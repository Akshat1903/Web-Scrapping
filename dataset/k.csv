Questions,Answer
What is multiple myeloma? What are plasma cells?,"'Multiple myeloma is a type of ''cancer'' of the plasma cells (a type of white blood cells) of the bone marrow. Plasma cells are protein-making cells that normally produce the different kinds of antibodies of the disease-fighting immune system. In multiple myeloma, the plasma cells undergo a ''malignant'' transformation and become cancerous. These myeloma cells (''cancer'"" cells) stop making different forms of protein in response to the immune system's needs and instead start to produce a single abnormal type of protein sometimes termed a monoclonal or M protein. Multiple myeloma plasma cell populations accumulate in the bone marrow, and these collections of cells called plasmacytomas can erode the hard outer shell or cortex of the bone that normally surrounds the marrow. These weakened bones show thinning of the bone, as seen in nonmalignant ""'osteoporosis'"" or what appear to be punched out or lytic bone lesions. These lesions may cause pain and even breaks or fractures of the weakened bones. They may cause other systemic problems listed below. People often refer to multiple myeloma simply as myeloma (also termed Kahler's disease after the physician who first described this cancer). The disease usually occurs in people past middle age. However, rarely it can occur in a child.""'The National Cancer Institute also notes that one type of myeloma-related plasma cell neoplasm is called a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). In MGUS, medical professionals only find low levels of M protein and people have no symptoms; MGUS infrequently develops into multiple myeloma. Plasma cell neoplasm is another name for multiple myeloma.' "
What causes multiple myeloma?,"'What triggers the ''malignancy'' of plasma cells in multiple myeloma is unknown. The cancerous myeloma plasma cells proliferate and crowd out normal plasma cells and can etch away areas of bones. The proteins produced in large amounts can cause many of the symptoms of the disease by making the blood more thickened (viscous) and depositing the proteins in organs that can interfere with the functions of the kidneys, nerves, and immune system. However, triggers or causes related to multiple myeloma may include toxic chemicals, ''radiation'', some ''viruses'', immune disorders, and family history of the disease or other related problems like MGUS.' "
What are multiple myeloma symptoms and signs?,"'Patients with myeloma may be asymptomatic with an unexplained increase in protein in the blood. With more advanced disease, some myeloma patients may have weakness due to ''anemia'' caused by inadequate production of ''red blood cells'', with bone pain due to the aforementioned bone damage, and as the abnormal M protein can accumulate in and damage the kidneys thereby resulting in a patient being found to have otherwise unexplained kidney damage and decreased kidney function. Multiple myeloma cancer cells may be in or outside the bone marrow.''The following is a list of symptoms and signs of multiple myeloma:'   Anemia Bleeding Nerve damage Skin lesions (rash) Enlarged tongue (macroglossia) Bone tenderness or pain, including back pain Weakness, fatigue or tiredness Infections Pathologic bone fractures Back pain Spinal cord compression Kidney failure and/or other end-organ damage Loss of appetite and weight loss Constipation Hypercalcemia Leg swelling"
What are risk factors for multiple myeloma? Is multiple myeloma hereditary?,"'Medical professionals have not established the definitive cause of multiple myeloma, but research has suggested several factors may be risk factors or contribute to multiple myeloma development in an individual. A genetic abnormality such as c-Myc oncogenes and others have been associated with multiple myeloma development. Currently, there is no evidence that heredity plays a role in multiple myeloma development so it is not considered a hereditary disease. People have suggested environmental exposures to herbicides, insecticides, benzene, hair dyes, and radiation as causes, but definitive data is lacking. Some have suggested inflammation and infection as causes, but again not proven to cause multiple myeloma. However, a benign proliferation of a plasma cell can result in a situation where a monoclonal antibody is produced in high amounts (but not as high as seen with multiple myeloma). This result is termed monoclonal gammopathy of unknown or undetermined significance (abbreviated as MGUS). About 19% of MGUS patients develop multiple myeloma in about two to 19 years after MGUS diagnosis. In addition, smoldering multiple myeloma (also termed inactive) is an early precursor to multiple myeloma. Abnormal proteins in blood or urine are detectable with special testing before ''multiple myeloma symptoms'' occur''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of multiple myeloma?,"'For many patients, physicians first suspect multiple myeloma when a routine blood test shows an abnormal amount of protein in the bloodstream or an unusual stickiness of red blood cells causing them to stack up almost like coins in a pattern called rouleaux, an unusual formation for red blood cells. The health care professional will do a history and physical exam, looking for signs and symptoms (see above) of multiple myeloma. If multiple myeloma is suspected, several studies help confirm the diagnosis. They include a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy most commonly from the large bones of the pelvis. Cells obtained from the marrow are studied by a pathologist to determine if there is one (plasmacytoma) or more (multiple myeloma) abnormal types or numbers of cells. Medical professionals also study a sample of the bone marrow aspirate for more detailed characteristics such as the presence or absence of abnormal numbers or types of chromosomes (DNA) by what is called cytogenetic testing. They may perform other molecular testing on the marrow sample, as well. The ''bone marrow biopsy'' can assess the concentrations of cells in the marrow and the presence of abnormal invasive growth of cellular elements. Blood testing and urine testing (for example, serum ''creatinine'') by several methods can determine levels and types of monoclonal protein produced and if there is kidney damage. The M protein may be a complete form of a type of antibody called an immunoglobulin (IgG or IgA, for example) or only a portion of the protein called a lambda or kappa light chain. Normal antibodies consist of both heavy and light chain components. In 2011, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended that health care professionals use a serum free light chain assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test to further identify multiple myeloma in patients. Most clinicians will use X-ray studies to identify skeletal lesions and ''MRI'' for spinal, paraspinal, or spinal cord lesions in multiple myeloma. In addition, medical professionals also perform several routine tests (''CBC'', ''sedimentation rate'', BUN, ''C-reactive protein'', and others such as beta 2 microglobulin). Bence-Jones proteins, monoclonal polypeptides that compose antibody light chains, may be found in the urine by immunofixation (detection of compounds with antibodies on an electrophoretic gel). Such tests help distinguish between myelomas and ''lymphomas'', such as non-Hodgkin ''lymphoma'' and Hodgkin disease.'  "
What specialties of health care professionals treat multiple myeloma?,"""Although the patient's primary care doctor helps to manage the patient's care, the specialists involved often include an oncologist, hematology pathologist, radiologist, stem cell transplant specialist, and occasionally a surgeon (orthopedist and/or spine surgeon). Researchers like Avet-Loiseau and others are actively seeking better treatments."" "
What are the stages of multiple myeloma?,"'There are four stages of multiple myeloma. While many health care professionals use different staging, these are various stages cited by many clinicians:'""Because staging criteria differ according to different groups, some clinicians simply define the individual's multiple myeloma without assigning a stage and simply estimate a prognosis (see below) for their patient. In 2013, an international group divided stages into three stages based on two criteria, the concentration of beta-2-microglobulin and serum albumin levels; over time, these defined criteria may become widely accepted."" Smoldering: multiple myeloma with no symptoms Stage I: early disease with little anemia, relatively small amount of M protein and no bone damage Stage II: more anemia and M protein as well as bone damage Stage III: still more M protein, anemia, as well as signs of kidney damage"
What is the medical treatment for multiple myeloma?,"""There is no known medical treatment that cures multiple myeloma. However, there are methods to decrease the occurrence and severity of symptoms and prolong life. The therapy is decided based upon the patient's condition and the cancer management team, made with the patient's input. The team will likely involve both a medical specialist in the treatment of myeloma called a medical oncologist, as well as a radiation oncologist and other consultants as appropriate. ""'Oncology'' trained nurses and other personnel will likely be important members of the treatment team.''The choices for treatment(s) often include combinations of drugs, some of which medical professionals give as pills and others by intravenous injection. These include drugs that affect or modulate the immune system, steroids, and some oral or injectable chemotherapy drugs. These are usually used in combinations. There may be a role for high-dose chemotherapy followed by the administration of bone marrow ''stem cells'"" called a stem cell transplant or autotransplantation. Numerous factors come into play in determining whether to do such a transplant. People may obtain further information from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (NCCN.org), which are updated at least yearly. Other medical treatments may include steroids, bisphosphonate therapy, blood or platelet transfusions, autotransplantation and/or plasmapheresis, and other combination therapy depending on the individual patient's disease stage. Also, researchers use meta-analysis (systematically combining data from selected studies to develop a more significant conclusion) of several studies to help determine better treatment protocols for the disease.""'Radiation therapy may treat painful areas of bone damage. Surgeons can surgically repair broken bones in many cases.''There are many drugs used to treat multiple myeloma. Medical professionals often use the following drugs in combination with ''dexamethasone'"", sometimes orally or by IV, depending on the patient's individual disease status:""'At least seven or eight other drugs that are occasionally used alone or in combination transfusions although the transfusion effects are temporary. Researchers are investigating newer drugs and drug combinations and used for treatment with some frequency. Most health care professionals who specialize in cancer treatment are aware of the newest treatments for multiple myeloma (for example, ''Procrit'', Revlimid, Kyprolis). In addition, your doctor can address the side effects (for example, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' with chemotherapy) that may occur with treatment. One goal of treatment is progression-free survival; that is the length of time during and after treatment that the patient lives without the symptoms worsening. In addition, low-dose therapy with drugs is being studied in elderly multiple myeloma patients. Risk-adapted therapy is another treatment approach with the design to minimize late disease effects while not compromising the chance for another potential cure.'   Dexamethasone (Decadron) -- immune cell modulation Bortezomib (Velcade) -- protease inhibitor Lenalidomide (Revlimid) -- immune cell modulation Pamidronic acid (Aredia) -- inhibits bone resorption Zoledronic acid (Zometa) -- inhibits bone resorption Melphalan (Alkeran) -- alkylating agent that is toxic to myeloma cells Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) -- protease inhibitor that is FDA approved usually for patients who have failed a previous treatment Daratumumab (Darzalex) -- monoclonal antibody that may damage or kill multiple myeloma cells (and others) that have CD38 protein on their surface Elotuzumab (Empliciti) -- a compound that activates the body's natural killer cells to destroy multiple myeloma cells, usually in combination with Revlimid and Decadron Ninlaro (Ixazomib) -- This proteasome inhibitor, in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, improves the survival rates of some patients with multiple myeloma."
What are lifestyle and diet tips for people with multiple myeloma?,"'To stay healthy, lifestyle changes can help individuals with multiple myeloma. Physicians recommend giving up tobacco, reducing ''alcohol'' intake, eating better, and getting more ''exercise''. Eating better may be difficult because of changes in your ''diet'' and tastes. After multiple myeloma treatments, it can be helpful to eat small meals about two to three hours apart until you feel as if you can eat a larger meal. During treatment, ''fitness'' or endurance and muscle strength can decline. For ''exercise'', start slowly by taking short walks or getting involved with an exercise program that gradually increases without pushing the body too hard.' "
What is the prognosis for multiple myeloma? What is the survival rate for multiple myeloma?,"""The prognosis of multiple myeloma is variable, depending on the approximate stage and response to therapy. Though there is no cure for the disease, today's treatments are more effective and less toxic (have fewer side effects) than did many in the past. Multiple myeloma is a focus of active ongoing research. The median survival rate, beginning at the point of first treatment according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), according to stage of the disease is as follows:""'However, the ACS suggests that with treatment improvements, current survival rates are likely better. Unfortunately, life expectancy after relapse averages about nine months.''Complications of multiple myeloma may include kidney insufficiency, ''bleeding disorders'', bone problems like pathological fractures, hypercalcemia, and neurological problems (for example, spinal cord compression, intracranial plasmacytomas, and others).'   Stage I, 62 months Stage II, 44 months Stage III, 29 months"
Is it possible to prevent multiple myeloma?,"'Because health care professionals do not fully understand the risk factors for multiple myeloma, it is not a preventable disease. Currently, there is no cure for the disease. Even some individuals who recommend herbal home remedies like cayenne peppers suggest that patients use the herbals with drugs. Individuals should discuss the use of home remedies with their doctor before use.' "
What support systems are available for multiple myeloma?,"""The International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) can provide caregivers and patients information about many aspects of this disease. IMF's phone number is 1-800-452-2873. There are local, state, and national support groups for multiple myeloma and for palliative care.""  "
What is the latest research on multiple myeloma?,"""Experimental studies on multiple myeloma have shown that if stem cells from patients with multiple myeloma are grown in cell culture, patients can improve but could also relapse because the stem cells often were contaminated with a few multiple myeloma cells. However, myxoma virus kills human multiple myeloma cells but not stem cells. Consequently, if stem cells for multiple myeloma patients are treated with myxoma viruses, the patient's stem cells are not contaminated multiple myeloma cells. Researchers have used this method to provide multiple myeloma patients with uncontaminated stem cells successfully preventing relapse of multiple myeloma due to contaminated stem cell cultures.""""Myxoma viruses exclusively infect rabbit's cells and are not infectious to humans, so the researchers tried another method. In a mouse model of multiple myeloma, researchers injected the mice with the myxoma viruses and impressively, according to the researchers, 25% of mice had a complete eradication of multiple myeloma and no evidence of relapse. Researchers plan to try to improve this technique in humans and improve the remission rate."" "
"What is Kawasaki disease, and how do doctors diagnose it?","'The definition of Kawasaki disease is an uncommon illness in children that is characterized by high ''fever'"" of at least 5 days' duration together with at least four of the following five symptoms and signs that occur in the acute phase:""'Doctors use the above criteria to make a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. Some investigators consider this phase 1. Phase 2 signs and symptoms may occur during the disease and may include:''In phase 3, signs and symptoms slowly abate if there are no complications. However, the person may have irritability, ''tiredness'', and low energy for 1-2 months.''Doctors sometimes use the terminology ""incomplete Kawasaki disease"" for patients who receive a diagnosis with only some features of classical Kawasaki disease.''Most patients (about 77%) are under 5 years of age with a peak incidence at 18 months of age. It is the most common acquired ''heart disease'' in children. Complications may include long-term effects of heart problems and coronary artery abnormalities like ''vasculitis''.''Mucocutaneous ''lymph node'' syndrome is the original name for Kawasaki disease. The original name was quite descriptive because the disease is characterized by the typical changes in the mucous membranes that line the lips and mouth and by the enlarged and tender\xa0lymph nodes. Kawasaki disease is also termed infantile polyarteritis.'   Inflammation with reddening of the whites (conjunctivae) of the eyes (conjunctivitis or pinkeye) without pus Redness or swelling of the feet and/or hands, or generalized skin peeling Rash on body and/or genital area Lymph nodes swelling in the neck Cracking, inflamed lips or throat, or red ""strawberry"" tongue Skin peeling (from red palms and finger tips and reddish swollen feet) Diarrhea Vomiting Abdominal pain Joint pain"
What are causes of Kawasaki disease?,"'The cause is not known. Microorganisms and toxins like that of ''scarlet fever'' have been suspected, but none has been identified to date.''Kawasaki disease typically affects children under 5 years of age. Only rarely does it affect children over 8 years of age, in which case it is sometimes referred to as atypical Kawasaki disease.' It is common for Kawasaki disease to occur after a preceding infection, such as tonsillitis, ear infection, pneumonia, urine infection, or gastrointestinal infection. Genetic factors (genetic variants in some patients) and the immune system (for example, autoimmune disease) seem to play roles in the disease, which is characterized by immune activation. The disease is more common in those of Japanese or Korean descent."
What are the symptoms and signs of Kawasaki disease?,"'The usual symptoms and signs of Kawasaki disease include''The rash appears in a glove-and-sock fashion over the skin of the hands and feet. The rash becomes hard, swollen (edematous), and then peels off.''Most of the common symptoms described above will resolve without complications, even if untreated. Less common findings include''The outlook (prognosis) for an individual affected is primarily determined by the seriousness of any heart complications.'   prolonged fever (about 5 days), reddening of the eyes without pus (pinkeye), cracked and inflamed lips and mucous membranes of the mouth with an inflamed strawberry tongue, ulcerative gum disease (gingivitis), swollen lymph nodes in the neck (cervical lymphadenopathy), joint pain often on both sides of the body, irritability, cough and runny nose, and a rash that is raised and bright red, with cracking and peeling skin (desquamation), especially on the palms and soles. inflammation of the lining of the heart (pericarditis), joints (arthritis), or covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), and the other heart problems listed below in the section on serious complications."
What is the difference between Kawasaki disease and Kawasaki syndrome?,'They are the same. Kawasaki disease is also referred to as Kawasaki syndrome. It was first described in the late 1960s in Japan by the renowned pediatrician Tomisaku Kawasaki.' 
Is Kawasaki disease contagious?,"'No. Kawasaki disease is not believed to be a ''contagious'' illness. However, Kawasaki disease symptoms and signs often start after the patient has had an acute infection with something else. The cause of the preceding illness may be something contagious. ' "
How can Kawasaki disease cause serious complications?,"'Children with Kawasaki disease can develop inflammation of the arteries of various parts of the body.''Because of the potential for heart injury and coronary artery aneurysms, special tests are performed to examine the heart.' This inflammation of the arteries is called vasculitis. Arteries that can be affected include the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (the coronary arteries). Vasculitis can cause weakening of the blood vessels and lead to areas of vessel widening (aneurysms). The weakening occurs because of the destruction of the elastic tissue in the walls of the blood vessels. Coronary artery aneurysms occur because of such injury to the blood vessels in Kawasaki disease. Children are typically evaluated with an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an ultrasound test of the heart (echocardiogram). Monitoring for this problem is crucial throughout life as it can develop as a late aftereffect of Kawasaki disease. Other arteries that can become inflamed include the arteries of the lungs, neck, and abdomen. These effects can lead to breathing problems, headaches, and abdominal pain, respectively. Blood tests to measure the degree of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein, or CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR) are often used to monitor the activity of the disease."
What is the treatment for Kawasaki disease?,"'Children affected by Kawasaki disease are hospitalized.''Kawasaki disease that is not responding to the traditional cornerstones of treatment, aspirin and gamma globulin infusions, can be deadly.'' Treatments being investigated include ''doxycycline'', statin drugs (''Lipitor'', ''Mevacor'', others), ''anakinra'' (''Kineret''), and ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral'').'   Kawasaki disease is treated with high doses of aspirin (salicylic acid) to reduce inflammation and to mildly thin the blood to prevent blood clot formation. This is one of the few times when children may take aspirin. Also used in treatment is gamma globulin administered through the vein (intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIG), together with fluids. This treatment has been shown to decrease the chance of developing coronary aneurysms in the coronary arteries, especially when used early in the illness. Sometimes cortisone medications are given. Persisting joint pains are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve). Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) has been reported as effective in patients who were not responding to aspirin and gamma globulin. Plasmapheresis is a procedure whereby the patient's plasma is removed from the blood and replaced with protein-containing fluids. By taking out portions of the patient's plasma, the procedure also removes antibodies and proteins that are felt to be part of the immune reaction that is causing the inflammation of the disease."
What is the prognosis for children with Kawasaki disease?,"'Kawasaki disease is typically self-limited and generally resolves on its own after four to eight weeks, and with early treatment, full recovery is usual.''Rarely, Kawasaki disease can cause death from ''blood clots'' forming in abnormal areas of widening (aneurysms) of the heart arteries (coronary arteries) and ''myocarditis'' (inflammation of heart muscle). Aneurysms of the arteries to the heart (coronary arteries) can occur early or late, even when the children are adults so follow-up is recommended for those patients diagnosed with the disease. Those children with larger aneurysms have a worse prognosis because of this risk. Such aneurysms can lead to blood clots, ''heart attacks'' (''myocardial infarction''), and ''internal bleeding''. Those whose echocardiograms do not demonstrate widening of the coronary arteries throughout life do best. Those with any signs of ''aneurysm'' changes require very close monitoring. Children less than 6 months of age and those with high levels of inflammation on blood testing are at highest risk.''The earlier the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun the better the outcome.''Researchers are searching for methods of detecting which children are at risk for the development of aneurysms of the coronary arteries. Further research is under way to investigate a variety of criteria for atypical variants of Kawasaki disease that do not have classical presentations.' "
Is it possible to prevent Kawasaki disease?,"'Because the cause of Kawasaki disease has not been determined, there are no measures known that can prevent the disease. ''Early evaluation and treatment can decrease the chance for long-term problems and/or complications.' "
Kawasaki disease and the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C),"'Another disease recently noted to have almost identical signs and symptoms to Kawasaki disease has been linked to the ''COVID-19'' (coronavirus) pandemic. The new disease seems more virulent than Kawasaki disease. The CDC named the disease (as of May 14, 2020) multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C. The following is the case definition for MIS-C provided by the CDC:'' The CDC noted the fever should be at least 100.4 F (38 C) for at least 24 hours or a subjective fever lasting 24 hours. The main differences between MIS-C and Kawasaki disease are a more rapid and serious advancement of symptoms, especially fever and multisystem organ problems like cardiac and respiratory problems along with a current or recent infection with ''SARS''-CoV-2. Some children suffer a rapid heartbeat and may develop cardiac and/or respiratory arrest. ' An individual under 21 years of age with fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization with multisystem (>2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological); 
and no alternative plausible diagnoses; and positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, serology, 
or antigen test; or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms."
What are Kegel exercises for men?,"'Kegel exercises or pelvic floor muscle exercises consist of repeated contraction and realization of the muscles that form part of the pelvic floor, to strengthen the pelvic floor. Arnold Kegel first described the exercises in 1948, and historically the exercises treated female patients in an effort to aid with ''stress'' ''incontinence'' following ''childbirth''. However, with time pelvic floor muscle therapy and other forms of behavioral therapy have been demonstrated to be useful in a variety of conditions, including ''overactive bladder'', male lower urinary tract symptoms, post radical ''prostatectomy'', ''urinary incontinence'', ''erectile dysfunction'' and climacteric, ''fecal incontinence'', and ''premature ejaculation''. Unlike typical ''exercise'"" routines, these exercises don't require the participant to buy any weights or expensive machines. However, the success of Kegel exercises is dependent on the proper performance of the exercises."" "
What are the benefits of Kegel exercises for men?,"'In men, Kegel exercises are primarily a first-line therapy in men with ''urinary incontinence'' after a radical ''prostatectomy''. Studies have demonstrated that patients should start pelvic floor muscle therapy prior to radical prostatectomy and continue postoperatively for the best results.''Overactive bladder symptoms'' can occur in men as well as women. Contraction of the pelvic floor muscles can suppress bladder contractions and thus pelvic floor muscle therapy is a part of the first-line management of ''overactive bladder''.''Researchers have evaluated the role of pelvic floor muscle therapy, Kegel exercises, in the management of ''erectile dysfunction'' and ''orgasm'' associated urinary ''incontinence'' (climacturia) after radical prostatectomy. One study demonstrated that men with ''erectile dysfunction'' and climacturia one year after nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy had significantly improvement in erectile function with pelvic floor muscle training at 15 months and that the effect was maintained during follow-up. In addition, in those men performing pelvic floor muscle therapy, there was a significant improvement in climacturia.''Pelvic floor muscle therapy, Kegel exercises, is helpful in men with ''premature ejaculation''. In fact, in one study, pelvic floor therapy consisting of biofeedback, pelvic exercises and electrostimulation led to a cure in premature ejaculation in 50% of patients with a history of lifelong premature ejaculation, within two to six months of starting therapy.''Kegel exercises treats nocturia (awakening at night to urinate). A preliminary study showed that behavioral therapy (including pelvic floor muscle exercises) in men, alone or in combination with an alpha-blocker (medical therapy for benign ''prostate enlargement''), consistently showed large favorable effects on ''sleep'', nocturia reduction, and quality of life.''Kegel exercises are harmless if performed correctly. Some people have reported chest and ''abdominal pain'"", but these occurrences are the result of inappropriately performed exercises. Proper education and performance of the Kegel exercises is important to achieve the best results. Patients can learn how to properly perform Kegels at their doctor's office, via paper instructions, or online tutorials. However, success will depend on the contracting the proper muscles regularly.""  "
How can men perform Kegel exercises?,"'Prior to beginning the exercises, it is important to localize the pelvic floor muscles. A simple way to start is to attempt to stop urine flow midway through. The muscles allowing for the pause in urination are the ones targeted by the Kegel exercises. However, several studies have demonstrated the importance of contracting the appropriate muscles and one study demonstrated significant differences in the muscles contracted with the following commands: ""shorten the penis,"" ""elevate the bladder,"" and ""tighten the anus."" Thus, if one is not responding to therapy, a health care professional should ensure that the patient contracts the correct muscles. Such therapy includes a transperineal ''ultrasound'' (placing the ''ultrasound'' probe on the area below the scrotum and in front of the anus). Ultrasound evaluation can also be performed transabdominal.''The first technique requires a contraction of the anus muscles as if trying to hold in ''gas''. The feeling of a pulling or lifting sensation on the anus tells you that you are performing the ''exercise'' correctly.''The second requires the use of a mirror in order to observe the movement of your penis vertically without moving the rest of your body. An elevator analogy can illustrate the ''exercise''. The anus, in this case, can represent an elevator. The goal of the ''exercise'' is to bring up the elevator over five seconds to its maximal level and then to bring it gradually back down to the resting level.''The techniques are interchangeable. Men can perform a different technique each day. However, the important thing is always to use only the pelvic muscles. When men first start performing these exercises, they may use other muscles to help them. Often, they may use their abdominal or gluteal Maximus (buttocks) muscles. It is thus important to become aware of which muscles one contracts. It is also important to avoid holding the breath or crossing the legs.'""Arguably, one of the strongest points of Kegel exercises is that they can be performed anywhere without anyone but the participant noticing. Unlike typical core exercises for men requiring sit-ups, planking, or other unusual positions, Kegel exercises can be performed during a variety of activities such as shaving, sitting at one's desk, or even while driving."" "
How often should men perform Kegel exercises?,"""Men are accustomed to exercises such as push-ups or sit-ups. However, a very small proportion of them knows how to perform Kegel exercises. This is unfortunate since many doctors recommend incorporating these into one's core routine.""'Unlike typical workouts for men, there is no magic number of sets one should do in a day when it comes down to Kegel exercises. However, men should perform at least two sessions of Kegel exercises every day. To keep things simple, men should perform their first session in the morning and their second at night. A session comprises of 10-30 individual contractions and relaxation exercises. Each exercise should last 10 seconds divided into five seconds of contraction and five seconds of relaxation. Once a man excels at performing these, he can do them in different positions. Of the 10-30 exercises, he can do one-third while laying down, one-third while sitting, and one-third while standing. Counting aloud certainly helps, and as time goes by, many men are surprised at the ease with which they can perform the exercises that at first seemed unnatural to them.''This is of the greatest importance for men undergoing prostate surgery, either for ''prostate cancer'' needing radical prostatectomy (complete prostate removal) or for ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH'') needing transurethral resection of the prostate. Both of such surgeries reduce the resistance to the bladder that can result in postsurgical urinary incontinence. As we can see from the following image, the anatomic changes reduce bladder outlet resistance. As such, strengthening the pelvic floor and sphincter are of paramount importance and Kegel exercises can help. Ideally, the Kegel exercises should start prior to the surgery and continue after the surgery.' "
How long does it take to see results from Kegel exercises?,"'Patients commonly experience results, such as improved urinary continence, within three to six weeks of regularly performing Kegel exercises. As with any exercise routine, the key to obtaining results quickly depends on efficient, targeted, and frequent exercise techniques.'  "
What are Kegel exercises?,"'Kegel exercises are designed to make your pelvic floor muscles stronger. These are the muscles that hold up your bladder and help keep it from leaking.''Building up your pelvic muscles with Kegel exercises can help with your bladder control. ''To do Kegel exercises, you just squeeze your pelvic floor muscles. The part of your body including your hip bones is the pelvic area. At the bottom of the pelvis, several layers of muscle stretch between your legs. The muscles attach to the front, back, and sides of the pelvic bone. ' "
How do you exercise your pelvic muscles?,"'Find the right muscles''. Try one of the following ways to find the right muscles to squeeze.''Let your doctor, nurse, or therapist help you''. Many people have trouble finding the right muscles. Your doctor, nurse, or therapist can check to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly. You can also ''exercise'' by using special weights or biofeedback. Ask your health care team about these ''exercise'' aids. '""Don't squeeze other muscles at the same time"""". Be careful not to tighten your stomach, legs, or other muscles. Squeezing the wrong muscles can put more pressure on your bladder control muscles. Just squeeze the pelvic muscle. Don't hold your breath. """"Repeat, but don't overdo it""'. At first, find a quiet spot to practice - your bathroom or ''bedroom -- so'' you can concentrate. Lie on the floor. Pull in the pelvic muscles and hold for a count of 3. Then relax for a count of 3. Work up to 10 to 15 repeats each time you ''exercise''. Use the ''Exercise'' Log below to keep track of your sessions. ''Do your pelvic exercises at least three times a day''. Every day, use three positions: lying down, sitting, and standing. You can exercise while lying on the floor, sitting at a desk, or standing in the kitchen. Using all three positions makes the muscles strongest. ''Be patient'"". Don't give up. It's just 5 minutes, three times a day. You may not feel your bladder control improve until after 3 to 6 weeks. Still, most women do notice an improvement after a few weeks. ""'Sunday''Monday''Tuesday''Wednesday''Thursday''Friday''Saturday' Imagine that you are trying to stop passing gas. Squeeze the muscles you would use. If you sense a ""pulling"" feeling, you are squeezing the right muscles for pelvic exercises.  Imagine that you are sitting on a marble and want to pick up the marble with your vagina. Imagine ""sucking"" the marble into your vagina.  Lie down and put your finger inside your vagina. Squeeze as if you were trying to stop urine from coming out.

What is a keloid scar?,"'Keloids can be considered to be ""''scars'' that don\'t know when to stop."" A keloid, sometimes referred to as a keloid scar, is a tough heaped-up scar that rises quite abruptly above the rest of the skin. It usually has a smooth top and a pink or purple color. Keloids are irregularly shaped and tend to enlarge progressively. Unlike scars, keloids do not regress over time.'  "
What is the cause of keloids?,"'Doctors do not understand exactly why keloids form. Alterations in the cellular signals that control proliferation and inflammation may be related to the process of keloid formation, but these changes have not yet been characterized sufficiently to explain this defect in ''wound'' healing.'  "
What are keloid risk factors?,"'Individuals with darkly pigmented skin are 15 times more likely to develop keloids, with those of African, Hispanic, and Asian ethnicity are at greatest risk. Keloids are equally common in women and men. Keloids are less common in children and the elderly. Although people with darker skin are more likely to develop them, keloids can occur in people of all skin types. In some cases, the tendency to form keloids seems to run in families. A mutation in a gene known as NEDD4 gene may indicate that a person has a predisposition to keloid formation.' "
In which area of the body are keloids most likely to appear?,"'Keloids develop most often on the chest, back, shoulders, and earlobes. They seldom develop on the face (with the exception of the jawline).'  "
"What is the difference between a keloid, hypertrophic scar, and a 
dermatofibroma?","'After the skin is injured, the healing process usually leaves a flat scar. Sometimes the scar is hypertrophic, or thickened, but confined to the margin of the original wound. Hypertrophic scars tend to be redder and often regress spontaneously (a process which can take one year or more). Treatment, such as injections of cortisone (steroids), can speed this process.''A ''dermatofibroma'' is a small, benign, pigmented, very firm bump in the skin that does not cause other symptoms. It is most often found on the legs. Dermatofibromas are almost never larger than ½ to ¾ of an inch and remain unchanged over many years.'""Keloids, by contrast, may start sometime after a cutaneous injury and extend beyond the wound site. This tendency to migrate into surrounding areas that weren't injured originally distinguishes keloids from hypertrophic scars. Keloids typically appear following surgery or injury, but they can also as a result of some minor inflammation, such as an ""'acne'' ''pimple'"" on the chest (even one that wasn't scratched or otherwise irritated). Other minor injuries that can trigger keloids are ""'burns'' and cosmetic piercings.''A keloid has a characteristic microscopic appearance and may be distinguished from a ''hypertrophic scar'' and a dermatofibroma.' "
Keloids and piercing,"""Keloids can develop following the minor injuries that occur with body piercing. Since this form of physical adornment has become popular, the presence of keloidal scarring is much more prevalent. Since doctors do not understand the precise reasons why some people are more prone to developing keloids, it is impossible to predict whether one's first piercing will lead to keloid formation. Although there are some families that seem prone to forming keloids, for the most part, it's impossible to tell who will develop a keloid. One person might, for instance, develop a keloid in one earlobe after piercing and not in the other. It makes sense, however, for someone who has formed one keloid to avoid any elective surgery or cosmetic piercing of any body part.""  "
Is it possible to remove a keloid?,"'The decision about when to treat a keloid depends on the symptoms associated with its development and its anatomical location. A chronically ''itchy'' and irritated keloid can be quite distracting. Keloids in cosmetically sensitive areas that cause disfigurement or embarrassment are obvious candidates for treatment. It is unclear whether early treatment is important. What is clear is that larger keloids are more difficult to treat. Special techniques must be used soon after the surgical procedure has concluded to prevent the formation of a new, larger keloid.' "
What are keloid symptoms and signs?,"'Keloids are raised and look shiny and dome-shaped, ranging in color from pink to red. Some keloids become quite large and unsightly. Aside from causing potential cosmetic problems, these exuberant scars tend to be itchy, tender, or even painful to the touch.'  "
What types of doctors diagnose and treat keloids?,"'Dermatologists, ''plastic'' surgeons, and certain family physicians generally diagnose and treat keloids with occasional help from therapeutic radiologists.' "
What are treatment options for keloids?,"'The methods now available to treat keloids are as follows:'   Corticosteroid injections (intralesional steroids): These are safe but moderately painful. Injections are usually given once every four to eight weeks into the keloids) and usually help flatten keloids; however, steroid injections can also make the flattened keloid redder by stimulating the formation of more superficial blood vessels. (These can be treated using a laser; see below.) The keloid may look better after treatment than it looked to start with, but even the best results leave a mark that looks and feels quite different from the surrounding skin. Surgery: This is risky because cutting a keloid can trigger the formation of a similar or even larger keloid. Some surgeons achieve success by injecting steroids or applying compression (using a specialized pressure device where appropriate) to the wound site for months after cutting away the keloid. Superficial radiation treatment after surgical excision has also been found to be useful. Laser: The pulsed-dye laser can be effective at flattening keloids and making them look less red. Treatment is safe and not very painful, but several treatment sessions may be needed. These may be costly, since such treatments are not generally covered by insurance plans. Silicone gel or sheeting: This involves wearing a sheet of silicone gel on the affected area continuously for months, which is hard to sustain. Results are variable. Some doctors claim similar success with compression dressings made from materials other than silicone. Pressure: Special earrings are available, which when used appropriately, can cause keloids on the earlobe to shrink significantly. Cryotherapy: Freezing keloids with liquid nitrogen may flatten them but often darkens or lightens the site of treatment. Interferon: Interferons are proteins produced by the body's immune systems that help fight off viruses, bacteria, and other challenges. In recent studies, injections of interferon have shown promise in reducing the size of keloids, though it's not yet certain whether that effect will be lasting. Current research is under way using a variant of this method, applying topical imiquimod (Aldara), which stimulates the body to produce interferon. Fluorouracil and bleomycin: Injections of these chemotherapeutic (anti-cancer) agents, alone or together with steroids, have been used for treatment of keloids. Radiation: Some doctors have reported safe and effective use of radiation to treat keloids using a variety of techniques."
Are there home remedies for keloids?,'There are no effective home remedies for keloids.' 
Is keloid prevention possible?,"'The best way to deal with a keloid is not to get one. A person who has had a keloid should not undergo elective or cosmetic skin surgeries or procedures such as piercing. When it comes to keloids, ''prevention'' is crucial, because current treatments leave a lot to be desired.' "
What is the prognosis for keloids?,"'Small keloids can be effectively treated using a variety of methods. Generally, a series of injections of steroids into the problem area is the simplest and safest approach. The patient needs to understand that the keloid will never entirely disappear but is likely to become less symptomatic and flatter. Larger lesions are more difficult to treat.' "
What is LASIK eye surgery?,"'LASIK'' stands for Laser in Situ Keratomileusis, which means using a laser underneath a corneal flap (in situ) to reshape the ''cornea'' (keratomileusis). This procedure utilizes a highly specialized laser (excimer laser) designed to treat refractive errors, improve vision, and reduce or eliminate the need for glasses or ''contact lenses''. This laser procedure alters the shape of the cornea, which is the transparent front covering of the eye. Though the excimer laser had been used for many years before, the development of LASIK is generally credited to Ioannis Pallikaris from Greece around 1991.'  "
How does LASIK work?,"'During the LASIK procedure, a specially trained eye surgeon first creates a precise, thin hinged corneal flap using a microkeratome. The surgeon then pulls back the flap to expose the underlying corneal tissue, and then the excimer laser ablates (reshapes) the cornea in a unique pre-specified pattern for each patient. The flap is then gently repositioned onto the underlying cornea without ''sutures''. ' "
How do glasses or contacts improve vision in people with refractive errors?,""" Glasses or contact lenses are used to compensate for the eye's refractive error by bending light rays in a way that complements the eye's specific refractive error. In contrast, LASIK and other forms of refractive surgery are intended to correct the eye's refractive error to reduce the need for other visual aids. "" "
What is refractive error?,"'In the human eye, the front surface (cornea) and ''lens'' inside the eye form the eye\'s ""focusing system"" and are primarily responsible for focusing incoming light rays onto the surface of the retina, much like the lenses of a camera focus light onto the film. In a perfect optical system, the power of the cornea and lens are perfectly matched with the length of the eye and images are in focus; any mismatch in this system is called a refractive error, and the result is a blurred image at some location. ' "
What are the primary types of refractive error?,"'There are three types of refractive errors:' Myopia (nearsightedness): In people with myopia, the mismatch in focusing power and eye length causes distant objects to be blurry and near objects to be clearer. Hyperopia (farsightedness): In people with hyperopia, the mismatch in focusing power and eye length causes near objects to be blurry and distant objects to be relatively clearer. Astigmatism: In people with astigmatism, either the corneal or lens shape is distorted, causing multiple images on the retina. This causes objects at all distances to appear blurry. Many people have a combination of either myopia or hyperopia with astigmatism."
What happens to vision when we age?,"'During our youth, the natural lens has the ability to change shape and power. This allows us to focus on close objects through a process of lens power change called accommodation. As we age, the natural lens becomes stiffer and loses the ability to change shape. This is termed ''presbyopia'', which is the loss of accommodation, and the need for reading glasses, bifocals, or other visual aids to facilitate near work.''LASIK cannot directly ""fix"" accommodation, but there are a variety of strategies that can be successful, including blended vision or monovision, in which one eye is corrected for better distance vision and one eye is corrected for better near vision.' "
Are there different types of LASIK?,"'There are a variety of different types of lasers used in ophthalmology. All LASIK procedures are performed with a specific type of laser (excimer laser), so in one sense, all LASIK procedures are similar. However, there are a variety of different laser manufacturers, including''Further, there are different types of laser ablations that can be performed (see below), including conventional laser treatments, wavefront-optimized treatments, and wavefront-guided treatments. Finally, a completely different type of laser (femtosecond laser) can be used instead of a mechanical microkeratome to create the LASIK (corneal) flap.' Visx, Wavelight, Alcon, Bausch & Lomb, and Nidek, among others, that have all designed specific excimer lasers."
What is conventional LASIK?,"""Conventional LASIK is the ablation pattern available on most lasers that treats directly based upon the patient's glasses prescription, with fixed treatment parameters for each patient. This type of ""'laser eye surgery'' is effective for most patients but can result in more visual aberrations such as glare, halos, and night vision issues than other forms of laser treatment. ' "
What is wavefront-optimized LASIK?,"""Wavefront-optimized LASIK is the type of laser eye surgery available on the Wavelight laser. This treatment is also based on the patient's glasses prescription, but also takes into account corneal curvature and thickness, and applies laser energy in a unique fashion in the periphery of the cornea. This laser has been found to reduce the aforementioned complications such as glare, halos, and other nighttime visual aberrations that can occasionally occur with conventional treatments."" "
What is wavefront-guided LASIK?,"""Wavefront-guided LASIK, also referred to as custom LASIK or wavefront LASIK, is similar to conventional LASIK, except that in addition to treating a patient's basic refractive error, specific alterations in a patient's eye (high order aberrations) can also be treated.""""In wavefront-guided LASIK, special mapping is performed prior to surgery to identify any small irregularities in the patient's optical system. When these irregularities are severe, they can affect vision quality, contrast sensitivity, and night vision. When significant irregularities in a patient's wavefront mapping are found, wavefront-guided LASIK can be used, and the treatment will be based on the wavefront-map generated."" "
What other types of refractive surgery are available?,"'Other types of refractive surgery are available and may be more appropriate than LASIK for certain individuals.''Advanced surface ablation'': There are a variety of other techniques that utilize the excimer laser to reshape the cornea in much the same way as LASIK, but without the creation of a corneal flap. These are generically termed advanced surface ablation (ASA) and include ''photorefractive keratectomy'' (PRK), laser subepithelial keratomileusis (''LASEK''), and epipolis laser in situ keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK). All of these techniques involve first removing the most superficial corneal layer (epithelium) and then performing excimer laser ablation.''Phakic intraocular lenses'': For patients with extreme myopia, LASIK and advanced surface ablation are not reasonable options. In these cases, a phakic ''intraocular lens'' may be used. This lens is implanted inside the eye and can effectively treat nearsightedness up to -20 diopters.''Conductive keratoplasty'': Conductive keratoplasty (CK) is a technique that can be used for the temporary correction of hyperopia or ''presbyopia''. CK involves using radiofrequency waves in the peripheral cornea to cause peripheral corneal shrinkage and central steepening. This procedure is very safe, but its effect is often not long-lasting, and regression is common after a few years.''Intracorneal ring segments'': Intacs (Addition Technology, Inc.) are approved for the correction of low myopia and for patients with ''keratoconus'' in the U.S. Intacs are micro-thin ''plastic'' segments that are implanted into the peripheral cornea in order to flatten the cornea centrally. Once implanted, the rings generally cannot be felt by the patient. These rings can be removed, and their effect is usually completely reversible. They are only able to correct up to -3 diopters of myopia, and visual recovery is generally slower and less predictable than LASIK.' "
Am I a good candidate for LASIK eye surgery?,"'Refractive surgery is not for everyone. In addition to having a complete eye exam to find out if you are a candidate for surgery, there are certain questions you should ask yourself before considering LASIK or other refractive procedures.' Am I willing to accept a low but real risk of surgical complications? Even though modern LASIK is extremely safe with rare complications, there are still times when unavoidable complications occur that can negatively affect your vision. Does my career allow me to have LASIK? Although there are now very few organizations that prohibit their employees or members to have refractive surgery, if there is any doubt, then it is important to ask your employer, professional society, or military service whether or not it is allowed for you to undergo refractive surgery. Has my vision been stable long enough to have LASIK? While minor changes in your prescription are not uncommon from year to year, if your prescription continues to get progressively stronger (for example, more myopic, more hyperopic, or more astigmatism) each year, then you may not yet be a good candidate for refractive surgery. Do I have any health conditions that make me a poor surgical candidate? Certain advanced autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may influence postoperative healing. Do my recreational activities make me a bad surgical candidate? There is a lifelong risk of LASIK flap dislocation if there is significant trauma to the eye, so people who participate in contact sports such as boxing, martial arts, or wrestling are not likely not be a good LASIK candidate. In these instances, other refractive procedures, especially surface ablation, may be more appropriate choices. Am I too young or too old to have LASIK? There are no hard and fast rules about the appropriate age to have LASIK. However, patients under age 18 are rarely stable enough for LASIK, and older patients may begin to develop cataracts or other eye health issues that preclude them from undergoing LASIK. Again, the best way to determine these things is to have a complete eye exam. Do I have keratoconus? Keratoconus is a corneal disease resulting from decreased corneal strength that can be detected as an abnormal curvature on testing. Patients that have evidence of keratoconus are not candidates for LASIK or surface ablation, but new technologies may become available for these individuals."
What is my doctor looking for during my evaluation?,"'Your eye doctor should look for risk factors prior to surgery that may make you a less than ideal candidate for surgery and discuss any abnormal findings with you at length. The following are considered to be risk factors for refractive surgery.'  High prescriptions: Patients with extreme eyeglass prescriptions (high myopia or high hyperopia) may not be good candidates for LASIK because too much corneal tissue would need to be removed to safely perform the procedure. Thin corneas: Because all excimer laser surgery (LASIK and surface ablation) requires the removal of small amounts of corneal tissue to correct your refractive error, the thickness of your corneas must be measured before surgery. Patients who have very thin corneas are at risk for excessive corneal weakening after surgery and may not be good candidates for LASIK. In these cases, surface ablation or other procedures may be more appropriate. Abnormal corneal curvature: There are many devices used today to measure the overall shape and curvature of your cornea. These devices are called topographers and are an essential part of your initial evaluation. Abnormalities in the shape and curvature of your cornea may indicate that your cornea is weaker than that of the average person, and this will exclude you from having LASIK safely. Dry eyes: Patients with dry eye symptoms, such as burning, redness, and tearing may have worse symptoms after LASIK surgery. This occurs because corneal nerves are cut during this procedure, and these nerves are partly responsible for stimulating tear secretion. Most patients have a full return back to their baseline state after surgery; however, patients with significant dry eye before surgery may not be appropriate surgical candidates Large pupils: Although less common today, some patients still notice glare, halos, or other night vision issues after LASIK. Patients with larger pupils may be more prone to noticing these things, so your screening evaluation should include measurement of your pupil size in a dark room. Previous refractive surgery: Prior corneal surgery or other types of refractive surgery, especially radial keratotomy (RK), may complicate additional procedures. You should talk to your eye doctor about this situation in order to make the best decision possible about your ability to be corrected with further surgery."
What are the risks of LASIK?,"'LASIK has been shown to be a very effective procedure, and most patients are very happy with their vision following the procedure. However, like any surgical procedure, LASIK does come with some risks. In order for you to decide whether LASIK surgery is right for you, you need to be aware of potential risks and complications and weigh these carefully before proceeding with surgery.'  You may be over-corrected or under-corrected. Most patients are satisfied with their vision after a single treatment, but in some cases, you may not achieve quality vision initially and need a second surgery, called an enhancement, to sharpen your vision. Patients with more extreme prescriptions are at higher risk for needing an enhancement. This enhancement cannot be performed for many months after your initial surgery to allow for your eyes to heal appropriately from the first surgery and for your eyeglass prescription to stabilize. In some rare cases, you may not be able to have an enhancement if your corneas are too thin or abnormally shaped after surgery. You may still need glasses or contact lenses after surgery to achieve your best vision. This is extremely rare for the average person; however, it is something you should discuss with your surgeon. In addition, if both of your eyes are corrected for good distance vision, you will still need glasses for close work when presbyopia develops as a part of normal aging process. Your results may not be permanent. Although uncommon, some patients do experience a regression of their desired treatment effect many years after the surgery. This is more common in patients with hyperopia, or farsightedness. Those who need reading glasses are especially prone to having changes in their vision after LASIK surgery. If regression does occur, it may be possible for you to have an additional surgery many years after your initial LASIK. You may experience visual aberrations, especially in low light. Visual effects that can occur with LASIK and decrease visual quality include: anisometropia (difference in refractive power between the two eyes), aniseikonia (difference in image size between the two eyes), double vision, hazy vision, fluctuating vision during the day and from day to day, increased sensitivity to light, glare, shadows, and seeing halos around lights. These visual aberrations are extremely unusual; however, they may be incapacitating for some time and may not ever go away completely. Dry eye symptoms may persist or get worse. Most people experience some dry-eye symptoms immediately after surgery. In some cases, people may develop worsening of dry-eye symptoms, such as burning and redness, or even decreased vision, after surgery. This condition is occasionally permanent and may require medication to improve tear production or punctal plugs, which temporarily close off the drainage system for tears. You may lose vision. Rarely, LASIK may result in worse vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. This could result from flap-related complications, equipment malfunction, infection, scarring, or extreme changes in corneal shape postoperatively."
How do I find the right doctor?,"'If you are considering refractive surgery, it is imperative that you compare all the different variables that go into your surgery. The overall success of your procedure will depend on the type of surgery you are considering, the type of instruments or lasers that are used for that particular surgery, and the level of experience of your surgeon. You should not base your decision solely on how much the procedure costs, and you should compare different eye centers and eye doctors before coming to a decision. Refractive surgery is permanent and will affect your vision for the rest of your life, so you need to carefully consider all of your options. The following are some specific things for you to consider:' Beware of ""guarantees."" Be cautious of eye centers that advertise guarantees on refractive surgeries, including ""lifetime"" guarantees, ""20/20 or free,"" or ""perfect vision."" Remember that there are never any guarantees with surgery. Know your surgeon. Make sure that the surgeon you choose has appropriate training and a good reputation in the community. You should ask your eye doctor to discuss his or her outcomes and compare them to the results of the studies that are printed in the device manufacturer's handbook. It is also important to know that your surgeon will be available to you after surgery should you develop a complication that requires management. Know your surgical center. It is equally important to make sure that the center where you have your surgery is equipped with the latest technology, knowledgeable staff, and has a good reputation in the community. Become an educated consumer. Because this is an important decision, you should read as much information as possible. Ask your eye doctor to provide you with the patient education booklet from the device manufacturer. It is also important to have an in-depth discussion about the most appropriate procedure for your eyes, as this may vary from individual to individual."
What should I expect before surgery?,"'What you should expect before, surgery may vary slightly from patient to patient and from surgeon to surgeon; however, the information listed below is a general guideline for the LASIK process. Each patient may also have slightly different expectations, and it is important to talk to your eye doctor about these expectations before surgery.''Prior to any procedure, you will need a full eye examination by your eye doctor. This process will help determine if you are a good candidate for surgery and whether you have certain risk factors listed above. If you wear contact lenses, you should take them out for many days before your initial examination and use your glasses full-time. This is important because contact lenses will change the shape of your cornea, and if your cornea has not had enough time without the contact lenses, then the measurements taken before surgery may be inaccurate. You should discuss the amount of time you are required to be out of your contact lenses with the surgical center performing your evaluation.''During your initial examination, you should talk to your eye doctor about your past and present medical and ''eye conditions'', including any previous eye surgery or trauma. It is also important to discuss all medicines you are taking, including over the counter medicines, as these can sometimes affect your vision or surgery. Also be sure to mention any medication ''allergies'' you have.''Your doctor should discuss certain topics with you, including whether you are a good candidate for refractive surgery. He or she should discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery, and what you should expect before, during, and after the procedure. Your doctor should also explain what will be expected from you before, during, and following the surgery.''It is quite important that you ask questions during this examination, and ideally you should already have the questions you want answered in mind before your examination. You will need to think about all of the risks and benefits and take time to review handouts that are provided to you by your doctor. After you have had plenty of time to think about these issues and had all of your questions answered, you will need to sign an informed consent form. It is not recommended to have your initial evaluation and surgery performed on the same day, as this does not give you enough time to fully contemplate your decision. It is also not ideal to first meet your LASIK surgeon on the day of surgery, because this again does not give you ample time and opportunity to ask the questions only your surgeon can answer before your procedure.''On the day of the surgery, you will need to avoid using all lotions, creams, ''makeup'', and perfumes. Some of these items build up on the eyelashes and may increase your risk of infection, while others (lotions and perfumes) can affect the function of the laser. In an effort to clean your ''eyelid'' margin, your doctor may ask that you scrub your eyelids and lashes with a gentle soap that is safe for the eyes prior to surgery.''You will also need to arrange for transportation to and from the surgery center both on the day of surgery and for your first follow-up visit the following day. You will not be allowed to drive yourself home after surgery under any circumstances.'  "
What are the advantages of LASIK surgery?,"'In summary, despite the risks outlined above, LASIK has been proven to be safe and effective for most people. With careful patient screening and selection, reasonable expectations, and in the care of an experienced surgeon, most patients will be very pleased with their results. These are some of the other advantages of LASIK:' LASIK is able to accurately correct most levels of myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. The procedure is fast, usually lasting only five to 10 minutes, and is generally painless. Because the laser is guided by a computer, it is very precise and results are very accurate. In most cases, a single treatment will achieve the desired outcome; however, enhancements are possible if needed, even many years after the initial surgery."
What are the disadvantages of LASIK surgery?," Because each patient will heal slightly differently, results may vary from patient to patient. LASIK could make some aspects of your vision worse, including night vision with glare and halos. LASIK may make dry-eye symptoms worse in certain individuals. In rare circumstances, LASIK can make your vision worse and not correctable with regular glasses or contact lenses."

What should I expect during surgery?,"'LASIK eye surgery normally takes less than 30 minutes to perform surgery on both eyes. You will be taken to the surgical suite and placed into a reclining chair or bed where you will lie on your back. The laser system consists of a microscope that is attached to a large machine and a computer screen.''After you are lying down and have been positioned underneath the laser, numbing eye drops will be placed in your eyes, and the area around your eyes will be cleaned thoroughly. After your surgical team, including your LASIK surgeons and assistants, have reviewed and confirmed all of your treatment information, a lid speculum will be placed to keep your eyelids open during the surgery. When it is time to create the LASIK flap, a suction device will be placed on your eye that will fixate it. During this period, you may feel pressure that may be somewhat uncomfortable, and your vision will go dark for a brief period of time. Your doctor will then use the microkeratome to create the corneal flap. After the flap has been created, the microkeratome will be removed, the suction will be off, and your vision will return, although it will likely remain blurry for the remainder of the procedure.''Your doctor will then carefully move the flap in order to expose the underlying corneal tissue. Any excess moisture on the tissue will be dried, and your underlying corneal thickness will be measured. The laser apparatus will then be positioned over your eye. Your doctor will ask you to stare directly at the light. It should be noted that the light you are staring at is not the laser that is being used for the surgery and may have different colors based on the specific laser being used for your treatment. This light is simply used so that your eye will remain in a fixed position.''The laser will be started by your doctor once your eye is in a satisfactory position. Do not be alarmed if you notice ticking sounds and new smells during this part of the procedure. The ticking sound is the sound of the laser pulses and the smell, which has been described by some as that of burning hair, is the evaporation of fluid from your cornea during laser ablation. The amount of laser treatment time varies among patients but is usually less than 60 seconds. After the appropriate amount of corneal tissue has been ablated by the laser, the corneal flap is gently placed back down into its original position.''To protect your eye, a shield will be placed around your eye. This is to prevent you from accidentally rubbing your eye or putting any pressure onto your eye. Your cornea is especially vulnerable in this early postoperative period, which is why it is very important to keep your eye protected. If you are having both eyes treated during the same surgery, the surgeon will reposition the laser over your other eye and the same process will be repeated for the second eye.' "
What should I expect after surgery?,"'As soon as the procedure is finished, you may notice that your eyes feel irritated, ''burn'', ''itch'', or feel like there is something in them. Your eyes will frequently water or tear excessively, and your vision will be somewhat blurry. The most important thing to avoid during this time is rubbing your eyes. Do not rub your eyes under any circumstances, as rubbing can dislocate or shift the corneal flap, which could require you to have an additional procedure to reposition it. Using copious artificial tears and resting with your eyes closed will most effectively ease these sensations. In some instances, there may be increased discomfort or even a mild degree of ''pain'', for which your doctor may advise you to take a ''pain reliever''. In most cases, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', such as ''ibuprofen'', are enough to relieve the ''pain''. In addition to artificial tears, you will have antibiotic drops and anti-inflammatory drops (steroids) to use beginning on the day of surgery that you will continue to use for days to weeks after surgery.''Other symptoms you may notice immediately after surgery include light sensitivity, hazy vision, glare, seeing starbursts or halos around lights, and reddened or bloodshot eyes. All of these symptoms should improve over the first few days following surgery. It is very important that you contact your doctor immediately on the first night after surgery if you are having severe pain or if your vision is getting worse and not better. You do not need to wait until your first follow-up visit if you are experiencing either of these things.''Your first postoperative visit should be scheduled within the first 24 hours following surgery. At that visit, your doctor will check your vision and examine your eyes. You will continue to use your antibiotics and steroid drops as well as artificial tears. Your vision should be clearer but may still be blurry the first few days after surgery, and you may need to adjust your work or travel schedule or even take some time off after surgery to fully recuperate.''You should ask your doctor how long you need to wait to start participating in sports again, such as ''walking'' or jogging. In general, you should wait anywhere from one to three days following surgery to restart low impact sports, and avoid any possible eye trauma, such as more competitive sports, for a minimum of 2 or more weeks. In addition, it is unwise to expose yourself to eye infection risks such as pools, lakes, or hot tubs during the early healing process. Your surgeon will tell you when you can resume these activities.''As mentioned earlier, lotions, creams, makeup, and perfumes can often cause buildup on the eyelids and may increase the risk for infection. Ask your doctor when it is advisable to resume use of these products.''Typically, your vision will stabilize within the first week or two, but it may continue to change over the first couple of months following surgery. It may take anywhere from 3-6 months for your vision to stabilize completely. Other visual symptoms, such as glare, seeing halos, and difficulty driving at night, may continue during this stabilization period. Additional treatments, or enhancements, may be needed after surgery, but the stability of your cornea will need to be established before any repeat treatments are performed. Before enhancements are considered, you should have had consistent eye measurements at two consecutive visits. When considering additional treatments, you should know that while it is likely that your vision can be improved by enhancements, just as with the initial surgery, there are no guarantees, and there are still risks associated with having surgery.''You should not hesitate to call your eye doctor immediately if you develop worsening or unusual symptoms at any time after surgery. These symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem that could result in ''loss of vision'' if not treated properly in a timely fashion.' "
What is photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)?,"'Photorefractive ''keratectomy'' (PRK) is ''laser eye surgery'' that reduces the need for corrective ''eyewear'' by reshaping the ''cornea'"" of the eye, thereby changing the way the eye focuses light on the retina. An excimer laser ablates (removes) a thin layer of the cornea at its surface, changing the cornea's refractive (focusing) power.""'LASIK'' (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis) eye surgery is a similar procedure except first a medical professional creates a flap within the cornea with either a laser or a microkeratome blade and then performs the ablation below the flap, deeper in the cornea. In ''LASEK'' (laser-assisted subepithelial keratomileusis), a medical professional makes a thinner flap of just the outer layer (epithelium) and performs the ablation under the epithelium. There are pros and cons to weigh in choosing between ''LASIK'', LASEK, and PRK. In terms of cost, photorefractive keratectomy is usually less expensive than LASIK. Postoperative discomfort is typically less of an issue with LASIK. Ultimately, the choice comes down to which procedure will produce the most safe and reliable outcome, and factors such as corneal health and degree of refractive error determine this.' "
What vision problems does photorefractive keratectomy treat?,"'PRK can treat a variety of refractive errors, including ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness''), ''hyperopia'' (''farsightedness''), and ''astigmatism'"" (imperfection in the eye's curvature of the cornea or ""'lens'""). The laser treats certain medical conditions affecting the eye's surface (for example, Salzmann's nodules and recurrent erosions). When physicians use the laser for these indications, the procedure is referred to as phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)."" "
Who is a good candidate for PRK?,"'The ideal candidate is someone whose corneal tissue is well suited for the procedure. Patients must first meet several criteria. For example, corneal thickness is important. Larger corrections require more tissue ablation so thin corneas may not be suitable for refractive surgery, particularly in patients with very high ''myopia''. The surgeon will calculate if there will be sufficient residual corneal tissue to perform the ablation safely.''The eye doctor reviews the medical history and performs a complete eye examination to look for any ''eye problems'' or medical conditions that might affect the outcome of refractive surgery. Poor eye health or certain medical diseases (for example, uncontrolled ''diabetes'') may increase the risk of a poor outcome.'""Age is another factor. If a candidate's eyes are still growing (for example, in childhood and in the teen years), the refractive error may not have stabilized. Undergoing photorefractive keratectomy too soon may only provide a temporary correction of the refractive error, since the eye is still changing."" "
What are the potential side effects and complications of PRK?,"'Common side effects in the days following the PRK procedure include discomfort, ''dry eye'', foreign body sensation (gritty or sandy feeling), ''blurred vision'', and glare or haloes around lights. These symptoms tend to resolve as the eye heals. Visual recovery takes a few days, and the final uncorrected visual acuity (vision without glasses) typically stabilizes after a few months.''Long-term under-correction or overcorrection can result from variable healing rates, inaccuracies in calculations, or unstable refractive errors.''Uncommon but potentially serious complications include infection, irregular shape, and thinning of the cornea (ectasia), elevated ''intraocular pressure'' (sometimes related to postoperative steroid eyedrops), scarring, or persistent corneal erosions. These complications could result in visual blurring or glare, ''vision loss'', light sensitivity, or ''pain''. These complications have become less common with improvements in preoperative screening, more sophisticated laser ablation profiles, and better medication regimens for optimized healing.' "
How do I prepare for PRK?,"'The eye surgeon first determines if your eyes are suitable for PRK surgery in the preoperative screening.''You may be asked to refrain from wearing hard (rigid) ''contact lenses'' for up to several weeks or soft contact lenses for several days in preparation for both the preoperative screening and the procedure itself. This is important because contact lenses can temporarily reshape the cornea. You will want your cornea to be in its “natural,” unaltered state when being measured preoperatively and when being treated.''On the day of PRK surgery, do not wear ''makeup'' or perfume. Be sure to have your postoperative medications ready and review the instructions for their use.' "
What happens during the PRK procedure?,"'Typically, the patient lies on his/her back. A small lid speculum holds the eyelids open. Once the eye is numbed with anesthetic drops, the surgeon removes the outer layer (epithelium) of the cornea either mechanically (with a tiny brush or a sweeping tool) or with laser. Once the surgeon removes the epithelium, laser is applied to the surface of the cornea to precisely ablate (remove) a thin layer of corneal tissue based on the amount of myopic, hyperopic, or ''astigmatic'' correction desired. A clicking or tapping sound might be heard as the laser fires. Once the laser ablation is complete, the surgeon places a contact lens. Medical professionals remove this ""bandage"" contact lens once the epithelium heals, typically a few days later (about three to five days). The postoperative medicated eye drops are used with the contact lens in place.' "
What follow-up care do people need after PRK? What is the recovery time for PRK?,"'At the completion of your surgery, you will need someone to drive for you. You can expect to be very light sensitive, so be sure to have ''sunglasses'' with you.''Medical professionals will instruct you to use prescription medicated eyedrops afterward. These may include steroids, anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', and antibiotics. The drops are very important for healing well. They serve to control inflammation and prevent infection, as well as to minimize discomfort.''You can expect a mild to moderate amount of ''eye pain'' (light sensitivity, foreign body sensation) for the first few days as the epithelium heals. You may need to take oral medication for ''pain''.''Close monitoring of the healing process is also very important. Be sure to keep all scheduled follow-up appointments. The number and frequency of follow-up visits will depend on how quickly the eye heals. It may take several weeks to three months to reach your best corrected vision (stable refraction).' "
What is the prognosis after a photorefractive keratectomy?,"'Generally, the success rate is very good. Assuming there are no underlying medical conditions that could adversely affect the healing process, the surface of the eye (epithelium) usually heals in a few days, achieving a stable refraction in the weeks and months following the procedure. Because the surgeon made no flap, there are no concerns about the flap-related complications sometimes seen after LASIK surgery.''Over time, there may be a need to use corrective eyewear again, either because some of the corrective effect regresses or because the underlying refractive error was still in flux and had not stabilized completely prior to the procedure. Re-treatment with further photorefractive keratectomy is often possible at a later date.''Patients over the age of 40 who correct their distance vision with photorefractive keratectomy will still need to use reading glasses when ''presbyopia'' sets in. ''Presbyopia'' is the inability to see well close-up due to age-related changes in the eye\'s lens. Patients over 40 who already have presbyopia can opt to have one eye corrected for distance while having the other eye corrected for near. This is called ""monovision."" The eye doctor will discuss these options with you in the preoperative screening.' "
What is keratitis?,"'Keratitis is the medical term for inflammation of the ''cornea'"". The cornea is the dome-shaped window in the front of the eye. When looking at a person's eye, one can see the ""'iris'"" and pupil through the normally clear cornea. The cornea bends light rays as a result of its curved shape and accounts for approximately two-thirds of the eye's total optical power, with the ""'lens'' of the eye contributing the remaining one-third. Only the very thin tear film lies between the front of the cornea and our environment.''The cornea is about 0.5 millimeter thick. The back of the cornea is bathed in the aqueous fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye. The cornea has a diameter of about 13 millimeters (½ inch) and, together with the sclera (the white part of the eye) forms the entire outer coat of the eye.' "
What are the causes of keratitis?,"'Keratitis, the eye condition in which the cornea becomes inflamed, has many potential causes. Various types of infections, ''dry eyes'', abnormalities of the eyelids, injury, and a large variety of underlying medical diseases may all lead to keratitis. Some cases of keratitis result from unknown factors.' "
What are the risk factors for keratitis?,"'Major risk factors for the development of keratitis include any break or disruption of the surface layer (epithelium) of the cornea.''The use of ''contact lenses'' increases the risk of developing keratitis, especially if hygiene is poor, improper solutions are used to store and clean the lenses, or if ''contact lenses'' are worn improperly or in the presence of persistent irritation.''A decrease in the quality or quantity of tears predisposes the eye to the development of keratitis.''Disturbances of immune function through diseases such as ''AIDS'' or the use of medications such as ''corticosteroids'' or ''chemotherapy'' also increase the risk of developing keratitis.'  "
What are the different types of keratitis?,"'Keratitis can be classified by its location, severity, and cause.''If keratitis only involves the surface (epithelial) layer of the cornea, it is called superficial keratitis. If it affects the deeper layers of the cornea (the corneal stroma), it is called stromal keratitis or interstitial keratitis. It may involve the center of the cornea or the peripheral part of the cornea (that portion closest to the sclera) or both. Keratitis may affect one eye or both eyes.''Keratitis may be mild, moderate, or severe and may be associated with inflammation of other parts of the eye. Keratoconjunctivitis is inflammation of the cornea and the ''conjunctiva''. Kerato-''uveitis'' is inflammation of the cornea and the uveal tract, which consists of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.''Keratitis may be acute or chronic. It may occur only once or twice in an eye or be recurrent. It may be limited in its effects on the eye or be progressive in its damage. It may involve one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral).''The various causes of keratitis may result in different clinical presentations, so defining the location, severity, and frequency of the condition can often assist in pinpointing the exact cause. Other helpful facts in establishing the cause of keratitis can include demographic information such as the age, sex, and geographic location of the patient. A medical history, social history, and a review of all symptoms are often useful as well in finding the cause of keratitis.''Infection is the most frequent cause of keratitis. Bacteria, ''viruses'', fungi, and parasitic organisms may all infect the cornea, causing infectious or microbial keratitis.''Physical or chemical ''trauma'"" is a frequent cause of keratitis. The injury may become secondarily infected or remain noninfected. Retained corneal foreign bodies are frequent sources of keratitis. Ultraviolet light from sunlight (snow blindness), a tanning light or a welder's arc, contact-lens overwear, and chemical agents, either in liquid form splashed into the eye or in gases in the form of fumes can all result in noninfectious keratitis. Chemical injury or contact lens-related keratitis often causes superficial punctate keratitis, in which the examiner notices myriads of injured surface cells on the affected cornea.""'Disturbances in the tear film may lead to changes in the corneal surface through drying of the corneal epithelium. This type of keratitis is usually superficial and is known as keratitis sicca. If the eyes are extremely dry, the surface cells may die and form attached filaments on the corneal surface, a condition known as filamentary keratitis. Inability to close the eyelids properly can also lead to corneal drying, a condition termed exposure keratitis. This can occur in '""Bell's palsy""', which is a facial nerve ''weakness'' sometimes associated with ''Lyme disease''.''Disorders of the eyelids or eyelashes may also cause keratitis. If the lower ''eyelid'' is turned inward, a condition known as entropion, eyelashes will rub against the cornea. Lashes growing in the wrong direction may also cause surface damage to the cornea.''Allergies'' to airborne pollens or bacterial toxins in the tears may also cause a noninfectious type of keratitis. Autoimmune diseases create a similar appearance, often affecting the periphery of the cornea, termed marginal keratitis or limbic keratitis. People with ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or other immune disorders may develop marginal corneal ulceration with thinning of the cornea.'   Bacteria most frequently responsible for keratitis include Staphylococci, Hemophilus, Streptococci, and Pseudomonas. If the front surface of the cornea has been damaged by a small scratch and the surface is not intact, almost any bacteria, including atypical mycobacteria, can invade the cornea and result in keratitis. Ulcerations of the cornea may occur, a condition known as ulcerative keratitis. Before the advent of antibiotics, syphilis was a frequent cause of keratitis. Viruses that infect the cornea include respiratory viruses, including the adenoviruses and others responsible for the common cold. The herpes simplex virus is another common cause of keratitis. It typically produces a dendritic keratitis, which is a defect in the surface of the cornea in a tree-branching configuration. Worldwide, the incidence of HSV keratitis is about 1.5 million, including 40,000 new cases of related blindness each year. The herpes zoster virus (VZV or varizella-zoster virus, the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles) may also cause keratitis, particularly when shingles involves the forehead. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently described adult patients with conjunctivitis and keratitis resulting from the Zika virus. Fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, and Nocardia are unusual causes of microbial keratitis, more frequently occurring in people who are immunocompromised because of underlying illnesses or medications. Fusarium keratitis, a type of fungal infection, occurs primarily in contact-lens wearers. Bacterial co-infection can complicate fungal keratitis. Contact-lens wearers are also susceptible to Acanthamoeba keratitis caused by an amebic parasite. ""River blindness,"" or onchocercal keratitis, is another parasitic infection of the cornea, rarely seen in developed countries, but very common in the Third World."
What are keratitis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of keratitis usually include ''pain'', tearing, redness, and blurring of vision. The ''pain'' may be mild to severe, depending on the cause and extent of the inflammation. ''Sensitivity to light'' may also be present. To the observer, the eye may appear red and watery; and if the cornea has extensive keratitis, the normally clear cornea may look gray or have white to gray areas.'  "
What types of doctors treat keratitis?,"'If you develop keratitis, you should be examined promptly by a professional trained in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. These include ophthalmologists and optometrists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose keratitis?,"'The diagnosis of keratitis is made by an ophthalmologist (a physician who specializes in diseases and surgery of the eye) through a history and a physical examination. The history consists of questions documenting a past medical and ''ocular'' history and the symptoms specific to the current visit. The eye examination will consist of checking your vision and careful inspection of the corneas using a slit lamp, which is a microscope with excellent illumination and magnification to view the ''ocular'' surface and the cornea in detail. A special dye containing fluorescein in the form of eyedrops may be placed in the eyes to assist with the examination.''In cases in which infection is suspected, a culture may be taken from the surface of the eye for specific identification of the bacteria, virus, fungus, or parasite causing the keratitis. Blood tests may also be done in certain patients with suspected underlying disease.' "
What is the treatment for keratitis?,"'Treatment depends on the cause of the keratitis. Infectious keratitis generally requires antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral therapy to treat the infection. This treatment can involve prescription eyedrops, pills, or even intravenous therapy. Any corneal or ''conjunctival'' foreign body should be removed. Wetting drops may be used if disturbance of the tears is suspected to be the cause of the keratitis. Steroid drops may be prescribed occasionally to reduce inflammation and limit scarring. This must be done carefully and judiciously, since some infections can be worsened with their use.''Contact-lens wearers are typically advised to discontinue contact-lens wear, whether or not the lenses are related to the cause of the keratitis.'  "
What are the possible complications of keratitis?,"'Superficial keratitis involves the superficial layers of the cornea and most commonly does not lead to scarring. More extensive keratitis involves deeper layers of the cornea, and if a ''corneal ulcer'' develops, a ''scar'' may be present upon healing. This will affect the vision if the central portion of the cornea is involved. With severe ulcerative keratitis, the cornea may perforate, which is an extremely serious situation.' "
What is the prognosis of keratitis?,"'With proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment including follow-up care, keratitis can usually be managed without causing permanent visual disturbances.' "
Is it possible to prevent keratitis?,"'The risk of keratitis can be reduced through the use of precautions to avoid eye injury, careful contact-lens care including proper cleaning of contact lens cases, and the prompt treatment of early ocular symptoms.' "
What is dry eye syndrome?,"'Dry eye syndrome (DES) -- also called dry eye, dry eye disease, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) -- is a common condition of the tear film that affects a significant percentage of the population, especially those older than 40 years of age. Dry eye syndrome can affect any race and is more common in women than in men. Another term used for dry eye is ocular surface disease.' "
What is the impact of dry eye syndrome?,"'More than 3 million American women over the age of 50 have moderate to severe ''dry eyes'', while more than 1.5 million American men over the age of 50 are similarly afflicted. Millions of others have mild dry eyes. In the majority of these people, this health condition is benign and easily treated with artificial tears.''Many wearers of ''contact lenses'' experience dry eyes at some point with many discontinuing or limiting ''lens'' wear. Dry eye is a significant finding in patients having undergone refractive surgery, especially ''LASIK''.''In addition to affecting ocular health, the discomfort and irritation of dry eyes can cause deterioration of general well-being, emotional health, and social functioning. Studies have demonstrated that people with dry eye syndrome are three times more likely than those without dry eyes to have difficulty with reading, computer work, watching TV, and driving. Direct costs of dry eyes, such as frequent physician visits, diagnostic tests, and charges for medication and surgery impact our health care resources. In addition, there are immeasurable indirect costs related to decreased productivity and efficiency and lost work time.' "
What causes dry eye syndrome? What are the types of dry eye disease?,"""Dry eye syndrome is a common disorder of the normal tear film that results from decreased tear production, excessive tear evaporation, and an abnormality in the production of mucus or lipids normally found in the tear layer, or a combination of these. Aqueous (watery) tear deficiency is caused by either poor production of watery tears or excessive evaporation of the watery tear layer. Poor production of tears by the tear glands may be a result of age, hormonal changes, or various autoimmune diseases, such as primary Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', or ''systemic lupus erythematosus''. Evaporative loss of the watery tear layer is usually a result of an insufficient overlying lipid layer.''Some medications, such as ''antihistamines'', ''antidepressants'', ''beta-blockers'', and ''oral contraceptives'', may decrease tear production.''If blinking decreases or if the eyelids cannot be closed, the eyes may dry out because of tear evaporation. While reading, watching TV, or performing a task that requires close attention with the eyes, a person may not blink as often. This decreased blinking allows excessive evaporation of the tears. Certain health conditions, such as ''stroke'"" or Bell's palsy, make it difficult to close the eyes. As a result, the eyes may become dry from tear evaporation.""'Abnormal production of mucin by the conjunctiva may occur. This can result from chemical (alkali) ''burns'' to the eye or because of different autoimmune diseases, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cicatricial pemphigoid. This abnormal production leads to poor spreading of the tears over the surface of the eye. The surface of the eye can dry out and even become damaged despite the presence of sufficient watery tears.''Insufficient lipid layers are the result of meibomian gland dysfunction, ''rosacea'', or following oral ''isotretinoin'' medication. Meibomian glands are the oil glands in the eyelids that produce the lipid layer. If these oil glands become blocked or if the oil is too thick, there may not be enough oil to cover the watery tear layer to prevent its evaporation.''In addition, if an infection is present along the eyelids or the eyelashes (called ''blepharitis'') the bacteria may break down the oil, so there may not be enough oil. This may lead to evaporative loss of tears and dry eyes.'  "
What are the risk factors for dry eye syndrome?,"'Dry eye syndrome is more common with increasing age, female sex, and Asian ethnicity. ''Menopause'' can increase the risk of dry eye syndrome. Paradoxically, ''postmenopausal'' women on ''hormone replacement therapy'', especially ''estrogens'"" alone, have a higher prevalence of dry eyes than postmenopausal women who don't take hormones.""'Occupational and environmental factors increasing risk include low humidity, high room temperature, wind exposure, pollution and poor air quality, ''smoking'', and decreased blink rates due to sustained computer use or reading.''Diseases associated with dry eyes include ''vitamin A'' deficiency (historically known as xerophthalmia), ''acne rosacea'', autoimmune/connective tissue disease, ''hepatitis C'' infection, ''HIV'"" infection, Sjögren's syndrome, ""'sarcoidosis'', ''diabetes mellitus'', and ''androgen'' or estrogen deficiency.''Wearing contact lenses increases the risk of dry eye syndrome. Refractive surgery, especially ''LASIK'', frequently causes dry eyes.''A ''diet'' low in ''omega-3 fatty acids'' or a ''diet'' with a relatively high amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to ''omega-3 fatty acids'' can also increase the risk of dry eye syndrome.''Various types of medications, including systemic ''chemotherapy'', diuretics, antidepressants, antihistamines and beta-adrenergic blockers, may cause dry eyes as a side effect of the medication.''Irregularities of the ''conjunctival'' surface as seen with pingueculae or pterygia, can cause dry eye symptoms. Abnormalities of the blink mechanism or mechanical lid abnormalities can also produce DES symptoms.' "
What are dry eye syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'A person with dry eye syndrome may experience dry, gritty/scratchy, or filmy feeling, burning or ''itching'', ''redness of the eyes'' (''conjunctivitis''), ''blurred vision'', foreign body sensation, and light sensitivity.''Dry eye symptoms seem to worsen in dry or windy climates and with higher temperatures and lower humidity. Symptoms may also be worse with prolonged use of the eyes (for example, while reading and watching TV) and toward the end of the day.''Sometimes a symptom of dry eye syndrome may actually be intermittent excessive tearing. With dry eye, when the eyes becomes slightly dry and irritated, it may initiate reflex tearing with the production of a large amount of tears all at once to try to get moist and comfortable again. Unfortunately, the eyes can only handle so many tears at any one time; the rest pour over the eyelids and down the cheeks. A short time later, the eyes will become slightly dry and irritated again and the whole process may repeat itself.'  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose dry eye syndrome?,"'During an eye examination, an ''eye care'' specialist (ophthalmologist) will most likely be able to diagnose dry eye syndrome just by ''hearing'"" the patient's complaints about his or her eyes. A health care professional can confirm the diagnosis of dry eyes by observing signs of dry eyes. As part of the eye examination, a doctor may""""An ophthalmologist may use different dyes during a patient's eye examination. An eye care specialist will place the dyes into the tears in the form of a drop. Fluorescein is a yellow dye that stains the cornea where epithelial (surface) cells have been worn away because of the lack of an adequate protective tear film. Rose Bengal is a red dye that stains the cornea and the conjunctiva where the cells are dead or dying as well as where healthy cells are inadequately protected by the tear film. Lissamine Green is a green dye that can help differentiate between normal and abnormal surface cells of the cornea and conjunctiva.""'Schirmer tests measure the amount of tears produced by the eyes. The ophthalmologist places the end of a thin strip of filter paper just inside the lower ''eyelid''. After a minute, the doctor removes the filter paper, and the amount of wetting is measured. Less wetting of the filter paper is more indicative of dry eye syndrome.''The osmolarity (salt content) of the tears may be measured. This is a new test that aids in the diagnosis of dry eye syndrome, in which tear osmolarity is increased over normal levels.'""Another new test on the tears can detect the presence of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), a substance which, when present in the tears, is a reliable marker for the presence of early ocular surface disease and dry eye. This test may be helpful to identify patients with ocular surface inflammation and autoimmune disease and may facilitate the decision to institute anti-inflammatory treatment in these patients. If autoimmune diseases or Sjögren's syndrome are suspected as a cause of a patient's dry eye syndrome, blood tests may be performed. These blood tests check for the presence of different autoantibodies that may be associated with dry eye syndrome.""""Rarely, a doctor may perform a biopsy of the salivary glands. Certain disease processes, such as Sjögren's syndrome, affect both the salivary glands, which produce saliva in your mouth, and the lacrimal glands, which produce tears."" examine the front of the eyes is examined using a special microscope, called a slit lamp; inspect the amount and thickness of the tear film; assess the stability of the tear film by checking the tear breakup time; inspect the eyelids for signs of inflammation; examine the Meibomian glands of the lids and their openings into the tear film; assess the conjunctiva to determine if it is too dry or inflamed; and check the cornea to see if it has dried out or become damaged. If both the cornea and conjunctiva are involved, the condition is known as keratoconjunctivitis."
What are over-the-counter medical treatments for dry eye syndrome?,"'Although no cure exists for dry eye syndrome, many medical treatments are available. Treatment is dependent on the severity of the condition; some people may only require a humidifier or occasional eye drops while others may require surgery to help decrease dry eyes.''Over-the-counter'' lubricating eye drops, commonly referred to as artificial tears, may help relieve dry eyes. Some examples of these products include 20/20 Tears, Celluvisc, Comfort Tears, Dry Eyes, Murine, Refresh, Genteal, Soothe, TheraTears, Systane and Tears Naturale. Most of these are available in a preservative free packaging, which reduces the possibility of irritation from preservatives. One should avoid tear substitutes containing a vasoconstrictor such as naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, phenylephrine, and oxymetazoline. A doctor may also prescribe medications to help a patient with dry eye syndrome.'  "
What types of medications (prescriptions) are used in the medical treatment of dry eye syndrome?,"""A major portion of the ophthalmologist's decision about prescription treatment of DES is based on determining whether the problem is primarily evaporative or aqueous-deficient, or a combination of both. There is a great deal of overlap between evaporative and aqueous-deficient dry eye.""'Certain prescription medications may help with dry eye syndrome. An eye care professional may prescribe eye lubricants, such as ''Lacrisert'', an artificial tear insert. The insert is similar to a contact lens, and the patient will need to insert the eye lubricant one to two times per day. Cellulose is contained in the insert and acts to stabilize and thicken the film of tears over the eyes and to prolong the time the tear film works. ''Corneal abrasion'"" may occur if the artificial tear insert isn't inserted properly.""'Certain prescription medications may help with dry eye syndrome. ''Cyclosporine'' A 0.5% (''Restasis'') helps decrease any inflammation on the surface of the eye. This inflammation decreases the ability of the eyes to maintain a healthy tear film. Used twice a day, cyclosporine 0.5% helps people make more, healthier tears on their own. Lifitegrast 5% (Xiidra) is another approved prescription eye drop that reduces inflammation in the tear glands. ''Corticosteroid'' drops (Lotemax, Alrex, ''FML'', ''Vexol'""), either alone or used in conjunction with cyclosporine or Lifitegrast, reduce the signs and symptoms of dry eye. Although the FDA has not yet approved this group of drops for the medical treatment of dry eye syndrome, many ophthalmologists use them. Corticosteroid drops, if used in excess, may have some side effects, but new formulations with fewer side effects have become available. Like all medications, patients should only use these under a doctor's supervision and according to her or his instructions. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops (""'Voltaren'', ''Acular'', Nevanac, and Xibrom) likewise reduce the inflammation associated with dry eye syndrome.''People with ''blepharitis'' or meibomian gland dysfunction need antibiotics. The patient will use antibiotic ophthalmic drops or ointments, such as ''erythromycin'', ''azithromycin'' and bacitracin, among others, for about seven to 10 days to decrease the number of bacteria that break down the lipid layer of the tear film. In ointment form, these also lubricate the eyes overnight. Oral antibiotics, particularly azithromycin and ''doxycycline'' or other ''tetracycline'', not only help to decrease the number of bacteria, but also help to make the oil more fluid so it flows out of the oil glands more easily. This is often used if a person has ''rosacea''. There are many people who have ''rosacea'' of the eyelids, suffer from dry eye syndrome, and do not have the typical changes of rosacea on the rest of the face.''Other physician prescribed medications may include drops prepared by a compounding pharmacy such as autologous serum or hormonal drops.' "
Can self-care treatments and remedies help alleviate dry eyes?,"'To help alleviate the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, certain self-care tips at home may help. A humidifier puts more moisture into the air. With more moisture in the air, tears evaporate more slowly, keeping the eyes more comfortable. Both furnaces in the winter and air conditioning in the summer decrease the humidity in the air. Excessive air movement dries out the eyes. Avoid having excessive air movement by decreasing the speed of ceiling fans and/or oscillating fans. Large amounts of dust or other particulate matter in the air may worsen the symptoms of dry eye. In those situations, an air filter may be helpful.''Warm compresses and eyelid scrubs/''massage'' with baby shampoo help by providing a thicker, more stable lipid layer. This is especially helpful if a person has meibomian gland dysfunction, rosacea, or blepharitis. The heat (careful, warm compresses should not be too hot; the compress should be comfortable if placed on your wrist) warms up the oil in the oil glands, making it flow more easily; the mild massaging action helps get the oil out of the glands. The cleansing action decreases the number of bacteria that break down the oil.''Artificial tears and lubricating eyedrops and gels (available over the counter) help provide more moisture and lubrication for the surface of the eye. Individuals typically use lubricating eyedrops about four times a day, but they can be used as often as needed. Doctors recommend preservative-free solutions for those who wish to use tears more than six times a day. There is no single over-the-counter drop that is best for everybody. Each individual will determine which drop provides the most relief from symptoms. Some drops may have a longer time effect than others.''Lubricating eye ointments are much thicker than eye drops and gels. Because ointments are so thick, they last much longer than eye drops and gels. However, because of their thickness, ointments may blur vision if people use them during the day. Therefore, people typically use ointments to lubricate the eyes overnight during ''sleep''.''If the eyes are dry mainly while reading or watching TV, taking frequent breaks to allow the eyes to rest and become moist and comfortable again is helpful. Closing the eyes for 10 seconds every five to 10 minutes will increase comfort, as will blinking more frequently.''Taking a ''fish oil'' (or other high quality source of ''omega-3'' fatty acids) supplement every day can often be helpful in alleviating symptoms of dry eye.' "
What is chronic dry eye syndrome?,'Chronic dry eye syndrome is a persistent condition of dry eyes that may wax and wane over an extended period of time. Removing environmental influences or reducing contact lens wear does not provide relief.' 
Can surgery treat dry eye syndrome?,"'Different minor surgical procedures may help decrease dry eye syndrome. Near the inner corner of each eyelid are tiny openings, called punctae, that are the beginning of the normal tear drainage system. From there, tears normally flow through naso-lacrimal ducts into the nose. Punctal occlusion helps by decreasing the normal drainage of the tears from the ocular surface and down the tear drainage system, into the back of the nose, and down the throat. This occlusion is usually done by a very simple office procedure and only takes a few minutes. An eye care professional can place different punctal plugs or lacrimal canalicular plugs at or just inside these openings to block the normal drainage of tears down the tear drainage system. Just like a stopper placed in the drain of a sink keeps the water from flowing down the drain, these plugs keep the tears from flowing down the tear drainage system. Therefore, the eyes stay more moist and comfortable, even if one has fewer tears. Ophthalmologists can remove these plugs very easily, if necessary. Sometimes, in severe cases of dry eye syndrome, eye care professionals permanently close these openings, usually by cautery (burning) or laser. This accomplishes the same thing as the plugs, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.'""If a person has difficulty closing the eyes for any reason, such as Bell's palsy, the eyes may dry out because of tear evaporation. Lateral tarsorrhaphy is a procedure during which the lateral (outside) one-third of the eyelids are sewn together to decrease the ability of the eye to open widely and to help the eyes close more easily. If ""'stroke'' or nerve damage keeps the eyelids from closing properly, a doctor may implant a small gold weight into the upper eyelid to help it close.' "
What are other therapies that treat dry eye syndrome?,"'Sometimes, people ''sleep'' with their eyes slightly open. If a person sleeps this way, he or she might want to tape the eyes shut at night.''Moisture chambers are ''plastic'' shields (similar to swim goggles) that help keep the eyes from drying out by decreasing the evaporation of tears off the eye. A person may use the moisture chambers just at night if he or she sleeps with his or her eyes slightly open, or they may be used all day, if necessary.' "
What are the health complications of dry eye syndrome?,"'Most people with dry eye syndrome have nothing to worry about aside from an annoying inconvenience. Although the symptoms might make activities of daily living (for example, reading, watching TV, driving) miserable, no long-term ''vision loss'' is to be expected.''For those with more severe dry eye syndrome, significant drying of the surface of the eye can lead to an increased risk of serious infections. Ultimately, scarring, thinning, and even perforation of the cornea may occur. As a result, vision, or even the eye itself, may be permanently damaged or function lost.'  "
What is the prognosis of dry eye syndrome?,"'Although dry eye syndrome can be very symptomatic, it is seldom a cause of significant visual loss. Most cases are benign and easily treated with artificial tears. Although ulcers of the cornea can occur, they are extremely rare.' "
Is it possible to prevent dry eye syndrome?,"'Avoiding environmental causes of dry eye can be helpful in ''prevention''. If the eyes are dry mainly while reading or watching TV, taking frequent breaks to allow the eyes to rest and become moist and comfortable again is helpful. Closing the eyes for 10 seconds every five to 10 minutes will increase comfort, as will blinking more frequently.''Taking a fish oil (or other high quality source of omega-3 fatty acids) supplement every day can often be helpful in alleviating symptoms of dry eye.' "
Introduction,"'We see through the ''cornea'', which is the clear, central part of the front surface of the eye. Normally, the cornea has a round shape, like a ball. Sometimes, however, the structure of the cornea is just not strong enough to hold this round shape. The normal pressure inside the eye makes the cornea bulge outward like a cone. This condition is called ''keratoconus''.' "
What Causes Keratoconus?,"'Often the cause of ''keratoconus'' is unknown. Some studies have found that keratoconus runs in families, and that it happens more often in people with certain medical conditions. But most often, there is no eye injury or disease that could explain why the eye starts to change.''Keratoconus usually begins in the teenage years, but it can also start in childhood or up to about age 30. The changes in the shape of the cornea occur slowly, usually over several years.''Someone with keratoconus will notice that vision slowly becomes distorted. The change can stop at any time, or it can continue for several years. In most people who have keratoconus, both eyes are eventually affected.'  "
Can Keratoconus Damage Vision?,"'Keratoconus does not make people go blind. However, the changes to the cornea will make it impossible for the eye to focus without ''eyeglasses'' or ''contact lenses'' .''Keratoconus can be dangerous if laser vision correction surgery -- ''LASIK'' or PRK is performed on the eye.''Anyone with even a small amount of keratoconus should not have laser vision correction surgery.' "
How Is Keratoconus Diagnosed?,"'The doctor may notice some things during the examination, or the patient may mention symptoms, that could be caused by keratoconus. These include:''These things might be related to keratoconus, but your doctor must measure the curvature of the cornea to be certain. Several different instruments can be used to measure the curvature of the cornea.''One instrument, called a keratometer, shines a pattern of light onto the cornea. The shape of the reflection of the pattern tells the doctor how the eye is curved. There are also computerized instruments that make three-dimensional ""maps"" of the cornea, a process called ''corneal topography''.'   Sudden change of vision in just one eye. Double vision when looking with just one eye. Objects both near and far look distorted, but not blurred. In other words, small details of the objects are clear, but the shapes or colors look wrong. Later, distant objects do become blurred. Bright lights look like they have halos around them."
How Is Keratoconus Treated?,"'Only a doctor experienced in treating ''eye problems'' can recommend the right treatment for someone with keratoconus. Treatment usually starts with new eyeglasses, and then contact lenses are recommended. These will correct the vision problems caused by keratoconus.''Keratoconus changes vision in two ways:'   As the cornea changes from a ball shape to a cone shape, the smooth surface also becomes slightly wavy. This is called irregular astigmatism . As the front of the cornea expands, the eye becomes more nearsighted . That is, only nearby objects can be seen clearly. Anything too far away will look like a blur."
Will Surgery Correct Keratoconus?,"'For most people with keratoconus, the only treatment needed is the correct prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses. A small number of cases of keratoconus keep getting worse, however, and, eventually, contact lenses cannot give clear vision. In other cases, the keratoconus or the use of contact lenses over the years will have side effects. These side effects can make the cornea cloudy. When these things happen, corneal transplantation might be recommended.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.' "
What is keratoplasty eye surgery?,"'Automated lamellar keratoplasty eye surgery, or ALK, is a surgical procedure used to correct vision in people with severe ''nearsightedness'' and mild degrees of ''farsightedness''.' "
What Happens During Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'Keratoplasty eye surgery, performed under local anesthesia, usually takes less than an hour to complete. A cutting device is used to make a small incomplete flap across the ''cornea'"". While still attached at one side, the corneal flap is folded back to reveal the layer of tissue below. Another, very precise cut is made on the sub layer of tissue based on the person's glasses' prescription. After this cut, the corneal flap is placed back over the eye where it reattaches."" "
What Are the Advantages of Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,'Compared to other vision repair surgeries:' The healing process for keratoplasty eye surgery is relatively quick It takes less time for stable vision to return Recovery period is more comfortable
What Are the Disadvantages of Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'While keratoplasty eye surgery is a safe and effective surgery, it does have its disadvantages. They include:' For people with mild to moderate  nearsightedness, keratoplasty eye surgery is not as accurate as other eye procedures, meaning that its outcome is more difficult to predict. Keratoplasty eye surgery slightly increases a person's risk of developing an irregular  astigmatism."
What Are the Potential Side Effects of Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'Aside from the above-mentioned disadvantages, side effects, though rare, do occur. These may include:' Glare Inability to wear contacts, sometimes permanently Infection Corneal scarring"
How Should I Prepare for Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'Before your keratoplasty eye surgery you will have met with a coordinator who will discuss with you what you should expect during and after the surgery. During this session your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be tested. Likely tests will include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through your evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any further questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the keratoplasty eye surgery.''If you wear rigid ''gas'' permeable ''contact lenses'"", you should not wear them during the three weeks before keratoplasty eye surgery. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to keratoplasty eye surgery. Be sure to bring your glasses to the surgery so your prescription can be reviewed. ""'On the day of your keratoplasty eye surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye ''makeup'"" or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you do not feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the keratoplasty eye surgery needs to be postponed."" "
What Should I Expect After Keratoplasty Eye Surgery?,"'The healing time from keratoplasty eye surgery is very rapid. It usually takes only about 24 hours to mend. But it may take a few weeks for your vision to finally stabilize.''Your doctor will give you eye drops to control inflammation, discomfort, and prevent infection.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.\t\t\t\t' "
What is keratosis pilaris?,"'Keratosis pilaris is a very common skin disorder that affects people of all ages. Keratosis pilaris is a benign condition characterized by numerous small, rough, red, or tan bumps primarily around hair follicles on the upper arms, legs, buttocks, and sometimes cheeks. Keratosis pilaris creates a ""goose bumps,"" ""gooseflesh,"" or ""chicken skin"" appearance. Keratosis pilaris may be cosmetically displeasing, but it is medically entirely harmless. Keratosis pilaris is common in otherwise healthy people.'  "
What are keratosis pilaris symptoms and signs?,"'Typically, keratosis pilaris patients present with a scattered, patchy ''rash'' composed of very small red or tan bumps. Anywhere from 10 to hundreds of very small slightly rough bumps produce a fine sandpaper-like texture. Some of the bumps may be slightly red or have an accompanying light-red halo indicating inflammation.''Sometimes, a small, coiled hair gets trapped beneath the rough bump. Patients may complain of a rough texture and an irregular cosmetic appearance of the skin. The cheeks may appear pink, red, flushed, and studded with very small (pinpoint) bumps.' "
Who gets keratosis pilaris?,"'Anyone can have keratosis pilaris. Although it is commonly a skin condition of children and adolescents, many adults also have keratosis pilaris. Females seem to get keratosis pilaris more often than males. The age of onset is often within the first 10 years of life and may worsen during ''puberty''. However, keratosis pilaris may begin at any age. There seems to be a genetic aspect to keratosis pilaris. It has been commonly been seen in twins. Keratosis pilaris also appears in patients with ''atopic dermatitis'' and patients with very ''dry skin'' and with a variety of rather rare dermatologic syndromes. Recently, medical professionals have observed that certain ''drugs'' produce a skin change indistinguishable from keratosis pilaris aside from the fact that it will resolve when the drug is stopped. These drugs include cyclosporin, B-raf inhibitors (for example, dabrafenib), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (for example, ''nilotinib'').' "
Does keratosis pilaris affect the entire body?,"'It is rare to have keratosis pilaris all over the body. The lesions in keratosis pilaris most characteristically involve the back of the upper arms. Other common locations include the back, thighs, buttocks and occasionally the face. It does not affect the eyes, mouth, palms, or soles.'  "
What causes keratosis pilaris?,"'The exact cause of keratosis pilaris is unknown. There seems to be a problem with overproduction of the keratin part of the skin producing hyperkeratinization. Others believe that there may be some defect in hair formation, producing defective sebaceous glands, which might partially explain its physical association with hair follicles. A majority of patients with keratosis pilaris has a known genetic predisposition and affected family members. Keratosis pilaris can be present with ''ichthyosis vulgaris'', ''dry skin'', seasonal ''inhalant'' ''allergies'' (''hay fever''), ''rhinitis'', ''asthma'', ''eczema'', and ''atopic dermatitis''.''The bumps in keratosis pilaris seem to arise from the excessive accumulation of keratin from the superficial layer of skin at individual hair follicles. The skin as examined under the microscope demonstrates mild thickening and perforation of the ''hair follicle''. The upper skin layers may have some dilation of the small superficial blood vessels, thereby giving the skin a red or flushed appearance.'

What types of doctors treat keratosis pilaris?,"'Most family physicians and pediatricians are able to diagnose and treat this condition. Occasionally, a dermatologist referral may be necessary.' "
How do doctors diagnose keratosis pilaris?,"""The diagnosis of keratosis pilaris is very straightforward and based on a typical skin appearance in areas like the upper arms. A family history of keratosis pilaris is also very helpful since there is a strong genetic component to the condition. A physician's clinical exam confirms the diagnosis. In late-onset keratosis pilaris occurring in adulthood, one needs to consider a drug as a possible cause.""'Since the appearance of keratosis pilaris is recognizable, specific laboratory tests are not needed for the diagnosis. ''Skin biopsy'' (surgically taking a small piece of skin using local numbing medicine) may be useful in atypical or widespread cases.''Histopathology or pathology are terms for microscopic examination of the body tissue under high magnification by a pathologist or dermatopathologist. Histopathology of keratosis pilaris shows modest thickening of the outer layer of skin (hyperkeratosis of the stratum corneum), increase in the granular cells of the ''epidermis'' (hypergranulosis), and plugging of individual hair follicles. The upper dermis (layer of the skin below the epidermis) may have some microscopic inflammation called mild superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory changes.' "
Does diet have anything to do with keratosis pilaris?,"'Diet'' does not affect keratosis pilaris. ''Vitamin A'"" deficiency may cause symptoms similar to keratosis pilaris, but it's not known to cause keratosis pilaris."" "
Is keratosis pilaris curable?,"'There is no available cure, miracle pill, or universally effective treatment for keratosis pilaris. It sometimes clears completely by itself without treatment.' "
Is keratosis pilaris contagious?,'Keratosis pilaris is not ''contagious''. People do not give it to someone else through skin contact and do not catch it from anyone else. Some people are simply more prone to developing keratosis pilaris because of genetics and skin type.' 
What conditions mimic keratosis pilaris?,"'Other medical conditions can mimic keratosis pilaris. Keratosis pilaris may resemble ''acne'', milia, ''folliculitis'', ''eczema'', ''atopic dermatitis'', facial ''rosacea'', or ''dry skin'' (''xerosis''). Keratosis pilaris may also resemble uncommon skin conditions like lichen spinulosus, ''pityriasis rubra pilaris'', phrynoderma (vitamin A deficiency), ulerythema ophryogenes, ichthyosis vulgaris, eruptive vellus hair ''cysts'', keratosis follicularis (Darier disease), Kyrle disease, lichen nitidus, lichen spinulosus, perforating ''folliculitis'', and trichostasis spinulosa.''In India and other countries, a specific condition called erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli occurs. This unusual condition has a possible genetic relationship to keratosis pilaris. Erythromelanosis follicularis faciei et colli is characterized by the triad of ''hyperpigmentation'' (darker skin color), follicular plugging (blocked hair follicles), and redness of the face and neck.' "
What is the treatment for keratosis pilaris?,"'Many treatment options and ''skin care'' ''recipes'' are available for controlling keratosis pilaris. Often there is very good temporary improvement following a regular skin care program of lubrication. As a general rule of thumb, treatment needs to be continuous. Since there is no available cure or universally effective treatment for keratosis pilaris, the list of potential lotions and creams is long. It is important to keep in mind that as with any condition, no therapy is uniformly effective in all people. Complete clearing may not be possible. In some cases, keratosis pilaris may also improve or clear spontaneously without any treatment.''Health care providers recommend general measures to prevent excessive skin dryness, such as using mild soapless cleansers. Frequent skin lubrication is the mainstay of treatment for nearly all cases.''Basic ''over-the-counter'' moisturizers such as Cetaphil lotion or Aquaphor ointment may improve mild cases of keratosis pilaris. Additional available therapeutic options for more difficult cases of keratosis pilaris include lactic-acid lotions (''AmLactin'', ''Lac-Hydrin''), alpha-hydroxy-acid lotions (Glytone, glycolic body lotions), urea cream (Carmol 10, Carmol 20, Carmol 40, Urix 40), salicylic acid (Salex lotion), topical ''tretinoin'' cream (''Retin A''), and topical steroid creams (triamcinolone 0.1%). Recently, medical professionals have recommended laser treatment for keratosis pilaris. New unproven treatments include topical chlorine dioxide complex wash, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (''Nitrosomonas eutropha'') spray on mist, and photopneumatic therapy. People have tried many treatments for keratosis pilaris, including carbon dioxide laser with mixed results. As there is no miraculous cure or universally effective treatment for keratosis pilaris, it is important to proceed with caution.''Rarely, physicians may prescribe a short seven- to 10-day course of a medium-potency, emollient-based topical steroid cream once or twice a day for ''itchy'', inflamed red areas.''Because keratosis pilaris is generally a chronic condition requiring long-term maintenance, most therapies would require repeated or long-term use for optimum results.''Mild cleansers and lotions for sensitive skin: Wash daily, and apply lotion twice a day''.''Potent moisturizers for home treatment: Use once or twice a day''.'

Are there home remedies for keratosis pilaris?," Do take measures to prevent excessive skin dryness, especially in colder winter months. Do use mild soaps like Dove soapless cleanser or Cetaphil cleanser. Do lubricate skin with special lotions containing ammonium lactate such as AmLactin or Lac-Hydrin lotion, alpha-hydroxy-acid lotions (glycolic acid), urea cream (Urix 40), and salicylic acid (Salex). Do gently massage the lotions into the affected area twice a day. Don't use harsh soaps or cleansers. Don't scrub harshly and try to scrape off the skin. Don't expect immediate results with topical creams. Never give up hope."
What are possible complications of keratosis pilaris?,"""Complications are infrequent since it's primarily a cosmetic skin condition. However, temporary skin discoloration called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (lighter than the regular skin color) or hyperpigmentation may occur after the inflamed, red bumps have improved or after a temporary flare. Permanent scarring may rarely occur from picking, overly aggressive treatments, or other inflammation."" "
What is the prognosis of patients with keratosis pilaris?,"'Overall, keratosis pilaris is a chronic skin condition periodically becoming worse or better. Keratosis pilaris is a benign, noncontagious, self-limited skin condition that tends to be mild. Keratosis pilaris frequently improves with age in many patients. Many patients note improvement of their symptoms in the summer months and seasonal flares in colder winter months. Keratosis seems to improve in areas of high humidity. More widespread, atypical cases of keratosis pilaris may be cosmetically distressing.''Keratosis pilaris usually improves with increasing age. Keratosis pilaris may even spontaneously clear completely after puberty. However, more frequently the condition is chronic with periodic exacerbations and improvements. Many adults still have the skin condition into their 40s and 50s.' "
What is jaundice in newborns?,"""Jaundice is the yellow color seen in the skin of many newborns. Jaundice happens when a chemical called bilirubin builds up in the baby's blood. During ""'pregnancy'"", the mother's ""'liver'"" removes bilirubin for the baby, but after birth the baby's liver must remove the bilirubin. In some babies, the liver might not be developed enough to efficiently get rid of bilirubin. When too much bilirubin builds up in a new baby's body, the skin and whites of the eyes might look yellow. This yellow coloring is called jaundice.""  "
What is kernicterus?,"""When severe jaundice goes untreated for too long, it can cause a condition called kernicterus. Kernicterus is a type of brain damage that can result from high levels of bilirubin in a baby's blood. It can cause athetoid ""'cerebral palsy'' and ''hearing loss''. Kernicterus also causes problems with vision and ''teeth'' and sometimes can cause intellectual disabilities. Early detection and management of jaundice can prevent kernicterus.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of jaundice in newborns?,"""Jaundice usually appears first on the face and then moves to the chest, belly, arms, and legs as bilirubin levels get higher. The whites of the eyes can also look yellow. Jaundice can be harder to see in babies with darker skin color. The baby's doctor or nurse can test how much bilirubin is in the baby's blood."" "
When should I contact my doctor if I think my newborn has jaundice?,"""See your baby's doctor the same day if your baby:""""Make sure your baby is getting enough to eat. The process of removing waste also removes bilirubin in your baby's blood. If you are breastfeeding, you should nurse the baby at least 8 to 12 times a day for the first few days. This will help you make enough milk for the baby and will help keep the baby's bilirubin level down. If you are having trouble breastfeeding, ask your doctor, nurse, or a lactation coach for help."" Is very yellow or orange (skin color changes start from the head and spread to the toes). Is hard to wake up or will not sleep at all. Is not 
		breastfeeding or sucking from a bottle well. Is very fussy. Does not have enough wet or dirty diapers. If you think your baby has jaundice you should call and visit your baby's doctor right away. Ask your baby's doctor or nurse about a jaundice bilirubin test. If your baby does have jaundice, it is important to take jaundice seriously and stick to the follow-up plan for appointments and recommended care."
When should I get emergency medical help if I think my newborn has jaundce?,"'Get emergency medical help if your baby:' Is crying inconsolably or with a high pitch. Is arched like a bow (the head or neck and heels are bent backward and the body forward). Has a stiff, limp, or floppy body. Has strange eye movements."
How is newborn jaundice diagnosed?,"'Before leaving the hospital with your ''newborn'', you can ask the doctor or nurse about a jaundice bilirubin test.'""A doctor or nurse may check the baby's bilirubin using a light meter that is placed on the baby's head. This results in a transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) level. If it is high, a blood test will likely be ordered.""""The best way to accurately measure bilirubin is with a small blood sample from the baby's heel. This results in a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level. If the level is high, based upon the baby's age in hours and other risk factors, treatment will likely follow. Repeat blood samples will also likely be taken to ensure that the TSB decreases with the prescribed treatment.""'Bilirubin levels are usually the highest when the baby is 3 to 5 days old. At a minimum, babies should be checked for jaundice every 8 to 12 hours in the first 48 hours of life and again before 5 days of age.' "
What is the treatment for newborn jaundice?,"'No baby should develop brain damage from untreated jaundice.'""When being treated for high bilirubin levels, the baby will be undressed and put under special lights. The lights will not hurt the baby. This can be done in the hospital or even at home. The baby's milk intake may also need to be increased. In some cases, if the baby has very high bilirubin levels, the doctor will do a blood exchange transfusion. Jaundice is generally treated before brain damage is a concern.""'Putting the baby in sunlight is not recommended as a safe way of treating jaundice.' "
What are the risk factors for newborn jaundice?,"'About 60% of all babies have jaundice. Some babies are more likely to have severe jaundice and higher bilirubin levels than others. Babies with any of the following risk factors need close monitoring and early jaundice management:''Babies born before 37 weeks, or 8.5 months, of pregnancy might have jaundice because their liver is not fully developed. The young liver might not be able to get rid of so much bilirubin.''Jaundice may be missed or not recognized in a baby with darker skin color. Checking the gums and inner lips may detect jaundice. If there is any doubt, a bilirubin test should be done.''A baby born to an East Asian or Mediterranean family is at a higher risk of becoming jaundiced. Also, some families inherit conditions (such as ''G6PD deficiency''), and their babies are more likely to get jaundice.''A baby who is not eating, wetting, or stooling well in the first few days of life is more likely to get jaundice.''A baby with a sister or brother that had jaundice is more likely to develop jaundice.''A baby with ''bruises'' at birth is more likely to get jaundice. A bruise forms when blood leaks out of a blood vessel and causes the skin to look black and blue. The healing of large ''bruises'' can cause high levels of bilirubin and your baby might get jaundice.''Women with an O blood type or Rh negative blood factor might have babies with higher bilirubin levels. A mother with Rh incompatibility should be given Rhogam.'  When severe jaundice goes untreated for too long, it can cause brain damage and a condition called kernicterus. Early diagnosis and treatment of jaundice can prevent kernicterus. If you're concerned that your baby might have jaundice visit your baby's doctor right away. Ask for a jaundice bilirubin test."
What to do before leaving the hospital,"'Some babies with jaundice might look yellow or even orange, but it is not possible to see jaundice in all babies, especially those with darker skin color.

The timing of the follow-up visit will depend on how old your baby is when you leave the birth hospital and on any other risk factors. Babies with jaundice in the first 24 hours of life or with high bilirubin levels before hospital discharge should have an early follow-up plan. ""'''T''reat jaundice seriously.' "
What do I do if my baby has jaundice?,"'It is important to take jaundice seriously and stick to the follow-up plan for appointments and recommended care.''Your baby might be put under special blue lights (phototherapy) to lower the bilirubin level.

What is diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe and life-threatening complication of ''diabetes''. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when the cells in our body do not receive the ''sugar'' (glucose) they need for energy. This happens while there is plenty of glucose in the bloodstream, but not enough insulin to help convert glucose for use in the cells. The body recognizes this and starts breaking down muscle and fat for energy. This breakdown produces ketones (also called fatty acids), which cause an imbalance in our ''electrolyte'' system leading to the ketoacidosis (a metabolic acidosis). The sugar that cannot be used because of the lack of insulin stays in the bloodstream (rather than going into the cell and provide energy). The kidneys filter some of the glucose (sugar) and excrete it in the urine.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Typical signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:'   Dry skin and mouth Abdominal Pain Decreased level of consciousness (anything from drowsiness and confusion to unconsciousness) Frequent urination Fruity smelling breath Shortness of breath Deep, rapid breathing (sometimes referred to as Kussmaul breathing) Nausea and vomiting Dehydration"
What causes diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'In general diabetic ketoacidosis occurs because there is not enough insulin to move sugar (glucose) into the cell where it can be used for energy. Besides lack of insulin, certain body stressors combined with ''diabetes'', such as infection or illness, can trigger diabetic ketoacidosis.''Sometimes diabetic ketoacidosis is the first sign of ''diabetes'' in people who are not aware they have ''diabetes''. (They have not previously diagnosed with ''diabetes''.)' "
Who is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'People with ''type 1 diabetes'' who are not taking their insulin or are getting ill with an infection or other disease are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis.''Usually it occurs in people who have ''type 1 diabetes'' that are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. Although it is rare in people with ''type 2 diabetes'', it can occur.' "
What are the complications of diabetic ketoacidosis?,'Because many people who develop into diabetic ketoacidosis have multiple underlying illnesses (besides ''diabetes'') diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to significant complications and death. ''Cardiac arrest'' and ''kidney failure'' are all known complications.''The lifesaving treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis also can lead to the following complications:'  Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Cerebral Edema (swelling of brain) Low potassium (hypokalemia).
How is diabetic ketoacidosis diagnosed?,"""Diabetic ketoacidosis is diagnosed using blood and urine tests, patient history, and physical exam. The typical signs and symptoms along with a history might suggest the diagnosis. A combination of elevated blood glucose level, ketones detected in the blood or urine and a lower than normal pH level of the blood (indicating acidosis) usually establish the diagnosis. Other blood tests also are ordered to assess the patient's overall status, for example, to check the patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium.""""Upon physical exam the patient's pulse rate is often elevated and the ""'blood pressure'' lower than normal. The patient may be confused and often will be dehydrated.''If your doctor thinks an infection is present, other tests might be added (''chest X-ray'', blood cultures).' "
What are the treatment guidelines for diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Diabetic ketoacidosis needs to be treated with several approaches at the same time. The aim is to normalize blood pH, while slowly lowering blood sugar levels, and normalizing all of the ''electrolytes''. This usually accomplished by giving insulin to the patient as well as electrolyte fluids (such as Normal Saline).''Diabetic ketoacidosis can cause abnormal electrolyte (especially potassium) levels requiring close monitoring of those levels and usually replacing deficient ''electrolytes''. One of the complications of the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is a severe fluctuation in potassium levels.''To reverse ''dehydration'' IV fluids are given to the patient to replace the fluid loss. The composition of the IV fluids and speed with which it is infused are important aspects of the care of the patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.'""Any underlying illness that may have caused the patient's diabetic ketoacidosis also will be treated such as:""""Supportive care such as oxygen and the patient's usual medications will often be added.""  Infections Heart attack Other stressors"
How can diabetic ketoacidosis be prevented?," If you have diabetes take all of your medications as prescribed by your health-care professional. Learn to recognize the symptoms of elevated blood glucose levels. Don't skip insulin doses (an important factor in prevention). Test your glucose levels regularly as recommended by your doctor. Test your urine at home, especially when you feel ill. This will help detect ketones or elevated sugar in the blood, which should alert you to the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis. Make an appointment with your health-care professional when you feel sick or if your sugar or ketone levels are higher than normal to prevent further worsening or development of diabetic ketoacidosis."
Can you die from diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Diabetic ketoacidosis has a high mortality (death rate) and risk of complications. The prognosis depends on how quickly it is recognized, the underlying medical conditions of the individual, and the underlying precipitating causes of the diabetic ketoacidosis.' "
Which type of doctors treat diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis usually needs to be treated at the hospital. The person will receive treatment at first by an ''emergency medicine'"" specialist and once admitted to the hospital by an internist, family medicine specialist or intensivist. Endocrinologists are physicians specializing in the endocrine system and diabetes, and often will be involved in the patient's medical care."" "

	hyperactivity, and hallucinations. There are reports of Khat-induced psychosis."
Who uses Khat? ,"  The use of Khat is an established cultural tradition 
for many social situations in the areas of primary cultivation: East Africa and 
the Arabian Peninsula.  Several million people may currently be using Khat 
worldwide.  The largest concentrations of users are in the regions surrounding 
the Middle East. "
How does Khat get to the United States?," Khat, while illegal in the United 
States, is legal in much of Europe, East Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula.  Individuals of East African and Middle Eastern descent are mot often responsible 
for the importation, distribution, possession, and use of Khat in the United 
	States.  Khat is usually shipped already packaged in bundles, and wrapped in plastic bags 
	or banana leaves to retain moisture and freshness.  Khat is 
generally smuggled in passenger luggage, overnight express mail, or shipped as 
air cargo and falsely labeled as ""vegetables."" "
How much does Khat cost? ," Exactly prices are not known, but Khat is a 
relatively costly drug."
What are the kidneys?,'Your kidneys are a pair of organs in your abdomen. Each kidney is about the size of a fist.''Your kidneys are part of the urinary tract. They make urine by removing wastes and extra water from your blood.''Urine collects in a hollow space (renal pelvis) in the middle of each kidney. Urine passes from your renal pelvis into your bladder through a long tube called a ureter. Urine leaves your bladder through a shorter tube (the urethra).''Your kidneys also make substances to help control ''blood pressure'' and to make ''red blood cells''.''Attached to the top of each kidney is an adrenal gland. A layer of fatty tissue and an outer layer of fibrous tissue surround the kidney and adrenal gland.' 
What is cancer?,"'Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the kidneys and the other organs of the body.''Normal cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.'""Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor.""'Tumors in the kidney can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign tumors are not as harmful as malignant tumors:''Kidney cancer cells can spread by breaking away from the kidney tumor. They can travel through lymph vessels to nearby ''lymph nodes''. They can also spread through blood vessels to the ''lungs'', bones, or ''liver''. After spreading, kidney cancer cells may attach to other tissues and grow to form new tumors that may damage those tissues.' Benign tumors (such as cysts):are usually not a threat to lifecan be treated or removed and usually don't grow backdon't invade the tissues around themdon't spread to other parts of the body are usually not a threat to life can be treated or removed and usually don't grow back don't invade the tissues around them don't spread to other parts of the body Malignant growths:may be a threat to lifeusually can be removed but can grow backcan invade and damage nearby tissues and organscan spread to other parts of the body may be a threat to life usually can be removed but can grow back can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs can spread to other parts of the body"
What are kidney cancer causes and risk factors?,"""When you get a diagnosis of kidney cancer, it's natural to wonder what may have caused the disease. Doctors usually can't explain why one person gets kidney cancer and another doesn't.""'However, we do know that people with certain risk factors may be more likely than others to develop kidney cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.''Studies have found the following risk factors for kidney cancer:'""Many people who get kidney cancer have none of these risk factors, and many people who have known risk factors don't develop the disease."" Smoking: Smoking tobacco is an important risk factor for kidney cancer. People who smoke have a higher risk than nonsmokers. The risk is higher for those who smoke more cigarettes or for a long time. Obesity: Being obese increases the risk of kidney cancer. High blood pressure: Having high blood pressure may increase the risk of kidney cancer. Family history of kidney cancer: People with a family member who had kidney cancer have a slightly increased risk of the disease. Also, certain conditions that run in families can increase the risk of kidney cancer.Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome: VHL is a rare disease that runs in some families. It's caused by changes in the VHL gene. People with a changed VHL gene have an increased risk of kidney cancer. They may also have cysts or tumors in the eyes, brain, or other parts of the body. Family members of those with VHL can have a test to check for a changed VHL gene. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome: VHL is a rare disease that runs in some families. It's caused by changes in the VHL gene. People with a changed VHL gene have an increased risk of kidney cancer. They may also have cysts or tumors in the eyes, brain, or other parts of the body. Family members of those with VHL can have a test to check for a changed VHL gene."
What are kidney cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Common symptoms of kidney cancer include:''These symptoms may be caused by kidney cancer or by other health problems, such as an infection or a kidney ''cyst''. People with these symptoms should tell their doctor so that any problem can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.'   Blood in the urine (making the urine slightly rusty to deep red) Pain in your side that doesn't go away A lump or mass in the side or the abdomen Weight loss for no known reason Fever Feeling very tired"
How is kidney cancer diagnosed?,"""If you have symptoms that suggest kidney cancer, your doctor will try to find out what's causing the problems.""'You may have a physical exam. Also, you may have one or more of the following tests:'   Urine tests: The lab checks your urine for blood and other signs of disease. Blood tests: The lab checks your blood for several substances, such as creatinine. A high level of creatinine may mean the kidneys aren't doing their job. Ultrasound: An ultrasound device uses sound waves that can't be heard by humans. The sound waves make a pattern of echoes as they bounce off organs inside your abdomen. The echoes create a picture of your kidney and nearby tissues. The picture can show a kidney tumor. CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your abdomen. You may receive an injection of contrast material so your urinary tract and lymph nodes show up clearly in the pictures. The CT scan can show cancer in the kidneys, lymph nodes, or elsewhere in the abdomen. MRI: A large machine with a strong magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of your urinary tract and lymph nodes. You may receive an injection of contrast material. MRI can show cancer in your kidneys, lymph nodes, or other tissues in the abdomen. IVP: You'll receive an injection of dye into a vein in your arm. The dye travels through the body and collects in your kidneys. The dye makes them show up on x-rays. A series of x-rays then tracks the dye as it moves through your kidneys to your ureters and bladder. The x-rays can show a kidney tumor or other problems. (IVP is not used as commonly as CT or MRI for the detection of kidney cancer.) Biopsy: The removal of tissue to look for cancer cells is a biopsy. In some cases, your doctor will do a biopsy to diagnose kidney cancer. Your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin into the kidney to remove a small sample of tissue. Your doctor may use ultrasound or a CT scan to guide the needle. A pathologist uses a microscope to check for cancer cells in the tissue. Surgery: After surgery to remove part or all of a kidney tumor, a pathologist can make the final diagnosis by checking the tissue under a microscope for cancer cells."
How is kidney cancer staging determined?,"'If kidney cancer is diagnosed, your doctor needs to learn the extent (stage) of the disease to help you choose the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the kidney tumor and whether the cancer has invaded nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body.''Your doctor may order one or more tests:''When cancer spreads from its original place to another part of the body, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells and the same name as the primary (original) tumor. For example, if kidney cancer spreads to a lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually kidney cancer cells. The disease is metastatic kidney cancer, not ''lung cancer'"". It's treated as kidney cancer, not as ""'lung cancer''. Doctors sometimes call the new tumor “distant” disease.''These are the stages of kidney cancer:''Common treatment options for people with kidney cancer are surgery, targeted therapy, and biological therapy. You may receive more than one type of treatment.'""The treatment that's right for you depends mainly on the following:""'You may have a team of specialists to help plan your treatment. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral.''You may want to see a ''urologist'', a surgeon who specializes in treating problems of the urinary tract. Other specialists who treat kidney cancer include urologic oncologists (surgeons who specialize in cancers of the urinary tract), medical oncologists, and ''radiation'' oncologists. Your health care team may also include an ''oncology'' nurse and a registered dietitian.''Your health care team can describe your treatment choices, the expected results of each, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs.'""At any stage of disease, supportive care is available to control pain and other symptoms, to relieve the side effects of treatment, and to ease emotional concerns. Information about such care is available on NCI's Web site at http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping. For example, some people with kidney cancer may need to have radiation therapy to relieve pain or certain other problems. Radiation therapy uses highenergy rays to kill cancer cells.""'You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial. ''Clinical trials'' are research studies testing new treatments. They are an important option for people with all stages of kidney cancer.''You may want to ask your doctor these questions before you begin treatment:'   Blood tests: Your doctor can check for substances in your blood. Some people with kidney cancer have high levels of calcium or LDH. A blood test can also show how well your liver is working. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the chest can show a tumor in your lung. CT scan: CT scans of your chest and abdomen can show cancer in your lymph nodes, lungs, or elsewhere. MRI: MRI can show cancer in your blood vessels, lymph nodes, or other tissues in the abdomen. Stage I: The tumor is no bigger than a tennis ball (almost 3 inches or about 7 centimeters). Cancer cells are found only in the kidney. Stage II: The tumor is bigger than a tennis ball. But cancer cells are found only in the kidney. Stage III: The tumor can be any size. It has spread to at least one nearby lymph node. Or it has grown through the kidney to reach nearby blood vessels. Stage IV: The tumor has grown through the layer of fatty tissue and the outer layer of fibrous tissue that surrounds the kidney. Or cancer cells have spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the lungs, liver, bones, or other tissues. The size of the tumor Whether the tumor has invaded tissues outside the kidney Whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body Your age and general health How large is the tumor? What is the stage of the disease? Has the tumor grown outside the kidney or spread to other organs? What are my treatment choices? Which do you suggest for me? Why? What are the expected benefits of each kind of treatment? What can I do to prepare for treatment? Will I need to stay in the hospital? If so, for how long? What are the risks and possible side effects of each treatment? How can side effects be managed? What is the treatment likely to cost? Will my insurance cover it? How will treatment affect my normal activities? Would a research study (clinical trial) be a good choice for me? Can you recommend a doctor who could give me a second opinion about my treatment options? How often should I have checkups?"
What are kidney cancer treatments?,"'Surgery is the most common treatment for people with kidney cancer. The type of surgery depends on the size and stage of the cancer, whether you have two kidneys, and whether cancer was found in both kidneys.''You and your surgeon can talk about the types of surgery and which may be right for you:'""There are two approaches for removing the kidney. The surgeon may remove the tumor by making a large incision into your body (open surgery). Or the surgeon may remove the tumor by making small incisions (laparoscopic surgery). The surgeon sees inside your abdomen with a thin, lighted tube (a laparoscope) placed inside a small incision. Sometimes a robot is used. The surgeon uses handles below a computer display to control the robot's arms.""""The surgeon may use other methods of destroying the cancer in the kidney. For people who have a tumor smaller than 4 centimeters and who can't have surgery to remove part of the kidney because of other health problems, the surgeon may suggest:""""It takes time to heal after surgery, and the time needed to recover is different for each person. It's common to feel weak or tired for a while.""'Also, you may have pain or discomfort for the first few days. Medicine can help control your pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your doctor or nurse. After surgery, your doctor can adjust the plan if you need more pain control.''Your health care team will watch you for signs of bleeding, infection, or other problems. They will keep track of how much fluid you take in and how much urine passes out of your body.'""If one kidney is removed, the remaining kidney is usually able to do the work of both kidneys. However, if your remaining kidney isn't doing a good job cleaning your blood, you may need dialysis. Some people may need a transplant with a healthy kidney from a donor.""'You may want to ask your doctor these questions before having surgery:' Removing all of the kidney (radical nephrectomy): The surgeon removes the entire kidney along with the adrenal gland and some tissue around the kidney. Some lymph nodes in the area may also be removed. Removing part of the kidney (partial nephrectomy): The surgeon removes only the part of the kidney that contains the tumor. People with a kidney tumor that is smaller than a tennis ball may choose this type of surgery. Cryosurgery: The surgeon inserts a tool through a small incision or directly through the skin into the tumor. The tool freezes and kills the kidney tumor. Radiofrequency ablation: The surgeon inserts a special probe directly through the skin or through a small incision into the tumor. The probe contains tiny electrodes that kill the kidney cancer cells with heat. What type of surgery do you suggest for me? Do you recommend surgery that is through a large incision? Or through small incisions with a laparoscope? Do you recommend surgery with a robot? Will lymph nodes and other tissues be removed? Why? How will I feel after surgery? If I have pain, how can it be controlled? How long will I be in the hospital? When will I be able to return to normal activities? What are the long-term effects of the surgery? Will I need dialysis?"
Targeted Therapy,"'People with kidney cancer that has spread may receive a type of drug called targeted therapy. Many kinds of targeted therapy are used for kidney cancer. This treatment may shrink a kidney tumor or slow its growth.''Usually, the targeted therapy is taken by mouth. You may feel very tired while taking targeted therapy for kidney cancer. Other side effects may include ''diarrhea'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', sores on the lips or in the mouth, and ''high blood pressure''.' "
Biological Therapy,"""People with kidney cancer that has spread may receive biological therapy. Biological therapy for kidney cancer is a treatment that may improve the body's natural defense (the immune system response) against cancer. The treatments used for kidney cancer can slow the growth of tumors or shrink them. The biological therapy is injected intravenously or under the skin. The treatment may be given at the hospital or a doctor's office.""'Other ''drugs'' may be given at the same time to prevent side effects. The side effects differ with the biological therapy used, and from person to person. Biological therapy commonly causes a ''rash'' or swelling. You may feel very tired during treatment. The treatment may also cause a ''headache'', muscle aches, a fever, or weakness.''You may want to ask your doctor these questions about targeted therapy or biological therapy:' Why do I need this treatment? Which drug or drugs will I receive? How do the drugs work? When will treatment start? When will it end? How will I feel during treatment? What are the side effects? Are there any lasting side effects? What can I do about them?"
Second Opinion,"'Before starting treatment, you may want a second opinion about your diagnosis, stage of cancer, and treatment plan. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.'""If you get a second opinion, the second doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at all of your options.""""It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In most cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually will not make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor.""'There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.'  "
Nutrition,"""It's important for you to take very good care of yourself before, during, and after cancer treatment. Taking care of yourself includes eating well so that you get the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.""""Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of some treatments (such as poor appetite, nausea, or vomiting) can make it hard to eat well.""'Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to help you meet your ''nutrition'' needs.' "
Follow-up Care,"""You'll need regular checkups (such as every 6 months) after treatment for kidney cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed.""'Kidney cancer may come back after treatment. Your doctor will check for return of cancer. Checkups may include blood tests, a chest x-ray, CT scans, or an ultrasound.'  "
Sources of Support,"""Learning that you have kidney cancer can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that a diagnosis of cancer can bring.""'Concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills are common. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities.'""Here's where you can go for support:"" Doctors, nurses, and other members of your health care team can answer questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Social workers, counselors, or members of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or concerns. Often, social workers can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support. Support groups also can help. In these groups, patients or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with cancer and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group."
Taking Part in Cancer Research,"'Doctors all over the world are conducting many types of clinical trials (research studies in which people volunteer to take part). Clinical trials are designed to find out whether new treatments are safe and effective.''Even if the people in a trial do not benefit directly from a treatment, they may still make an important contribution by helping doctors learn more about kidney cancer and how to control it. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, doctors do all they can to protect their patients.'""Doctors are studying new targeted therapies and drug combinations for kidney cancer. If you're interested in being part of a clinical trial, talk with your doctor."" "
What is PKD?,"'Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic disorder that causes many fluid-filled cysts to grow in your kidneys. Unlike the usually harmless simple kidney cysts that can form in the kidneys later in life, PKD cysts can change the shape of your kidneys, including making them much larger.''PKD is a form of chronic kidney disease (CKD) that reduces kidney function and may lead to kidney failure. PKD also can cause other complications, or problems, such as high blood pressure, cysts in the liver, and problems with blood vessels in your brain and heart.'  "
"What are the causes, symptoms, and types of PKD?","'A gene mutation, or defect, causes PKD. In most PKD cases, a child got the gene mutation from a parent. In a small number of PKD cases, the gene mutation developed on its own, without either parent carrying a copy of the mutated gene. This type of mutation is called “spontaneous.” Read more about genes and genetic conditions.''Two of the common types of PDK are autosomal dominant PDK (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive PK (ARPKD)' The signs and symptoms of and complications of ADPKD include pain,high blood pressure, andkidney failure, pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure, PKD does not cause signs or symptoms until your kidney cysts are a half inch or larger in size. Early signs of ARPKD in the womb are larger-than-normal kidneys and a smaller-than-average size baby, a condition called growth failure. The early signs of ARPKD are also complications. Some people with ARPKD do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood or even adulthood. autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), which is usually diagnosed in adulthood autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD), which can be diagnosed in the womb or shortly after a baby is born"
What is autosomal dominant PKD and its symptoms and signs?,"   Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common form of PKD. ADPKD affects 1 in every 400 to 1,000 people and is the most common kidney disorder passed down through family members. Healthcare providers usually diagnose ADPKD between the ages of 30 and 50, when signs and symptoms start to appear, which is why it is sometimes called “adult PKD.” ""Autosomal dominant"" means you can get the PKD gene mutation, or defect, from only one parent. Researchers have found two different gene mutations that cause ADPKD. Most people with ADPKD have defects in the PKD1 gene, and 1 out of 6 or 1 out of 7 people with ADPKD have a defective PKD2 gene. Healthcare providers can diagnose people with PKD1 sooner because their symptoms appear sooner. People with PKD1 also usually progress more quickly to kidney failure than people with PKD2. How quickly ADPKD progresses also differs from person to person. In many cases, ADPKD doesn’t cause signs or symptoms until cysts are a half inch or larger in size. For this reason, you should meet with a healthcare provider if you are at risk for PKD before your symptoms start. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) The most common symptoms are pain in the back and sides, between the ribs and hips, and headaches. The pain can be short term or ongoing, mild or severe. Hematuria, or blood in the urine, may be a sign of ADPKD. If you have symptoms or signs of hematuria, see a healthcare provider right away.

What are common and other complications of ADPKD?,"'Most people with ADPKD have pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure at some point in their lives. Common and other complications of ADPKD\xa0include:''Pain.'' Pain is a common complication of ADPKD and is usually due to kidney or liver cysts. Pain also can be caused by''High blood pressure.'' Almost all people with ADPKD who have kidney failure have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases your chances of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys even more. Keep your blood pressure under control to help delay kidney damage.''Kidney failure.\xa0''Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to stay healthy. Untreated kidney failure can lead to ''coma'' and death. More than half of people with ADPKD progress to kidney failure by age 70.''Kidney cancer''.'' ADPKD complications, or problems, can affect many systems in your body besides your kidneys. Researchers have not found a link between PKD and kidney ''cancer''.''Abnormal heart valves.'' Abnormal heart valves can occur in some people with ADPKD. Abnormal heart valves can cause too little blood to flow into the ''aorta'', the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of your body. Abnormal heart valves in people with ADPKD rarely need to be replaced. However, you may need more tests if your healthcare provider detects a ''heart murmur''.''Brain aneurysms. ''An ''aneurysm'' is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Aneurysms in the brain might cause ''headaches'' that are severe or feel different from other headaches. See a healthcare provider even before you take ''over-the-counter'' pain medicines for severe headaches or headaches that won’t go away.''Brain aneurysms can break open and cause bleeding inside the skull. Large brain aneurysms are life threatening and need immediate medical treatment. If you have an ''aneurysm'', stop ''smoking'' and control your blood pressure and ''lipids''.''Liver cysts.'' Liver cysts, which are fluid-filled cysts on the liver, are the most common nonkidney complication of ADPKD. Liver cysts don’t usually cause symptoms in people under age 30, because liver cysts are normally small and few in number in the early stages of ADPKD. In rare cases, liver cysts can eventually reduce ''liver function''. In the most severe cases, you may need a liver transplant.''Because the hormone estrogen may affect ''liver cyst'' growth, women are more likely to have liver cysts than men. The more ''pregnancies'' a woman with ADPKD has had, the more likely she will have liver cysts.''Pancreatic cysts.'' PKD can also cause cysts in your pancreas. Pancreatic cysts rarely cause ''pancreatitis'', which is inflammation, or swelling, of the pancreas.''Diverticula. ''Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that push through weak spots in your colon wall. Diverticula can cause ''diverticulosis''. ''Diverticulosis'' can cause changes in your bowel movement patterns or pain in your abdomen.''Urinary tract infections'' (UTIs).'' Kidney cysts can block urine flow through the kidneys so that urine stays in your urinary tract too long. When urine stays in your urinary tract too long, bacteria in your urine can cause a ''bladder infection'' or a ''kidney infection''. A kidney infection can cause further damage to your kidneys by causing cysts to become infected.''Kidney stones.'' People with ADPKD sometimes have kidney stones. Kidney stones can block urine flow and cause infection and pain.''Although most women with PKD have normal pregnancies, women with PKD who have high blood pressure and decreased kidney function are more likely to have ''preeclampsia'', or high blood pressure during ''pregnancy''.''With ''preeclampsia'', the fetus gets less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Women with preeclampsia should be followed closely by their health care provider during and after pregnancy. After delivery, preeclampsia goes away.''Many men with ADPKD have cysts on their seminal vesicles, which are glands in the male reproductive system that help produce semen. Seminal vesicle cysts rarely cause ''infertility''.''People with PKD who are considering having children may want to discuss ''family planning'' concerns with a genetics counselor.' kidney cyst infection, bleeding or burst kidney cysts, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and high blood pressure. You may see some ADPKD complications right away. Other complications may not appear for many years, depending on whether you have the PKD1 or PKD2 gene. ADPKD complications can vary from person to person, so you may not have all of these problems."
What procedures and tests diagnose PDK?,"'Health care providers diagnose ADPKD using imaging tests and genetic testing. A healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on these tests and your age, family history of PKD, and how many cysts you have.\xa0The sooner a healthcare provider can diagnose ADPKD, the better your chances of delaying complications.''A specially trained technician performs imaging tests in a healthcare provider’s office, an outpatient center, or a hospital.\xa0 A radiologist reads the images.\xa0 Adults usually don’t need anesthesia for these tests. However, a healthcare\xa0provider may give infants or children a sedative to help them fall asleep during the test.''Ultrasound. ''Ultrasound uses a device called a transducer that bounces safe, painless sound waves off your organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of your entire urinary tract or focus specifically on the kidneys. The images can show cysts in the kidneys.''Computed tomography (CT) scans. ''CT scans'' use a combination of ''x-rays'' and computer technology to create images of your urinary tract. For a ''CT scan'' of your urinary tract, a health care provider may give you an injection of contrast medium. Contrast medium is a dye or other substance that makes structures inside your body easier to see during imaging tests. You lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that takes the x-rays. CT scans can show more detailed images of kidney cysts than ultrasound.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI). ''MRI machines use radio waves and magnets to produce detailed pictures of your body’s internal organs and soft tissues without using x-rays. An MRI may include an injection of contrast medium. With most MRI machines, you lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine that may be open on each end or closed at one end. Some newer machines allow you to lie in a more open space. Health care providers use ''MRIs'' to measure kidney and cyst size and monitor kidney and cyst growth. Measuring kidney and cyst size and growth can help track the progress of PKD.' "
How are the most common complications of ADPKD treated?,"'Although a cure doesn’t exist yet for ADPKD, treatment can help reduce your complications, which can help you live longer.''A health care provider needs to find the source of your pain before he or she can treat it. For example, if growing cysts are causing pain, the health care provider may first suggest over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines such as ''aspirin'' or ''acetaminophen''.''Always talk with a health care provider before taking any OTC medicines because some may be harmful to your kidneys. People with ADPKD have a higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI), which is the sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. Sometimes AKI is caused by using OTC painkillers for a long time.''Depending on the size and number of cysts and whether medicine helps your pain, a health care provider may suggest surgery. Surgery to shrink cysts can help pain in your back and sides for a while. However, surgery does not slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure.''Controlling your blood pressure can slow the effects of ADPKD. Lifestyle changes and medicines can lower high blood pressure. Sometimes you can control blood pressure with healthy eating and regular physical activity alone.''Some health care providers will recommend blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs'').''ADPKD can eventually cause your kidneys to fail. People with kidney failure must have dialysis or a kidney transplant to replace their kidney function.''The two forms of dialysis are ''hemodialysis'' and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to circulate your blood through a filter outside the body. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen to filter the blood inside the body.''A kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney from a donor into your body.' "
What is autosomal recessive ARPKD?,"'Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects 1 in 20,000 children. A fetus or baby with ARPKD has fluid-filled kidney cysts that may make the kidneys too big, or enlarged. ARPKD can cause a child to have poor kidney function, even in the womb. ARPKD is sometimes called “infantile PKD” because health care providers can diagnose it so early in life.''Poor kidney function can cause breathing problems that can threaten the life of a fetus or baby. About 30 percent of newborns with ARPKD die within their first week of life. A baby with ARPKD who survives birth and the first few weeks of life has a good chance of surviving into adulthood. However, children or young adults with ARPKD will likely need medical treatment their whole life.''""Autosomal recessive"" means that for a child to have this disorder, both parents must have and pass along the gene mutation. If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will not get the disorder, although the child may get the gene mutation. The child is a “carrier” of the disorder and can pass the gene mutation to the next generation.''How quickly ARPKD progresses to kidney failure is different for each child. The sooner a fetus is diagnosed in the womb, the better the child’s outlook. Getting good ''prenatal care'' is important for increasing a child’s survival rate. Working with a health care team as soon as possible can help parents manage their child’s PKD.' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of ARPKD?,"'The early signs of ARPKD often appear during the first few months of life and in the womb. Early signs of ARPKD in the womb can cause serious health problems. For this reason, it is important for a woman who is at risk for passing PKD to her children to get ''prenatal'' care as soon as she learns she is ''pregnant''.''Enlarged kidney.'' An early sign of ARPKD is an enlarged kidney. Enlarged kidneys put pressure on a fetus’ or child’s lungs, which can make lung growth and breathing harder. A health care provider can see enlarged kidneys in a fetus or an infant using ultrasound imaging, also called a ''sonogram''.''Growth failure. ''Due to decreased kidney and lung function, children with ARPKD are usually smaller-than-average size, a condition called growth failure.''Low levels of amniotic fluid. ''Decreased kidney function can cause low levels of amniotic fluid in a mother’s womb. Low levels of amniotic fluid can cause breathing problems in the fetus.''Some people with ARPKD do not develop signs or symptoms until later in childhood, or even adulthood.' "
How are the common complications of ARPKD diagnosed and treated?,"'Health care providers diagnose ARPKD with ultrasound imaging. The test can show enlarged kidneys and liver scarring.''Working with a health care team as soon as possible can help manage these complications.''Breathing problems in infants''Liver problems''High blood pressure in children'   Most people with ADPKD have pain, high blood pressure, and kidney failure at some point in their lives. Pain is a common complication of ADPKD and is usually due to kidney or liver cysts. Pain also can be caused bykidney cyst infection,bleeding or burst kidney cysts,urinary tract infection,kidney stones,tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and high blood pressure. kidney cyst infection, bleeding or burst kidney cysts, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, tissue stretching around the kidney due to cyst growth, and  high blood pressure. Almost all people with ADPKD who have kidney failure have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases your chances of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also damage your kidneys even more. Keep your blood pressure under control to help delay kidney damage. Kidney failure means your kidneys no longer work well enough to stay healthy. Untreated kidney failure can lead to coma and death. More than half of people with ADPKD progress to kidney failure by age 70. Children with ARPKD who survive birth often have kidney and liver problems that can affect their breathing. Children born with ARPKD often develop kidney failure before reaching adulthood. Babies with the most severe cases of ARPKD often die hours or days after birth because they cannot breathe well enough to live. Their lungs do not develop as they should in the womb. Liver scarring occurs in all cases of ARPKD and is usually present at birth. Liver scarring can lead to decreased liver function and other liver problems. However, liver problems from ARPKD tend to become more of a concern over time.  Most children with ARPKD have high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases a child’s chances of heart disease and stroke. High blood pressure can also further damage a child’s kidneys."
How are other complications of ARPKD diagnosed and treated?,"'Healthcare providers diagnose ARPKD with ultrasound imaging. The test can show enlarged kidneys and liver scarring.''Enlarged kidney. ''Kidney enlargement cannot be prevented or reversed. One or both kidneys may need to be removed if their size makes breathing impossible. Children who don’t have working kidneys will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.''Growth failure.'' A health care provider may treat growth failure with nutritional therapy . In severe cases of growth failure, a health care provider and a child’s parents may consider treatment with human growth hormone. Human growth hormone is a prescribed, man-made hormone that can help children grow.''Breathing problems.'' Health care providers treat infants with breathing problems with artificial ventilation, which allows them to breathe with the help of a machine.''Kidney failure. ''Peritoneal dialysis is the preferred method of treating children with kidney failure, although health care providers also use hemodialysis. Kidney transplants may be a limited option for infants because of their size.''Liver problems. ''If serious ''liver disease'' develops, some children may need to have a combined liver and kidney transplant.''High blood pressure.'' A health care provider can help control blood pressure with medicines. Treating high blood pressure can help delay kidney failure.' "
Can diet and lifestyle changes slow the progression of PKD?,"'Your healthcare provider will use lab tests to watch your levels of these ''minerals''.''If lifestyle and diet changes don’t help control your blood pressure, a health care provider may prescribe one or more blood pressure medicines. Two types of blood pressure medicines, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may slow kidney disease and delay kidney failure. The names of these medicines end in –pril or –sartan.''If you have any kind of chronic kidney disease, including polycystic kidney disease (PKD), talk with a dietitian about which foods to include in your diet and which foods might be harmful. Find a dietitian who specializes in helping people with kidney disease to help you choose the right foods and plan healthy meals.' The sooner you know you or your child has PKD, the sooner you can keep the condition from getting worse. Getting tested if you or your child are at risk for PKD can help you take early action.  PKD may require diet changes to help lower your blood pressure by limiting how much sodium (salt) you eat. Staying hydrated by drinking the right amount of fluid may help slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure. Eating high-quality protein and smaller portions of protein also can help protect the kidneys. As your kidneys become more damaged, you may need to eat foods lower in phosphorus and potassium. You may need to change what you eat and drink to help control your blood pressure and protect your kidneys. People with any kind of kidney disease, including PKD, should talk with a dietitian about which foods and drinks to include in their healthy eating plan and which may be harmful. Staying hydrated by drinking the right amount of fluid may help slow PKD’s progress toward kidney failure. Be active for 30 minutes or more on most days. Regular physical activity can help you reduce stress, manage your weight, and control your blood pressure. If you are not active now, ask your health care provider about how much and what type of physical activity is right for you. If you play contact sports, such as football or hockey, a healthcare provider should do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test to see whether these sports are safe for you. Trauma to your body, especially to your back and sides, may cause kidney cysts to burst. Lose weight. Being overweight makes your kidneys work harder. Losing weight helps protect your kidneys. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Getting enough sleep is important to your overall physical and mental health and can help you manage your blood pressure and blood glucose, or blood sugar. Reduce stress. Long-term stress can raise your blood pressure and even lead to depression. Some of the steps you take to manage your PKD are also healthy ways to cope with stress. For example, getting enough physical activity and sleep helps reduce stress. Quit smoking. Cigarette smoking can raise your blood pressure, making your kidney damage worse. Quitting smoking may help you meet your blood pressure goals, which is good for your kidneys and can lower your chances of having a heart attack or stroke. Quitting smoking is even more important for people with PKD who have aneurysms. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. Take blood pressure medications."
How does ADPKD affect your day-to-day life?,"'Managing PKD successfully will probably include several lifestyle changes, such as changes in your physical activity level and what you eat. Visiting with a health care team on a regular basis is an important part of your routine as you work to limit your kidney problems.''PKD is a costly disease to manage and treat, especially if health insurance doesn’t cover some or any of your costs. Financial help may be available from the Federal Government and other sources. Visit the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website or talk with your health care team for more information.''Many people with PKD may find it hard, but not impossible, to get life insurance. Contact an insurance company that specializes in “impaired risk life insurance.”' "
Can you prevent PKD?,"'Researchers have not yet found a way to prevent PKD. However, you may be able to slow PKD problems caused by high blood pressure, such as kidney damage. Aim for a blood pressure goal of less than 120/80. Work with a health care team to help manage your or your child’s PKD. The health care team will probably include a general practitioner and a nephrologist, a health care provider specializing in kidney health.' "
What is genetic testing?,"'Your healthcare provider may refer you to a geneticist if you are at risk for ADPKD. A geneticist is an expert in genes and diseases that are passed down through families. You will provide the geneticist with a blood or saliva sample, which will be tested in a special lab for the gene mutations that cause ADPKD. The genetic testing may take many days or weeks to complete.''A healthcare provider may also use genetic testing results to find out whether someone with a family history of PKD is likely to develop PKD in the future.' "
When should you consider genetic counseling?,"'If you are considering genetic testing, you and your family may want to talk with a genetics counselor as part of your health care team. Genetic counseling may be useful when you’re deciding whether to have genetic testing and again later when test results are available. Genetic counseling can help you and your family understand how test results may affect your lives.' "
Introduction to hemodialysis,"'Hemodialysis'' is the most common method used to treat advanced and permanent ''kidney failure''. Since the 1960s, when hemodialysis first became a practical treatment for ''kidney failure'"", we've learned much about how to make hemodialysis treatments more effective and minimize side effects. In recent years, more compact and simpler ""'dialysis'' machines have made home dialysis increasingly attractive. However, even with better procedures and equipment, hemodialysis is still a complicated and inconvenient therapy that requires a coordinated effort from your whole health care team, including your nephrologist, dialysis nurse, dialysis technician, dietitian, and social worker. The most important members of your health care team are you and your family. By learning about your treatment, you can work with your health care team to give yourself the best possible results, and you can lead a full, active life. ' "
When Your Kidneys Fail,"'Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, ''minerals'', and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail, harmful wastes build up in your body, your ''blood pressure'' may rise, and your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough ''red blood cells''. When this happens, you need treatment to replace the work of your failed kidneys. ' "
How Hemodialysis Works,"'In hemodialysis, your blood is allowed to flow, a few ounces at a time, through a special filter that removes wastes and extra fluids. The clean blood is then returned to your body. Removing the harmful wastes and extra salt and fluids helps control your blood pressure and keep the proper balance of chemicals like potassium and sodium in your body. ''One of the biggest adjustments you must make when you start hemodialysis treatments is following a strict schedule. Most patients go to a clinic-a dialysis center-three times a week for 3 to 5 or more hours each visit. For example, you may be on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule or a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule. You may be asked to choose a morning, afternoon, or evening shift, depending on availability and capacity at the dialysis unit. Your dialysis center will explain your options for scheduling regular treatments. ''Researchers are exploring whether shorter daily sessions, or longer sessions performed overnight while the patient sleeps, are more effective in removing wastes. Newer dialysis machines make these alternatives more practical with home dialysis. However, the federal government has not yet established a policy to pay for more than three hemodialysis sessions a week. ''Several centers around the country teach people how to perform their own hemodialysis treatments at home. A family member or friend who will be your helper must also take the training, which usually takes at least 4 to 6 weeks. Home dialysis gives you more flexibility in your dialysis schedule. With home hemodialysis, the time for each session and the number of sessions per week may vary, but you must maintain a regular schedule by giving yourself dialysis treatments as often as you would receive them in a dialysis unit. ' "
Adjusting to Changes,"'Even in the best situations, adjusting to the effects of kidney failure and the time you spend on dialysis can be difficult. Aside from the ""lost time,"" you may have less energy. You may need to make changes in your work or home life, giving up some activities and responsibilities. Keeping the same schedule you kept when your kidneys were working can be very difficult now that your kidneys have failed. Accepting this new reality can be very hard on you and your family. A counselor or social worker can answer your questions and help you cope. ''Many patients feel ''depressed'' when starting dialysis, or after several months of treatment. If you feel depressed, you should talk with your social worker, nurse, or doctor because this is a common problem that can often be treated effectively. ' "
Getting Your Vascular Access Ready,"'One important step before starting hemodialysis is preparing a vascular access, a site on your body from which your blood is removed and returned. A vascular access should be prepared weeks or months before you start dialysis. It will allow easier and more efficient removal and replacement of your blood with fewer complications. For more information about the different kinds of vascular accesses and how to care for them, see the National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) fact sheet ''Vascular Access for Hemodialysis''. ' "
Equipment and Procedures,"""When you first visit a hemodialysis center, it may seem like a complicated mix of machines and people. But once you learn how the procedure works and become familiar with the equipment, you'll be more comfortable. ""'The ''dialysis machine'' is about the size of a dishwasher. This machine has three main jobs: ''The dialyzer is a large canister containing thousands of small fibers through which your blood is passed. Dialysis solution, the cleansing fluid, is pumped around these fibers. The fibers allow wastes and extra fluids to pass from your blood into the solution, which carries them away. The dialyzer is sometimes called an artificial kidney. ''Dialysis solution, also known as dialysate, is the fluid in the dialyzer that helps remove wastes and extra fluid from your blood. It contains chemicals that make it act like a sponge. Your doctor will give you a specific dialysis solution for your treatments. This formula can be adjusted based on how well you handle the treatments and on your blood tests. '""Many people find the needle sticks to be one of the hardest parts of hemodialysis treatments. Most people, however, report getting used to them after a few sessions. If you find the needle insertion painful, an anesthetic cream or spray can be applied to the skin. The cream or spray will numb your skin briefly so you won't feel the needle. ""'Most dialysis centers use two needles-one to carry blood to the dialyzer and one to return the cleaned blood to your body. Some specialized needles are designed with two openings for two-way flow of blood, but these needles are less efficient and require longer sessions. Needles for high-flux or high-efficiency dialysis need to be a little larger than those used with regular dialyzers. ''Some people prefer to insert their own needles. You\'ll need training on inserting needles properly to prevent infection and protect your vascular access. You may also learn a ""ladder"" strategy for needle placement in which you ""climb"" up the entire length of the access session by session so that you don\'t weaken an area with a grouping of needle sticks. A different approach is the ""buttonhole"" strategy in which you use a limited number of sites but insert the needle back into the same hole made by the previous needle stick. Whether you insert your own needles or not, you should know these techniques to better care for your access. ' pump blood and watch flow for safety clean wastes from blood watch your blood pressure and the rate of fluid removal from your body Reuse. Your dialysis center may use the same dialyzer more than once for your treatments. Reuse is considered safe as long as the dialyzer is cleaned before each use. The dialyzer is tested each time to make sure it's still working, and it should never be used for anyone but you. Before each session, you should be sure that the dialyzer is labeled with your name and check to see that it has been cleaned, disinfected, and tested. "
Tests to See How Well Your Dialysis Is Working,"'About once a month, your dialysis care team will test your blood by using one of two formulas-URR or Kt/V-to see whether your treatments are removing enough wastes. Both tests look at one specific waste product, called blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as an indicator for the overall level of waste products in your system. For more information about these measurements, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Hemodialysis Dose and Adequacy''. ' "
Conditions Related to Kidney Failure and Their Treatments,"'Your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. They also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. When your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with ''anemia'' and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. Some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme ''tiredness'', bone problems, joint problems, ''itching'', and ""restless legs."" Restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping. ''Anemia'"" is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. Anemia can also contribute to ""'heart'' problems. ''Anemia is common in people with ''kidney disease'' because the kidneys produce the hormone ''erythropoietin'"", or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys often don't make enough EPO, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. EPO is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis. ""'For more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the NIDDK fact sheet''Anemia in Kidney Disease and Dialysis''. ''The term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. ''Renal osteodystrophy'', or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. It causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. Older patients and women who have gone through ''menopause'' are at greater risk for this disease. ''Many people treated with hemodialysis complain of ''itchy'' skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. ''Itching'"" is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood. ""'The problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. The four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. The parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. ''A cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. Phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. Still others improve with EPO shots. A few ''antihistamines'' (''Benadryl'', Atarax, ''Vistaril'') have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. In any case, taking care of ''dry skin'' is important. Applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help. ''Patients on dialysis often have ''insomnia'', and some people have a specific problem called the ''sleep apnea'' syndrome, which is often signaled by ''snoring'' and breaks in ''snoring''. Episodes of apnea are actually breaks in ''breathing'' during ''sleep''. Over time, these ''sleep'' disturbances can lead to ""day-night reversal"" (''insomnia'' at night, sleepiness during the day), ''headache'', ''depression'', and decreased alertness. The apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. Treatments that work with people who have ''sleep apnea'', whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive ''airway'' pressure, or ''CPAP'').''Many people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or ""restless"" legs. You may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. Kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. The causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances. ''Moderate ''exercise'' during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. People with ''restless leg syndrome'' should reduce or avoid ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. A class of ''drugs'' called ''benzodiazepines'', often used to treat ''insomnia'' or ''anxiety'', may help as well. These prescription drugs include ''Klonopin'', ''Librium'', ''Valium'', and ''Halcion''. A newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa (''Sinemet''), a drug used to treat '""Parkinson's""' disease. ''Sleep disorders'"" may seem unimportant, but they can impair your quality of life. Don't hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse, doctor, or social worker. ""'Dialysis-related ''amyloidosis'' (DRA) is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. DRA develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons, causing ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and fluid in the joints, as is the case with ''arthritis''. Working kidneys filter out these proteins, but dialysis filters are not as effective. ' "
How Diet Can Help,"""Eating the right foods can help improve your dialysis and your health. Your clinic has a dietitian to help you plan meals. Follow the dietitian's advice closely to get the most from your hemodialysis treatments. Here are a few general guidelines. ""'You can also ask your dietitian for ''recipes'' and titles of cookbooks for patients with kidney disease. Following the restrictions of a diet for kidney disease might be hard at first, but with a little creativity, you can make tasty and satisfying meals. For more information, see the NIDDK booklet''Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis''. '  Fluids. Your dietitian will help you determine how much fluid to drink each day. Extra fluid can raise your blood pressure, make your heart work harder, and increase the stress of dialysis treatments. Remember that many foods-such as soup, ice cream, and fruits-contain plenty of water. Ask your dietitian for tips on controlling your thirst.  Potassium. The mineral potassium is found in many foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Potassium affects how steadily your heart beats, so eating foods with too much of it can be very dangerous to your heart. To control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like oranges, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and dried fruits. You can remove some of the potassium from potatoes and other vegetables by peeling and soaking them in a large container of water for several hours, then cooking them in fresh water. Phosphorus. The mineral phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. Control of phosphorus may be even more important than calcium itself in preventing bone disease and related complications. Foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus and should be avoided. You'll probably need to take a phosphate binder with your food to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. Salt (sodium chloride). Most canned foods and frozen dinners contain high amounts of sodium. Too much of it makes you thirsty, and when you drink more fluid, your heart has to work harder to pump the fluid through your body. Over time, this can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products labeled ""low sodium."" Protein. Before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet to preserve kidney function. But now you have different nutritional priorities. Most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. Protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue, but protein breaks down into urea (blood urea nitrogen, or BUN) in your body. Some sources of protein, called high-quality proteins, produce less waste than others. High-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. Getting most of your protein from these sources can reduce the amount of urea in your blood. Calories. Calories provide your body with energy. Some people on dialysis need to gain weight. You may need to find ways to add calories to your diet. Vegetable oils-like olive, canola, and safflower oils-are good sources of calories and do not contribute to problems controlling your cholesterol. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly also provide calories and energy. If you have diabetes, however, be very careful about eating sweets. A dietitian's guidance is especially important for people with diabetes. Supplements. Vitamins and minerals may be missing from your diet because you have to avoid so many foods. Dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement designed specifically for people with kidney failure. Take your prescribed supplement after treatment on the days you have hemodialysis. Never take vitamins that you can buy off the store shelf, since they may contain vitamins or minerals that are harmful to you. "
Financial Issues,"'Treatment for kidney failure is expensive, but Federal health insurance plans pay much of the cost, usually up to 80 percent. Often, private insurance or State programs pay the rest. Your social worker can help you locate resources for financial assistance. For more information, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Financial Help for Treatment of Kidney Failure''. ' "
Hope Through Research,"'The NIDDK, through its Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases, supports several programs and studies devoted to improving treatment for patients with progressive kidney disease and permanent kidney failure, including patients on hemodialysis. ''The U.S. Government does not endorse or favor any specific commercial product or company. Trade, proprietary, or company names appearing in this document are used only because they are considered necessary in the context of the information provided. If a product is not mentioned, the omission does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory. ' The End-Stage Renal Disease Program promotes research to reduce medical problems from bone, blood, nervous system, metabolic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and endocrine abnormalities in kidney failure and to improve the effectiveness of dialysis and transplantation. The research focuses on evaluating different hemodialysis schedules and on finding the most useful information for measuring dialysis adequacy. The program also seeks to increase kidney graft and patient survival and to maximize quality of life. The HEMO Study, completed in 2002, tested the theory that a higher dialysis dose and/or high-flux membranes would reduce patient mortality (death) and morbidity (medical problems). Doctors at 15 medical centers recruited more than 1,800 hemodialysis patients and randomly assigned them to high or standard dialysis doses and high- or low-flux filters. The study found no increase in the health or survival of patients who had a higher dialysis dose, who dialyzed with high-flux filters, or who did both. The U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) collects, analyzes, and distributes information about the use of dialysis and transplantation to treat kidney failure in the United States. The USRDS is funded directly by the NIDDK in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The USRDS publishes an Annual Data Report, which identifies the total population of people being treated for kidney failure; reports on incidence, prevalence, death rates, and trends over time; and develops data on the effects of various treatment approaches. The report also helps identify problems and opportunities for more focused special studies of renal research issues. The Hemodialysis Vascular Access Clinical Trials Consortium is conducting a series of multicenter, clinical trials of drug therapies to reduce the failure and complication rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts and fistulas in hemodialysis. These studies are randomized and placebo controlled, which means the studies meet the highest standard for scientific accuracy. AV grafts and fistulas prepare the arteries and veins for regular dialysis. See the NIDDK fact sheet Vascular Access for Hemodialysis for more information. Recently developed drugs to prevent blood clots may be evaluated in these large clinical trials. "

Introduction to high blood pressure and kidney disease,"""The kidneys play a key role in keeping a person's blood pressure in a healthy range, and blood pressure, in turn, can affect the health of the kidneys. High blood pressure, also called ""'hypertension'', can damage the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD).'  "
What is high blood pressure?,"'Blood pressure measures the force of blood against the walls of the blood vessels. Extra fluid in the body increases the amount of fluid in blood vessels and makes blood pressure higher. Narrow, stiff, or clogged blood vessels also raise blood pressure.''People with high blood pressure should see their doctor regularly.' "
How does high blood pressure hurt the kidneys?,"""High blood pressure makes the heart work harder and, over time, can damage blood vessels throughout the body. If the blood vessels in the kidneys are damaged, they may stop removing wastes and extra fluid from the body. The extra fluid in the blood vessels may then raise blood pressure even more. It's a dangerous cycle.""'High blood pressure is one of the leading causes of ''kidney failure'', also called ''end-stage renal disease'' (''ESRD''). People with kidney failure must either receive a ''kidney transplant'' or have regular blood-cleansing treatments called ''dialysis''. Every year, high blood pressure causes more than 25,000 new cases of kidney failure in the United States.''1''1''United States Renal Data System. USRDS 2007 Annual Data Report.

What are the signs and symptoms of high blood pressure?,"'Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms. The only way to know whether a person\'s blood pressure is high is to have a health professional measure it with a blood pressure cuff. The result is expressed as two numbers. The top number, called the systolic pressure, represents the pressure when the heart is beating. The bottom number, called the diastolic pressure, shows the pressure when the heart is resting between beats. A person\'s blood pressure is considered normal if it stays at or below 120/80, which is commonly stated as ""120 over 80."" People with a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 are considered prehypertensive and should adopt lifestyle changes to lower their blood pressure and prevent heart and blood vessel diseases. A person whose systolic blood pressure is consistently 140 or higher or whose diastolic pressure is 90 or higher is considered to have high blood pressure and should talk with a doctor about the best ways to lower it.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease (CKD)?,"""Early kidney disease is a silent problem, like high blood pressure, and does not have any symptoms. People may have CKD but not know it because they do not feel sick. A person's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how well the kidneys are filtering wastes from the blood. GFR is estimated from a routine measurement of creatinine in the blood. The result is called the estimated GFR (eGFR).""'Creatinine is a waste product formed by the normal breakdown of muscle cells. Healthy kidneys take creatinine out of the blood and put it into the urine to leave the body. When the kidneys are not working well, creatinine builds up in the blood.'""An eGFR with a value below 60 milliliters per minute (mL/min) suggests some kidney damage has occurred. The score means that a person's kidneys are not working at full strength.""'Another sign of CKD is ''proteinuria'', or ''protein in the urine''. Healthy kidneys take wastes out of the blood but leave protein. Impaired kidneys may fail to separate a blood protein called albumin from the wastes. At first, only small amounts of albumin may leak into the urine, a condition known as microalbuminuria, a sign of failing kidney function. As kidney function worsens, the amount of albumin and other proteins in the urine increases, and the condition is called proteinuria. CKD is present when more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine is excreted in urine, with or without decreased eGFR.'  "
How can kidney damage from high blood pressure be prevented?,"'The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), recommends that people with CKD use whatever therapy is necessary, including lifestyle changes and medicines, to keep their blood pressure below 130/80.' "
How can blood pressure be controlled?,"'The NHLBI recommends five lifestyle changes that help control blood pressure. People with ''prehypertension'' or high blood pressure should' Weight: maintain their weight at a level close to normal Diet: eat fresh fruits and vegetables, grains, and low-fat dairy foods. Sodium: limit their daily salt, or sodium, intake to 2,000 milligrams. They should limit frozen foods and trips to fast food restaurants. They should read nutrition labels on packaged foods to learn how much sodium is in one serving. Keeping a sodium diary can help monitor sodium intake. Exercise: get plenty of exercise-at least 30 minutes of moderate activity, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, most days of the week. Alcohol: avoid consuming too much alcohol. Men should have no more than two drinks-two 12-ounce servings of beer or two 5-ounce servings of wine or two 1.5-ounce servings of hard liquor-a day. Women should have no more than a single serving a day because differences in the way foods are broken down in the body make women more sensitive to the effects of alcohol."
Can medicines help control blood pressure?,"'Many people need medicine to control high blood pressure. Several effective blood pressure medicines are available. The most common types of blood pressure medicines doctors prescribe are diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs''), ''beta blockers'', and ''calcium channel blockers''. Two of these medicines, the ''ACE inhibitors'' and ARBs, have an added protective effect on the kidneys. Studies have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of kidney damage. Diuretics, also known as ""water pills,"" help a person urinate and get rid of excess fluid in the body. A combination of two or more blood pressure medicines may be needed to keep blood pressure below 130/80.' "
Who is at risk for kidney failure related to high blood pressure?,"'Everyone has some risk of developing kidney failure from high blood pressure. African Americans, however, are more likely than Caucasians to have high blood pressure and its related kidney problems - even when their blood pressure is only mildly elevated. In fact, African Americans are six times more likely than Caucasians to develop ''hypertension''-related kidney failure.''2''People with ''diabetes'' also have a greater risk of developing kidney failure. Early management of high blood pressure is especially important for African Americans with diabetes.''The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), also part of the NIH, sponsored the African American Study of Kidney Disease and ''Hypertension'' (AASK) to find effective ways to prevent high blood pressure and kidney failure in this population. The results, published in the November 20, 2002, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that an ACE inhibitor was the most effective drug at slowing the progression of kidney disease in African Americans. While ACE inhibitors help reduce the risk of kidney disease, they are less effective in ''lowering blood pressure'' in African Americans than in Caucasians.''2''United States Renal Data System. USRDS 2007 Annual Data Report. Bethesda, MD: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; 2007.' "
Hope Through Research ,"'In recent years, researchers have learned a great deal about kidney disease. The NIDDK sponsors several programs aimed at understanding kidney failure and finding treatments to stop its progression.'""The NIDDK's Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases supports basic research into normal kidney function and the diseases that impair normal function, including diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, and ""'polycystic kidney disease''.''Participants in clinical trials can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

What is kidney dysplasia?," Kidney dysplasia is a condition in which the internal structures of one or both of a fetus’ kidneys do not develop normally while in the womb. During normal development, two thin tubes of muscle called ureters grow into the kidneys and branch out to form a network of tiny structures called tubules. The tubules collect urine as the fetus grows in the womb. In kidney dysplasia, the tubules fail to branch out completely. Urine that would normally flow through the tubules has nowhere to go. Urine collects inside the affected kidney and forms fluid-filled sacs called cysts. The cysts replace normal kidney tissue and prevent the kidney from functioning. Kidney dysplasia can affect one kidney or both kidneys. Babies with severe kidney dysplasia affecting both kidneys generally do not survive birth. Those who do survive may need the following early in life:blood-filtering treatments called dialysisa kidney transplant blood-filtering treatments called dialysis a kidney transplant Children with dysplasia in only one kidney have normal kidney function if the other kidney is unaffected. Those with mild dysplasia of both kidneys may not need dialysis or a kidney transplant for several years. Kidney dysplasia is also called renal dysplasia or multicystic dysplastic kidney. Kidney dysplasia is a common condition. Scientists estimate that kidney dysplasia affects about one in 4,000 babies.1 This estimate may be low because some people with kidney dysplasia are never diagnosed with the condition. About half of the babies diagnosed with this condition have other urinary tract defects. Babies who are more likely to develop kidney dysplasia include those those parents have the genetic traits for the condition with certain genetic syndromes affecting multiple body systems whose mothers used certain prescription medications or illegal drugs during pregnancy."
What are the kidneys and what do they do?," The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid. Children produce less urine than adults - the amount they produce depends on their age. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through the two ureters, one on each side of the bladder. The bladder stores urine. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder."
What are the signs and symptoms of kidney dysplasia?,"'Many babies with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney have no signs of the condition.' In some patients, the affected kidney may be enlarged at birth and may cause pain. The affected kidney may be enlarged at birth. Abnormalities in the urinary tract may lead to urinary tract infections. Children with kidney dysplasia may develop high blood pressure, but only rarely. Children with kidney dysplasia may have a slightly increased risk for kidney cancer. Chronic kidney disease and kidney failure may develop if the child has urinary problems that affect the normal kidney. Many children with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney have no signs or symptoms."
What causes kidney dysplasia?,"'Genetic factors can cause kidney dysplasia. Genes pass information from both parents to the child and determine the child’s traits. Sometimes, parents may pass a gene that has changed, or mutated, causing kidney dysplasia.''Genetic syndromes that affect multiple body systems can also cause kidney dysplasia. A syndrome is a group of symptoms or conditions that may seem unrelated yet are thought to have the same genetic cause. A baby with kidney dysplasia due to a genetic syndrome might also have problems of the''A baby may also develop kidney dysplasia if his or her mother takes certain prescription medications during pregnancy, such as some used to treat ''seizures'' and ''high blood pressure''. A mother’s use of illegal drugs, such as ''cocaine'', during pregnancy may also cause kidney dysplasia in her unborn child.' digestive tract, nervous system, heart and blood vessels, muscles and skeleton, or other parts of the urinary tract."
What are the complications of kidney dysplasia?,"'The complications of kidney dysplasia can include' hydronephrosis of the working kidney. A baby with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney might have other urinary tract defects. When other defects in the urinary tract block the flow of urine, the urine backs up and causes the kidneys and ureters to swell, a condition called hydronephrosis. If left untreated, hydronephrosis can damage the working kidney and reduce its ability to filter blood. Kidney damage may lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure. a urinary tract infection (UTI). A urine blockage may increase a baby’s chance of developing a UTI. Recurring UTIs can also lead to kidney damage. high blood pressure. a slightly increased chance of developing kidney cancer. "
What procedures and tests diagnose kidney dysplasia?,"'If the condition is limited to one kidney and the baby has no signs of kidney dysplasia, no treatment may be necessary. However, the baby should have regular checkups that include'  checking blood pressure. testing blood to measure kidney function. testing urine for albumin, a protein most often found in blood. Albumin in the urine may be a sign of kidney damage. performing periodic ultrasounds to monitor the damaged kidney and to make sure the functioning kidney continues to grow and remains healthy. "
How is kidney dysplasia treated?,"""If the condition is limited to one kidney and the child has no symptoms, no treatment may be necessary. Regular checkups should include blood pressure measurements, blood tests to measure kidney function, and urine testing for protein. Usually the child is monitored with periodic ultrasounds to look at the affected kidney and to make sure the other kidney continues to grow normally and doesn't develop any other problems. Children with ""'urinary tract infections'' may need to take antibiotics.''Removal of the kidney should be considered only if the kidney''Researchers have not found that eating, ''diet'', and ''nutrition'' play a role in causing or preventing kidney dysplasia.'  causes pain causes high blood pressure shows abnormal changes on ultrasound Does my child have any other problems in the urinary tract? Does my child need to take antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections? Will my child need special medical care? How often should my child be checked for high blood pressure and kidney damage? How often should the dysplastic kidney and the normal kidney be evaluated by ultrasound?"
What is the prognosis for a child if only one kidney has dysplasia?,"'The long-term outlook for a child with kidney dysplasia in only one kidney is generally good. A person with one working kidney, a condition called\xa0solitary kidney, can grow normally and may have few, if any, health problems.''The affected kidney may shrink as the child grows. By age 10,3\xa0the affected kidney may no longer be visible on x-ray or ultrasound. Children and adults with only one working kidney should have regular checkups to test for high blood pressure and kidney damage. A child with urinary tract problems that lead to failure of the working kidney may eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant.' "
What is the prognosis for a child if both kidneys have dysplasia?,'The long-term outlook for a child with kidney dysplasia in both kidneys is different from the long-term outlook for a child with one dysplastic kidney. A child with kidney dysplasia in both kidneys' is more likely to develop CKD. needs close follow-up with a pediatric nephrologist—a doctor who specializes in caring for children with kidney disease. Children who live in areas that don’t have a pediatric nephrologist available can see a nephrologist who cares for both children and adults. may eventually need dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Can kidney dysplasia be prevented during pregnancy?, Researchers have not found a way to prevent kidney dysplasia caused by genetic factors or certain genetic syndromes. Pregnant women can prevent kidney dysplasia by avoiding the use of certain prescription medications or illegal drugs during pregnancy. Pregnant women should talk with their health care provider before taking any medications during pregnancy.
What are the kidneys? Where are they located?,"'The kidneys play key roles in body function, not only by filtering the blood and getting rid of waste products, but also by balancing the electrolyte levels in the body, controlling blood pressure, and stimulating the production of ''red blood cells''.''The kidneys are located in the abdomen toward the back, normally one on each side of the spine. They get their blood supply through the renal arteries directly from the ''aorta'' and send blood back to the ''heart'' via the renal veins to the vena cava. (The term ""renal"" is derived from the Latin name for kidney.)' "
What do the kidneys do?,"'When blood flows to the kidney, sensors within specialized kidney cells regulate how much water to excrete as urine, along with what concentration of ''electrolytes''. For example, if a person is dehydrated from ''exercise'' or from an illness, the kidneys will hold onto as much water as possible and the urine becomes very concentrated. When adequate water is present in the body, the urine is much more dilute, and the urine becomes clear. This system is controlled by renin, a hormone produced in the kidney that is part of the fluid and blood pressure regulation systems of the body.''Kidneys are also the source of ''erythropoietin'' in the body, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells. Special cells in the kidney monitor the oxygen concentration in blood. If oxygen levels fall, erythropoietin levels rise and the body starts to manufacture more red blood cells.''Urine that is made by each kidney flows through the ureter, a tube that connects the kidney to the bladder. Urine is stored within the bladder, and when urination occurs, the bladder empties urine through a tube called the urethra.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of kidney failure?,"'Initially, kidney failure may be not produce any symptoms (asymptomatic). As kidney function decreases, the symptoms are related to the inability to regulate water and electrolyte balances, clear waste products from the body, and promote red blood cell production.''If unrecognized or untreated, the following symptoms of kidney failure may develop into life-threatening circumstances.'   Lethargy Weakness Shortness of breath Generalized swelling (edema) Generalized weakness due to anemia Loss of appetite Lethargy Fatigue Congestive heart failure Metabolic acidosis High blood potassium (hyperkalemia) Fatal heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation Rising urea levels in the blood (uremia) may lead to brain encephalopathy, pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining), or low calcium blood levels (hypocalcemia)"
What causes kidney failure?,"'Kidney failure may occur from an acute situation that injures the kidneys or from chronic diseases that gradually cause the kidneys to stop functioning.''In ''acute renal failure'"", kidney function is lost rapidly and can occur from a variety of insults to the body. Since most people have two kidneys, both kidneys must be damaged for complete kidney failure to occur. Fortunately, if only one kidney fails or is diseased it can be removed, and the remaining kidney may continue to have normal kidney (renal) function. If a both patient's kidneys are injured or diseased, a donor kidney(s) may transplanted.""'The list of causes of kidney failure is often categorized based on where the injury has occurred.''Prerenal causes'' (pre=before + renal=kidney) causes are due to decreased blood supply to the kidney. Examples of ''prerenal causes of kidney failure'' are:' Hypovolemia (low blood volume) due to blood loss Dehydration from loss of body fluid (for example, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, fever) Poor intake of fluids Medication, for example, diuretics (""water pills"") may cause excessive water loss Abnormal blood flow to and from the kidney due to obstruction of the renal artery or vein."
What causes acute kidney failure?,"'Renal causes of kidney failure (damage directly to the kidney itself) include:''Sepsis'':'"" The body's immune system is overwhelmed from infection and causes inflammation and shutdown of the kidneys. This usually does not occur with simple ""'urinary tract infections''.''Medications:'' Some medications are toxic to the kidney including:''Rhabdomyolysis'':'' In rhabdomyolysis there is significant muscle breakdown in the body, and the damaged muscle fibers clog the filtering system of the kidneys. Massive muscle injury may occur because of ''trauma'', crush injuries, and ''burns''. Some medications used to treat ''high cholesterol'' may cause rhabdomyolysis.''Multiple myeloma''Acute glomerulonephritis or inflammation of the glomeruli, the filtering system of the kidneys. Many diseases can cause this inflammation including:''Hemolytic uremic syndrome'':'' This condition results from abnormal destruction of red blood cells. It most often occurs in children after certain infections, but also may be caused by medications, ''pregnancy'', or can occur for unknown reasons.''Post renal causes of kidney failure'' (post=after + renal= kidney) are due to factors that affect outflow of the urine:' Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) Antibiotics like aminoglycosides gentamicin (Garamycin), tobramycin lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid) Iodine-containing medications such as those injected for radiology dye studies Systemic lupus erythematosus Wegener's granulomatosis Goodpasture syndrome. Obstruction of the bladder or the ureters can cause back pressure because the kidneys continue to produce urine, but the obstruction acts like a dam, and urine backs up into the kidneys. When the pressure increases high enough, the kidneys are damaged and shut down. Prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer may block the urethra and prevents the bladder from emptying. Tumors in the abdomen that surround and obstruct the ureters. Kidney stones. Usually, kidney stones affect only one kidney and do not cause kidney failure. However, if there is only one kidney present, a kidney stone may cause the remaining kidney to fail."
What causes chronic kidney failure?,"'Chronic renal failure'' develops over months and years. The most common causes of chronic renal failure are related to''Less common causes of chronic renal failure include:' poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled high blood pressure, and chronic glomerulonephritis. Polycystic kidney disease Reflux nephropathy (damage caused by urine backflow from the bladder into the ureters and kidney) Nephrotic syndrome Alport's disease Interstitial nephritis Kidney stones Prostate disease"
Does kidney failure cause pain?,"'Kidney failure in itself does not cause ''pain''. However, the consequences of kidney failure may cause ''pain'' and discomfort in different parts of the body.''Normal functioning kidneys filter amyloid (a protein) from the blood stream. In kidney failure amyloid proteins in the blood rise, and can separate and clump together forming amyloid deposits into a variety of tissue and organs, including joints and tendons. This can result in symptoms of:' joint stiffness, pain, and swelling. Patients who are on dialysis may have discomfort when on the dialysis machine. Pain is often a consequence of the underlying chronic disease that led to kidney failure, for example: People with poorly controlled diabetes may develop diabetic neuropathy pain. People who have peripheral vascular disease also may have pain in their extremities, and may develop claudication (leg pain that occurs with walking)."
What procedures and tests diagnose kidney failure?,"""Often, a patient is seen for another medical condition and the diagnosis of kidney failure is a consequence of the patient's disease or injury. In patients with chronic kidney disease due to diabetes, ""'high blood pressure'', or another related medical condition his or her medical care team most likely monitors kidney function as part of the his or her routine long-term medical care plan.''Diagnosis of kidney failure can be confirmed by blood tests such as BUN, creatinine, and GFR; that measure the buildup of waste products in the blood.''Urine tests may be ordered to measure the amount of protein, detect the presence of abnormal cells, or measure the concentration of electrolytes.''Other tests are used to diagnose the type of kidney failure such as:'   Abdominal ultrasound Kidney biopsy"
What is the treatment for kidney failure?,"'Prevention'' is always the goal with kidney failure. Chronic diseases such as ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure'') and diabetes are devastating because of the damage that they can do to kidneys and other organs. Lifelong diligence is important in keeping blood ''sugar'' and blood pressure within normal limits. Specific treatments depend upon the underlying diseases.''Once kidney failure is present, the goal is to prevent further deterioration of renal function. If ignored, the kidneys will progress to complete failure, but if underlying illnesses are addressed and treated aggressively, kidney function can be preserved, though not always improved.'  "
Is there a diet for kidney failure? What foods should be avoided? Which are OK to eat?,"'Diet'' is an important consideration for those with impaired kidney function. Consultation with a dietician may be helpful to understand what foods may or may not be appropriate.''In this state of impaired kidney function, the kidneys cannot easily remove excess water, salt, or potassium from the blood, so foods high in potassium salt substitutes may need to be consumed in limited quantities. Examples of potassium rich foods include:''Phosphorus is a forgotten chemical that is associated with calcium metabolism and may be elevated in the body in kidney failure. Too much phosphorus can leech calcium from the bones and cause ''osteoporosis'' and ''fractures''. Examples of foods and ''beverages'' high in phosphorus include:'   Bananas Apricots Cantaloupe Sweet potatoes Yogurt Spinach Avocados Milk Cheese Nuts Dark cola drinks Canned iced teas Yogurt Organ meets Sardines Oysters Baked beans Black beans Lentils Kidney beans Soy beans Bran cereals Caramels Whole grain products"
What medications treat kidney failure?,"'Different classes of medications may be used to help control some of the issues associated with kidney failure including:''Once the kidneys fail completely, the treatment options are limited to dialysis or kidney replacement by transplantation.' Phosphorus-lowering medications, for example, calcium carbonate (Caltrate), calcitriol (Rocaltrol), and sevelamer (Renagel) Red blood cell production stimulation, for example, erythropoietin, darbepoetin (Aranesp) Red blood cell production (iron supplements) Blood pressure medications Vitamins"
What are dialysis and hemodialysis?,"'Dialysis cleanses the body of waste products in the body by use of filter systems. There are two types of dialysis, 1) ''hemodialysis'', and 2) peritoneal dialysis.''Hemodialysis uses a machine filter called a dialyzer or artificial kidney to remove excess water and salt, to balance the other electrolytes in the body, and to remove waste products of metabolism. Blood is removed from the body and flows through tubing into the machine, where it passes next to a filter membrane. A specialized chemical solution (dialysate) flows on the other side of the membrane. The dialysate is formulated to draw impurities from the blood through the filter membrane. Blood and dialysate never touch in the artificial kidney machine.''For this type of dialysis, access to the blood vessels needs to be surgically created so that large amounts of blood can flow into the machine and back to the body. Surgeons can build a fistula, a connection between a large artery and vein in the body, usually in the arm, that allows a large amount of blood flow into the vein. This makes the vein swell or dilate, and its walls become thicker so that it can tolerate repeated needle sticks to attach tubing from the body to the machine. Since it takes many weeks or months for a fistula to mature enough to be used, significant planning is required if hemodialysis is to be considered as an option.''If the kidney failure happens acutely and there is no time to build a fistula, special catheters may be inserted into the larger blood vessels of the arm, leg, or chest. These catheters may be left in place for weeks. In some diseases, the need for dialysis will be temporary, but if the expectation is that dialysis will continue for a prolonged period of time, these catheters act as a ''bridge'' until a fistula can be planned, placed, and matured.''Dialysis treatments normally occur three times a week and last a few hours at a time. Most commonly, patients travel to an outpatient center to have dialysis, but home dialysis therapy is becoming an option for some.''Outpatient dialysis is available on some cruise ships. They are equipped with dialysis machines with trained health care professionals ready to care for those with kidney failure while traveling.'  "
What is peritoneal dialysis?,"'Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal ''cavity'' as the dialysis filter to rid the body of waste and to balance electrolyte levels. A catheter is placed in the abdominal ''cavity'' through the abdominal wall by a surgeon, and it is expected to remain in place for the long-term. The dialysis solution is then dripped in through the catheter and left in the abdominal cavity for a few hours after which, it is drained out. During that time, waste products leech from the blood flowing through the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum), and attach themselves to the fluid that has been instilled by the catheters. Often, patients instill the dialysate fluid before bedtime, and drain it in the morning.'""There are benefits and complications for each type of dialysis. Not every patient can choose which type he or she would prefer. The treatment decision depends on the patient's illness and their past medical history along with other issues. Usually, the nephrologist (kidney specialist) will have a long discussion with the patient and family to decide what will be the best option available.""'Dialysis is lifesaving. Without it, patients whose kidneys no longer function would die relatively quickly due to electrolyte abnormalities and the buildup of toxins in the blood stream. Patients may live many years with dialysis but other underlying and associated illnesses often are the cause of death.' "
Is a kidney transplant an option?,"'If kidney failure occurs and is non-reversible, kidney transplantation is an alternative option to dialysis. If the patient is an appropriate candidate, the healthcare professional and nephrologist will contact an organ transplant center to arrange evaluation to see whether the patient is suitable for this treatment. If so, the search for a donor begins. Sometimes, family members have compatible tissue types and, if they are willing, may donate a kidney. Otherwise, the patient will be placed on the organ transplant list that is maintained by the United Network of Organ Sharing.''Not all hospitals are capable of performing kidney transplants. The patient may have to travel to undergo their operation. The most successful programs are those that do many transplants every year.''While kidney transplants have become routine, they still carry some risk. The patient will need to take anti-rejection medications that reduce the ability of the immune system to fight infection. The body can try to reject the kidney or the transplanted kidney may fail to work. As with any operation, there is a risk of bleeding and infection.''Kidney transplants may provide better quality of life than dialysis. After one year, 95% of transplanted kidneys are still functioning and after five years, the number is 80%. It seems that the longer a patient is on dialysis, the shorter the life of the transplanted kidney.''If the transplanted kidney fails, the alternative is another kidney transplant or a return to dialysis.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for kidney failure? Can it be prevented?,"'The outlook for kidney failure depends upon the underlying condition that caused it. Kidney function may return to normal, especially if it is due to an acute obstruction and that obstruction is relieved. Other causes of decreased kidney function leading to kidney failure are due to underlying disease and occur slowly over time.''Prevention is the best chance to maintain kidney function, and controlling ''high blood pressure'' and diabetes over a lifetime can decrease the potential for progressive kidney damage. Chronic kidney failure may be managed by to help monitor electrolyte and waste product levels in the bloodstream. Major abnormalities can be life threatening, and treatment options may be limited to dialysis or transplant.' "
Introduction to hemodialysis,"'Hemodialysis'' is the most common method used to treat advanced and permanent ''kidney failure''. Since the 1960s, when hemodialysis first became a practical treatment for ''kidney failure'"", we've learned much about how to make hemodialysis treatments more effective and minimize side effects. In recent years, more compact and simpler ""'dialysis'' machines have made home dialysis increasingly attractive. However, even with better procedures and equipment, hemodialysis is still a complicated and inconvenient therapy that requires a coordinated effort from your whole health care team, including your nephrologist, dialysis nurse, dialysis technician, dietitian, and social worker. The most important members of your health care team are you and your family. By learning about your treatment, you can work with your health care team to give yourself the best possible results, and you can lead a full, active life. ' "
When Your Kidneys Fail,"'Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, ''minerals'', and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail, harmful wastes build up in your body, your ''blood pressure'' may rise, and your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough ''red blood cells''. When this happens, you need treatment to replace the work of your failed kidneys. ' "
How Hemodialysis Works,"'In hemodialysis, your blood is allowed to flow, a few ounces at a time, through a special filter that removes wastes and extra fluids. The clean blood is then returned to your body. Removing the harmful wastes and extra salt and fluids helps control your blood pressure and keep the proper balance of chemicals like potassium and sodium in your body. ''One of the biggest adjustments you must make when you start hemodialysis treatments is following a strict schedule. Most patients go to a clinic-a dialysis center-three times a week for 3 to 5 or more hours each visit. For example, you may be on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule or a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule. You may be asked to choose a morning, afternoon, or evening shift, depending on availability and capacity at the dialysis unit. Your dialysis center will explain your options for scheduling regular treatments. ''Researchers are exploring whether shorter daily sessions, or longer sessions performed overnight while the patient sleeps, are more effective in removing wastes. Newer dialysis machines make these alternatives more practical with home dialysis. However, the federal government has not yet established a policy to pay for more than three hemodialysis sessions a week. ''Several centers around the country teach people how to perform their own hemodialysis treatments at home. A family member or friend who will be your helper must also take the training, which usually takes at least 4 to 6 weeks. Home dialysis gives you more flexibility in your dialysis schedule. With home hemodialysis, the time for each session and the number of sessions per week may vary, but you must maintain a regular schedule by giving yourself dialysis treatments as often as you would receive them in a dialysis unit. ' "
Adjusting to Changes,"'Even in the best situations, adjusting to the effects of kidney failure and the time you spend on dialysis can be difficult. Aside from the ""lost time,"" you may have less energy. You may need to make changes in your work or home life, giving up some activities and responsibilities. Keeping the same schedule you kept when your kidneys were working can be very difficult now that your kidneys have failed. Accepting this new reality can be very hard on you and your family. A counselor or social worker can answer your questions and help you cope. ''Many patients feel ''depressed'' when starting dialysis, or after several months of treatment. If you feel depressed, you should talk with your social worker, nurse, or doctor because this is a common problem that can often be treated effectively. ' "
Getting Your Vascular Access Ready,"'One important step before starting hemodialysis is preparing a vascular access, a site on your body from which your blood is removed and returned. A vascular access should be prepared weeks or months before you start dialysis. It will allow easier and more efficient removal and replacement of your blood with fewer complications. For more information about the different kinds of vascular accesses and how to care for them, see the National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) fact sheet ''Vascular Access for Hemodialysis''. ' "
Equipment and Procedures,"""When you first visit a hemodialysis center, it may seem like a complicated mix of machines and people. But once you learn how the procedure works and become familiar with the equipment, you'll be more comfortable. ""'The ''dialysis machine'' is about the size of a dishwasher. This machine has three main jobs: ''The dialyzer is a large canister containing thousands of small fibers through which your blood is passed. Dialysis solution, the cleansing fluid, is pumped around these fibers. The fibers allow wastes and extra fluids to pass from your blood into the solution, which carries them away. The dialyzer is sometimes called an artificial kidney. ''Dialysis solution, also known as dialysate, is the fluid in the dialyzer that helps remove wastes and extra fluid from your blood. It contains chemicals that make it act like a sponge. Your doctor will give you a specific dialysis solution for your treatments. This formula can be adjusted based on how well you handle the treatments and on your blood tests. '""Many people find the needle sticks to be one of the hardest parts of hemodialysis treatments. Most people, however, report getting used to them after a few sessions. If you find the needle insertion painful, an anesthetic cream or spray can be applied to the skin. The cream or spray will numb your skin briefly so you won't feel the needle. ""'Most dialysis centers use two needles-one to carry blood to the dialyzer and one to return the cleaned blood to your body. Some specialized needles are designed with two openings for two-way flow of blood, but these needles are less efficient and require longer sessions. Needles for high-flux or high-efficiency dialysis need to be a little larger than those used with regular dialyzers. ''Some people prefer to insert their own needles. You\'ll need training on inserting needles properly to prevent infection and protect your vascular access. You may also learn a ""ladder"" strategy for needle placement in which you ""climb"" up the entire length of the access session by session so that you don\'t weaken an area with a grouping of needle sticks. A different approach is the ""buttonhole"" strategy in which you use a limited number of sites but insert the needle back into the same hole made by the previous needle stick. Whether you insert your own needles or not, you should know these techniques to better care for your access. ' pump blood and watch flow for safety clean wastes from blood watch your blood pressure and the rate of fluid removal from your body Reuse. Your dialysis center may use the same dialyzer more than once for your treatments. Reuse is considered safe as long as the dialyzer is cleaned before each use. The dialyzer is tested each time to make sure it's still working, and it should never be used for anyone but you. Before each session, you should be sure that the dialyzer is labeled with your name and check to see that it has been cleaned, disinfected, and tested. "
Tests to See How Well Your Dialysis Is Working,"'About once a month, your dialysis care team will test your blood by using one of two formulas-URR or Kt/V-to see whether your treatments are removing enough wastes. Both tests look at one specific waste product, called blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as an indicator for the overall level of waste products in your system. For more information about these measurements, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Hemodialysis Dose and Adequacy''. ' "
Conditions Related to Kidney Failure and Their Treatments,"'Your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. They also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. When your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with ''anemia'' and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. Some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme ''tiredness'', bone problems, joint problems, ''itching'', and ""restless legs."" Restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping. ''Anemia'"" is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. Anemia can also contribute to ""'heart'' problems. ''Anemia is common in people with ''kidney disease'' because the kidneys produce the hormone ''erythropoietin'"", or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys often don't make enough EPO, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. EPO is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis. ""'For more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the NIDDK fact sheet''Anemia in Kidney Disease and Dialysis''. ''The term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. ''Renal osteodystrophy'', or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. It causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. Older patients and women who have gone through ''menopause'' are at greater risk for this disease. ''Many people treated with hemodialysis complain of ''itchy'' skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. ''Itching'"" is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood. ""'The problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. The four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. The parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. ''A cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. Phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. Still others improve with EPO shots. A few ''antihistamines'' (''Benadryl'', Atarax, ''Vistaril'') have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. In any case, taking care of ''dry skin'' is important. Applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help. ''Patients on dialysis often have ''insomnia'', and some people have a specific problem called the ''sleep apnea'' syndrome, which is often signaled by ''snoring'' and breaks in ''snoring''. Episodes of apnea are actually breaks in ''breathing'' during ''sleep''. Over time, these ''sleep'' disturbances can lead to ""day-night reversal"" (''insomnia'' at night, sleepiness during the day), ''headache'', ''depression'', and decreased alertness. The apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. Treatments that work with people who have ''sleep apnea'', whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive ''airway'' pressure, or ''CPAP'').''Many people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or ""restless"" legs. You may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. Kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. The causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances. ''Moderate ''exercise'' during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. People with ''restless leg syndrome'' should reduce or avoid ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. A class of ''drugs'' called ''benzodiazepines'', often used to treat ''insomnia'' or ''anxiety'', may help as well. These prescription drugs include ''Klonopin'', ''Librium'', ''Valium'', and ''Halcion''. A newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa (''Sinemet''), a drug used to treat '""Parkinson's""' disease. ''Sleep disorders'"" may seem unimportant, but they can impair your quality of life. Don't hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse, doctor, or social worker. ""'Dialysis-related ''amyloidosis'' (DRA) is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. DRA develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons, causing ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and fluid in the joints, as is the case with ''arthritis''. Working kidneys filter out these proteins, but dialysis filters are not as effective. ' "
How Diet Can Help,"""Eating the right foods can help improve your dialysis and your health. Your clinic has a dietitian to help you plan meals. Follow the dietitian's advice closely to get the most from your hemodialysis treatments. Here are a few general guidelines. ""'You can also ask your dietitian for ''recipes'' and titles of cookbooks for patients with kidney disease. Following the restrictions of a diet for kidney disease might be hard at first, but with a little creativity, you can make tasty and satisfying meals. For more information, see the NIDDK booklet''Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis''. '  Fluids. Your dietitian will help you determine how much fluid to drink each day. Extra fluid can raise your blood pressure, make your heart work harder, and increase the stress of dialysis treatments. Remember that many foods-such as soup, ice cream, and fruits-contain plenty of water. Ask your dietitian for tips on controlling your thirst.  Potassium. The mineral potassium is found in many foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Potassium affects how steadily your heart beats, so eating foods with too much of it can be very dangerous to your heart. To control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like oranges, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and dried fruits. You can remove some of the potassium from potatoes and other vegetables by peeling and soaking them in a large container of water for several hours, then cooking them in fresh water. Phosphorus. The mineral phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. Control of phosphorus may be even more important than calcium itself in preventing bone disease and related complications. Foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus and should be avoided. You'll probably need to take a phosphate binder with your food to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. Salt (sodium chloride). Most canned foods and frozen dinners contain high amounts of sodium. Too much of it makes you thirsty, and when you drink more fluid, your heart has to work harder to pump the fluid through your body. Over time, this can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products labeled ""low sodium."" Protein. Before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet to preserve kidney function. But now you have different nutritional priorities. Most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. Protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue, but protein breaks down into urea (blood urea nitrogen, or BUN) in your body. Some sources of protein, called high-quality proteins, produce less waste than others. High-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. Getting most of your protein from these sources can reduce the amount of urea in your blood. Calories. Calories provide your body with energy. Some people on dialysis need to gain weight. You may need to find ways to add calories to your diet. Vegetable oils-like olive, canola, and safflower oils-are good sources of calories and do not contribute to problems controlling your cholesterol. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly also provide calories and energy. If you have diabetes, however, be very careful about eating sweets. A dietitian's guidance is especially important for people with diabetes. Supplements. Vitamins and minerals may be missing from your diet because you have to avoid so many foods. Dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement designed specifically for people with kidney failure. Take your prescribed supplement after treatment on the days you have hemodialysis. Never take vitamins that you can buy off the store shelf, since they may contain vitamins or minerals that are harmful to you. "
Financial Issues,"'Treatment for kidney failure is expensive, but Federal health insurance plans pay much of the cost, usually up to 80 percent. Often, private insurance or State programs pay the rest. Your social worker can help you locate resources for financial assistance. For more information, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Financial Help for Treatment of Kidney Failure''. ' "
Hope Through Research,"'The NIDDK, through its Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases, supports several programs and studies devoted to improving treatment for patients with progressive kidney disease and permanent kidney failure, including patients on hemodialysis. ''The U.S. Government does not endorse or favor any specific commercial product or company. Trade, proprietary, or company names appearing in this document are used only because they are considered necessary in the context of the information provided. If a product is not mentioned, the omission does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory. ' The End-Stage Renal Disease Program promotes research to reduce medical problems from bone, blood, nervous system, metabolic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and endocrine abnormalities in kidney failure and to improve the effectiveness of dialysis and transplantation. The research focuses on evaluating different hemodialysis schedules and on finding the most useful information for measuring dialysis adequacy. The program also seeks to increase kidney graft and patient survival and to maximize quality of life. The HEMO Study, completed in 2002, tested the theory that a higher dialysis dose and/or high-flux membranes would reduce patient mortality (death) and morbidity (medical problems). Doctors at 15 medical centers recruited more than 1,800 hemodialysis patients and randomly assigned them to high or standard dialysis doses and high- or low-flux filters. The study found no increase in the health or survival of patients who had a higher dialysis dose, who dialyzed with high-flux filters, or who did both. The U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) collects, analyzes, and distributes information about the use of dialysis and transplantation to treat kidney failure in the United States. The USRDS is funded directly by the NIDDK in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The USRDS publishes an Annual Data Report, which identifies the total population of people being treated for kidney failure; reports on incidence, prevalence, death rates, and trends over time; and develops data on the effects of various treatment approaches. The report also helps identify problems and opportunities for more focused special studies of renal research issues. The Hemodialysis Vascular Access Clinical Trials Consortium is conducting a series of multicenter, clinical trials of drug therapies to reduce the failure and complication rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts and fistulas in hemodialysis. These studies are randomized and placebo controlled, which means the studies meet the highest standard for scientific accuracy. AV grafts and fistulas prepare the arteries and veins for regular dialysis. See the NIDDK fact sheet Vascular Access for Hemodialysis for more information. Recently developed drugs to prevent blood clots may be evaluated in these large clinical trials. "

Why are blood creatinine levels checked?,"'The kidneys maintain the blood creatinine in a normal range. Creatinine has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of kidney function. Elevated creatinine level signifies impaired kidney function or ''kidney disease''.''As the kidneys become impaired for any reason, the creatinine level in the blood will rise due to poor clearance of creatinine by the kidneys. Abnormally high levels of creatinine thus warn of possible malfunction or failure of the kidneys. It is for this reason that standard blood tests routinely check the amount of creatinine in the blood.'""A more precise measure of the kidney function can be estimated by calculating how much creatinine is cleared from the body by the kidneys. This is referred to as creatinine clearance and it estimates the rate of filtration by kidneys (glomerular filtration rate, or GFR). The creatinine clearance can be measured in two ways. It can be calculated (estimated) by a formula using serum (blood) creatinine level, patient's weight, and age. The formula is 140 minus the patient's age in years times their weight in kilograms (times 0.85 for women), divided by 72 times the serum creatinine level in mg/dL. Creatinine clearance can also be more directly measured by collecting a 24-hour urine sample and then drawing a blood sample. The creatinine levels in both urine and blood are determined and compared. Normal creatinine clearance for healthy women is 88-128 mL/min. and 97 to 137 mL/min. in males (normal levels may vary slightly between labs).""'Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is another indicator of kidney function. Urea is also a metabolic byproduct which can build up if kidney function is impaired. The BUN-to-creatinine ratio generally provides more precise information about kidney function and its possible underlying cause compared with creatinine level alone. BUN also increases with ''dehydration''.''Recently, elevated creatinine levels in infants were associated with ''bacteremia'' while elevated levels in adult males have been linked to incresed risk of ''prostate cancer''.'  "
What are normal blood creatinine levels?,"'Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dL) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. (In the metric system, a milligram is a unit of weight equal to one-thousandth of a gram, and a deciliter is a unit of volume equal to one-tenth of a liter.)'  "
What are considered high creatinine levels?," A person with only one kidney may have a normal level of about 1.8 or 1.9. Creatinine levels that reach 2.0 or more in babies and 5.0 or more in adults may indicate severe kidney impairment. The need for a dialysis machine to remove wastes from the blood is based upon several considerations including the BUN, creatinine level, the potassium level and how much fluid the patient is retaining."
What are the symptoms associated with high creatinine levels?,"'The symptoms of kidney dysfunction (renal insufficiency) vary widely. They generally do not correlate with the level of creatinine in the blood.'   Some people may have an incidental finding of severe kidney disease and elevated creatinine on routine blood work without having any symptoms. In others, depending on the cause of the problem, different symptoms of kidney failure may be present including:feeling dehydrated,fatigue,swelling (edema),shortness of breath,confusion, ormany other nonspecific symptoms (for example, nausea, vomiting, neuropathy, and dry skin). feeling dehydrated, fatigue, swelling (edema), shortness of breath, confusion, or many other nonspecific symptoms (for example, nausea, vomiting, neuropathy, and dry skin)."
What causes elevated (high) creatinine levels in the blood?,"'Any condition that impairs the function of the kidneys is likely to raise the creatinine level in the blood. It is important to recognize whether the process leading to kidney dysfunction (''kidney failure'', azotemia) is longstanding or recent. Recent elevations may be more easily treated and reversed.''The most common causes of longstanding (chronic) kidney disease in adults are''Other causes of elevated blood creatinine levels are:'   high blood pressure and diabetes. Certain drugs (for example,cimetidine [Bactrim]) can sometimes cause abnormally elevated creatinine levels. Serum creatinine can also transiently increase after ingestion of a large amount of dietary meat; thus,nutrition can sometimes play a role in creatinine measurement. Kidney infections,rhabdomyolysis (abnormal muscle breakdown) and urinary tract obstruction may also elevate creatinine levels."
Who has low or high blood creatinine levels?," Muscular young or middle-aged adults may have more creatinine in their blood than the norm for the general population. Elderly persons may have less creatinine in their blood than the norm. Infants have normal levels of about 0.2 or more, depending on their muscle development. In people with malnutrition, severe weight loss, and long standing illnesses, the muscle mass tends to diminish over time and, therefore, their creatinine level may be lower than expected for their age."
What is the function of the kidneys?,"'The kidneys have a variety of important functions in the body. These functions include filtering and excreting the waste products from the blood as it circulates through capillaries within the kidneys, regulating ''blood pressure'', maintaining steady levels of ''electrolytes'' (for example, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and chloride), and contributing to the production of ''red blood cells''.' "
Where are the kidneys located?,"'The kidneys are located on either side of the body underneath the ''diaphragm'' near the lower back. Each kidney is connected to the bladder in the pelvis by ureters (long tube-like structures) that drain the urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Urine stored in the bladder is excreted from the body through the urethra. Collectively, these structures make up what is called the urinary tract.' "
What is a kidney infection? Is it the same as a urinary tract infection?,"'The main components of the urinary tract system are kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Any part of the urinary system may become infected and this is generally referred to as ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''). When a kidney becomes infected, the condition is medically referred to as pyelonephritis. Thus, kidney infection is only one of several types of infections encompassed by the term ''UTI''. The spectrum of ''UTIs'' includes:''A more general classification of ''urinary tract infection''\xa0includes:' Acute uncomplicated cystitis (bladder infection) Recurrent cystitis Complicated UTI Prostatitis (prostate infection) Kidney infection (pyelonephritis) Catheter-associated UTI (in individuals with indwelling urinary catheters) Lower urinary tract infection involves the urethra, the bladder, and, in men, the prostate gland. Upper urinary tract infection refers to infection of the kidneys."
What are the signs and symptoms of kidney infection?,"'Some of the ''common symptoms of kidney infection'' include:''Signs of kidney infection on exam may include:''In elderly patients and those with weak immune systems, kidney infection may be more severe with these conditions:'   fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, shivering, shaking -- chills, painful urination (dysuria), frequent urination (urinary frequency), urge to urinate (urinary urgency), flank and low and mid back pain (dull kidney pain), and generalized malaise. fever, tenderness on the flanks (costo-vertebral angle tenderness, referring to tenderness upon tapping gently on the mid back on the sides), and clinical evidence of infection in the urinalysis (laboratory analysis of urine). confusion, lethargy, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, and dehydration."
What are the causes of kidney infection?,"'Urine, similar to other fluids in the body, is normally sterile without any bacterial infection. Therefore, the presence of bacteria in the urine is considered abnormal and may lead to urinary tract infection. Typically, bacteria gain access to the urinary system from outside through the urethra (the drainage tube for urine from the bladder). The bacteria may then ascend in the urinary system and cause kidney infections. Kidney infection (upper UTI) is typically more severe than lower UTI because bacteria may also infect the bloodstream (''bacteremia'') from the kidneys resulting in a more severe illness.''Bacteria may travel from the rectum or the vagina towards the urethra to gain entry into the urinary system. Other bacteria may enter from the skin. Women are more susceptible to ''urinary tract infections'' due to the shorter length of their urethras in comparison to those of men.''Since kidney infection occurs when bacteria from the genital or anal areas enter the urinary tract, it is typically not contagious.'  "
What are risk factors for kidney and urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'There are many factors that may increase the chances for infection of the kidneys and urinary tract.''Premenopausal women are at higher risk for developing UTI and kidney infection. Risk factors within this population include:''In fact, some ''pregnant'' women may have urinary infections during their pregnancy. This may occur because of slower transit of urine in the ureters during pregnancy from the pressure applied by the enlarging uterus.''In post-menopausal women, physiological factors (''vaginal dryness'', ''urinary incontinence'', ''urinary retention'', and prolapse of the pelvic organs) seem to add potential risk to develop UTIs and kidney infections.''In men, ''prostate enlargement'' is the main risk factor for UTI and kidney infection.''Urinary catheters (Foley catheters) also increase the risk of developing urinary and kidney infections. These catheters are used in settings where an individual may not be able to urinate due to ''paralysis'' (neurogenic bladder), prostate enlargement (''BPH''), ''prostate cancer'', severe illness, bed bound state, ''incontinence of urine'' (inability to hold their urine), or bladder dysfunction. Urinary catheters simply provide a physical vehicle for the bacteria from outside to be directly transported into the bladder and the urinary system.''Kidney stones and structural abnormalities of the urinary system may also cause kidney infection. Impaired draining and blockage of urine (''urinary retention'') may cause bacteria to ascend to the kidney without being washed back down with the urine. Any obstruction to the flow of urine can serve as a focus of infection that can spread to other parts of the urinary tract.''Urinary ''stents'' placed in ureters to relieve obstruction due to stones or tumors are also a potential risk for kidney infection. As matter of fact, any instrumentation or procedure of the urinary system (stenting, ''cystoscopy'', biopsy, and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can pose a risk for infection of the urinary tract.''Diabetes'' may also increase the risk of kidney infection in both men and women. Other conditions or medications that suppress immune function increase the risk of kidney infection.''In children, risk factors for kidney infection include female gender, uncircumcised male, structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and Caucasian race (four times higher than African American).'   Sexual intercourse (for women -- may increase the risk of urinary tract infection because of possible introduction of the bacteria around the urethra into the urinary system [a condition sometimes referred to as ""honeymoon cystitis""]) Previous urinary tract infection Use of spermicides History of mother with recurrent UTIs (which suggests a possible genetic component to susceptibility) Pregnancy"
Is screening recommended for UTI or kidney infection?,"'In general, screening is not recommended for urinary tract infection and kidney infection in men and nonpregnant women.''While pregnant, screening may be recommended for women because bacteria in the urine without symptoms of infection are associated with a higher rate of progression to an overt urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis. These infections can potentially compromise the fetal growth and health.''Screening for bacteria in the urine without any symptoms is also recommended for any individual prior to undergoing instrumentation of the urinary tract or in men undergoing prostate procedures. Presence of bacteria in the urine with or without an infection can possibly lead to an increased chance for developing urinary tract infection. Treating these bacteria can substantially reduce infectious complications of such procedures.' "
How is kidney infection diagnosed?,"'Kidney infection may be diagnosed by a physician by performing a complete physical examination and taking a detailed medical history. The evaluation includes checking the vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rate), assessing for signs of ''dehydration'', and checking for tenderness on the mid and lower back. In young, female patients a ''pelvic exam'' may also be necessary to evaluate for pelvic infection (''pelvic inflammatory disease'' or PID). A ''pregnancy test'' may also be performed.'""Urinalysis test is essential for the diagnosis of kidney infection. The urine sample must be properly collected. The urethra needs to be wiped clean properly before the sample is collected in order to avoid contamination of urine by the bacteria on the skin around the urethra. The initial stream of urine is preferably voided in the toilet before the collecting urine in the provided container. This is called the mid-stream, clean-catch urine. After an appropriate amount of urine is collected (about 10 milliliters or cc's) in the container, the remaining urine may also be voided in toilet.""'A urinalysis suggestive of an infection in the urine (presence of white blood cells or bacteria in the urine) in general, is highly suggestive and supportive of the diagnosis of kidney infection or urinary tract infection. A urine sample without evidence of urine infection makes kidney infection unlikely and another diagnosis may be considered.''Once white blood cells and other indications of urine infection (such as, leukocyte esterase [produced by white blood cells in urine] or nitrites [produced by bacteria in urine]) are noted on the urinalysis, it is important to determine the amount and the type of bacteria in the urine sample. Generally, a urine sample that has greater than 100,000 bacteria in one cc of urine is considered diagnostic of urinary tract infection. In some clinical settings, counts of less than 100,000 bacteria in one cc of urine may also indicate kidney infection in a clinical setting supportive of this diagnosis.' "
What are different types of kidney infection?,"'Kidney infection, or pyelonephritis, may be classified as uncomplicated, complicated, or chronic kidney infection (long-term).''A ''complicated kidney infection'' refers to a kidney infection in which there is an accompanying condition that increases the risk of severe infection and ineffective treatment, such as abnormalities of the urinary tract, urinary obstruction, or ''diabetes''. It can also mean there is severe involvement of the kidney, for example, ''abscess'' formation, obstruction, or enlarged kidney, or ''gas'' seen in the kidney by an imaging study, such as a ''CT scan''. In these situations, the symptoms may be more severe and less responsive to usual treatments.''Chronic kidney infection'' may refer to recurring kidney infection that could be a result of a ''kidney stone'' obstructing the ureter or other structural abnormalities in the ureters (for example, vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which urine is forced back up toward the kidneys). These conditions are usually associated with milder symptoms, but they may last longer.''The evaluation of complicated kidney infection and chronic kidney infection typically require a more thorough evaluation and more extensive testing such as ''CT scans'' and ''X-rays''.' "
What are the common bacteria that cause kidney infections?,"'The most common bacteria responsible for kidney infection are ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli''), which accounts for close to 80% of cases of kidney and ''urinary tract infections''. Other common bacteria are ''Klebsiella'', ''Proteus'', ''Pseudomonas'', ''Enterococcus'', and ''Staphylococcus'' saprophyticus''.' "
What is the treatment for kidney infection?,"'The most important component of treating kidney infection (as with any bacterial infection) is timely initiation of antibiotics under the directions of a health care professional. If kidney infection is diagnosed, then an empiric antibiotic (an antibiotic that would cover all likely causative bacterial organisms) is usually prescribed. A urine and blood sample will be taken and sent to a laboratory for analysis of any bacterial growth (urine culture and blood culture).''When a specific type of bacteria is isolated, antibiotics may then be changed to those that are more active against that particular bacterial type. If the bacteria shows resistance (unresponsive) to the antibiotic that was initially prescribed, then the antibiotic is changed promptly to one that the organism is susceptible to in order to cure the kidney infection.''Home treatment with oral antibiotics and adequate water and fluid intake are usually sufficient for curing uncomplicated kidney infection and urinary tract infection. Nondrug home treatment with fluid intake, ''cranberry'' products, or ''acupuncture'' without antibiotics is not advisable for kidney infections.''However, if symptoms are severe (uncontrolled nausea and vomiting resulting in inability to take medications) or the infection is difficult to control with the routine oral medications for kidney infection, then hospitalization may be required to receive intravenous antibiotics, intravenous hydration, and aggressive management of symptoms. In cases of complicated kidney infection hospitalization may also be necessary.''Self-medication for kidney infection is considered only in patients with mild, recurrent urinary infections. In individuals who are reliable and familiar with the symptoms of kidney infection, appropriate antibiotics prescribed to them in advance by their treating physicians may be started at the onset of their symptoms.'

Are there foods I should avoid if I have a kidney infection?,"'There is no scientific data to suggest that avoiding any type of food while suffering from a kidney infection is harmful or beneficial. However, it is important to note that severe nausea and vomiting as well as poor appetite can occur with kidney infection. Therefore, it may be difficult to maintain adequate food and liquid requirements for patients with kidney infection, as this may lead to dehydration and worsening ''weakness''. The treating physician may prescribe medications to treat these symptoms.''Some natural remedies for kidney and urinary tract infection, cranberry and cranberry juice, may have a role in reducing the risk of future kidney infections. This approach seems to be more useful as a preventative measure than actual treatment.' "
Can kidney infection be prevented?,"'Hygiene: ''The main approach to ''prevention'' of kidney infection is proper hygiene. Because the majority of infections tend to happen due to the presence of bacteria entering the urinary tract from the urethra, proper personal hygiene plays a theoretical importance in preventing urinary infections. For example, in women, wiping the genital area from front to back after going to the bathroom may significantly prevent bacteria around the anus or vagina to gain access to the urethra. Hygienic use of bath tubs and ''douching'' may also have a preventive role, but is not universally supported by clinical experts.''Sex:'' Because sexual intercourse is another risk factor for kidney infection, it is advised to empty the bladder (urinate) after sexual activity to drain bacteria that may have entered the bladder. This practice, however, is not overwhelmingly proven by available clinical data and not recommended by some experts.''Antibiotics:'' Preventive antibiotic therapy can sometimes be helpful in women who have recurrent UTIs (more than 3 to 4 times per year). This could be guided by presence of symptoms suggestive of an infection or after sexual intercourse if infections are temporally associated with sexual intercourse. Preventive (prophylactic) antibiotics are also recommended for patients undergoing invasive urologic procedures when bacteria are detected in screening urine culture.''Hormonal therapy:'' Daily application of topical intravaginal (inside the vagina) estriol cream may reduce episodes of symptomatic UTI and kidney infection in ''postmenopausal'' women. On the contrary, oral estrogen did not significantly reduce episodes of UTI in these women.''Foods/''supplements'':'' Cranberry and cranberry juice or other cranberry products may have benefit in preventing urinary infections as demonstrated in some, but not all, research studies.''Catheters:'' Other important measures may apply to special situations. For example, in individuals for indwelling bladder catheters, it is important that the catheter is changed routinely under the guidance of a physician. The area around the catheter, especially where it enters the urethra, should be monitored and cleaned routinely.''Kidney stones:'' In patients with kidney infection who also have kidney stones, the stone may serve as a potential focus of infection that can spread to the rest of the urinary system. Therefore, these patients may be referred to a specialist (''urologist'') for evaluation and possible removal of the stone(s) to prevent future urinary infections.' "
What are the kidneys?,"'The kidneys are two organs whose major functions are to remove waste products and excess fluid from the body and to produce hormones that regulate ''blood pressure'', red blood cell production, acid regulation and to influence calcium, sodium, potassium and other ''electrolyte'' metabolism.'  "
Where are the kidneys located?,"'The kidneys are bean-shaped organs (about 11 cm x 7 cm x 3 cm) that are located against the back muscles in the upper abdominal area. They sit opposite each other on both the left and right side of the body; the right kidney, however, sits a little lower than the left to accommodate the size of the ''liver''.' "
What is the function of the kidneys?,"'The excess waste products and excess fluid are removed when the kidneys produce urine that is excreted from the body. Moreover, the kidneys play an important role in regulation of the body salt, potassium, and acid content.''The kidneys also produce hormones that stimulate the production of ''red blood cells'' that help regulate ''blood pressure'' and help control calcium and ''electrolyte'' metabolism in the body.' "
What are the first signs and symptoms that are associated with kidney pain?,"'Symptoms associated with kidney pain (also termed renal or flank pain) are discomfort (acute or chronic), aches, or sharp pain that occurs in the back between approximately the lowest rib and the buttock. Depending on the cause of the pain, it may radiate down the flank to the groin or toward the abdominal area. Some individuals may develop symptoms and signs such as:''Other symptoms and signs that may occur if the kidney function is increasingly compromised are a''Depending on the underlying cause, kidney pain may occur on the left or right side. Sometimes it can occur on both sides of the back; traumatic kidney injury (kidney laceration) may cause the above symptoms, but mild damage may initially have no symptoms. Severe kidney lacerations can cause abnormal blood pressure and pulse, and ''shock''.''Kidney pain itself is a symptom that may happen due to problems or diseases of the kidney or its associated structures, including the ureters or bladder. However, other diseases may mimic kidney pain, ''but are not actually due to the kidneys'', for example,''Although kidney pain often occurs on one side of the back, it can occur on both sides at the same time and may radiate toward the abdomen or groin.''Pain that occurs suddenly, is sharp, severe, and may increase and decrease in waves is often due ''kidney stones'' in the ureters of the kidneys. Pain caused by kidney stones is termed renal ''colic''.' Fever Painful urination (dysuria) Blood in the urine Nausea Vomiting Dizziness Constipation or diarrhea Rash Fatigue Chills metallic taste in the mouth, bad breath, swelling and shortness of breath. muscle strains in the back, spinal problems (fracture, abscesses), rib pain, pleuritis, radiculitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, shingles, aortic abdominal aneurysm, gynecological problems, and many other causes."
What are some examples of kidney conditions and diseases that cause pain?,"'Many of the causes of ''kidney disease'' that lead to kidney pain (also termed flank pain) are due to acquired underlying diseases that may acutely or chronically affect kidney function. Other diseases are present at birth. Some people may be born with an abnormality that is genetically determined that affects the kidneys.''Kidney pain or flank pain can be acute, relatively constant, and sharp. This is termed ""renal ''colic''."" This kind of pain is usually seen when a ''kidney stone'' or other problem blocks the tube (ureter) that drains the kidney. However, other processes can cause chronic dull aching with occasionally sharp kidney pain. Some of the causes of kidney pain or flank pain are as follows:'   Urinary tract infections (UTI) Bladder infection (cystitis) Kidney infections (pyelonephritis) Hydronephrosis Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis and/or ureterolithiasis) Kidney cancer Anything that compresses the kidney (for example, a large tumor) Glomerulonephritis Blood clots in the kidneys (renal vein thrombosis) Polycystic kidney disease (congenital) Congenital malformations in the renal system resulting in complete or partial blockage of urine flow Drugs or toxins that harm kidney tissue (for example, pesticide exposure or chronic use of medications such as ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin, and others]) Kidney pain during pregnancy Kidney bleeding (hemorrhage) such as from penetrating trauma or blunt trauma (""kidney laceration"") End-stage renal disease"
When should call a doctor for kidney pain?,"'Individuals should not postpone seeing a doctor about kidney pain or flank pain. Although flank pain is often seen in underlying problems with the kidney, there are many other diseases that can mimic kidney pain, and a physician can help with an accurate diagnosis of underlying problems that result in kidney or flank pain. Any acute onset of intense kidney or flank pain should be evaluated immediately.''Warning signs that ''kidney disease'' is present and may result in kidney pain or flank pain are the following:''In addition, if an individual has ''diabetes'' or any of the congenital problems that lead to kidney dysfunction, the individual should be routinely checked for the onset of kidney dysfunction or ''kidney failure'' by their physician.' Blood or protein in the urine More frequent urination, especially at night and/or difficult or painful urination High blood pressure Swelling of the hands and feet and/or puffiness around the eyes Testing that shows an abnormal creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 (calculated as ml/min/meter2)"
What procedures and tests diagnose kidney diseases?,"'The doctor usually will do a history and physical examination. Initial tests usually consist of a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), kidney function (''creatinine'' and BUN), and urine test, and when appropriate, a ''pregnancy test''. A lacerated kidney may be suspected if the person has experienced a traumatic injury to the lower back.''If kidney stones are suspected, a CT exam (renal protocol or noncontrast spiral CT) or renal ''ultrasound'' is done; an abdominal X-ray (KUB) may be ordered but has been replaced in general by ''ultrasound'' and CT. As patients with kidney stones often need repeat X-ray studies or have repeat episodes of kidney stones, ultrasound with its lack of ''radiation'' is a good study to consider. Abdominal/pelvic CTs with contrast or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') and aortogram may be ordered to further define or differentiate underlying kidney (renal) and nonrenal causes of flank pain. Such studies are routinely performed if a kidney is suspected to be damaged by a traumatic event (auto accident, gunshot ''wound'', or blunt trauma such as from a collision in football or workplace injury).' "
What is the treatment for kidney pain?,"   Kidney pain (flank pain) treatment depends on the underlying cause of the pain. Kidney infections and kidney stones that cause pain are often treated with ibuprofen, ketorolac (Toradol), acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), or occasionally with small amounts of morphine (kidney stones). However, these agents treat pain (pain relief only) and not the underlying cause(s) of pain. Some patients may spontaneously pass (urine sweeps the irritating kidney stone out of the ureters and/or urethra) small kidney stones (usually less than about 6 mm in diameter) and then be pain-free. Infections like urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pyelonephritis usually require antibiotic treatments in addition to pain medications. If kidney stones completely block a ureter or are about 6 mm in diameter or larger, they may require urologic surgery. Usually, recovery time is fast (same day or a few days) if kidney stones are removed by retrograde surgical techniques. However, some severe kidney lacerations may require more extensive surgery. Recovery time for these surgeries varies from weeks to months. Other underlying causes of flank pain may need similar pain management and concurrent treatments. However, patients with known kidney problems (kidney disease) and/or renal function compromise should not be treated with pain medications that are either filtered (removed) through the kidneys and/or may cause further renal damage."
What is back pain?,"'People may feel the ''pain'' almost anywhere in the back, from the base of the neck down to the tailbone. The ''pain'' may originate from any of the structures of the spine, including the''Pain'' can also begin elsewhere and radiate to the back. Some examples include the following:' vertebrae (bones of the spine), discs between the bones, nerves that exit the back to the rest of the body, and muscles and ligaments that support the back. Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Peptic ulcer disease, including ulcers or inflammation of the stomach and the duodenum Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) Abdominal aortic aneurysm that starts to expand or leak Kidney inflammation"
What is kidney pain?,'Kidney pain'' is a specific type of ''back pain'' arising from the kidney and causing symptoms in the flank. The flank is a rectangular area in the back from the lower rib cage to the iliac crest (the top bone of the pelvis) and the spine to the lateral part of the body.' 
Which signs and symptoms of kidney vs. back pain are different and similar?,"'Unless there is an acute injury, most mechanical ''back pain'' from muscles, ligaments, or bone will arise gradually and will be localized to the area of inflammation and strain.''Pain'' from nerve inflammation will follow the path of the nerve as it leaves the back and travels elsewhere in the body. For example, sciatic pain tends to travel from the low back to the buttock and then down the leg. Should a nerve become inflamed, there may be numbness and tingling, and the muscles that the nerve controls may develop ''weakness''.''Shingles'' can attack any nerve that leaves the spinal cord and it is associated with a ''blistering'' ''rash''. Most often the pain will occur a few days before the ''rash'' becomes visible.''When ''back pain'' is due to infection, ''fever'' may be present. Because those causes of ''back pain'' associated with ''fever'' are very uncommon, it sometime takes longer for the health care provider to make the diagnosis.''Pain from the kidney usually has other symptoms associated with it. Regardless of the cause, people with pain from their kidney also have ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Other symptoms give clues to the reason for ''kidney pain''.' If the pain is due to an infection, the flank pain tends to be constant, and there may be an associated fever and chills. Urine may appear dark or cloudy and smell foul. If there is an associated bladder infection, other symptoms might include frequent urination, urgency to urinate, and painful urination. Blood may be in the urine, as well. People who have kidney stones tend to have colicky, intense pain, meaning that the severe pain comes and goes, and there may be episodes in which the pain is more tolerable. There may or may not be blood visible in the urine. Those with bleeding into or surrounding their kidney may have bloody urine. Tumors of the kidney, ureter, or bladder can cause blood in the urine."
What are the causes and risk factors of kidney and back pain?,"'Back pain'' has numerous causes, depending upon the involved structure. Pain and inflammation of the muscles and ligaments in the back from an acute injury, or from chronic overuse, can cause significant pain.''Osteoporosis'' and decreased ''bone density'' can cause spontaneous compression ''fractures'' of vertebrae of the spine. ''Fractures'' (broken bones) may also occur due to ''trauma'' and acute injury.''The spinal nerves that exit the back can become irritated for a variety of reasons that cause the nerve to be inflamed. These include ruptured discs and ''arthritis'' of the back and narrowing of the spaces between the vertebral bodies. A common example is ''sciatica'', inflammation of the ''sciatic nerve'' that causes pain in the back that may radiate down the leg.''Tumors can affect all structures that make up the back and cause pain. Those tumors may be benign or ''malignant''. They can be primary, arising from the back structure, or metastatic, having spread from another part of the body.''All the structures located in the area of the back have the potential to become infected and cause pain. Some examples include the following:''Inflammation of the kidney causes kidney pain and is most often due to a ''kidney infection'', bleeding inside or surrounding the kidney, or obstruction of the kidney.''Kidney infection'', or ''pyelonephritis'' = pyelo (central structure of the kidney called the renal pelvis) + neph or renal (kidney) + itis (inflammation), can be a result of a ''bladder infection'' in which the bacteria climb up the ureter to invade the kidney. Infection may also enter the kidney through the bloodstream should there be an infection elsewhere in the body.''Bleeding in and around the kidney may occur because of an injury (''trauma'') or may occur spontaneously in people who take anticoagulation (blood thinning) medication. Kidney tumors may also cause bleeding in the kidney.''Kidney pain from obstruction is most often due to ''kidney stones'', but ''blood clots'"" and tumors can also prevent urine from draining from the kidney down the ureter into the bladder. The kidney continues to make urine, even if it can't easily drain. This causes the kidney to swell and become inflamed, causing pain. Too much swelling and inflammation within the kidney may cause that one kidney to stop working. Fortunately, most people have another kidney to help remove waste from the body.""  Shingles, a complication of chickenpox, which is an infection of the nerves Osteomyelitis, bone infection of the vertebral body Discitis, infection of the discs located between the vertebral bodies"
What procedures and tests diagnose kidney and back pain?,"'The most important first steps in helping make the diagnosis of back or kidney pain is for the health care provider to talk to the patient, take a history of the illness and examine the patient. Most often, this can help determine the cause of the ''back pain'' and direct what tests might be done to confirm the diagnosis.''If concern is that the kidney is the cause of the pain, then a ''urinalysis'' or urine sample is most helpful and can help guide further testing. If infection is a concern, urine and blood cultures may be helpful. Most often, patients begin antibiotics before culture results come back, but the results may allow a more specific antibiotic to be chosen.''If a ''kidney stone'' is a concern, the provider may choose to treat the patient based on the history, physical exam, and evidence of ''blood in the urine'', especially if the patient has had kidney stones in the past. For patients with their first stone, imaging the kidneys may be appropriate. This can be done with ''ultrasound'' or ''CT scan''.''Regardless of the cause of the kidney pain, the provider may choose to evaluate kidney function. Some blood tests include BUN (blood urea nitrogen), ''creatinine'', and GFR (glomerular filtration rate).''If the ''back pain'' is thought to be due to bones, muscles, nerves, or other structures of the back, the health care provider may or may not need to image the back with plain ''X-rays'', CT, or ''MRI'' scanning. Other tests depend upon the symptoms and potential underlying cause.''Health care providers are aware that back symptoms may arise from a source away from the back and the pain and may need to order tests that may not be directly related to the back.' "
What treatments for kidney and back pain are different and similar?,"'There are numerous causes of ''back pain'' and the health care provider will help choose the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment path for the specific cause.''For ''strains'' of the back, rest, ice, stretching, and muscle strengthening may be all that is required. But if there is evidence of nerve inflammation, it may be necessary to explore other treatment options for pain and to prevent long term complications.''Often it is difficult for people to know that pain is coming from their kidney, but people with kidney stones have intense pain and often require a visit to the emergency department for pain control.''There are some symptoms that should alert the patient or family that they should seek care quickly.'  Symptoms of urinary tract infection, including urgency, frequency, pain with urination, and/or fever Back pain associated with nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain that radiates to the back or flank Blood in the urine is never normal and should not be ignored. Back pain with muscle weakness, numbness, or fever Difficulty or inability to urinate Loss of bowel control"
What is the prognosis for kidney and back pain?,'The prognosis for these symptoms depends upon the cause of the pain.' 
What is a kidney stone (nephrolithiasis)?,"'A kidney stone is a hard, crystalline mineral material formed within the kidney or urinary tract. Kidney stones are a common cause of ''blood in the urine'' (hematuria) and often severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. Kidney stones are sometimes called renal calculi.''The condition of having kidney stones is termed nephrolithiasis. Having stones at any location in the urinary tract is referred to as urolithiasis, and the term ureterolithiasis is used to refer to stones located in the ureters.' "
Who is at risk for kidney stones?,"'Anyone may develop a kidney stone, but people with certain diseases and conditions (see below) or those who are taking certain medications are more susceptible to their development. Urinary tract stones are more common in men than in women. Most urinary stones develop in people 20 to 49 years of age, and those who are prone to multiple attacks of kidney stones usually develop their first stones during the second or third decade of life. People who have already had more than one kidney stone are prone to developing further stones.''In residents of industrialized countries, kidney stones are more common than stones in the bladder. The opposite is true for residents of developing areas of the world, where bladder stones are the most common. This difference is believed to be related to dietary factors. People who live in the southern or southwestern regions of the U.S. have a higher rate of kidney stone formation, possibly due to inadequate water intake leading to ''dehydration'', than those living in other areas. Over the last few decades, the percentage of people with kidney stones in the U.S. has been increasing, most likely related to the ''obesity'' epidemic.''A family history of kidney stones is also a risk factor for developing kidney stones. Kidney stones are more common in Asians and Caucasians than in Native Americans, Africans, or African Americans.''Uric acid kidney stones are more common in people with chronically elevated uric acid levels in their blood (''hyperuricemia'').''A small number of ''pregnant'' women develop kidney stones, and there is some evidence that ''pregnancy''-related changes may increase the risk of stone formation. Factors that may contribute to stone formation during pregnancy include a slowing of the passage of urine due to increased ''progesterone'' levels and diminished fluid intake due to a decreasing bladder capacity from the enlarging uterus. Healthy pregnant women also have a mild increase in their urinary calcium excretion. However, it remains unclear whether the changes of pregnancy are directly responsible for kidney stone formation or if these women have another underlying factor that predisposes them to kidney stone formation.' "
What causes kidney stones?,"'Kidney stones form when there is a decrease in urine volume and/or an excess of stone-forming substances in the urine. The most common type of kidney stone contains calcium in combination with either oxalate or phosphate. A majority of kidney stones are calcium stones. Other chemical compounds that can form stones in the urinary tract include uric acid, magnesium ammonium phosphate (which forms struvite stones; see below), and the amino acid cysteine.''Dehydration from reduced fluid intake or strenuous ''exercise'' without adequate fluid replacement increases the risk of kidney stones. Obstruction to the flow of urine can also lead to stone formation. In this regard, climate may be a risk factor for kidney stone development, since residents of hot and dry areas are more likely to become dehydrated and susceptible to stone formation.''Kidney stones can also result from infection in the urinary tract. These are known as struvite or infection stones. Metabolic abnormalities, including ''inherited'"" disorders of metabolism, can alter the composition of the urine and increase an individual's risk of stone formation. ""

  "
Other medical conditions which cause kidney stones,"'A number of different medical conditions can lead to an increased risk for developing kidney stones:' Gout results in chronically increased amount of uric acid in the blood and urine and can lead to the formation of uric acid kidney stones. Hypercalciuria (high calcium in the urine), another inherited condition, causes stones in more than half of cases. In this condition, too much calcium is absorbed from food and excreted into the urine, where it may form calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate kidney stones. Other conditions associated with an increased risk of kidney stones include hyperparathyroidism, kidney diseases such as renal tubular acidosis, and other inherited metabolic conditions, including cystinuria and hyperoxaluria. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) are also associated with an increased risk of developing kidney stones. People with inflammatory bowel disease are also more likely to develop kidney stones. Those who have undergone intestinal bypass or ostomy surgery are also at increased risk for kidney stones. Some medications also raise the risk of kidney stones. These medications include some diuretics, calcium-containing antacids, and the protease inhibitor indinavir (Crixivan), a drug used to treat HIV infection. Dietary factors and practices may increase the risk of stone formation in susceptible individuals. In particular, inadequate fluid intake predisposes to dehydration, which is a major risk factor for stone formation. Other dietary practices that may increase an individual's risk of forming kidney stones include a high intake of animal protein, a high-salt diet, excessive sugar consumption, excessive vitamin D supplementation, and excessive intake of oxalate-containing foods such as spinach. Interestingly, low levels of dietary calcium intake may alter the calcium-oxalate balance and result in the increased excretion of oxalate and a propensity to form oxalate stones. Hyperoxaluria as an inherited condition is uncommon and is known as primary hyperoxaluria. The elevated levels of oxalate in the urine increase the risk of stone formation. Primary hyperoxaluria is much less common than hyperoxaluria due to dietary factors as mentioned above."
What are the early signs and symptoms of kidney stones?,"'While some kidney stones may not produce symptoms (known as ""silent"" stones), people who have kidney stones often report the sudden onset of excruciating, cramping pain in their low back and/or side, groin, or abdomen. Changes in body position do not relieve this pain. The abdominal, groin, and/or ''back pain'' typically waxes and wanes in severity, characteristic of colicky pain (the pain is sometimes referred to as renal ''colic''). It may be so severe that it is often accompanied by ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. The pain has been described by many as the worst pain of their lives, even worse than the pain of ''childbirth'' or broken bones. Kidney stones also characteristically cause ''bloody urine''. If infection is present in the urinary tract along with the stones, there may be ''fever'' and ''chills''. Sometimes, symptoms such as ''difficulty urinating'', ''urinary urgency'', ''penile pain'', or ''testicular pain'' may occur due to kidney stones.'

  "
How are kidney stones diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of kidney stones is suspected when the typical pattern of symptoms is noted and when other possible causes of the abdominal or flank pain are excluded. Which is the ideal test to diagnose kidney stones is controversial. Imaging tests are usually done to confirm the diagnosis. Many patients who go to the emergency room will have a non-contrast CT scan done. This can be done rapidly and will help rule out other causes for flank or ''abdominal pain''. However, a CT scan exposes patients to significant ''radiation'', and recently, ultrasound in combination with plain abdominal ''X-rays'' have been shown to be effective in diagnosing kidney stones.''In pregnant women or those who should avoid radiation exposure, an ultrasound examination may be done to help establish the diagnosis. ' "
What is the treatment for kidney stones? How long does it take to pass a kidney stone?,"'Most kidney stones eventually pass through the urinary tract on their own within 48 hours, with ample fluid intake. ''Ketorolac'' (''Toradol''), an injectable anti-inflammatory drug, and narcotics may be used for pain control when ''over-the-counter'' pain control medications are not effective. Toradol, ''aspirin'', and ''NSAIDs'' must be avoided if lithotripsy is to be done because of the increased risk of bleeding or if there is impaired kidney function. Intravenous pain medications can be given when ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' are present.''Although there are no proven home remedies to dissolve kidney stones, home treatment may be considered for patients who have a known history of kidney stones. Since most kidney stones, given time, will pass through the ureter to the bladder on their own, treatment is directed toward control of symptoms. Home care in this case includes the consumption of plenty of fluids. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') may be used as pain medication if there is no contraindication to its use. If further pain medication is needed, stronger narcotic pain medications may be recommended.''There are several factors that influence the ability to pass a stone. These include the size of the person, prior stone passage, ''prostate enlargement'', pregnancy, and the size of the stone. A 4 mm stone has an 80% chance of passage while a 5 mm stone has a 20% chance. Stones larger than 9 mm to 10 mm rarely pass without specific treatment.''Some medications have been used to increase the passage rates of kidney stones. These include ''calcium channel blockers'' such as ''nifedipine'' (Adalat, ''Procardia'', ''Afeditab'', ''Nifediac'') and alpha blockers such as ''tamsulosin'' (''Flomax''). These ''drugs'' may be prescribed to some people who have stones that do not rapidly pass through the urinary tract.''For kidney stones that do not pass on their own, a procedure called lithotripsy is often used. In this procedure, ''shock'' waves are used to break up a large stone into smaller pieces that can then pass through the urinary system.''Surgical techniques have also been developed to remove kidney stones when other treatment methods are not effective. This may be done through a small incision in the skin (percutaneous nephrolithotomy) or through an instrument known as an ureteroscope passed through the urethra and bladder up into the ureter.'

Can kidney stones be prevented?,"'Rather than having to undergo treatment, it is best to avoid kidney stones in the first place when possible. It can be especially helpful to drink more water, since low fluid intake and dehydration are major risk factors for kidney stone formation.'""Depending on the cause of the kidney stones and an individual's medical history, changes in the diet or medications are sometimes recommended to decrease the likelihood of developing further kidney stones. If one has passed a stone, it can be particularly helpful to have it analyzed in a laboratory to determine the precise type of stone so specific ""'prevention'' measures can be considered.''People who have a tendency to form calcium oxalate kidney stones may be advised to limit their consumption of foods high in oxalate, such as spinach, rhubarb, Swiss chard, beets, wheat germ, and peanuts. Also drinking lemon juice or lemonade may be helpful in preventing kidney stones.'  "
What is the prognosis for kidney stones?,"'Most kidney stones will pass on their own, and successful treatments have been developed to remove larger stones or stones that do not pass. People who have had a kidney stone remain at risk for future stones throughout their lives.' "
Are home remedies effective for kidney stones?,"'For some people who have had many kidney stones, home care may be appropriate. When passing a kidney stone, drinking lots of fluid is important. In fact, this is the most important home care measure. Medications may help control the pain (as described previously). However, if it is the first time one has had symptoms suggestive of a kidney stone, it is important to see a doctor right away. ' "
What is childhood depression?,"""Clinically significant depression is being severe enough to interfere with one's ability to function. It is quite common at every age, affecting more than 16% of children in the United States at some time in their lives and thought to be increasing in children and adolescents, both in this country and elsewhere. Other statistics about depression include its tendency to occur at a rate of about 2% prior to the teenage years and at approximately 5%-8% when both adolescents and children younger than adolescence are considered. It is a leading cause of health impairment (morbidity) and death (mortality). About 3,000 adolescents and young adults die by ""'suicide'' each year in the United States, making it the third leading cause of death in people 10-24 years of age.' "
What are the types of depression in children?,"'Children may suffer from the episodes of moderate to severe depression associated with major depressive disorder, or more chronic, mild to moderate low mood of ''dysthymia''. Depression may also be part of other mood disorders like ''bipolar disorder'', as a ''result of psychosis (for example, having symptoms of ''delusions'' or ''hallucinations''), as part of a medical condition like ''hypothyroidism'', or the result of exposure to certain medications such as ''cold'' medications or ''drug abuse'', like ''cocaine'' withdrawal.' "
What are causes and risk factors for depression in children?,"'Depressive disorders in children does not have one specific cause. Rather, people with these conditions tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors to its development. Biologically, depression is associated with a deficient level of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, a smaller size of some areas of the brain and increased activity in other parts of the brain. Girls are more likely to be given the diagnosis of depression than boys, but that is thought to be due to, among other things, biological differences based on gender, and differences in how girls are encouraged to interpret their experiences and respond to it as opposed to boys. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic component to the pattern of children, and ''teens'' with a depressed parent are as much as four times more likely to also develop the disorder. Children who have depression or ''anxiety'' are more prone to have other biological problems, like low birth weight, suffering from a physical condition, trouble sleeping, and to having a mother younger than 18 years old at the time of their birth.''Psychological contributors to depression include low self-esteem, negative social skills, negative ''body image'', being excessively self-critical, and often feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. Children who suffer from conduct disorder, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), clinical ''anxiety'', or who have cognitive or learning problems, as well as trouble engaging in social activities, also have more risk of developing depression.''Depression may be a reaction to life stresses, like ''trauma'', including verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, the death of a loved one, school problems, ''bullying'', or suffering from peer pressure. Youth who are struggling to adapt to the United States culture have found to be at higher risk for developing depression. Research differs as to whether ''obese'' children have an increased risk of developing depression.''Other contributors to this condition include poverty and financial difficulties in general, exposure to violence, social isolation, parental conflict, divorce, and other causes of disruptions to family life. Children who have limited physical activity, poor school performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for developing depression, as well.' "
What are the symptoms and warning signs of depression in children?,"'Clinical depression'', also called ''major depression'', is more than sadness that lasts for a day or two. In true depressive illnesses, the symptoms last weeks, months, or sometimes years if not treated. Depression often results in the sufferer being unable to perform daily activities, such as getting out of bed or getting dressed, performing well at school, or playing with peers. General symptoms of a major depressive episode, regardless of age, include having a depressed mood or irritability or difficulty experiencing pleasure for at least two weeks and having at least five of the following signs and symptoms:''Children with depression may also experience the classic symptoms but may exhibit other symptoms as well, including''Examples of risk-taking behaviors in children include unsafe play, like climbing excessively high or ''running'' in the street.''Parents of infants and children with depression often report noticing the following behavior changes in the child:'   Feeling sad or blue and/or irritable or seeming that way as observed by others (for examples, tearfulness or otherwise looking persistently sad, or angry) Significant appetite changes, with or without significant weight loss, failing to gain weight appropriately or gaining excessive weight Change in sleep pattern: trouble sleeping or sleeping too much Physical agitation or retardation (for example, restlessness or feeling slowed down) Fatigue or low energy/loss of energy Difficulty concentrating Feeling worthless, excessively guilty, or tend to self-blame Thoughts of death or suicide impaired performance of schoolwork, persistent boredom, quickness to anger, frequent physical complaints, like headaches and stomachaches, more risk-taking behaviors and/or showing less concern for their own safety. Crying more often or more easily Increased sensitivity to criticism or other negative experiences More irritable mood than usual or compared to others their age and gender, leading to vocal or physical outbursts, defiant, destructive, angry or other acting out behaviors Eating patterns, sleeping patterns, or significant increase or decrease in weight change, or the child fails to achieve appropriate gain weight for their age Unexplained physical complaints (for examples, headaches or abdominal pain) Social withdrawal, in that the youth spends more time alone, away from friends and family Developing more ""clinginess"" and more dependent on certain relationships (This is not as common as social withdrawal.) Overly pessimistic, hopeless, helpless, excessively guilty or feeling worthless Expressing thoughts about hurting him or herself or engaging in self-injury (like cutting or burning him or herself), reckless or other potentially harmful behavior Young children may act younger than their age or than they had before (regress)."
How do health care professionals diagnose depression in children? What health care specialists diagnose and treat childhood depression?,"'Many health care providers can help determine if the diagnosis of clinical depression is appropriate in children, including licensed mental health counselors, pediatricians, other primary care providers, specialists seen for a medical problem, emergency room doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and social workers. Due to the societal stigma that can be associated with receiving mental health treatment, pediatricians and other primary care doctors are often the first professionals approached for diagnosis and treatment of depression. The practitioner consulted to assess a child for depression will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical interview and physical examination as part of assigning the correct diagnosis. Depression is associated with a number of other mental health conditions, like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), ''autism''-spectrum disorders, ''bipolar disorder'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''), and ''anxiety'' disorders, so the evaluator will likely screen for signs and symptoms of ''manic'' depression (''bipolar disorder''), a history of trauma, and other mental health symptoms. Childhood depression also may be associated with a number of medical problems, or it can be a side effect of various medications, exposure to ''drugs'' of abuse or other toxins. Therefore, health care professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial assessment to rule out other causes of symptoms. Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study. As part of the evaluation, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help determine the risk of depression and suicide.' "
What should parents do if they suspect that their child is depressed?,"""Family members and friends should seek mental health assessment and treatment for the depressed child. Adult family members may confer with the child's primary care doctor or seek mental health services by contacting one of the resources indicated below. Once the child with depression is receiving treatment, family members can promote good mental health by gently encouraging him or her to have a healthy lifestyle, including encouraging the child to maintain a healthy ""'diet'', including adequate water intake, get enough ''sleep'', ''exercise'' regularly, remain socially active, and to engage in healthy ''stress''-management activities. Research that analyzed the results of several studies (meta-analysis) has found that the positive impact of ''exercise'' on mood is even more than assumed due to its being part of a healthy lifestyle. Parents and other loved ones can also be helpful to the depressed child by discouraging him or her from engaging in risky behaviors.' "
What is the treatment for depression in children?,"'If it is determined that your child is suffering from clinical depression, the health care professional likely will recommend treatment. Treatment options may include alleviating any medical condition that causes or worsens depression. For example, a person who has low levels of ''thyroid hormone'' might receive hormone replacement with levothyroxine (''Synthroid''). Other aspects of treatment may include supportive therapy, like lifestyle and behavioral changes, psychotherapy, complementary treatments, and possibly medication for moderate to severe depression. If symptoms are severe enough that treatment with medication is appropriate, symptoms tend to improve faster and for a longer period when medication is combined with psychotherapy.'""Most mental health professionals will continue treatment of major depression for six months to a year to prevent a reoccurrence of symptoms. Treatment for children with depression can have a significantly positive effect on the child's functioning with peers, family members, and at school. Without treatment, symptoms tend to last much longer, may not improve, or may worsen. With treatment, the chances of recovery are significantly improved.""'Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") is a kind of mental health counseling that entails working with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with depression. It can be a powerfully effective intervention, even resulting in positive biochemical changes in the brain. For ''babies'', music therapy and infant ''massage'' are useful interventions. Two major kinds of psychotherapy commonly treat childhood depression: interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In general, these forms of treatment take weeks to months to complete and has a goal of alleviating depressive symptoms. More intensive psychotherapy may be needed for a longer period of time when treating very severe depression or for depression that is accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms.''Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This form of psychotherapy seeks to alleviate depressive symptoms by helping child with depression develop more effective skills for coping with their emotions and relationships. IPT uses two strategies to achieve those goals:''Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This approach to psychotherapy helps to decrease depression and the likelihood it will come back by helping the child change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to achieve these goals.''The most commonly used group of antidepressant medications prescribed for children is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI medications influence the levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing professionals, these medications are the first choice because of the significant degree of effectiveness and safety of this group of medicines. Examples of these medications are listed here with the generic name first and the brand name in parentheses.''Only Prozac and Lexapro are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat childhood depression and only in those 8 years of age and older for Prozac, 12 years old and older for Lexapro. Any other medications used to treat this condition in children or using an antidepressant in younger children is therefore considered to be being used ""off label."" In fact, the use of Paxil has fallen out of favor due to its lack of consistent efficacy in the context of the risk of possible side effects.''Although FDA approved for use in teenagers with ''schizophrenia'' rather than for depression, atypical neuroleptic medications like ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify'') and ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal'') are sometimes prescribed in addition to an antidepressant in children who either suffer from severe depression, fail to improve after receiving a trial of an antidepressant in addition to, or instead of, an antidepressant in children who have bipolar disorder.''Doctors sometimes prescribe non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications with an antidepressant to treat children with severe unipolar depression who do not improve after receiving trials of different ''antidepressants''. Physicians might consider these medications in addition to or instead of an antidepressant in children who suffer from bipolar disorder.''Examples of such non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers include ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal''). Of the non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers, lamotrigine (Lamictal) seems to be unique in its ability to treat unipolar depression effectively by itself as well as in addition to an antidepressant. However, only people 16 years of age or older use the drug due to potentially serious side effects.''Other antidepressant medications work differently than the commonly used SSRIs. Physicians may prescribe the following medications when SSRIs have not worked: ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), or levomilnacipran (Fetzima).''About 60% of children who take antidepressant medication improve. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to start feeling better. The prescribing professional will likely assess the depressed child who is receiving the medication again soon after it is started to determine if the medication is being well tolerated and if symptoms have begun to improve. If not, the doctor or other prescriber might adjust the dose of the medication or prescribe a different one.''After symptoms start to improve, the prescribing health care professional will likely encourage the parents of the depressed child to continue giving the medication for six months to a year because stopping the medication too soon may result in symptoms returning or worsening. Some people need to take the medication for longer to prevent the depression from returning. Stopping treatment abruptly may cause the depression to return or for withdrawal effects (discontinuation syndrome) to occur, depending on which medication the doctor prescribes.''Side effects of antidepressant medications vary significantly from drug to drug and from person to person.''People use a number of nonprescription herbal ''supplements'"" like St. John's wort and ""'dietary supplements'' like ''vitamin C'' and B complex ''vitamins'' as remedies for depression. There is little known about the safety, effectiveness, or appropriate doses of these remedies, despite their being taken by thousands of people around the world.'  Educating the child, his or her parents, and other family members about the nature of depression: The therapist will reassure the child and his or her loved ones that depression is a common illness and that most people tend to improve with treatment. Defining problems (such as abnormal grief or interpersonal conflicts): The therapist can help the child set realistic goals for solving problems and work with him or her and the child's family using different treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to establish positive expectations for treatment and promote the child's participation in treatment. Cognitive component: This promotes identifying the thoughts and assumptions that play a role in the child's behaviors, especially those that may predispose the sufferer to being depressed. Behavioral component: This uses behavior-modification methods to teach the child more effective ways of dealing with problems. Fluoxetine (Prozac) Sertraline (Zoloft) Paroxetine (Paxil) Fluvoxamine (Luvox) Citalopram (Celexa) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Vortioxetine (Trintellix) Vilazodone (Viibryd) Common side effects can include dry mouth, upset stomach, nausea, tremor, insomnia, blurred vision, constipation, and dizziness. In rare cases, some people of all ages become acutely more depressed when on the medication, even having suicidal or homicidal thoughts, and/or attempting or completing suicide or homicide. Children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to this rare possibility. However, when considering this risk, it is imperative to consider the risk of the possibly serious outcomes that can result from untreated depression. While some of the best-known alternative remedies continue to be studied to see how well they work, there remains little evidence that herbal supplements effectively treat moderate to severe clinical depression. Medical professionals are often hesitant to recommend herbs or dietary supplements to treat depression, particularly in children, because the FDA doesn't regulate them (as prescription drugs are) to ensure their purity, quality, and effectiveness."
What are complications of depression in children?,"'Depression during childhood puts sufferers at risk for developing a number of other mental health issues. Children with depression are also more likely to have poor academic performance and to engage in ''alcohol'' and other ''drug abuse''. As adults, people who had depression during childhood and adolescence are at risk for having trouble maintaining employment, as well as family and other social disruptions during adulthood.' "
What is the prognosis for depression in children?,"'Depression can be chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode of the disorder will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. Depressed individuals exposed to trauma are less likely to respond to treatment with antidepressant medication than those who have not experienced trauma. Young people with depression are more likely to develop severe ''mental illness'' during adulthood compared to children who do not suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States for people over 5 years of age, particularly for females. Childhood depression is a risk factor for a number of potentially negative outcomes, like academic and interpersonal problems, as well as issues with drugs and attempting suicide and engaging in other forms of self-harm. Since early treatment of childhood depression improves the prognosis, improving access to care (including encouraging parents and other family members to seek mental health treatment for their child) promotes a better prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent depression in children?,"""For children, from infancy through the teenage years, strong, healthy parent-child attachment can help protect the child from developing depression. Parental behaviors that tend to foster health attachment with their children involve consistent love and care, as well as attentive responsiveness to the child's needs, including age-appropriate steps toward the child's gradual independence.""""Preventing depression in childhood tends to involve addressing risk factors, both specific and nonspecific, strengthening other protective factors, and using an appropriate approach for the child's developmental level. Such programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well as family based prevention strategies because research shows that these interventions are the most effective.""""Protective factors for adolescent depression include involving supportive adults, strong family and peer relationships, healthy coping skills, and emotional regulation. Children of a depressed parent tend to be more resilient when the child is more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their relationships, as well as being able to understand their parents' condition. For depressed parents, their children seem to be less likely to develop the disorder when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to ""'parenting'' and to relationships.' "

What is the killer cold virus?,"'The term ""killer cold virus"" was applied to a new strain of adenovirus (Adenoviridae) termed adenovirus 14, adenovirus type 14, or Ad14 that appeared in multiple outbreaks worldwide since the 1950s and that has caused severe ''pneumonia'' and deaths in several different groups of individuals. People use this term because typical adenoviruses cause symptoms of the ''common cold'', not severe ''pneumonia'' or death in most people. Investigations are done by state and city health authorities, the U.S. Air Force, and CDC during several outbreaks showed that Ad14 is a rarely reported but emerging serotype of adenovirus that can cause severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease in anyone, including healthy adults. In 2006, a 12-day-old died from Ad14. Fortunately, Ad14 infections are uncommon, and most infections from Ad14 ''strains'' are not serious; the severe or fatal outcomes from Ad14 are rare for this ''common cold'' virus. However, the name ""killer cold virus"" has stuck with the Ad14 strain of adenovirus infection. Health officials first identified the virus in the 1950s when adenoviruses were first isolated from human ''adenoids''. (Adenovirus is named after adenoids.) The number 14 of Ad14 represents the antigenic ''makeup'"" of the strain or type; currently, there are at least 52 strains (antigenically distinct) that immunologic techniques can distinguish. These viruses have a double-stranded DNA that lab experiments can easily modify and apparently can undergo changes in the environment that may change Ad14's ability to infect cells and cause disease. People infrequently report or encounter the Ad14 strain, while Ad4 and Ad7 strains are the most widespread adenovirus strains (account for about 80% of adenoviral infections).""'Many different strains or types (serotypes) of viruses cause adenovirus infections. A human adenovirus occasionally may behave like Ad14 but usually produces a set of symptoms that is characteristic of that type or strain. For example, types 8, 9, 37, 53, and 54 can cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, while types 40 and 4 can cause ''gastroenteritis'' in children. However, in 2018, an outbreak of an Ad7 serotype was reported that acts like its close relative, Ad14, and has produced 11 deaths in a facility for children with serious pre-existing medical problems and the death of an 18-year-old college student with medical problems.' "
Is adenovirus 14 contagious?,"'Yes, Ad14 is contagious person to person. Usually, an individual acquires Ad14 through person-to-person exposure via droplets containing Ad14 expelled by an infected person who ''coughs'' or sneezes. When these droplets reach the eyes, nose, or mouth, the Ad14 virus can attach and infect cells. These infected sites allow the virus to proliferate in some patients, and the virus then may go on to infect other organ systems, especially the ''lungs''.' "
How does adenovirus 14 spread?,"'Droplets produced by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' usually transmit the virus. Ad14 also passes through direct hand-to-hand contact if an infected patient has not washed their hands after coughing or sneezing. Adenoviruses can survive for days on objects like doorknobs, hand rails, and other objects. If a non-infected person touches the contaminated item, they can pick up the virus and then transfer it to a site (mouth, nose, eyes) where the virus can infect cells and proliferate.' "
"What are risk factors for an 
adenovirus 14 infection?","'Risk factors include crowded living conditions like schools, day care facilities, dorms or barracks, lack of hand-washing, utilization of public transit, and close association with an infected individual. Immunosuppressed people may be at high risk.' "
What is the incubation period for an adenovirus 14 infection?,"'The incubation period (time from infection to showing symptoms) is variable and ranges from about two days to two weeks with about a five- to eight-day average.''Unfortunately, the contagious period for this virus begins when the virus sheds in respiratory droplets and feces. This can begin in the incubation period and can continue shedding for months after the person has recovered and has no signs or symptoms of the illness.' "
"How long does it take to get over an 
adenovirus 14 infection?",'Most infections last about five days (range is about three to seven days). Severe infections may last two or more weeks.' 
"What are symptoms and signs of an 
adenovirus 14 infection?","'Adenovirus 14 infections usually begin with cold symptoms such as:''The majority of infected people have these types of symptoms for several days (about three to five days), and then the respiratory tract infection clears without any medical treatment. However, with some individuals, infection with the adenovirus 14 strain (and rarely a few other strains such as 3, 7, 21, 30) progresses past the three to five days, causing additional symptoms. These symptoms may include:''Although medical professionals have found infection with Ad14 in a few isolated individuals, most recent outbreaks have occurred with groups of individuals living in close contact. For example, the 2007 outbreak occurred in a military installation (Lackland AFB) in San Antonio, TX, while the 2008 outbreak was in a small community in Alaska. A group of individuals that appears very ill (require hospitalization) due to respiratory problems, and are likely due to a ""virus,"" should make clinicians suspect Ad14 as a possible cause of infection.'   a cough, runny nose, and mild fever and possibly throat irritation. diarrhea, bronchitis/pharyngitis, eye infections (conjunctivitis), bladder infection, rash, high fevers (febrile), swollen lymph nodes, pneumonia, and shortness of breath (dyspnea)."
How do health care professionals diagnose an adenovirus 14 infection?,"'Diagnosis begins with a complete medical history and physical exam, especially noting if the patient has been associated with any group of people that has similar symptoms (clinical evidence). Ad14 is one of several possible causative agents for an outbreak of respiratory problems in members of a group, like military recruits. To provide a definitive diagnosis of Ad14, medical professionals specifically culture blood, tissue, and/or exudates for the virus. Rising serum titers of antibodies to Ad14, immunofluorescence tests for virus antigens in tissues, and a ''polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) are also tests that provide a definitive diagnosis. However, in the vast majority of infected patients, such specific testing is not done and is not clinically necessary. It does not alter the management of the infected person. Electron microscopy shows the virus structure (Figure 1) but does not identify the strain. Supportive tests may include chest ''X-rays'', blood tests, and others that the health care professional deems appropriate.''For further information on adenovirus structure, see ''http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/.' "
What is the treatment for an adenovirus 14 (Ad14) infection?,"'Treatment for Ad14 infection in most people consists of supportive care (rest, fluids, and fever reduction) because many people do well and have no problems. However, the Ad14 infections that progress require more intensive care; about 40% have required hospitalization in some outbreaks and some require respiratory assistance (''intubation'' or mechanical ''breathing'' support) and intensive care. Mortality (death) rate has been as high as 5% in some settings.''There are many reports of use of antivirals in severe Ad14 infections, but there are no good studies that support specific antivirals. Health care providers have documented some benefits of antivirals such as ''ribavirin'' (''Rebetol'', ''Copegus'') and cidofovir (''Vistide'"") in ill patients; in severe cases, clinicians may try such agents because there is no other treatment other than supportive care. The effectiveness of antiviral medications has not been well studied in Ad14 infections. It's advisable to consult with an infectious disease, pulmonary, or ophthalmologist consultant, depending on the location of the severe infection."" "
"What are complications of an 
adenovirus 14 infection?","'Most people require neither treatment nor hospitalization, and they do not develop complications. However, complications may be serious if the Ad14 disease progresses and the complication types are related to the organ system(s) bearing the most severe infection. Complications include ''bronchitis'', ''conjunctivitis'', pneumonia, meningitis, ''hepatitis'', bladder infection (''cystitis''), ''diarrhea'', ''ARDS'' (''acute respiratory distress syndrome''), and death. ' "
What is the prognosis for an adenovirus 14 (Ad14) infection?,"""In general, the prognosis for the majority (about 60% in some outbreaks) of people diagnosed with Ad14 is excellent with no complications. The prognosis declines as the severity of disease increases. Some hospitalized people may do well; those with other pre-existing health problems or who have a weakened immune system have a prognosis that may range from fair to poor depending on the individual's response to supportive and other possible (antiviral) therapies. Depending on the population and the setting, up to 5% of people identified as having Ad14 may die."" "
"Is it possible to prevent an 
adenovirus 14 infection?","'The only adenovirus ''vaccines'' are against Ad4 and Ad7 strains and are not available to the public, but are restricted to the military in the U.S. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine against Ad14. Fortunately, the number of people infected with this strain has been very low, and to date, there is no good evidence this strain will rapidly cause global problems like ''HIV'' or ''enterovirus'' strains. However, because this virus can be deadly and is transmissible from person to person by droplets, it has the potential to become widespread. Also, there can be some ''confusion'' in the medical literature about adenovirus ""''vaccines'',"" as medical researchers have used the virus as a genetic carrier for other viral genomic elements to make research ''vaccines'' against other viruses; these should be listed as recombinant vaccines and not confused with the limited production of Ad4 and Ad7 vaccines. In addition, adenoviruses are the most common vector for ''cancer'' gene therapy; genetic engineering science has allowed these modified viruses to carry therapeutic genes into ''cancer'' cells without causing viral symptoms.''Good hand washing techniques, avoiding close contact with infected people, and avoidance of touching people or potentially contaminated surfaces and then touching eyes, nose, or mouth are some of the best ways to reduce the chance of getting infected with Ad14. These techniques are used to help avoid many other viral illnesses such as ''influenza'', RSV, and other enteroviruses. Patients with the disease should always cover their cough or sneeze and avoid touching others. Discard or carefully clean potentially contaminated items such as food, plates, utensils, and other handled items before reuse to help reduce Ad14 transfer to others.' "

What is the Kinesio Taping Method?,"'The Kinesio Taping Method is felt to cause physiological effects on several body systems. The systems affected by the body are thought to include the circulatory/lymphatic, neural, muscular, and fascial systems, as well as the joints. Kinesio Taping is currently being used by therapists to change muscle tone, move lymphatic fluids, correct movement patterns, and improve posture. The Kinesio Taping Method is a unique method of applying Kinesio Tex Tape in a specific manner to create change in the aforementioned systems. Benefits of using the tape are that it is more economical over time than other modalities, it is easy to learn and apply, there are less types of tape, and it may be used over a longer period of time.''The Kinesio Taping Method differs from athletic strapping tape and the traditional McConnell Taping Method. Athletic strapping tape is used mostly to limit ranges of motion and to constrict muscle movement. The effect of this method is to create a ''bridge'' over the areas that are injured so that athletes can perform sport movements and have either prophylactic support or support to an injured part of the body. Athletic tape is typically removed after the end of an athletic event.''The McConnell Taping Method is a technique that tapes body parts to affect a specific biomechanical movement. McConnell Tape uses a very rigid, highly adhesive tape that is applied for no more that 18 hours and often for shorter periods of time due to patient discomfort.''The Kinesio Taping Method has been developed specifically to be used in conjunction with Kinesio Tape. The Kinesio Taping Association certifies practitioners of the Kinesio Taping Method. Kinesio Tape can be identified by the words ""Kinesio Tex"" printed on the back of the tape.' "
What is Kinesio Tex Tape?,'Kinesio Tex Tape is a newly popularized modality that is used by therapists trained in the Kinesio Taping Method by Certified Kinesio Taping Instructors (CKTI). Kinesio Tex Tape is a latex-free hypoallergenic cotton ''fiber'' tape with an acrylic heat-activated backing that stretches only along its longitudinal axis. The tape can be stretched 40%-60% of its resting length. The tape has no medicinal properties. The thickness and weight of the tape is designed to approximate the weight and thickness of skin.'  
Who is using Kinesio Tape?,"'Physical therapists, occupational therapists, certified athletic trainers, chiropractors, physicians, manual therapists, nurses, and physiotherapists around the world are using Kinesio Tape for many dysfunctions on a wide spectrum from temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') disorder to ''turf toe''. Today, though Kinesio Tex Tape is used primarily by nonathletic populations, it is also used by high-profile athletes.' "
How does it work?,"'The following are the current theories of how properly applied Kinesio Tape works.''On skin, the Kinesio Tape pulls the upper layers of skin, creating more space between the dermis and the muscle. The space created is believed to relieve pressure on the lymph channels in the area between the muscle and the dermis, creating more space for lymph flow and thus better lymph drainage through an affected area. This space also houses various nerve receptors that send specific information to the brain. When the space between the ''epidermis'' and the muscle is compressed, such as during an injury, these nerve receptors are compressed and send information to the brain regarding continuous touch, light touch, ''cold'', ''pain'', pressure, and heat. This information causes the brain to send out certain signals to the body on how to react to particular stimuli. Kinesio Tape alters the information that these receptors send to the brain and causes a less reactive response in the body, allowing the body to work in a more normal manner and removing some of the roadblocks that normally slow down the healing process.''Kinesio Tape also is felt to affect deeper tissues in the body. Increased space theoretically allows muscles greater contractility, which in turn pushes more fluid through the muscle, resulting in better muscle performance. The end results are believed to be reduced muscle ''fatigue'', increase in range of motion, and better quality of muscle contraction.''Kinesio Tex Tape is used to improve joint alignment by affecting the muscles and fascia and can reduce poor function of a joint by influencing opposing muscle groups and joint mobility.''Fascia and lymph have an intimate relationship with each other. Fascia is a material that divides and separates the muscles and internal organs and helps to provide support against gravity in some parts of the body. Lymph removes fluids and chemical substances in the muscles. Lymph channels pass though fascia between the bone and the muscle and superficially between the skin and the muscle. Lymph ducts range in size from smaller than a hair to 2 cm ''lymph nodes''. Major lymph channels can be found in the groin, neck, and armpits. When the flow of lymph is restricted or increased, an accumulation of fluid occurs behind the congested area, resulting in swelling that decreases space between the muscle and skin, causing the body to react to a painful stimulus.''The working model gives rise to the basic theoretical concepts of the Kinesio Taping Method. There are six basic concepts of the Kinesio Taping technique called corrections. They are: mechanical, fascia (fascial), space, ligament/tendon, functional, and circulatory/ lymphatic. Mechanical corrections are used for improved stability and biomechanics. Fascia or fascial corrections create or direct movement of fascia. Space corrections are used for decreasing pressure over a target tissue. Tendon/ligament corrections decrease ''stress'' on a ligament or tendon. Functional corrections provide sensory stimulation to either assist or limit a motion. Circulatory/lymphatic corrections help move lymphatic fluid from more congested to less congested areas.''Kinesio Taping has also been shown to affect ''scars''. Reductions of adhesions and pitting, softening, flattening, improved pliability, and reduction of contractures have been seen in some patients.' "

By planning and practicing for evacuation, you will be better prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently to signs of danger or to directions by civil authorities.'  Take a few minutes with your family to discuss a home evacuation plan. 
Sketch a floor plan of your home; walk through each room and discuss evacuation 
details. Plan a second way to exit from each room or area, if possible. If you need 
special equipment, such as a rope ladder, mark where it is located. Mark where your emergency food, water, first aid kits, and fire extinguishers are located. Mark where the utility switches or valves are located so that they can be 
turned off, if possible. Indicate the location of your family's emergency outdoor meeting place."
"How to establish 
priorities and personal documentation paperwork","'Take time before an earthquake strikes to write an emergency priority list, including:''Make a list of important information and put it in a secure location. Include on your list:''Gather and Store Important Documents in a Fire-Proof Safe' important items to be hand-carried by you other items, in order of importance to you and your family items to be removed by car or truck if one is available things to do if time permits, such as locking doors and windows, turning 
off the utilities, etc. important telephone numbers, such as police, fire, paramedics, and medical

Indoor Safety,"'There are actions you can take, even while an earthquake is happening, that will reduce your chances of being hurt. Lights may be out, and hallways, stairs, and room exits may be blocked by fallen furniture, ceiling tiles, and other debris. Planning for these situations will help you to take action quickly.''High-Rise Buildings'' ''Get under a desk and stay away from windows and outside walls. Stay in the building. The electricity may go out, and the sprinkler systems may come on. ''DO NOT use the elevators. '' ''If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.''Crowded Indoor Public Places'' ''If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.'  If an earthquake strikes, you may be able to take cover under a heavy desk or 
table. It can provide you with air space if the building collapses. If you get 
under a table and it moves, try to move with it.  Inner walls or door frames are the least likely to collapse and may also 
shield against falling objects. If other cover is not available, go to an inner 
corner or doorway, away from windows or glass panels. Stay away from glass and hanging objects, and bookcases, china cabinets, or 
other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks 
from fireplaces and chimneys, light fixtures, wall hangings, high shelves, and 
cabinets with doors that could swing open. Grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken 
glass. If the lights go out, use a battery-operated flashlight. Don't use candles, 
matches, or lighters during or after the earthquake. If there is a gas leak, an 
explosion could result. If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the 
first sign of shaking."
Outdoor Safety,"'If outdoors, move away from buildings and utility wires. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls. Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. ' "
Automobiles,"'If you are in a moving automobile, stop as quickly and safely as possible and move over to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses. Stay in the vehicle, set the parking brake, and turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information. A car may jiggle violently on its springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. If you are in a life-threatening situation, you may be able to reach someone with either a cellular or an emergency roadside assistance phone. ''When you drive on, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as breaks in the pavement, downed utility poles and wires, a fallen overpasses and ''bridges''. ' "
Emergency supplies for earthquake preparedness,"'Stock up now on emergency supplies that can be used after an earthquake. These supplies should include a ''first aid'' kit, survival kits for the home, automobile, and workplace, and emergency water and food. Store enough supplies to last at least 3 days.' "
First aid kit,"'Store your first aid supplies in a tool box or fishing tackle box so they will be easy to carry and protected from water. Inspect your kit regularly and keep it freshly stocked. NOTE: Important medical information and most prescriptions can be stored in the refrigerator, which also provides excellent protection from fires.' Hydrogen peroxide to wash and disinfect wounds Antibiotic ointment Individually wrapped alcohol swabs Aspirin and non-aspirin tablets Prescriptions and any long-term medications (keep these current) Diarrhea medicine Eye drops Bandage strips Ace bandages Rolled gauze Cotton-tipped swabs Adhesive tape roll First aid book Scissors Tweezers Thermometer Bar soap Tissues Sunscreen Paper cups Pocket knife Small plastic bags Safety pins Needle and thread Instant cold packs for sprains Sanitary napkins Splinting materials"
Survival kit for your home,"'Assemble a survival kit for your home with the following items:' ax, shovel, broom screwdriver, pliers, hammer, adjustable wrench rope for towing or rescue plastic sheeting and tape sturdy shoes that can provide protection from broken glass, nails, and 
other debris gloves (heavy and durable for cleaning up debris) candles waterproof matches change of clothing knife garden hose (for siphoning and firefighting) tent recreational supplies for children and adults blankets or sleeping bags portable radio, flashlight, and extra batteries essential medications and eyeglasses fire extinguisher -- multipurpose, dry chemical type food and water for pets toilet tissue cash"

Emergency Water Storage And Purification,"'Following are recommendations for storing and purifying water supplies.''Do not store water containers in direct sunlight. Select a place with a fairly constant, cool temperature.' The minimum drinking water supply is 1 gallon per 
person per day. You will also need water for food preparation, bathing, brushing 
teeth, and dish washing. Store a 3-5 day supply of water (at least 5 gallons for 
each person). Water should be stored in sturdy plastic bottles with tight-fitting lids. 
Rinsed chlorine bleach bottles work well for water storage. Plastic containers 
for juice and milk do not work as well because they tend to crack and leak more 
readily. All containers should be labeled. Stored water should be changed every 6 months. Avoid placing water containers in areas where toxic substances, such as 
gasoline and pesticides, are present. Vapors may penetrate the plastic over 
time."
Safe Water Sources In The Home,"'If you do not have enough water stored, there are sources in your home that may provide safe, clean water for drinking purposes.'  Water drained from the water heater faucet, if the water heater has not been 
damaged. Water dipped from the tank of the toilet (not the bowl). The water in the 
bowl can be used for pets. Do not use water that has been chemically treated or 
""blue"" water. Melted ice cubes. Canned fruit, vegetable juice, and liquids from other canned goods. Water from swimming pools and spas can be used for personal hygiene, 
cleaning, and related uses, but not for drinking."
Unsafe Water Sources,"'Never use water from the sources listed below for drinking.''NOTE: Remember that carbonated ''beverages'' do not meet drinking water requirements. ''Caffeinated'' ''drinks'' and alcohol dehydrate the body, which increases the need for drinking water.' Radiators Hot water boilers (home heating system) Water beds (fungicides added to the water or chemicals in the vinyl may make 
water unsafe for use)"
Water for Drinking and Cooking,"'Safe drinking water includes bottled, boiled, or treated water. Your state, local, or tribal health department can make specific recommendations for boiling or treating drinking water in your area. Here are some general rules concerning water for drinking and cooking. Remember:''Containers for water should be rinsed with a bleach solution before using and reusing. Use water storage tanks and other types of containers with caution. For example, fire truck storage tanks, as well as previously used cans or bottles, can be contaminated with microbes or chemicals.' Do not use contaminated water to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and 
prepare food, or make ice. If you use bottled water, make sure the seal has not been broken. Otherwise, 
water should be boiled or treated before use. Drink only bottled, boiled, or 
treated water until your supply is tested and found safe. Boiling water kills harmful bacteria and parasites. Bringing water to a 
rolling boil for 1 minute will kill most organisms. If you can't boil water, you can treat water with chlorine tablets, iodine 
tablets, or unscented household chlorine bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite). If 
you use chlorine tablets or iodine tablets, follow the directions that come with 
the tablets. If you use household chlorine bleach, add 1/8 teaspoon (~0.75 
milliliter [mL]) of bleach per gallon of water if the water is clear. For cloudy 
water, add 1/4 teaspoon (~1.50 mL) of bleach per gallon. Mix the solution 
thoroughly and let it stand for about 30 minutes before using it. Treating water 
with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or liquid bleach will not kill many 
parasitic organisms. Boiling is the best way to kill these organisms."
Emergency Food," Keep foods that: have a long storage life require little or no cooking, water, or refrigeration, in case utilities are 
disrupted meet the needs of babies or other family members who are on special diets meet pets' needs are not very salty or spicy, as these foods increase the need for drinking 
water, which may be in short supply"
How To Store Emergency Food," A disaster can easily disrupt the food supply at any time, so plan to have at 
least a 3-day supply of food on hand. When storing food, it is not necessary to buy dehydrated or other types of 
emergency food. Canned foods and dry mixes will remain fresh for about 2 years. Certain storage conditions can enhance the shelf life of canned or dried 
foods. The ideal location is a cool, dry, dark place. The best temperature is 40 
to 60°F. Keep foods away from ranges or refrigerator exhausts. Heat causes many 
foods to spoil more quickly. Keep food away from petroleum products, such as gasoline, oil, paints, and 
solvents. Some food products absorb their smell. Protect food from rodents and insects. Items stored in boxes or in paper 
cartons will keep longer if they are heavily wrapped or stored in airtight 
containers. Date all food items. Use and replace food before it loses freshness."
How To Use Emergency Food,"'Preparing Food''Preparing food after an earthquake may be complicated by damage to your home and loss of electricity, gas, and water. The following items will help you to prepare meals safely:''NOTE: Do not use your fireplace for cooking until the chimney has been inspected for cracks and damage. Sparks may escape into your attic through an undetected crack and start a fire.' Use perishable food in your refrigerator or freezer before using food in your 
emergency supplies. Discard cooked, unrefrigerated foods after 2 hours at room temperature, 
regardless of appearance. Eat only foods that have a normal color, texture, and odor. Discard cans that bulge at the ends or that are leaking. Cooking utensils Knives, forks, and spoons Paper plates, cups, and towels A manual can- and bottle-opener Heavy-duty aluminum foil Gas or charcoal grill; camp stove Fuel for cooking, such as charcoal. (CAUTION: Never burn charcoal indoors. 
The fumes are deadly when concentrated indoors.)"
What is Kleine-Levin syndrome?,'Kleine-Levin syndrome is a rare disorder that primarily affects adolescent males (approximately 70 percent of those with Kleine-Levin syndrome are male). ' 
What are the symptoms of Kleine-Levin syndrome?,"'It is characterized by recurring but reversible periods of excessive ''sleep'' (up to 20 hours per day). Symptoms occur as ""episodes,"" typically lasting a few days to a few weeks. ''Episode onset is often abrupt, and may be associated with ''flu''-like symptoms. Excessive food intake, irritability, childishness, disorientation, ''hallucinations'', and an abnormally uninhibited sex drive may be observed during episodes. Mood can be ''depressed'' as a consequence, but not a cause, of the disorder. Affected individuals are completely normal between episodes, although they may not be able to remember afterwards everything that happened during the episode. It may be weeks or more before symptoms reappear. Symptoms may be related to malfunction of the hypothalamus and thalamus, parts of the brain that govern appetite and ''sleep''.'  "
Is there any treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome?,"'There is no definitive treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome and watchful waiting at home, rather than pharmacotherapy, is most often advised. Stimulant pills, including amphetamines, ''methylphenidate'', and ''modafinil'', are used to treat sleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitive abnormalities. Because of similarities between Kleine-Levin syndrome and certain mood disorders, ''lithium'' and ''carbamazepine'' may be prescribed and, in some cases, have been shown to prevent further episodes. This disorder should be differentiated from cyclic re-occurrence of sleepiness during the ''premenstrual'' period in teen-aged girls, which may be controlled with ''birth control pills''. It also should be differentiated from ''encephalopathy'', recurrent ''depression'', or psychosis.'  "
What is the prognosis for Kleine-Levin syndrome?,'Episodes eventually decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of eight to 12 years.'  
What research is being done on Kleine-Levin syndrome?,'NINDS supports a broad range of clinical and basic research on diseases causing ''sleep disorders'' in an effort to clarify the mechanisms of these conditions and to develop better treatments for them.'

What is Klinefelter syndrome?,"'Klinefelter syndrome, also known as the XXY condition, is a term used to describe males who have an extra X chromosome in most of their cells. Instead of having the usual XY chromosome pattern that most males have, these men have an XXY pattern. Klinefelter syndrome is named after Dr. Henry Klinefelter, who first described a group of symptoms found in some men with the extra X chromosome. Even though all men with Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome, not every XXY male has all of those symptoms. ''Because not every male with an XXY pattern has all the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome, it is common to use the term XXY male to describe these men, or XXY condition to describe the symptoms. '""Scientists believe the XXY condition is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities in humans. About one of every 500 males has an extra X chromosome, but many don't have any symptoms. "" "
What are the symptoms of the XXY condition?,"'Not all males with the condition have the same symptoms or to the same degree. Symptoms depend on how many XXY cells a man has, how much testosterone is in his body, and his age when the condition is diagnosed. The XXY condition can affect three main areas of development 1) physical, 2) language, and 3) social. '  "
Physical development,"'As ''babies'', many XXY males have weak muscles and reduced strength. They may sit up, crawl, and walk later than other infants. After about age four, XXY males tend to be taller and may have less muscle control and coordination than other boys their age. '""As XXY males enter puberty, they often don't make as much testosterone as other boys. This can lead to a taller, less muscular body, less facial and body hair, and broader hips than other boys. As teens, XXY males may have larger breasts, weaker bones, and a lower energy level than other boys. ""'By adulthood, XXY males look similar to males without the condition, although they are often taller. They are also more likely than other men to have certain health problems, such as autoimmune disorders, ''breast cancer'', vein diseases, ''osteoporosis'', and tooth decay. ''XXY males can have normal sex lives, but they usually make little or no sperm. Most XXY males are ''infertile'"" because their bodies don't make a lot of sperm. "" "
Language development,"'As boys, it is not uncommon for XXY males have some kind of language problem, such as learning to talk late, trouble using language to express thoughts and needs, problems reading, and trouble processing what they hear. ''As adults, XXY males may have a harder time doing work that involves reading and writing, but most hold jobs and have successful careers. ' "
Social development,"'As babies, XXY males tend to be quiet and undemanding. As they get older, they are usually quieter, less self-confident, less active, and more helpful and obedient than other boys. ''As teens, XXY males tend to be quiet and shy. They may struggle in school and sports, meaning they may have more trouble ""fitting in"" with other kids. ''However, as adults, XXY males live lives similar to men without the condition; they have friends, families, and normal social relationships. ' "
What are the treatments for the XXY condition?,"'The XXY chromosome pattern can not be changed. But, there are a variety of ways to treat the symptoms of the XXY condition.''One of the most important factors for all types of treatment is starting it as early in life as possible. ' Educational treatments - As children, many XXY males qualify for special services to help them in school. Teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. Therapeutic options - A variety of therapists, such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapists, can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of the XXY condition, such as poor muscle tone, speech or language problems, or low self-confidence. Medical treatments - Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) can greatly help XXY males get their testosterone levels intonormal range. Having a more normal testosterone level can help develop bigger muscles, deepen the voice, and grow facial and body hair. TRT often starts when a boy reaches puberty. Some XXY males can also benefit fromfertility treatment to help them father children. "

What is Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome?,"'Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome is a condition characterized by a triad of findings:'   Port-wine stain or ""birthmark"" (capillary malformations in the skin)  Soft tissue and bony hypertrophy (excessive growth of the soft tissue and/or bones) most often involving a single limb. Vascular anomalies such as varicose veins."
What is a port-wine stain?,"'A port-wine stain is a certain type of ''hemangioma''. This capillary hemangioma has a recognizable appearance. It is usually a deep violet (""port-wine"") colored  lesion with fairly linear borders. These are most often found on the affected hypertrophied limb. They are generally flat or only slightly raised compared to the surrounding unaffected skin surface. The actual depth of the lesion is unpredictable and less commonly may even affect muscle and bone.''In addition to the port-wine stain, individuals with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber also develop ''varicose veins''. These often can be seen at birth as a large superficial vein extending from the lower leg all the way up to the buttocks. This vein has been referred to as the ""Klippel-Trènaunay"" vein and may not be obvious until later in childhood. ''Occasionally affected individuals develop an arteriovenous fistula (abnormal connection between an artery and a vein). This is known as the Parkes-Weber variant of KTW. These patients usually have numerous fistulae that can result in ''heart failure'' if untreated.' "
What is asymmetrical limb hypertrophy?,"'Asymmetric limb hypertrophy is enlargement of one limb compared to the opposite side. For example, an individual with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome may have a left leg or arm that is larger than his/her right leg or arm. This asymmetry is found in other ''inherited'' syndromes as well. Most commonly in individuals with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber, the leg is involved more frequently than an arm; however, on occasion there is enlargement of two limbs, a buttock, or part of the trunk of the body.

Additionally, there is an increased risk of abnormal ''blood clots'' forming, which can move to the ''lungs'', causing a ''pulmonary embolism''.'   atrophy (a limb that is underdeveloped),  fingers and toes that are disproportionately large or small,  digits that are webbed (syndactyly),  too many digits (polydactyly), or  too few digits (oligodactyly). asymmetrical facial hypertrophy (one side of the face may be smaller than the other), macrocephaly (a large head), or microcephaly (a small head)."
How is intelligence affected?,"'Intelligence is usually not impaired in Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber. However, when there are hemangiomas on the face (facial hemangiomatosis), there may also be hemangiomas in the brain which can cause ''seizures'' (convulsions) or mental retardation. Fortunately, such problems are rare in Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber.' "
What is the basic defect in Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"""It is not completely known, but some researches believe part of the defect is related to the control of angiogenic cells (precursors of blood vessels). Others believe it is caused by some injury to the developing embryo within the womb, resulting in venous compression and resultant abnormal venous pressures, causing varicosities and limb enlargement. In other words, we don't currently know the precise events that lead to the development of Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber."" "
What causes Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"'Most cases of Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber are sporadic. They usually occur without warning, with no prior case in the family. However, there have been some cases that run in families. ' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"'Most persons with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber have an enlarged leg and they do relatively well without any significant treatment. It can be helpful to wear compression stockings to prevent venous pooling in the affected extremity (''varicose vein'' management). However, some Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber patients do have considerable ''pain''. Skin ulcers, infections and other skin problems can occur, but usually the treatment is conservative. Surgery is almost never needed.'  "
Why is it called Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"'In 1900 the French physicians Maurice Klippel and Paul Trènaunay reported the case of a patient with a port-wine stain, asymmetrical overgrowth (hypertrophy) of soft tissue and bone together with hemangiomas of the skin In 1907, the eminent London physician F. Parkes Weber reported three more cases, and noted the varicosities. As is often the case in medicine, those who describe a syndrome are often given credit by having the syndrome named after them.

Additionally, there is an increased risk of abnormal ''blood clots'' forming, which can move to the ''lungs'', causing a ''pulmonary embolism''.'   atrophy (a limb that is underdeveloped),  fingers and toes that are disproportionately large or small,  digits that are webbed (syndactyly),  too many digits (polydactyly), or  too few digits (oligodactyly). asymmetrical facial hypertrophy (one side of the face may be smaller than the other), macrocephaly (a large head), or microcephaly (a small head)."
How is intelligence affected?,"'Intelligence is usually not impaired in Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber. However, when there are hemangiomas on the face (facial hemangiomatosis), there may also be hemangiomas in the brain which can cause ''seizures'' (convulsions) or mental retardation. Fortunately, such problems are rare in Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber.' "
What is the basic defect in Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"""It is not completely known, but some researches believe part of the defect is related to the control of angiogenic cells (precursors of blood vessels). Others believe it is caused by some injury to the developing embryo within the womb, resulting in venous compression and resultant abnormal venous pressures, causing varicosities and limb enlargement. In other words, we don't currently know the precise events that lead to the development of Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber."" "
What causes Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"'Most cases of Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber are sporadic. They usually occur without warning, with no prior case in the family. However, there have been some cases that run in families. ' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"'Most persons with Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber have an enlarged leg and they do relatively well without any significant treatment. It can be helpful to wear compression stockings to prevent venous pooling in the affected extremity (''varicose vein'' management). However, some Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber patients do have considerable ''pain''. Skin ulcers, infections and other skin problems can occur, but usually the treatment is conservative. Surgery is almost never needed.'  "
Why is it called Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome?,"'In 1900 the French physicians Maurice Klippel and Paul Trènaunay reported the case of a patient with a port-wine stain, asymmetrical overgrowth (hypertrophy) of soft tissue and bone together with hemangiomas of the skin In 1907, the eminent London physician F. Parkes Weber reported three more cases, and noted the varicosities. As is often the case in medicine, those who describe a syndrome are often given credit by having the syndrome named after them. Thus, in 1918 it became know as Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber syndrome.' "
Alternative names for Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome,"""Alternative names for Klippel-Trènaunay-Weber (KTW) syndrome include angio-osteohypertrophy syndrome, congenital dysplastic angiectasia, elephantiasis congenita angiomatosa, hemangiectatic hypertrophy, Klippel-Trenaunay- Parkes-Weber syndrome (Parkes was Weber's middle name), Klippel Trenaunay syndrome, KTS, and osteohypertrophic ""'nevus'' flammeus.' "
What is bursitis?,"'A bursa is a closed, fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. ''Bursae'' is plural for ''bursa''. The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. When a bursa becomes inflamed, the condition is known as bursitis. This can cause swelling, warmth, and tenderness in the affected area. Most commonly, bursitis is caused by local soft-tissue ''trauma'' or strain injury, and there is no infection (''aseptic bursitis''). On rare occasions, particularly when the immune system is suppressed, the bursa can become infected with bacteria. This condition is called septic bursitis.' "
What is knee bursitis?,"'The ''knee joint'' is surrounded by three major bursae. At the tip of the knee, over the kneecap bone (''patella''), is the prepatellar bursa. This bursa can become inflamed (''prepatellar bursitis'') from direct trauma to the front of the knee. This commonly occurs when maintaining a prolonged kneeling position, thereby causing irritation of the prepatellar area. It has been referred to as ""housemaid\'s knee,"" ""roofer\'s knee,"" and ""carpet layer\'s knee,"" based on the patient\'s associated occupational histories.''Strain of the large tendon below the kneecap can cause both tendonitis and infrapatellar bursitis. This bursa of the knee is located just under the kneecap beneath the large tendon that attaches the muscles in front of the thigh and the kneecap to the prominent bone in front of the lower leg. This bursa is called the infrapatellar bursa, and when inflamed, the condition is called infrapatellar bursitis. It is commonly seen with inflammation of the adjacent tendon as a result of a jumping injury, hence the name ""jumper\'s knee.""''Inflammation of the bursa at the inner side of the knee (anserine area) can cause pes anserine bursitis. Pes anserine bursitis causes local tenderness of the inner knee. This bursa of the knee is located on the lower inner side of the knee and is called the ""anserine bursa."" This bursa most commonly becomes inflamed in middle-aged women. This condition is referred to as anserine bursitis. Anserine bursitis is particularly common in those who are ''obese''. These patients can notice ''pain'' in the inner knee while climbing or descending stairs.'  "
What are causes of knee bursitis?,"'Bursitis of the knee can occur when the bursa fills with blood from injury and overuse, such as from athletic competition. Bursitis can also occur from ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and from deposits of crystals, as seen in patients with ''gouty arthritis'' and ''pseudogout''. The prepatellar bursa can also become infected with bacteria (septic bursitis). When this happens, ''fever'' may be present. This type of infection usually occurs from breaks in the overlying skin or ''puncture wounds''. The bacterium involved in septic bursitis of the knee is usually ''Staphylococcus'', which is normally present on the skin. Rarely, a chronically inflamed bursa can become infected by bacteria spreading through the blood.'  "
What are knee bursitis symptoms and signs?,"'Bursitis can lead to varying degrees of swelling, warmth, tenderness, and redness in the overlying area of the knee. As compared with knee ''joint inflammation'' (''arthritis''), it is usually only mildly painful. It is frequently associated with increased pain when kneeling and can cause ''stiffness'' and pain with ''walking''. Also, in contrast to problems within the knee joint, the range of motion of the knee is frequently preserved and the swelling is outside of the joint.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose knee bursitis?,"'Bursitis of the knee is diagnosed based upon the typical location of a bursa displaying signs of inflammation including ''knee pain'', tenderness, stiffness, and sometimes redness and warmth. Typically, there is point tenderness at the site of the inflamed bursa.' "
What is the treatment for prepatellar bursitis of the knee? Are there home remedies for knee bursitis?,"'The treatment of any bursitis depends on whether or not it involves infection. Non-infectious (aseptic) prepatellar bursitis can be treated with ice compresses, rest, and anti-inflammatory and pain medications. When ice packs and anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' are not effective, knee bursitis can require aspiration of the bursa fluid and/or a local ''cortisone injection'"". This procedure involves removal of the fluid with a needle and syringe under sterile conditions and can be performed in the doctor's office. Sometimes the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further analysis. Noninfectious knee bursitis can also be treated with an injection of cortisone medication into the swollen bursa. Cortisone injections are sometimes done at the same time as the aspiration procedure.""'Septic bursitis requires even further evaluation and treatment. The bursal fluid can be examined in the laboratory to identify the microbes causing the infection. It requires antibiotic therapy, often intravenously. Repeated aspiration of the inflamed fluid may be required. Surgical drainage and removal of the infected bursa sac (bursectomy) may also be necessary.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) of knee bursitis?,"'The outlook for knee bursitis is generally very good. Mild bursitis resolves spontaneously with rest. More significant bursitis can require medications (either taken by mouth or locally injected) to reduce inflammation. Infectious bursitis requires drainage, possibly surgical resection, and antibiotics.' "
Is it possible to prevent knee bursitis?,"'To the extent that the bursitis is caused by injury or athletic activity, it can be prevented by avoiding reinjury to the bursa and adjacent tissues.' "
What are the different types of knee injuries?,"'The knee is one of the most commonly injured parts of the body. Sports, falls, and motor-vehicle accidents account for the vast majority of knee ''pain'' and injuries to the knee.'""The different types of common knee injuries to the knee are defined by the affected anatomy of the knee and the mechanism by which it's injured.""'Knee ''sprains'' are injuries to the ligaments that hold the knee together. There are multiple ligaments that stabilize the knee and keep it in alignment. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) stabilize the knee in movement from front to back and cross each other in the middle of the ''knee joint''. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) stabilize the knee so that the bones do not slide from side to side.''Ligament sprains are graded by the amount of stretching or tearing of the ligament fibers and how much instability it causes as follows:''Knee ''strains'' occur when tendons or muscles surrounding the knee are stretched, usually due to hyperflexion or hyperextension of the knee. These strains can lead to ''pain'' outside of the ''knee joint'' but can cause dysfunction of the normal range of motion of the knee. The patellar tendon stretches from the lower kneecap to the front of the tibia bone at the front of the leg.''Knee bursitis'' occurs when a fluid-filled pouch (called a bursa) in the knee is irritated, inflamed, or infected. Bursas are fluid-filled sacs located around joints that act as ''shock'' absorbers that minimize the friction between various tissues, such as the muscles and tendons around the joints. In the knee, there are two main bursas, one above the kneecap (''patella''), and one below the knee joint near the front of the tibia bone.''Tears of the ''meniscus'' can occur from damage to the inside of the knee. The medial and lateral menisci (plural of meniscus) are semi-round, articular cartilage that act as shock absorbers and smooth cushions for the thighbone (femur). These menisci can be injured acutely or can become dysfunctional gradually due to overuse and/or ''aging''.''Knee joint dislocation'' can occur due to high-impact, large-force injuries to the knee (sports, motor vehicle accidents). This is a rare injury but causes severe damage to all the anatomical components of the knee and can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves about the knee. This requires emergency treatment or surgery.''The kneecap (''patella'') can dislocate to the side of the knee. Patellar dislocation can be very painful but is generally not life-threatening and can be treated by popping it back into place (reduction of the patella), splinting, and physical therapy.''Knee ''fractures'' occur from direct blows to the bones. Patella, or kneecap, fractures occur when a person falls directly down onto the knees and the kneecap cracks due to the force. Collapse of the top of the tibia bone in the knee (tibia plateau ''fracture'') can occur from sudden compression injury to the knee, especially in people with ''osteoporosis''. Other fractures of the long bones (fibula, tibia, and femur) are rare with isolated injures to the knee.''Other overuse injuries'' of the knee include patellofemoral ''pain'' syndrome (often referred to as ""runner\'s knee,"" which causes ''pain'' on the front of the knee) and ''weakness'' and degeneration of the cartilage under the kneecap (''chondromalacia patella''). These injuries are due to an accumulation of repetitive damage to the knee structures. Congenital knee problems or improper mechanics of the knee movement may cause this.''Osteochondritis dissecans'' is a joint disorder that occurs most commonly in children. Bone and cartilage beneath the joints loses its blood supply, resulting in ''joint pain'' and ''stiffness''. This condition typically affects the knees, but it can also affect other joints such as elbows and ankles.''Osgood-Schlatter disease'' is a condition in children caused by growth spurts that cause ''knee pain'' and swelling below the kneecap.'   Grade 1 knee sprain: The ligament is stretched and painful, but fibers are not torn and no instability is present. Grade 2 knee sprain: The ligament fibers are torn partially, mild instability may be evident. Grade 3 knee sprain: The ligament fibers are completely torn and the knee is unstable."
What causes a knee injury?,"'Most knee injuries are caused by an external force bending or twisting the knee in a manner that it was not anatomically designed for. Common causes of knee injuries are from a twisting mechanism from falls, sports, or accidents. A twisted knee can cause damage to the ligaments and cartilage.''High-force injuries such as sports-related injuries and motor vehicle accidents can disrupt multiple parts of the knee anatomy, causing multiple types of knee injuries.''Bursitis'' can be caused by overuse, ''arthritis'', ''degenerative joint disease'', injuries from kneeling, infection, or ''gout''.'  "
What are risk factors for a knee injury?,"'High-impact sports, including ''running'', basketball, football, hockey, soccer, ''cycling'', and others, can increase the risk of ''knee pain'' and injury. Sports where shoes with cleats are worn and sharp, sudden changes in direction are made, along with contact sports, are common risks for knee injury. ''Exercise'', such as high-impact cardiovascular activity or ''yoga'', can also cause knee injury.''The elderly may be at higher risk for knee injury due to falls and ''osteoporosis''.'""Women may be at higher risk for anterior cruciate ligament injuries (ACL) and patellar injuries. This is due to the anatomy of a woman's hips and femur and the angle at which the knee is tilted. This can lead to ""'chondromalacia patella'' (CMP), an inflammation or irritation of the underside of the patella.''Being ''overweight'' can be a risk factor for knee injury, as excess weight puts more ''stress'' on the lower extremity joints.''Overuse and overtraining, improper or insufficient training for a sport, or not properly rehabilitating acute injuries can also predispose a person to knee injuries.' "
What are knee injury symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of knee injury are related to the type of injury and the part of the knee that was injured.''The main symptoms of knee injury are as follows:''If the injury is acute, the main symptoms will most likely be knee pain and swelling. If the injury is chronic or from overuse, the symptoms of clicking, popping, and intermittent pain will be more prominent.'   Knee pain Swelling Heat Redness Tenderness Difficulty bending the knee Problems weight bearing Clicking or popping sounds Locking of the knee Feeling of instability Bruising"
What specialists treat knee injuries?,"""A knee injury may first be examined and treated by a primary care provider (PCP), such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child's pediatrician. If you go to the emergency room for your knee injury, you will be seen by an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist.''If the knee injury is severe, you may be referred to an orthopedist (a specialist in injuries of the musculoskeletal system) or an orthopedic surgeon. If your knee injury is related to sports, you may see a sports medicine specialist.''Other medical professionals who may be involved in treating your injured knee include physical therapists, occupational therapists, or other rehabilitation specialists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a knee injury?,"'The diagnosis of a knee injury is made by a physician on the basis of history, physical examination, and sometimes the use of ''X-rays'' or ''MRIs''.''Depending on the how the knee was injured and whether or not there are accompanying medical issues, the doctor will perform specific tests involving bending or twisting the knee to test the stability of the ligaments and check for damage to the cartilage. Knee-bending tests done by your doctor are designed to isolate specifically which ligament or part of the cartilage has been damaged.''Further testing with ''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', or ''MRIs'' may be necessary to evaluate the extent of the injury and help determine treatment and prognosis. X-rays and ''CT scans'' are used to asses for bony injuries (fractures), and MRIs are used to evaluate soft-tissue damage (ligaments and cartilage).' "
What are home remedies for a knee injury?,"'Treatment for a knee injury depends on the part of the knee that is damaged and the extent of the damage.''Some injuries such as simple ''strains'' or sprains are treated with home remedies such as RICE therapy (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). Taking time off from sports and ''exercise'' may be enough for minor injuries and knee pain to heal. ''Over-the-counter'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') may help treat the pain and inflammation from these minor injuries. Chronic knee injuries may respond to heat therapy.''See a doctor for knee pain and injury if you experience the following:'   Severe pain Limping Inability to move the knee Inability to bear weight on the knee Buckling of the knee when trying to stand Deformity of the knee"
What is the medical treatment for a knee injury?,"'More serious knee injuries require medical care.''Knee immobilization or splinting keeps the knee from moving and decreases the chance of further injury. Immobilizing the knee can help stabilize an injured knee that may not be stable due to torn ligaments. It also keeps the knee from moving to assist in resting the knee.''Chronic knee injuries involving inflammation and bursitis may be treated with anti-inflammatories. Injections of cortisone (a steroid with powerful anti-inflammatory effects) may be helpful in these situations.''More extensive injuries involving torn ligaments, instability of the knee joint, swelling, decreased range of motion, or fractures will require an orthopedic surgeon consultation. In the initial stages of these more extensive injuries, RICE therapy can still be used. Staying off the leg by using crutches or a wheelchair may be advised.''Surgery may be indicated for tears of the ligaments or extensive meniscal tears. Surgery may also be needed for fractures or dislocations of the knee. Some acute injuries such as those with high-force impact, or multiple parts of the knee damaged, may require emergency surgery.''Most knee surgery can be done by ''arthroscopy'', a procedure in which a camera is used and small punctures are made in the knee to insert instruments. Repairs can be done inside the knee without having the open the knee with a large incision. Most arthroscopic surgeries do not need to be done immediately after an acute injury. Some are delayed to allow for decreased inflammation.''After surgery, or if surgery is not an option, physical therapy can be used to strengthen and stretch the muscles surrounding the knee. Physical therapy can also allow for better movement mechanics of the leg and the knee to help prevent future injury.' "
"What exercises are recommended, and what exercises should be avoided during rehabilitation for a knee injury?","'During physical therapy for rehabilitation of a knee injury, the patient will be given specific exercises by the physical therapist in order to strengthen and stabilize the knee joint. These exercises include strengthening the front of the thigh (''quadriceps''), back of the thigh (hamstrings), calf, and hip. Consult your doctor and your physical therapist before starting any ''exercise'' program. Your physical therapist should insure you perform the exercises properly before doing them on your own.''If you have any pain or discomfort while doing prescribed exercises, see your doctor or physical therapist.''Some exercises your physical therapist may recommend include the following:''The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) has an ''exercise guide'' that includes directions and pictures. Consult your doctor or physical therapist before trying any of these exercises on your own.''Some exercises to avoid following knee injury include the following:''These exercises can further ''stress'' already damaged knee joints.' Quad sets Straight leg raisesStraight-leg raise to the frontStraight-leg raise to the back Straight-leg raise to the front Straight-leg raise to the back Hamstring curls Heel raises Heel dig bridging Shallow standing knee bends Full-arc knee extensions Lunges Deep squats Hurdler's stretches"
What is the recovery time for a knee injury?,"'The recovery time for a knee injury depends on the type and severity of the injury. If the injury is significant enough to require surgery and/or physical therapy, the recovery time will be longer.''Simple strains or sprains can last for one to two weeks. More extensive injuries requiring arthroscopic surgery may take one to three months to heal.''Major traumatic injuries to the knee may take up to a year to heal.'""Following the doctor's instructions for rest, immobilization, staying off your ""'feet'', and avoiding ''exercise'' that aggravates the injuries will help speed recovery.''Physical therapy can also speed recovery time. It is important to follow directions of your physical therapist to insure you are doing the exercises correctly and attaining the best results.''Chronic knee injuries that do not require surgery may flare up from time to time. Physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and cortisone injections are used to provide temporary relief.' "
What is the prognosis of a knee injury?,"'The prognosis of a knee injury depends on the type and severity of the injury.''Most minor knee injuries (strains, minor sprains) heal on their own with conservative treatment. The prognosis for these types of injures is good.''Ligament or cartilage injuries that lead to dysfunction or instability of the knee may require surgery. These injuries generally respond well to surgery and patients can ultimately gain full or nearly full range of knee motion.' "
What are complications of knee injuries?,"'Knee injuries are rarely life-threatening, though severe injuries may be disabling. Some knee injuries lead to chronic, irreversible damage to the knee and may result in complications such as long-term dysfunction. Knee-joint dislocations can cause blood vessel injuries and can lead to severe disability.' "
Is it possible to prevent knee injuries?,"'Knee injuries can be prevented by taking steps to reduce the risks:''For specific information on prevention of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, check out the ACL Prevention Project training program by the Santa Monica Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Foundation. It is a 15-minute training session that consists of a warm-up, stretching, strengthening, ''plyometrics'', and sport specific agility training.'

What is knee pain?,"'Pain is a common knee problem that can originate in any of the bony structures compromising the ''knee joint'' (femur, tibia, fibula), the kneecap (''patella''), or the ligaments, tendons, and cartilage (''meniscus'') of the knee. Knee pain can be aggravated by physical activity, as well as ''obesity'', affected by the surrounding muscles and their movements, and be triggered by other problems (such as a foot injury). Knee pain can affect people of all ages, and home remedies can be helpful unless it becomes severe.' "
What are knee pain symptoms and signs?,"'The location of the knee pain can vary depending on which structure is involved. With infection or an inflammatory process, the whole knee might be swollen and painful, while a ''torn meniscus'' or ''fracture'' of a bone gives symptoms only in one specific location. A ''Baker cyst'' will usually cause pain in the back of the knee.''The severity of the ''joint pain'' can vary, from a minor ache to a severe and disabling pain.''Some of the other signs and symptoms that accompany knee pain are'   difficulty weight bearing or walking due to instability of the knee, limping due to discomfort, difficulty walking up or down steps due to ligament damage (sprain), locking of the knee (unable to bend the knee), redness and swelling, inability to extend the knee, and shifting weight to the opposite knee and foot."
What causes knee pain?,"'Knee pain can be divided into three major categories:''Below is a list of some of the more common causes of knee pain. This is not an all-inclusive list but rather highlights a few common causes of knee pain in each of the above categories.''Fractures'': A direct blow to the bony structure can cause one of the bones in the knee to break. This is usually a very obvious and painful ''knee injury''. Most knee fractures are not only painful but will also interfere with the proper functioning of the knee (such as kneecap fracture) or make it very painful to bear weight (such as tibial plateau fracture). All fractures need immediate medical attention. Many fractures require significant force, and a thorough examination is performed to detect other injuries.''Ligament injuries'': The most common injury is the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury. An ACL injury is often a sports-related injury due to a sudden stop and change in directions. The remaining ligaments (posterior cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament, and medial collateral ligament) are injured less frequently.''Meniscus injuries'': The menisci (medial and lateral) are made of cartilage and act as ''shock'' absorbers between bones in the knee. Twisting the knee can injure the meniscus.''Dislocation'': The knee joint can be dislocated, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. ''Knee dislocation'' can compromise blood flow to the leg and have other related problems. This injury often occurs during a motor-vehicle accident when the knee hits the dashboard.'

What medical conditions cause knee pain?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' is an autoimmune condition that can affect any joint in the body. It can cause severe pain and disability, as well as swelling.''Gout'' is a form of arthritis that is most commonly found in the big toe, though it can also affect the knee. ''Gout'' tends to flare up and is extremely painful during the acute episodes. When there is no flare-up, the knee can be pain free.''With ''septic arthritis'' (''infectious arthritis''), the knee joint can become infected; this leads to pain, swelling, and ''fever''. This condition requires antibiotics and drainage treatments as soon as possible.''Patellar tendinitis ''is an inflammation of the tendons connecting the kneecap (patella) to the shinbone (the bone of the lower leg). Patellar tendinitis is a chronic condition often found in individuals repeating the same motion during ''exercise'' (such as runners and cyclists).''Patellofemoral pain syndrome is caused by degeneration or ''stress'' under the kneecap (patella) where it meets the thighbone (femur). Patellofemoral pain syndrome occurs in runners and cyclists.''Osteoarthritis'': a wearing down of cartilage of the joint due to use and age''Prepatellar bursitis'': Inflammation to the bursa (fluid-filled sac) in front of the kneecap may cause anterior knee pain.''Children can develop inflammation of the point of bony insertion of the patellar tendon (''Osgood-Schlatter disease'').' "
What are risk factors for knee pain?,"'Biomechanics'': The knee joint is complicated in its operation and is used frequently throughout the day. Any change in the movement of the joint (leg-length difference, change in walking style due to back problems) can cause subtle changes and cause pain and injuries.''Excess weight'': The ''stress'' on the knee joint is increased with excess weight. Obesity also increases the risk of knee\xa0osteoarthritis as the cartilage breaks down more rapidly.''Overuse during repetitive motions'' as are found during certain exercises (jogging, skiing) or work conditions (long periods of kneeling) can cause breakdown of cartilage and lead to pain.' "
When should see a doctor for knee pain?,"'Any pain that does not respond to rest or disappears within a few days should be evaluated by a doctor. In addition, the following are symptoms and signs in the knee that a doctor should evaluate: swelling, inability to bend, deformity, unable to walk or discomfort while walking, significant pain, and ''fever''.' "
What procedures and tests diagnose knee pain?,"""A health care professional will begin by asking questions related to the person's general health and then specifically to the nature of the knee pain (how long, how severe, does anything make it feel better or worse, etc.).""'Next, an examination of the knee will be performed. This will include bending the knee through the full range of motion, checking for stability of the ligaments, and evaluating for any tenderness and swelling. It is often helpful to compare the results of the examination of the painful knee with the other knee. Frequently, this is all that is required to make a diagnosis and start treatment. In several research studies, it has been found that an experienced examiner is as reliable as X-ray examination.''Sometimes the doctor might want to do further studies such as the following tests.''Plain X-ray can establish fractures and degenerative changes of the knee.''MRI'' is used to evaluate the soft tissues of the knee for ligament tears or cartilage and muscle injuries.''If ''gout'', arthritis, or other medical conditions are suspected, a health care professional might order blood tests.''Some conditions are best diagnosed by removal of a small amount of fluid from the knee joint. During ''arthrocentesis'', a small needle is placed into your joint and fluid is withdrawn. This is done in a sterile method. The fluid is then sent to the laboratory for evaluation. This procedure is especially helpful if an infected knee joint is suspected or to distinguish ''gout'' and different forms of arthritis. If there is a collection of blood in the joint due to a traumatic injury, removing the fluid can help relieve the pain.' "
Which types of doctors treat knee pain?,"'Often knee pain can be evaluated and treated by your primary care doctor. If the knee pain requires surgery or the cause of the pain needs further evaluation, an orthopedic surgeon will usually be consulted. With arthritis, ''gout'', or inflammatory joint problems a ''rheumatologist'' may be consulted.' "
What is the treatment for knee pain?,"'Treatments for knee pain are as varied as the conditions that can cause the pain.''Medications might be prescribed to treat an underlying medical condition or for pain relief.''If you are taking ''over-the-counter''\xa0anti-inflammatory pain medications regularly for your knee pain, you should see your doctor to be evaluated.''Sometimes physical therapy sessions to strengthen the muscles around the knee will make it more stable and help guarantee the best mechanical movements. Working with a physical therapist can help avoid injuries or further worsening of an injury.''Injecting medications directly into your knee might help in certain situations. The two most common injections are ''corticosteroids'' and lubricants. ''Corticosteroid'' injections can help arthritis and other inflammations of the knee. They usually need to be repeated every few months. Lubricants that are similar to the fluid already in your knee joint can help with movement and pain.'  "
Will surgery treat and cure knee pain?,"'Knee operations range from arthroscopic knee surgery to ''total knee replacement''. Arthroscopic knee surgery is a very common surgical procedure that allows the physician look inside your knee through a few small holes and a fiberoptic camera. The surgeon can repair many of the injuries and remove small pieces of loose bones or cartilage. This is a common outpatient procedure.''Partial ''knee replacement'': The surgeon replaces the damaged portions of the knee with ''plastic'' and metal parts. Because only part of the knee joint is replaced, this procedure has a shorter recovery then a total knee replacement.''Total knee replacement'': In this procedure, the knee is replaced with an artificial joint.''Acupuncture'' has shown some relieve of knee pain, especially in patients with osteoarthritis. ''Glucosamine'' and chondroitin ''supplements'' have shown mixed results in research studies.' "
What natural home remedies relieve knee pain?,"'Over-the-counter pain medications can frequently alleviate the pain. If someone is taking these medications on a regular basis, he or she should see a health care professional to evaluate the knee pain for proper diagnosis and to avoid the potential side effects of chronic medication use.''The RICE mnemonic is often helpful, especially for minor injuries:''Rest: Rest the joint, and take a break from your usually activities involving the knee joint.''Ice: Applying ice can help with pain and inflammation.''Compress: A compression bandage can help prevent swelling and help knee alignment. It should not be tight and should be removed at night.''Elevate: Elevation can help with swelling and resting of the knee.' "
What are the complications of knee pain?,"'Frequently, knee pain will disappear without ever finding a specific cause. Depending on the underlying cause of the pain, the condition can progress and lead to more serious injuries or complications. Usually, these complications are long term and result in worsening pain or an increasing difficulty to walk.' "
Can you prevent knee pain?,"'There can be many reasons for knee pain. Therefore, there are different strategies to prevent the pain depending on the underlying cause. ''Running'' on soft surfaces or decreasing the amount of running can help if the pain is due to overuse. Avoiding any direct injuries to the knee including wearing a seatbelt can prevent traumatic injuries. ''Weight loss'' can be helpful for many different forms of knee pain.' "
Can knee pain come back after being treated?,"'Frequently, knee pain will occur for a short period of time and then resolve. Sometimes it can return a few weeks or months later. For chronic knee pain, it is important to get it evaluated to avoid further damage to cartilage, bones, or ligaments. Prognosis depends on the underlying causes of the pain.'""With modern surgical techniques, it's possible to relieve many of the knee pain syndromes and return to an active lifestyle.""  "
What is a total knee replacement?,"'A total knee replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased knee joint is replaced with artificial material. The knee is a hinge joint that provides motion at the point where the thigh meets the lower leg. The thighbone (or femur) abuts the large bone of the lower leg (tibia) at the knee joint.''During a total knee replacement, the end of the femur bone is removed and replaced with a metal shell. The end of the lower leg bone (tibia) is also removed and replaced with a channeled ''plastic'' piece with a metal stem. Depending on the condition of the kneecap portion of the knee joint, a plastic ""button"" may also be added under the kneecap surface. The artificial components of a total knee replacement are referred to as the prosthesis.''The posterior cruciate ligament is a tissue that normally stabilizes each side of the knee joint so that the lower leg cannot slide backward in relation to the thighbone. In total knee replacement surgery, this ligament is either retained, sacrificed, or substituted by a polyethylene post. Each of these various designs of total knee replacement has its own particular benefits and risks.'  "
What patients should consider a total knee replacement?,"'Total knee replacement surgery is considered for patients whose knee joints have been damaged by either progressive ''arthritis'', ''trauma'', or other rare destructive diseases of the joint. The most common reason for knee replacement in the United States is severe ''osteoarthritis'' of the knees.''Regardless of the cause of the damage to the joint, the resulting progressively increasing ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' and decreasing daily function lead the patient to consider total knee replacement. Decisions regarding whether or when to undergo knee replacement surgery are not easy. Patients should understand the risks as well as the benefits before making these decisions about knee replacement.'  "
What are the risks of undergoing a total knee replacement?,"'Risks of total knee replacement include ''blood clots'' in the legs that can travel to the ''lungs'' (pulmonaryembolism). ''Pulmonary embolism'' can cause ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', and even ''shock''. Other risks include ''urinary tract infection'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (usually related to pain medication), chronic ''knee pain'' and stiffness, bleeding into the knee joint, nerve damage, blood vessel injury, and infection of the knee which can require reoperation. Furthermore, the risks of anesthesia include potential ''heart'', lung, kidney, and ''liver'' damage.' "
What is involved with the pre-operative evaluation for total knee replacement?,"'Before surgery, the joints adjacent to the diseased knee (hip and ankle) are carefully evaluated. This is important to ensure optimal outcome and recovery from the surgery. Replacing a knee joint that is adjacent to a severely damaged joint may not yield significant improvement in function as the nearby joint may become more painful if it is abnormal. Furthermore, all medications that the patient is taking are reviewed. Blood-thinning medications such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') and anti-inflammatory medications such as ''aspirin'' may have to be adjusted or discontinued prior to knee replacement surgery.''Routine blood tests of liver and kidney function and urine tests are evaluated for signs of ''anemia'', infection, or abnormal metabolism. ''Chest X-ray'' and ''EKG'"" are performed to exclude significant heart and lung disease that may preclude surgery or anesthesia. Finally, a knee replacement surgery is less likely to have good long-term outcome if the patient's weight is greater than 200 pounds. Excess body weight simply puts the replaced knee at an increased risk of loosening and/or dislocation and makes recovery more difficult.""'Another risk is encountered in younger patients who may tend to be more active, thereby adding trauma to the replaced joint.' "
What happens in the post-operative period? What is involved in the recovery from surgery?,"'A total knee replacement generally requires between one and a half to three hours of operative time. Post-surgery, patients are taken to a recovery room, where vital organs are frequently monitored. When stabilized, patients are returned to their hospital room.''Passage of urine can be difficult in the immediate postoperative period, and this condition can be aggravated by pain medications. A catheter inserted into the urethra (a Foley catheter) allows free passage of urine until the patient becomes more mobile.''Physical therapy is an extremely important part of rehabilitation and requires full participation by the patient for optimal outcome. Patients can begin physical therapy 48 hours after surgery. Some degree of pain, discomfort, and stiffness can be expected during the early days of physical therapy. Knee immobilizers are used in order to stabilize the knee while undergoing physical therapy, ''walking'', and sleeping. They may be removed under the guidance of the physical therapist for various portions of physical therapy.''A unique device that can help speed recovery is the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine. The CPM machine is first attached to the operated leg. The machine then constantly moves the knee through various degrees of range of motion for hours while the patient relaxes. This can help to improve circulation and minimize the risk of scarring and contracture of the tissues around the knee.''Patients will start walking using a walker and crutches. Eventually, patients will learn to walk up and down stairs and grades. A number of home exercises are given to strengthen thigh and calf muscles.'  "
How does the patient continue to improve as an outpatient after discharge from the hospital? What are recommended exercises?,"'For an optimal outcome after total knee replacement surgery, it is important for patients to continue in an outpatient physical-therapy program along with home exercises during the healing process. Patients will be asked to continue exercising the muscles around the replaced joint to prevent scarring (and contracture) and maintain muscle strength for the purposes of joint stability. These exercises after surgery can reduce recovery time and lead to optimal strength and stability.''The ''wound'' will be monitored by the surgeon and his/her staff for healing. Patients also should watch for warning signs of infection, including abnormal redness, increasing warmth, swelling, or unusual pain. It is important to report any injury to the joint to the doctor immediately.''Future activities are generally limited to those that do not risk injuring the replaced joint. Sports that involve ''running'' or contact are avoided, in favor of leisure sports, such as golf, and ''swimming''. Swimming is the ideal form of ''exercise'', since the sport improves muscle strength and endurance without exerting any pressure or ''stress'' on the replaced joint.''Patients with joint replacements should alert their doctors and dentists that they have an artificial joint. These joints are at risk for infection by bacteria introduced by any invasive procedures such as surgery, dental or gum procedures, urological and endoscopic procedures, as well as from infections elsewhere in the body.''The treating physician will typically prescribe antibiotics before, during, and immediately after any elective procedures in order to prevent infection of the replaced joint.''Though infrequent, patients with total knee replacements can require a second operation years later. The second operation can be necessary because of loosening, ''fracture'', or other complications of the replaced joint. Reoperations are generally not as successful as original operations and carry higher risks of complications. Future replacement devices and techniques will improve patient outcomes and lead to fewer complications.'  "
What to know about spider bites,"'There are many species of spiders around the world such as the jumping spider, wolf spider, brown recluse, black widow, hobo spider, tarantulas, false black widow, camel spider, etc. Most spiders don’t bite unless they are threatened. Some don’t even have fangs. Most ''spider bites'' aren’t poisonous. A few species in the United States and Australia are known to be poisonous and can be deadly. These are the black widow and brown recluse.' "
How do you identify a spider bite?,"'The most obvious way to identify a ''spider bite'' is to see the spider on or near the person’s body. The puncture marks may be seen on the body part. They may be surrounded by an area of redness. In the United States, only the black widow and brown recluse are often known to be the most harmful to people.' The black widow is an approximately 1-inch long spider with a shiny black body and long legs. It has a red hourglass-shaped mark on the outer side of the belly. The brown recluse is around 0.25to 0.75-inches long, violin-shaped and golden brown with six eyes. Most spiders live in undisturbed, dark areas such as woodpiles, sheds or attics and they don’t bite unless threatened."
What are the symptoms of spider bites?,"'Although all the spiders look different, they do share some common symptoms. The severity of a ''spider bite'' may depend on the type of the spider, the amount of venom injected and your body’s sensitivity to it.''If you suspect that you have been bitten by a spider, you may have' Bite marks Sudden sharp pain at the site of the bite that may last for days Tingling sensation around the bite Inability to move the limb that was bitten Headache, nausea, vomiting and belly pain Painful, red tiny bumps Itching A lot of sweating and chills A lot of drooling Swelling around your face and eyes (if you have an allergy to the venom) Cyanosis (turns your lips and skin blue due to poor blood flow) Muscle or neck pain Cramps or muscle twitching Lung swelling"
What can you do if you have a spider bite?,"'If you suspect that you have been bitten by a spider, you must' Check whether you have any spider bite marks. Do not panic. Most bites are harmless. Clean the area with soap and water. Wrap a clean, wet towel around the area. Place an ice cube on the bite to reduce the redness and swelling. Put some antibiotic cream on that area. Do not put a bandage on (unless you know the type of spider or bite). Raise your arm or leg if it was bitten. Take a mild, over-the-counter analgesic such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for your pain. Take an over-the-counter antihistamine to reduce your swelling. Call or see a doctor ifYou are unsure whether it was a poisonous spider.A child is bitten.You have symptoms beyond just a bite such as stomach pain, cramping, throwing up or breathing trouble.Your symptoms and pain worsen after 24 hours. You are unsure whether it was a poisonous spider. A child is bitten. You have symptoms beyond just a bite such as stomach pain, cramping, throwing up or breathing trouble. Your symptoms and pain worsen after 24 hours. If possible, take a photo of the spider or take the spider (even dead) to the doctor to help identify it and correlate it with your symptoms."
What is kyphosis?,"'The spine has a series of normal curves when viewed from the side. These curves help absorb the loads applied to the spine from the weight of the body. The cervical spine (neck) and lumbar spine (lower back) have a normal inward curvature that health care professionals call ''lordosis'' or ''lordotic'' curvature by which the spine is bent backward. The thoracic spine (upper back) has a normal outward curvature that is health care providers call''kyphosis'' or the ''kyphotic'' curve by which the spine is bent forward. The official medical term for an abnormal curvature of the thoracic spine is ''hyperkyphosis''. However, abnormal kyphosis and hyperkyphosis are commonly referred to as ''kyphosis'' by the medical community, so in this discussion, the term kyphosis will be used to discuss abnormal kyphosis. In other words, kyphosis is a deformity of the spine of the upper back causing an exaggerated outward curve.''The spine is normally straight when looking from the front. ''Scoliosis'' is an abnormal curve when viewed from the front. ''Scoliosis'' can occur from bony abnormalities of the spine at birth, growth abnormalities especially with adolescence, degenerative spinal changes in adulthood, or abnormal twisting of the vertebrae because of ''muscle spasm'' after an injury.''The normal curves of the spine allow the head to balance directly over the pelvis. If one or more of these curves is either too great or too small, the head may not properly balance over the pelvis. This can lead to ''back pain'', ''stiffness'', and an altered gait or ''walking'' pattern.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of kyphosis?,"'The most common symptoms for patients with an abnormal kyphosis are the appearance of poor posture with a hump appearance of the back or ""roundback."" Symptoms may include ''back pain'', muscle ''fatigue'', and stiffness in the back. Most often, these symptoms remain constant and do not become progressively worse with time.''In more severe situations, the patient may notice their symptoms worsening with time. The kyphosis can progress, causing a more exaggerated hunchback. In rare cases, this can lead to compression of the spinal cord with neurologic symptoms including ''weakness'', loss of sensation, or loss of bowel and bladder control. Severe cases of thoracic kyphosis can also limit the amount of space in the chest and cause cardiac and pulmonary problems leading to ''chest pain'' or ''shortness of breath'' with eventual pulmonary and/or ''heart failure''.'  "
What causes abnormal kyphosis? What are the types of kyphosis?,"""There are three main types of abnormal kyphosis: postural kyphosis, Scheuermann's kyphosis (Scheuermann's disease), and congenital kyphosis.""'Postural kyphosis is the most common type of kyphosis. This is more common in girls than in boys and typically appears during adolescence. Poor posture (slouching) and a weakening of the muscles and ligaments in the back (paraspinous muscles) cause postural kyphosis. Typically, the vertebrae are a normal shape in postural kyphosis. It is often slow to develop and usually does not continue to become progressively worse with time. These patients can have symptoms of ''pain'' and muscle ''fatigue''. This is commonly mild kyphosis. This type of kyphosis does not lead to a severe curve, and there is little risk of neurologic, cardiac, or pulmonary problems.'""Scheuermann's kyphosis also first appears during adolescence. This type of kyphosis is the result of a structural deformity of the vertebrae. It is more common to develop scoliosis (kyphoscoliosis) with Scheuermann's kyphosis than with the other types of kyphosis. The diagnosis requires ""'X-rays'' to show a wedge of at least 5 degrees at the front of at least three neighboring vertebral bodies. Physicians do not understand the reason for this abnormal wedging of the vertebrae.''Congenital kyphosis is the least common type of abnormal kyphosis. An abnormal development of the vertebrae during development prior to birth causes congenital kyphosis. This can lead to several of the vertebrae growing together (fusing) in kyphosis.''There are other disorders that can lead to different types of kyphosis in adults. Each of these disorders can lead to a collapse of the front of the vertebrae and the development of kyphosis. The most common of these is from sustaining multiple compression ''fractures'' of the bony building blocks of the spine (vertebrae) from ''osteoporosis'' (thinning of the bones). Multiple wedge-shaped deformities resulting from compression fractures in the thoracic spine can lead to severe kyphosis. Other causes include ''degenerative arthritis'', spine infections, and spine tumors. ''Ankylosing spondylitis'' can lead to ''spinal fusion'' and severe kyphosis.'  "
When should you seek medical attention?,"'Postural changes cause most cases of kyphosis, and it rarely progresses to cause serious complications. However, a physician should evaluate any patient who develops signs or symptoms of kyphosis to rule out a more serious cause. A referral to an orthopedist may be necessary for proper evaluation and treatment. Additionally, a physician should evaluate any patient with worsening of symptoms or who develops any weakness, numbness, or tingling in the legs or ''chest pain'' and shortness of breath.' "
How is kyphosis diagnosed?,"'Your doctor will likely begin by obtaining your medical history, including when you first noticed your symptoms, any history of family members with similar problems, and other history of back or neck problems. A doctor will perform a physical examination. This will assess the curve of your spine both standing upright and while bending forward. A health care professional will test your strength, sensation, reflexes, and flexibility in your arms and legs.'""Based on the results of the history and physical examination, your physician may order X-rays of your spine. This can help differentiate postural kyphosis (normal shaped vertebrae) from Scheuermann's kyphosis (wedged-shaped vertebrae). If your doctor finds any evidence of neurologic injury, you may also obtain an ""'MRI'' of your spine. This can identify any compression of the spinal cord or nerves. If you have any chest ''pain'' or shortness of breath, your physician may order additional tests to evaluate your ''heart'' and ''lungs''.'  "
What is the treatment for abnormal kyphosis?,"'Treatment options depend on the type of kyphosis. Nonsurgical treatment is most common. Physical therapy strengthens the back muscles and corrects the posture of individuals with postural kyphosis. Mild pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications can also help with symptoms. These curves do not continue to worsen with time or lead complications that are more serious. Surgery is unnecessary for postural kyphosis.'""Initially, health care professionals treat Scheuermann's kyphosis with a combination of physical therapy exercises and mild pain and anti-inflammatory medications. If the patient is still growing, a brace can be effective. Physicians often recommend ""'braces'' for more severe kyphosis with curves of at least 45 degrees and can be continued until the patient is no longer growing. X-rays are frequently used to monitor the degree of kyphosis over time. Bracing is not typically recommended for adults who are no longer growing.'""In some cases, physician's recommend surgery for Scheuermann's kyphosis. The goals of surgery are to partially correct the deformity of the kyphosis, relieve pain, and improve your overall spinal alignment. Indications for surgery include a curve greater than 75 degrees, uncontrolled pain, and neurologic, cardiac, or pulmonary complaints.""'There are various types of surgical procedures available depending on the specifics of each case. Surgery can be performed from the front (anterior approach), from the back (posterior approach), or both (combined anterior and posterior approach). A surgeon makes the decision based on the specific characteristics of the spinal curve. A health care professional may obtain X-rays bending forward and backward to determine how flexible the spine is. If it is flexible, a posterior approach may be adequate. If the spine is less flexible, an anterior or combined approach may be used. Regardless of the approach, the surgery involves partially straightening your spine and using rods and screws in the vertebrae to hold the spine while a bony fusion occurs (spinal fusion).''Treatment of congenital kyphosis often involves surgery while the patient is an infant. An abnormality in the developing vertebrae causes congenital kyphosis. Surgical treatment earlier in life can help correct the spinal deformity before it continues to worsen.''Sometimes, a procedure called a kyphoplasty treats kyphosis from painful collapse of vertebrae due to ''osteoporosis''. With kyphoplasty, a balloon is inserted into the affected vertebra and filled with a liquid (methymethacrylate) that hardens to restore the vertebral height. This procedure is a last resort after failure of noninvasive treatment.'  "
What are the potential complications of surgery for kyphosis?,"'The most common complications from surgery for kyphosis include infection and failure of the bones to heal (failure of fusion, also known as pseudoarthrosis). Other more serious complications are much less common, including injury to the nerves or blood vessels, complications related to anesthesia, or ''blood clots'' in lower extremities or lungs.' "
What ongoing care is required for patients with kyphosis?,"'Most patients with kyphosis do not require continued care by a physician. After the initial diagnosis and initiating physical therapy and exercises, the patient will often not need routine follow-up care. Patients that notice a progression of their curve or a worsening of their symptoms should see their doctor for further evaluation.' "
How can I prevent kyphosis?,"""Scheuermann's and congenital kyphosis are both the result of a structural problem with the vertebrae. As a result, there is nothing that people can do to prevent these types of kyphosis. Bracings and exercises can help slow the progression of Scheuermann's kyphosis. It's possible to prevent postural kyphosis or lessen the severity with physical therapy and exercises to strengthen the back muscles."" "
What is the prognosis for kyphosis?,"'The majority of patient with kyphosis respond very well to a combination of physical therapy, exercises, and medications.
