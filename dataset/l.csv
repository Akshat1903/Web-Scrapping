Questions,Answer
Facts you should know about labor and delivery,"""Every woman's experience is unique. Below are typical guidelines that will help you understand what to expect during ""'labor'' and delivery.' Normal labor can begin three weeks prior to the anticipated due date up until two weeks afterwards. There is no way to precisely predict when labor will begin. In the first stage of labor the cervix dilates and effaces (thins out). Once contractions begin, they usually increase in strength, duration, and frequency. The second stage of labor begins when the cervix is completely (i.e. 10 centimeters) dilated. It ends when, following expulsive efforts (pushing) by the mother, the infant is delivered. During the third stage of labor, the placenta and membranes are delivered. There are a number of methods for monitoring the fetus that may be used during labor. Options for pain control during labor include breathing exercises, imagery, relaxation techniques, medications, and regional anesthesia."
What are the early symptoms and signs of labor?,"'Signs and symptoms of impending labor are not uniform among all women.''Early symptoms and signs that labor is approaching are ""lightening"" and passing the mucous plug.''Lightening is a term used to denote the descent of the fetal head into the pelvis as labor approaches. It can occur up to two weeks prior to the onset of labor, or it may not occur at all. At that time, there may be increased pressure on the maternal bladder accompanied by the urge to urinate more frequently. Many women find it easier to breathe after lightening occurs because upward pressure on the ''diaphragm'' diminishes.''Release or passage of the ""''mucus'' plug"" can be another sign that labor is near. Mucus produced by the cervical glands normally blocks the entrance to the cervix and helps prevent infection. When the fetal head impinges on the cervix, mucus from the cervical glands, along with a small amount of blood, is expelled. This results in a blood-tinged or brownish discharge being expelled from the vagina. Passage of the mucus plug may occur days before or after labor begins. It is also common after a vaginal examination.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs that labor is near or has begun?,"'Spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes is referred to as one\'s ""water breaking."" This means that the membranes that surround the baby have ruptured, and clear ''amniotic fluid'' is often expelled from the vagina at that time. Once this occurs, labor will generally ensue spontaneously. If it does not, induction of labor may be necessary to avoid infection ascending upward through the vagina into the uterus. Most commonly rupture of the membranes does not occur until labor has already begun.''Finally, labor begins with the onset of contractions. At that point, the cervix begins to thin out and dilate. When contractions begin to occur less than ten minutes apart, this frequently signals the onset of labor. Irregular contractions, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions or ""''false labor'',"" occur toward the end of ''pregnancy'' during the ''third trimester'', and they do not necessarily signify that labor is imminent. Some women even experience these contractions during the ''second trimester''. Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually milder than those of ''true labor'' are, and they do not occur at regular intervals.' "
What are the stages of labor and delivery?,"'Labor is divided into three stages; corresponding to the dilation of the cervix, the birth of the baby, and the delivery of the placenta.' "
Stage 1 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 1 is the longest stage of labor. It is characterized by thinning (effacement) and dilation of the cervix. Sometimes doctors subdivide this stage into three separate phases: the latent phase, the active phase, and the transition phase. Contractions, occurring with increasing frequency, are present during all phases of Stage 1. Early contractions last from 30 to 45 seconds and are several minutes apart. During the latent phase, the cervix dilates to about 3 to 4 centimeters. Many women are admitted to the hospital during this phase. In the active phase, the cervix dilates to about 7 centimeters, and the contractions become more intense. During the transition phase, the cervix dilates completely to 10 centimeters, and the contractions are strong and painful. Contractions can occur every 3 to 4 minutes and last from 60 to 90 seconds.' "
Stage 2 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 2 refers to the passage of the baby through the birth canal until delivery. It begins when the cervix has fully dilated and voluntary pushing is initiated. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''""pushing"" stage'"". The head is typically delivered first, and sustained pushing allows for delivery of the infant's shoulders and body. Some women prefer different body positions during this stage of labor. These may include kneeling, squatting, lying down, or even on the hands and knees. This stage may take minutes to a few hours. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a woman giving birth for the first time should complete Stage 2 within 2 hours if no regional anesthesia has been used, and up to 3 hours if she has received anesthesia. Stage 2 is usually shorter in subsequent ""'pregnancies'', up to 2 hours if anesthesia has been given and 1 hour if none has been used.' "
Stage 3 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 3 begins at the time the infant is delivered. In stage 3, the placenta and fetal membranes are expelled. The placenta and membranes are sometimes referred to as the ''afterbirth''. Stage 3 usually takes only 5 to 10 minutes, but it can take up to 30 minutes. Mild contractions may occur during stage 3, and there may be some associated bleeding.' "
What are pain control options during labor and delivery?,"'Many women opt not to receive medications or interventions for ''pain'' control during labor and delivery, while others choose medical or procedural pain control methods. Several different opioid analgesic and opioid agonist medications are acceptable for pain control. Examples are''Regional anesthesia is another option. This can be administered as an epidural, spinal, or combined spinal-epidural block. Research has shown that regional anesthesia is more effective than injectable medications for controlling pain. Moreover, large-scale ''clinical trials'' did not show an increase in the ''C-section'' rate in women who opted for regional anesthesia.''Women who choose not to receive pain medications can use breathing techniques and/or imagery for pain control. Relaxation techniques and ''yoga'' have also proved beneficial.'  injectable meperidine, fentanyl, morphine, butorphanol (Stadol), and nalbuphine (Nubain)."
What kind of monitoring is done during labor and delivery?," During the first stage of labor, you will likely have pelvic examinations to check the dilation and thinning of the cervix. The baby's heart rate is usually checked intermittently with a Doppler device, or continuous electronic fetal monitoring may be employed. External fetal monitoring is accomplished by placing a transducer on the maternal abdominal wall. The transducer detects the fetal heart rate and displays it on a visual tracing. Internal monitoring is another method used to follow the fetal heartbeat. With this technology, a small electrode is passed through the cervix and attached to the fetal scalp. The type of monitoring selected depends upon a number of factors, and it will vary from patient to patient. Your health-care professional will choose the most appropriate type for your individual situation. Continuous fetal monitoring is almost universally used if the woman receives epidural anesthesia, or if oxytocin (Pitocin) is used to induce labor. It is also employed with high-risk pregnancies or if the labor is complicated."
Why is labor induced?,"'Labor induction may be indicated in the following:' Post-term pregnancy: If the process of labor hasn’t begun two weeks beyond the due date (usually over 39-41 weeks), the doctor may suggest inducing labor. Rupture of the membranes before labor: The membranes rupture (water breaks), but labor has not begun. Gestational diabetes: This is diabetes in the mother that develops during pregnancy. High blood pressure disorders of pregnancy: This involves hypertension (high blood pressure) that develops during pregnancy. Chorioamnionitis: It is an infection of the uterus. Intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR): The weight of the fetus is below average. Oligohydramnios: It is reduced amniotic fluid in the uterus surrounding the baby. Placental abruption: The placenta detaches partially or completely from the inner wall of the uterus before delivery. Systemic medical conditions: Certain systemic medical conditions such as kidney disease or obesity."
How is labor induced?,"'Induction of labor is usually performed in a ''labor and delivery'' unit, with an operating room and resources available to perform an emergency cesarean delivery if necessary and induction fail. If induction is successful, women may be able to deliver vaginally. The fetal and maternal status are continuously monitored. Induced labor is usually more painful than natural labor because uterine contractions are quicker and much stronger. Hence, women may need an epidural (regional anesthesia) to manage ''pain''.''There are various techniques to induce labor:' Ripen your cervix: Medications called prostaglandins are usually placed inside the vagina to cause thinning or ripening (softening) of the cervix. Another technique that may be used to ripen the cervix is filling a balloon catheter with saline and placing it in the cervix. Amniotomy: This involves rupturing the amniotic sac, also referred to as rupturing the membranes or breaking of water. A small opening in the amniotic sac is made using a surgical instrument resulting in the gushing of flush, also known as “water breaking.” An amniotomy is done only if the cervix is partially dilated and thinned. Intravenous medication: Medication such as the synthetic version of the hormone oxytocin is administered intravenously (IV). Oxytocin is a naturally occurring hormone in women that causes the uterus to contract. IV oxytocin augments labor that has already begun."
What are the complications of labor induction?,"'Some common risks that may be associated with induction of labor include:' Failed induction: About 25% of induced women may need cesarean delivery due to failed induction. Women who are pregnant for the first time have a higher risk of failure of induction. Infection: Some methods of induction of labor, such as rupturing the membranes (especially if there is prolonged membrane rupture), may increase the risk of infection in the mother and/or baby. Fetal distress: Medications used to induce labor can cause abnormal or excessive contractions, which reduce the baby's heart rate and oxygen supply resulting in fetal distress. Uterine rupture: It is a life-threatening complication in which the uterus ruptures the scar from previous surgery. Rarely, the uterus may rupture in women who have never had previous uterine surgery. An emergency cesarean delivery with or without a hysterectomy (uterus removal) is required. Postpartum hemorrhage: Labor induction increases the risk of uterine atony (the uterine muscles don’t contract properly) that can cause severe bleeding after delivery."
What are Braxton Hicks contractions?,"'Braxton Hicks contractions are contractions of the uterus that occur during the third trimester of pregnancy. They are perfectly normal and have been said to represent contractions that occur as the uterus is preparing to give birth. In some women, they occur as early as the ''second trimester''. Sometimes, Braxton Hicks contractions have been referred to as ""false ''labor''.""''In contrast to the contractions of ''true labor'', Braxton Hicks contractions do not occur at regular intervals, do not get stronger over time, and do not last longer over time. They do not occur at predictable intervals, and they may disappear altogether for a time. They tend to become more frequent toward the end of pregnancy.''Braxton Hicks contractions are named after an English doctor, John Braxton Hicks, who first described them in 1872.'  "
What causes Braxton Hicks contractions?,"'Common events can sometimes trigger Braxton Hicks contractions, for example:' Increased activity of mother or baby Touching of the maternal abdomen Dehydration Sexual intercourse Distended maternal bladder"
What do Braxton Hicks contractions feel like?,'Braxton Hicks contractions are not typically as painful as those of true ''labor contractions''. Some women describe them as a tightening sensation across the lower abdomen. They may feel similar to ''menstrual cramps'' in some women. The abdomen may become firm to the touch. They do not occur at regular intervals.'  
Which home remedies help relieve Braxton Hicks contraction discomfort and pain?,"'If Braxton Hicks contractions are uncomfortable, you can take these measures:' Change positions, take a walk, or rest if you have been active. Drink a glass of water, or a cup of herbal tea. Perform relaxation exercises, deep breathing, or mental relaxation. Eat something. Bathe in a warm bath for up to 30 minutes."
When should I call my doctor about Braxton Hicks contractions?,"'Call your doctor or ''midwife'"" if you haven't reached 37 weeks and the contractions are increasing in frequency, are more painful, or you have any of the signs of preterm ""'labor'':'  Increasing vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, or spotting; Increasing low back pain or pelvic pressure; More than four contractions an hour; Menstrual-like cramping or abdominal pain."
Labor and Delivery: Pain control options introduction,"'Women respond differently to the ''pain'' of ''labor and delivery''. ''Pain'' control options during ''labor'"" and delivery are a personal choice, and a birth plan can typically be individualized according to a woman's wishes. The circumstances of ""'labor'' and individual medical conditions can sometimes determine what pain relief options are indicated. Available medical pain control options range from pain control medications to ''nerve blocks'' and anesthesia. It is helpful to discuss your preferences with your health care professional in advance so that your questions can be fully answered and your wishes can be expressed. Of course, during your ''labor'"", your health care professional will assess your progress and determine how you are feeling. It's fine to change your mind about pain relief options even during ""'labor''. Consequently, understanding the various options for pain control will help you make an informed decision.''This article describes the most commonly used medical pain relief interventions used for labor and delivery. All of these options have been shown to be safe for both mother and baby.' "
Regional anesthesia: Spinal and epidural blocks,"'Epidural anesthesia is a popular choice for pain control because it does not affect your ability to push during labor. With this procedure, medications are injected near the nerves of the low back to block pain signals from your lower body, even though you remain awake and labor is usually not significantly slowed. An anesthesiologist typically administers this type of anesthesia. With an epidural block, the medicine is injected into the sac that surrounds the spinal cord. Before the medications are injected, a numbing medication is given into the lower back. An epidural block can be used for a Cesarean delivery.''With a spinal block, both contractions and the ability to push are temporarily abolished. With a spinal block, the anesthetic is injected into the subarachnoid space surrounding the spinal cord. A spinal block is usually used when a Cesarean section or an instrumented delivery (e.g. forceps or vacuum extraction) is planned. A spinal usually provides better pain relief than an epidural and may take several hours to wear off, at which time sensory and motor function of the tissues/muscles controlled by the previously blocked nerves will return.''Because many women are not able to urinate immediately following regional anesthesia, a catheter may need to be inserted into the bladder until the spinal or epidural block wears off. A relatively uncommon complication is a ''headache'' which begins after the anesthesia wears off. Both types of anesthesia may temporarily reduce ''blood pressure'', although this is more commonly seen with a spinal block.''A spinal block requires less medication and is typically given only one time, while, with an epidural block, a catheter may be inserted into the epidural space for repeated delivery of anesthetic medications as necessary.''An epidural block takes about 10 to 20 minutes to work, and because a catheter is inserted into the epidural space, the effects can last as long as needed due to the ability to inject more medication. A spinal block begins working immediately, but its effects last only about 2 ½ hours. It is possible to have a combination of both spinal and epidural anesthesia.' "
Local anesthesia,"'Local injections of a numbing medication may be used to relieve a small area of pain, typically around the vagina, if you require an ''episiotomy'' to extend the vaginal opening or if ''stitches'' are needed to repair any damage. This type of anesthesia cannot be used to relieve the pain from contractions during labor.' "
Pudendal block,'A pudendal block is another type of local anesthesia. It involves injecting a numbing medication into the wall of the vagina shortly before delivery to block pain signals from the vagina and area around the vaginal opening. It usually works within 10 minutes and lasts for up to an hour. It does not relieve the pain of labor and is only used at the time of delivery.' 
Narcotics,"'Narcotics, or opioids, are ''drugs'' that diminish the perception of pain. They may be given intravenously or as an intramuscular injection during labor. They can cause ''nausea'' or sleepiness, and they do not completely eliminate pain. Although narcotics have been shown to be safe in labor, they may cause a temporary ''depression'' of ''respiration'' in both mother and baby.'  "
Nitrous oxide,"'Nitrous oxide is an odorless, tasteless, inhaled ''gas'' that is given using a hand-held face mask. It is not generally used in labor in the US but is sometimes used in the United Kingdom and Canada. It has little effect on the baby. Nitrous oxide does not eliminate pain but changes the way the pain is perceived.' "
What is labyrinthitis (inner ear infections)?,"'Labyrinthitis is a type of inner ear condition that causes dizziness, a spinning sensation (''vertigo''), and problems with balance. The dizziness also can cause acute ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Inflammation of the nerves in the inner ear cause labyrinthitis. The inflammation leading to labyrinthitis can be a caused by an inner ''ear infection'', and it has many of the same symptoms as an ''ear infection''.''The anatomy ear is divided into three parts, 1) ''outer ear'', 2) middle ear, and the 3) inner ear.''The ''outer ear'' consists of the parts you can see outside the body, the auricle (also known as pinna), earlobe, and the ear canal up to the eardrum. The middle ear consists of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) and the auditory bones (ossicles) - the incus, malleus, and stapes. The inner ear consists of the fluid-filled semicircular canals, cochlea, ''vestibular'' nerve, and auditory nerve.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of labyrinthitis (inner ear infections)?,"'Signs and symptoms of labyrinthitis\xa0(inner ''ear infections'') may include (one or more):''The symptoms of labyrinthitis are very similar to another inner ear disorder called ''vestibular'' neuritis. The two conditions have similar symptoms, but vestibular neuritis does not include ''hearing loss''.'  Dizziness Spinning sensation (vertigo) Nausea Vomiting Problems with balance Difficulty walking Hearing loss (or decrease in sound volume) in one ear Earache or ear pain Feeling of fullness in the ear Ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or hearing abnormal sounds Discharge from the ear"
What causes labyrinthitis (inner ear infections)? Is it contagious?,"'The exact cause of labyrinthitis\xa0(inner ear infections) is unknown. It may be caused by swelling or problems with the nerve inside the brain responsible for balance and hearing. Labyrinthitis also may occur during or after a viral infection. Viruses associated with labyrinthitis include ''influenza'', ''herpes'' viruses, ''measles'', ''mumps'', ''rubella'', ''hepatitis'', ''Epstein-Barr virus'', and ''polio''.''Rarely, other ear problems like barotrauma (injury due to abnormal pressure inside the ear) or otosclerosis (abnormal growth of bone impeding the middle ear) can cause labyrinthitis.''Labyrinthitis itself is not ''contagious'', however, viral infections that lead to labyrinthitis are.'  "
How long does labyrinthitis (inner ear infections) last?," Labyrinthitis (inner ear infections) symptoms usually last only last a few weeks. If your symptoms don’t resolve after about 3 weeks, see your doctor. If your symptoms are severe (unable to walk, excessive vomiting, headache or weakness) seek medical care immediately."
How can I tell if I have labyrinthitis (inner ear infections)? How is it diagnosed?,"'The only way to know if you have labyrinthitis or another ear problem is to see a doctor. Labyrinthitis symptoms such as dizziness and loss of balance can resemble other medical problems, so a doctor will rule out conditions that may cause the symptoms such as ''head injury'', ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', side effects of medications, ''anxiety'', and neurological disorders.''Make an appointment with your doctor, ENT (ear, nose, and throat specialist) or other healthcare professional if you experience symptoms of an ''ear infection'' such as:''The doctor will use an otoscope to examine the inside of the ear canal and eardrum to check for redness or swelling, ''earwax'' build-up, or any abnormalities in the ear. The doctor may gently puff air against the eardrum to see if it moves, which is normal. If the eardrum does not move, there may be fluid buildup in the middle ear.''A tuning fork exam may help diagnose neurologic hearing loss. Sound waves from the vibration of the tuning fork can be heard through the air and through the bones around the ear.' Ear pain Fullness in the ear Ringing in the ear or other abnormal sounds Discharge from the ear Dizziness Spinning sensation Nausea Vomiting Problems with balance or walking Hearing loss"
What is the treatment for labyrinthitis (inner ear infections)?,"'Once other conditions have been ruled out, the treatment for labyrinthitis (inner ear infections) depends on the cause, your symptoms, and how long the problem has been present.''Your doctor or other healthcare professional may prescribe medications to treat any infection, reduce swelling and inflammation, treat nausea and vomiting, and help eliminate dizziness and vertigo.''If you are having balance problems, your doctor may be refer you to a physical therapist who can prescribe exercises to help with balance.' "
What medications treat and cure labyrinthitis (inner ear infections)?,"'Labyrinthitis (inner ear infections) symptoms and any associated infection may be treated with ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications or prescription medications.''Your doctor may recommend OTC ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), or prescription ''meclizine'' (''Antivert''), ''promethazine'' hydrochloride (Phenergan), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan''), or ''diazepam'' (''Valium'') to help control nausea and vomiting, and to relieve dizziness and vertigo.''If you become dehydrated from severe vomiting, you may receive intravenous fluids in an Emergency Department.' "
What natural or home remedies treat labyrinthitis symptoms?,"'Home remedies cannot treat or cure labyrinthitis (inner ear infections), but they may help relieve symptoms.''Some natural remedies and alternative treatments are touted as treatment or cures for labyrinthitis, including ''garlic'' oil or ''tea tree oil'' ear drops, apple cider vinegar, basil, olive oil, and hydrogen peroxide. Scientific studies do not show any of these to be effective.''Some chiropractors also claim to be able to treat labyrinthitis with manipulation; however, there currently are no studies that show chiropractic treatment to be effective for labyrinthitis.''Talk to your doctor before using any home remedies.' Use a warm compress over the ear may ease pain Stand or keep your head upright. Sitting can help drain the ear. A saltwater gargle may help clear Eustachian tubes, and soothe a sore throat that may accompany labyrinthitis. Do not smoke and limit alcohol intake. Use stress management techniques to control emotional and psychological stress as stress can worsen symptoms. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, for example, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may relieve pain. Do not give children and teenagers aspirin as this has been linked with a serious condition called Reye's syndrome. If your doctor approves, OTC eardrops may be used to relieve pain. Eardrops should not be used in children with tympanostomy tubes (ear tubes) unless specifically prescribed by your child’s pediatrician. AVOID cold and cough medicines in young children, as these can have dangerous side effects."
Can labyrinthitis (inner ear infections) be prevented?,"'You cannot get labyrinthitis\xa0(inner ear infections) from another person who has the condition. However, labyrinthitis often results from ear infections. An ''ear infection'' itself is not contagious, but the viruses and bacteria that cause them are. To prevent ear infections, practice good hygiene.''Children should be vaccinated, specifically with pneumococcal conjugate ''vaccine'' to protect against several types of pneumococcal bacteria, which are the most common cause of ear infections.' Wash your hands frequently Avoid sharing food and drinks, especially with someone you know to have an ear infection Do not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke"
What is the prognosis for a person with labyrinthitis? What are the complications?," When treated promptly, most bouts of labyrinthitis will resolve in days to about 2 weeks duration, with no permanent damage to the ear. Labyrinthitis can lead to increased risk of hearing loss, especially in children who developed the condition as a complication of meningitis. Labyrinthitis can lead to a condition called BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), which causes brief episodes of dizziness and vertigo. The dizziness can be mild to severe. Labyrinthitis may also lead to Ménière disease (also called idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops) to develop years after the initial infection. Ménière's disease can cause variable hearing loss, vertigo, ringing in the ears, and a feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear."
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy.""

What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest and absorb lactose (the ''sugar'' in milk) that results in gastrointestinal symptoms when milk or food products containing milk are consumed. It is due either to a genetically-programmed loss of lactase, the intestinal enzyme responsible for the digestion of lactose, or diseases affecting the small intestine that destroy lactase. Genetically programmed loss of lactase occurs between early childhood and age 21. The timing of this loss is determined primarily by ethnicity.''Because diseases of the intestine can occur at any age, lactose intolerance can begin at any age; however, that does not mean that an individual has become genetically lactase deficient.' "
What causes lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose is a sugar molecule that is made up of two smaller sugars, glucose and galactose. In order for lactose to be absorbed from the intestine and into the body, it must first be split into glucose and galactose. The glucose and galactose are then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine. The enzyme that splits lactose into glucose and galactose is called lactase, and it is located on the surface of the cells lining the small intestine.''Lactose intolerance is caused by reduced or absent activity of lactase that prevents the splitting of lactose (lactase deficiency). Lactase deficiency may occur for one of three reasons, congenital, secondary or developmental.''Lactase deficiency may occur because of a congenital absence (absent from birth) of lactase due to a mutation in the gene that is responsible for producing lactase. This is a very rare cause of lactase deficiency, and the symptoms of this type of lactase deficiency begin shortly after birth.''Another cause of lactase deficiency is secondary lactase deficiency. This type of deficiency is due to diseases that destroy the lining of the small intestine along with the lactase. An example of such a disease is ''celiac disease'' (sprue).''The most common cause of lactase deficiency is a decrease in the amount of lactase that occurs after childhood and persists into adulthood, referred to as adult-type hypolactasia. This decrease in lactase is genetically programmed. Lactase deficiency (and lactose intolerance) is most common among Asians, affecting more than 90% of adults in some communities. People with ancestry from Northern Europe, on the other hand, have a 5% rate of lactase deficiency. In addition to variability in the prevalence of lactase deficiency among ethnic groups, there also is variability in the age at which symptoms of lactase deficiency (and lactose intolerance) appear.''As people age they may develop lactose intolerance; however, the extent of the intolerance appears to be mild and not associated with clinical symptoms.\xa0 Therefore, the development of lactose intolerance in the elderly should not be made lightly.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance?,"'The common primary symptoms of lactose intolerance are gastrointestinal and include:''Less common symptoms of lactose intolerance include:''Constipation'' is not a sign of lactose intolerance.''Unfortunately, these symptoms can be caused by several gastrointestinal conditions or diseases, so the presence of these symptoms is not very good at predicting whether a person has lactase deficiency or lactose intolerance.''Symptoms occur because the unabsorbed lactose passes through the small intestine and into the colon. In the colon, one type of normal bacterium contains lactase and is able to split the lactose and use the resulting glucose and galactose for its own purposes. Unfortunately, when they use the glucose and galactose, these bacteria also release hydrogen gas. Some of the gas is absorbed from the colon and into the body and is then expelled by the ''lungs'' in the breath. Most of the hydrogen, however, is used up in the colon by other bacteria. A small proportion of the hydrogen gas is expelled and is responsible for increased flatulence (passing gas). Some people have an additional type of bacterium in their colons that changes the hydrogen gas into methane gas, and these people will excrete only methane or both hydrogen and methane gas in their breath and flatus.''Not all of the lactose that reaches the colon is split and used by colonic bacteria. The unsplit lactose in the colon draws water into the colon (by osmosis). This leads to loose, diarrheal stools.''The severity of the symptoms of lactose intolerance vary greatly from person to person. One reason for this variability is that people have different amounts of lactose in their ''diet''; the more lactose in the diet, the more likely and severe the symptoms. Another reason for the variability is that people have differing severities of lactase deficiency, that is, they may have mild, moderate, or severe reduction in the amounts of lactase in their ''intestines''. Thus, small amounts of lactose will cause major symptoms in severely lactase deficient people but only mild or no symptoms in mildly lactase deficient people. Finally, people may have different responses to the same amount of lactose reaching the colon. Whereas some may have mild or no symptoms, others may have moderate symptoms. The reason for this is not clear but may relate to differences in their intestinal bacteria.'   abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence (passing gas). abdominal bloating, abdominal distention, and nausea."
What foods have lactose and should be avoided in the diet?,"'Although milk and foods made from milk are the only natural sources of lactose, lactose often is ""hidden"" in prepared foods to which it has been added. People with very low tolerance for lactose should know about the many food products that may contain lactose, even in small amounts. Food products that may contain lactose include:''Smart shoppers learn to read food labels with care, looking not only for milk and lactose in the contents but also for such words as whey, curds, milk by-products, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk powder. If any of these are listed on a label, the item contains lactose.' Bread Baked goods Processed breakfast cereals Instant potatoes, soups, and breakfast drinks Margarine Lunch meats (except those that are kosher) Salad dressings Candies Chips and other processed snacks Mixes for pancakes, biscuits, and cookies Soft cheeses Milk Nondairy whipped 
	toppings Nondairy liquid and powered coffee creamers"
What about lactase in medications or drugs?,"'In addition to food sources, lactose can be ""hidden"" in medicines. Lactose is used as the base for many prescription and ''over-the-counter'' medications. Many types of ''birth control pills'', for example, contain lactose, as do some tablets used for stomach acid and gas. However, these products typically affect only people with severe lactose intolerance because they contain such small amounts of lactose.' "
Is there test for lactose deficiency?,"'Although there are several good ways to diagnose lactose intolerance, most people who consider themselves lactose intolerant have never been formally tested for intolerance; approximately 20% of people who think they are lactose intolerant are not lactose intolerant.''Why do people believe that they are lactose intolerant when they are not? This erroneous belief may be common for several reasons. People with unexplained (undiagnosed) gastrointestinal symptoms are looking for an explanation for their symptoms. Since lactose intolerance is a well-known and common condition, it provides these people with a ready (and welcome) explanation for their symptoms. Confirmation that lactose intolerance is present often is made subjectively and without careful correlation between ingestion of milk or milk products and symptoms. Also, there are placebo responses, that is, people think they are better when they are not.''Formal testing for lactose intolerance is valuable. Not only can testing confirm lactose intolerance and prompt the institution of a reduced or lactose-free diet, but it also can exclude lactose intolerance and direct attention to diagnosing other conditions and diseases that are responsible for the symptoms.' "
Elimination diet,"'Probably the most common way that people self-diagnose lactose intolerance is by an elimination diet, a diet that eliminates milk and milk products. There are several problems with this type of ""testing.""''If an elimination diet is to be used for diagnosing lactose intolerance, it should be a rigorous diet. A rigorous diet requires counseling by a dietician or reading a guide to a lactose-elimination diet. The diet also needs to be continued long enough to clearly evaluate whether or not symptoms are better. If there is doubt about improvement on the diet, particularly if symptoms normally fluctuate in intensity over weeks or months, repeated periods of lactose elimination should be tried until a firm conclusion can be drawn. Elimination of all milk products should eliminate symptoms completely if lactose intolerance alone is the cause of the symptoms.'   Milk products are so common in prepared foods from the supermarket or restaurant that it is likely that an elimination diet that is not rigorous (i.e., does not eliminate all milk-containing products) will still include substantial amounts of milk. Thus, persons with severe lactase deficiency attempting an elimination diet may be ingesting enough lactose to have symptoms and erroneously conclude that lactose intolerance is not responsible for the symptoms. People often make the assumption that they are lactose intolerant based on a short trial of elimination. A short trial may be adequate if symptoms are severe and occurring daily, but not if the symptoms are subtle and/or variable. In the latter case, an elimination diet may need to be continued for several weeks. Because symptoms of lactose intolerance are subjective and variable, there always is the possibility of a ""placebo effect"" in which people think they feel better eliminating milk when, in fact, they are no better."
Milk challenge,"'A milk challenge is a simpler way of diagnosing lactose intolerance than an elimination diet. A person fasts overnight and then drinks a glass of milk in the morning. Nothing further is eaten or drunk for 3-5 hours. If a person is lactose intolerant, the milk should produce symptoms within several hours of ingestion. If there are no symptoms or symptoms are substantially milder than the usual symptoms, it is unlikely that lactose intolerance is the cause of the symptoms. It is important that the milk that is used is fat-free in order to eliminate the possibility that fat in the milk is the cause of symptoms. It is not possible to eliminate the possibility that symptoms are due to milk allergy, a very different condition than lactose intolerance; however, this usually is not confusing since allergy to milk is rare and primarily occurs in infants and young children. (If milk allergy is a consideration, pure lactose can be used instead of milk for the challenge.)''An important issue is the amount of milk required for the milk challenge.''Recognition of this issue is important in interpreting the results of a milk challenge.\xa0Also, it is important to remember that lactose intolerance does not mean that there is a genetic lactase deficiency.' If a person drinks several glasses of milk or ingests large amounts of milk-containing products in their normal diet, then a larger amount of milk should be used in the challenge, 8-16 ounces in an adult, equivalent to one or two large glasses of milk. If the person being tested usually does not drink several glasses of milk or ingest larger quantities of milk-containing products, there may be a problem with using 8-16 ounces of milk for testing. These larger quantities of milk used for testing may cause symptoms, but the smaller amounts of milk or milk products that these persons ingest in their normal diet may not be enough to cause symptoms. Technically, they may be lactose intolerant when they are tested with larger amounts of milk, but lactose in their normal diet cannot be responsible for their usual symptoms."
Breath test,"'The ''hydrogen breath test'' is the most convenient and reliable test for lactose intolerance. For the breath test, pure lactose, usually 25 grams (the equivalent of 16 oz. of milk), is ingested with water after an overnight fast. In persons who are lactose intolerant, the lactose that is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine reaches the colon where the bacteria split the lactose into glucose and galactose and produce hydrogen (and/or methane) gas. Small amounts of the hydrogen and methane are absorbed from the colon into the blood and then travel to the lungs where they are excreted in the breath. Samples of breath are collected every 10 or 15 minutes for 3-5 hours after ingestion of the lactose, and the samples are analyzed for hydrogen and/or methane. If hydrogen and/or methane are found in the breath, it means that the small intestine of the person was unable to digest and absorb all of the lactose. He or she is lactose intolerant. The amount of hydrogen or methane excreted in the breath is roughly proportional to the degree of lactose intolerance (and potential lactase deficiency), that is, the larger the amount of hydrogen and/or methane produced, the greater the intolerance or deficiency. The amount of hydrogen and/or methane in the breath, however, is not proportional to the severity of the symptoms. In other words, a person who produces little hydrogen and/or methane may have more severe symptoms than a person who produces a large amount hydrogen and/or methane.'""The breath test is the best test for determining lactose intolerance and potentially lactase deficiency, but it has several weaknesses. The first is that it is a long, boring test. The second is that it suffers from the same issue as the milk challenge test with respect to the quantity of lactose that should be used. (See previous discussion.) Lastly, the breath test can be falsely abnormal when there is spread of bacteria from the colon into the small intestine, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel. When overgrowth occurs, the bacteria that have moved up into the small intestine get to the lactose in the intestine before there has been enough time for the lactose to be digested and absorbed normally, and these bacteria produce hydrogen and/or methane. This may lead erroneously to a diagnosis of genetic lactase deficiency; the abnormal test is due to an intestinal condition. Other conditions also interfere with the breath test. Thus, diseases that markedly speed up transit of lactose through the small intestine prevent lactose from being fully digested and absorbed, leading to a misdiagnosis of lactose intolerance. Recent treatment with antibiotics can suppress colonic bacteria and their production of hydrogen or methane and lead to a misdiagnosis of lactose tolerance. Fortunately, these latter conditions are uncommon and usually can be anticipated on the basis of a person's history or symptoms."" "
Other tests to diagnose lactose intolerance,"""The appearance and disappearance of lactase in the intestinal lining is controlled by genes.  It is possible to analyze DNA, the substance of genes, from cells in the blood to determine if an individual has the genes that program disappearance of lactase.  If they do, then they are very likely to be lactose intolerant.  Genetic testing is the most direct way of diagnosing congenital or developmental lactase deficiency.  Unfortunately, the test is relatively complex, expensive, and often not easily available.  Moreover, it usually is not necessary to know an individual's lactase genetics to diagnose and treat.""'The most direct test for lactase deficiency is biopsy of the intestinal lining with measurement of lactase levels in the lining. The biopsy can be obtained by ''endoscopy'' or by special capsules that are passed through the mouth or nose and into the small intestine. The analysis of lactase levels in the biopsy requires specialized procedures that are not often available, and, as a result, lactase levels are not often measured except for research purposes.''The blood glucose test is an older test for lactase deficiency and lactose intolerance. For the blood glucose test, lactose is ingested (usually 0.75 to 1.5 gm. of lactose per kg of body weight) after an overnight fast, and serial blood samples are drawn and analyzed for glucose. If the level of blood glucose rises more than 25 mg/100ml, it means that the lactose has been split in the intestine and the resulting glucose has been absorbed into the blood. This implies that lactase levels are normal. Unfortunately, the blood glucose test, though simple in principle, requires the collection of multiple samples of blood. Moreover, the test has many real and potential problems, the most common of which is false positive tests, that is, an abnormal test in people who have normal lactase levels and no lactose intolerance. For these reasons, the blood glucose test is not often used.' "
Is there a test for lactose intolerance in infants and young children?,"'The ''stool'' acidity test is a test for lactase deficiency in infants and young children. For the ''stool'' acidity test, the infant or child is given a small amount of lactose orally. Several consecutive stool samples then are tested for acidity. With a deficiency of lactase, unabsorbed lactose enters the colon and is split into glucose and galactose. Some of the glucose and galactose is broken down by the bacteria into acids, for example, lactic acid. Lactic acid turns the stool acidic. Therefore, a lactase deficient infant or child will develop an acidic stool following the test dose of lactose.''Despite the availability of the stool acidity test, the superiority of breath testing has led to modifications in the equipment for collecting breath samples that makes it easier to do breath testing in young children and even infants. As a result, the stool acidity test is not done frequently.' "
What is the treatment for lactose intolerance?,"'The most obvious means of treating lactose intolerance is by reducing the amount of lactose in the diet. Fortunately, most people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate small or even moderate amounts of lactose. It often takes only elimination of the major milk-containing products to obtain sufficient relief from their symptoms. Thus, it may be necessary to eliminate only milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and ice cream. Though yogurt contains large amounts of lactose, it often is well-tolerated by lactose intolerant people. This may be so because the bacteria used to make yogurt contain lactase, and the lactase is able to split some of the lactose during storage of the yogurt as well as after the yogurt is eaten (in the stomach and intestine). Yogurt also has been shown to empty more slowly from the stomach than an equivalent amount of milk. This allows more time for intestinal lactase to split the lactose in yogurt, and, at least theoretically, would result in less lactose reaching the colon.''Most supermarkets carry milk that has had the lactose already split by the addition of lactase. Substitutes for milk also are available, including ''soy'' and rice milk. Acidophilus-containing milk is not beneficial since it contains as much lactose as regular milk, and acidophilus bacteria do not split lactose.''For individuals who are intolerant to even small amounts of lactose, the dietary restrictions become more severe. Any purchased product containing milk must be avoided. It is especially important to eliminate prepared foods containing milk purchased from the supermarket and dishes from ''restaurants'' that have sauces.''Another means to reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance is to ingest any milk-containing foods during meals. Meals (particularly meals containing fat) reduce the rate at which the stomach empties into the small intestine. This reduces the rate at which lactose enters the small intestine and allows more time for the limited amount of lactase to split the lactose without being overwhelmed by the full load of lactose at once. Studies have shown that the absorption of lactose from whole milk, which contains fat, is greater than from non-fat milk, perhaps for this very reason. Nevertheless, the substitution of whole milk or yogurt for non-fat milk or yogurt does not seem to reduce the symptoms of lactose intolerance.''Caplets or tablets of lactase are available to take with milk-containing foods.''Some people find that by slowly increasing the amount of milk or milk-containing products in their diets they are able to tolerate larger amounts of lactose without developing symptoms. This adaptation to increasing amounts of milk is not due to increases in lactase in the intestine. Adaptation probably results from alterations in the bacteria in the colon. Increasing amounts of lactose entering the colon change the colonic environment, for example, by increasing the acidity of the colon. These changes may alter the way in which the colonic bacteria handle lactose. For example, the bacteria may produce less gas. There also may be a reduction in the secretion of water and, therefore, less ''diarrhea''. Nevertheless, it is not clear how frequently or how much progressive increases in milk intake increase the quantities of milk that can be ingested.''Milk and milk-containing products are the best sources of dietary calcium, so it is no wonder that ''calcium deficiency'' is common among lactose intolerant persons. This increases the risk and severity of ''osteoporosis'' and the resulting bone ''fractures''. It is important, therefore, for lactose intolerant persons to supplement their diets with calcium. A deficiency of ''vitamin D'' also causes disease of the bones and fractures. Milk is fortified with ''vitamin D'' and is a major source of vitamin D for many people. Although other sources of vitamin D can substitute for milk, it is a good idea for lactose-intolerant persons to take supplemental vitamin D to prevent ''vitamin D deficiency''.'  "
Which specialties of doctors treat lactose intolerance?,"'Since internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners all see patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, they all are called upon to diagnose and treat lactose intolerance.  If their attempts to diagnose and treat do not result in adequate clinical benefit, patients usually will be referred to a ''gastroenterologist'', an internist or pediatrician specially trained in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These specialists will be able to diagnose and treat causes of symptoms other than lactose intolerance.' "
What are the long-term consequences of lactose intolerance?,"'The important long-term health consequence of lactose intolerance is calcium deficiency that leads to ''osteoporosis''. Less commonly, vitamin D deficiency may occur and compound the bone disease. Both of these health issues can be prevented easily by calcium and vitamin D ''supplements''. The real problem is that many lactose intolerant people who consciously or unconsciously avoid milk do not realize that they need supplements. ' "
What is new in lactose intolerance?,"'Genetic testing of DNA of individuals to make a diagnosis of lactase deficiency has already been discussed. This is likely to be an important research tool for studying lactase deficiency. It is still too early to know how helpful this sophisticated test will be in the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients. It is an expensive test. The most important question to answer usually is, does lactose cause symptoms, and not, whether an individual is lactase deficient.''In 1998, scientists were able to make lactose intolerant rats tolerant to lactose by transferring the gene for lactase production to their intestinal lining cells. It is unlikely that this type of gene therapy will find much of an application in people. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating example of what science can accomplish.' "
What is the lactose tolerance test?,"'The lactose tolerance test is a test for diagnosing an intolerance of ingested lactose. ''Lactose intolerance'' is a genetic condition in which individuals are unable to digest and absorb the lactose ''sugar'"" in cow's milk. "" "
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the ''sugar'' in milk, lactose. Milk is an important source of ''nutrition'' for children and even some adults. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is broken down (digested) in the intestine by an enzyme into two smaller sugars (galactose and glucose) which then are absorbed into the body. As a result, normally no lactose reaches the colon. ''On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause ''diarrhea'', and also produce ''gas''. ''Abdominal pain'' also may occur. ' "
How is the lactose tolerance test done?,"'The lactose tolerance test requires an individual to drink a liquid that contains lactose. In the small intestine among lactose tolerant individuals, the ingested lactose is split into galactose and glucose which then are absorbed from the intestine and go into the blood. Several blood samples are taken over a two hour period following the ingestion of the lactose to measure the blood glucose level. If lactose tolerance is normal, the glucose level in the blood rises due to the absorption of glucose from the intestine. If there is lactose intolerance, the glucose level does not rise.' "
What other tests can detect lactose intolerance?,"""Many clinicians simply make this diagnosis based on improvement of symptoms when lactose is withheld from the patient's ""'diet'' and affravation when it is re-introduced. Other tests used to detect lactose intolerance include the lactose ''hydrogen breath test'' and ''stool acidity test'', the latter is primarily used in infants and very young children. There also is a genetic test which can determine whether an individual has or does not have the intestinal enzyme that is required for the ''digestion'' and absorption of lactose.' "
What is a stool acidity test?,"'The ''stool'' acidity test is a test for diagnosing intolerance to lactose, the ''sugar'' contained in milk, in infants and very young children.'  "
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance'' is the inability to digest the lactose ''sugar'' in milk. Milk containing the sugar lactose is a main source of ''nutrition'' for infants and young children. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is digested (broken down into two smaller sugars) and absorbed in the small intestine so that none reaches the colon. ''On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause ''diarrhea'' and also produce ''gas''. Some of the chemicals produced by bacteria include lactic and other acids that turn the ''stool'' acidic. '""Individuals with intolerance to lactose cannot drink regular cow's milk without developing ""'diarrhea'', gas, and often ''abdominal pain''. They instead must drink substitutes like rice or ''soy'"" milk or treat cow's milk with an enzyme that digests the lactose (Lactaid) so that the smaller sugars can be absorbed in the small intestine."" "
How does the stool acidity test work?,"'During the stool acidity test, infants and very young children are given lactose to drink. With normal tolerance to lactose, all of the lactose is digested and absorbed in the small intestine. In individuals who are lactose intolerant, some or all of the lactose is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon. Through the action of the colonic bacteria, the stool becomes acidic. The acidity of stools that are passed after ingestion of the lactose then is measured. If the stool becomes acidic, the individual is intolerant of lactose.' "
How does testing for lactose intolerance differ in adults?,"'Lactose intolerance in older children and adults can be detected by using the ''lactose tolerance test'' or the lactose ''hydrogen breath test''. ' The lactose tolerance and lactose hydrogen breath tests are not given to infants and very young children who are suspected of having lactose intolerance because they require cooperation for either multiple samplings of blood or breath, which can be difficult if the infant or child is not cooperative.  The dose of lactose that is needed for the lactose tolerance and hydrogen breath tests also may present problems for infants and very young children since if they are intolerant of lactose, they may develop diarrhea and become dehydrated.  Nevertheless, special masks have been developed for infants and very young children that can make the sampling of breath for the lactose hydrogen breath test easier to perform."
Childbirth class options introduction,"'Many women and couples desire to take part in formal classes as part of their birthing plan.

What is Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is a childhood disorder. A major feature of LKS is the gradual or sudden loss of the ability to understand and use spoken language. All children with LKS have abnormal electrical brain waves that can be documented by an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), a recording of the electric activity of the brain. Approximately 80 percent of the children with LKS have one or more epileptic ''seizures'' that usually occur at night. Behavioral disorders such as ''hyperactivity'', aggressiveness and ''depression'' can also accompany this disorder. LKS may also be called infantile acquired ''aphasia'', acquired epileptic ''aphasia'' or aphasia with convulsive disorder. This syndrome was first described in 1957 by Dr. William M. Landau and Dr. Frank R. Kleffner, who identified six children with the disorder. ' "
What are the signs of Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'LKS occurs most frequently in normally developing children who are between 3 and 7 years of age. For no apparent reason, these children begin having trouble understanding what is said to them. Doctors often refer to this problem as auditory agnosiaor ""word deafness."" The auditory agnosia may occur slowly or very quickly. Parents often think that the child is developing a ''hearing'' problem or has become suddenly deaf. Hearing tests, however, show normal hearing. Children may also appear to be autistic or developmentally delayed. '""The inability to understand language eventually affects the child's spoken language which may progress to a complete loss of the ability to speak (""'mutism''). Children who have learned to read and write before the onset of auditory agnosia can often continue communicating through written language. Some children develop a type of gestural communication or sign-like language. The communication problems may lead to behavioral or psychological problems. Intelligence usually appears to be unaffected. ''The loss of language may be preceded by an epileptic ''seizure'' that usually occurs at night. At some time, 80 percent of children with LKS have one or more ''seizures''. The seizures usually stop by the time the child becomes a teenager. All LKS children have abnormal electrical brain activity on both the right and left sides of their brains. '  "
How common is Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,'More than 160 cases have been reported from 1957 through 1990. ' 
What causes Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'The cause of LKS is unknown. Some experts think there is more than one cause for this disorder. All of the children with LKS appear to be perfectly normal until their first ''seizure'' or the start of language problems. There have been no reports of children who have a family history of LKS. Therefore, LKS is not likely to be an ''inherited'' disorder. ' "
What is the outcome of Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'There have not been many long-term follow-up studies of children with LKS. This lack of evidence, along with the wide range of differences among affected children, makes it impossible to predict the outcome of this disorder. Complete language recovery has been reported; however, language problems usually continue into adulthood. The continued language problems can range from difficulty following simple commands to no verbal communication. If recovery takes place, it can occur within days or years. So far, no relationship has been found between the extent of the language impairment, the presence or absence of seizures and the amount of language recovery. Generally, the earlier the disorder begins, the poorer the language recovery. ''Most children outgrow the seizures, and electrical brain activity on the EEG usually returns to normal by age 15. '  "
What treatments are available?,'Medication to control the seizures and abnormal brain wave activity (anticonvulsants) usually has very little effect on language ability. ''Corticosteroid'' therapy has improved the language ability of some children. ''Sign language'' instruction has benefited others. '

All children with LKS have abnormal electrical brain waves that can be documented by an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), a recording of the electric activity of the brain. Approximately 80 percent of the children with LKS have one or more epileptic ''seizures'' that usually occur at night. Behavioral disorders such as ''hyperactivity'', aggressiveness and ''depression'' can also accompany this disorder. LKS may also be called infantile acquired ''aphasia'', acquired epileptic ''aphasia'' or aphasia with convulsive disorder. This syndrome was first described in 1957 by Dr. William M. Landau and Dr. Frank R. Kleffner, who identified six children with the disorder. ' "
What are the signs of Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'LKS occurs most frequently in normally developing children who are between 3 and 7 years of age. For no apparent reason, these children begin having trouble understanding what is said to them. Doctors often refer to this problem as auditory agnosiaor ""word deafness."" The auditory agnosia may occur slowly or very quickly. Parents often think that the child is developing a ''hearing'' problem or has become suddenly deaf. Hearing tests, however, show normal hearing. Children may also appear to be autistic or developmentally delayed. '""The inability to understand language eventually affects the child's spoken language which may progress to a complete loss of the ability to speak (""'mutism''). Children who have learned to read and write before the onset of auditory agnosia can often continue communicating through written language. Some children develop a type of gestural communication or sign-like language. The communication problems may lead to behavioral or psychological problems. Intelligence usually appears to be unaffected. ''The loss of language may be preceded by an epileptic ''seizure'' that usually occurs at night. At some time, 80 percent of children with LKS have one or more ''seizures''. The seizures usually stop by the time the child becomes a teenager. All LKS children have abnormal electrical brain activity on both the right and left sides of their brains. '  "
How common is Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,'More than 160 cases have been reported from 1957 through 1990. ' 
What causes Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'The cause of LKS is unknown. Some experts think there is more than one cause for this disorder. All of the children with LKS appear to be perfectly normal until their first ''seizure'' or the start of language problems. There have been no reports of children who have a family history of LKS. Therefore, LKS is not likely to be an ''inherited'' disorder. ' "
What is the outcome of Landau-Kleffner syndrome?,"'There have not been many long-term follow-up studies of children with LKS. This lack of evidence, along with the wide range of differences among affected children, makes it impossible to predict the outcome of this disorder. Complete language recovery has been reported; however, language problems usually continue into adulthood. The continued language problems can range from difficulty following simple commands to no verbal communication. If recovery takes place, it can occur within days or years. So far, no relationship has been found between the extent of the language impairment, the presence or absence of seizures and the amount of language recovery. Generally, the earlier the disorder begins, the poorer the language recovery. ''Most children outgrow the seizures, and electrical brain activity on the EEG usually returns to normal by age 15. '  "
What treatments are available?,'Medication to control the seizures and abnormal brain wave activity (anticonvulsants) usually has very little effect on language ability. ''Corticosteroid'' therapy has improved the language ability of some children. ''Sign language'' instruction has benefited others. '

Lap band (gastric banding) introduction,"'Obesity'' is a growing concern. By medical standards, ''obesity'' is defined as having a ''body mass index'' (''BMI'') of over 30 kg/m2. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for treatment, surgical options are becoming more popular. One of the surgical treatments for obesity is called gastric banding, commonly known as lap-band surgery. Some of the specifics of gastric banding will be addressed in this article.' "
What is gastric banding?,"'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of an adjustable belt around the upper portion of the stomach using a laparascope. The band is made of silicone and can be tightened by adding saline to fill the band (like blowing air into a doughnut-shaped balloon). The band is connected to a port that is placed under the skin of the abdomen. This port is used to introduce or remove saline into the band.''LAGB ultimately restricts the size of the stomach and the amount of food it can hold. It also slows the passage of food to the intestine. By doing so, signals to the brain from the gut allow for a sensation of fullness and satiety with the consumption of less food. This signal is sent from a small pouch created by the band in the upper stomach. When the pouch fills, the same signal is sent to the brain that occurred previously when the entire stomach filled.' "
What is a lap band?,"'The LAP BAND® is a specific device brand name and is made by Allergan Inc. The term is often used in the lay community interchangeable with gastric banding (similar to the way we interchange the brand name Kleenex for facial tissue). There are different sizes and models of the LAP BAND. There are also other companies that make gastric banding devices such as the REALIZE® adjustable gastric band (by Ethicon), the MIDBAND®, and the Heliogast® gastric band (which are not available in the US).' "
Who are candidates for the lap band system?,"'Generally, candidates for LAGB have a body mass index over 40 kg/m2, or are more than 45 kilograms over their ideal body weight. LAGB can be performed on a person with a ''BMI'' of 35-40 kg/m2 if there are problematic medical conditions that are weight-related, such as ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') or ''diabetes''.''Most surgeons and programs will want to note a history of failed ''weight loss'' in the past using more conventional approaches. The procedure is indicated for adults only, and is not to be performed on those less than 18 years old. All patients must demonstrate an understanding of the procedure, and be willing to adhere to the lifestyle changes that are needed to make this procedure successful. Most large centers have a psychological assessment to assure that this last criteria is met.''LAGB is usually contraindicated if the potential patient has difficulty understanding the procedure, is emotionally unstable, or is dependent on ''drugs'' or ''alcohol''. Those potential cases with a history of gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers need to be reviewed carefully. Similarly, those that have underlying medical conditions that make them high risk for surgery- such as ''heart'' or lung conditions- may be refused the procedure. Associated with these risks is a BMI of greater than 50kg/m2. In this group, there may be a request to ''lose weight'' prior to the procedure (although this seems paradoxical). Again, the risks of the procedure in this subgroup of ''obese'' patients may outweigh the benefits of surgery. By dropping the BMI under 50 kg.m2, outcomes may be better.''While there is growing discussion about offering LAGB to those with a BMI of 30-35 who have ''diabetes'', there are no current guidelines for this.' "
How is the lap band (LAGB) procedure performed?,"'Lap band or LAGB is a surgical procedure done under full general anesthesia and takes about 1 to 2 hours to perform. It is done using a laparoscopic technique. This involves making 3 to 5 small incisions, each about 1 inch in length. The surgeon inserts a small camera attached to a tube into one of these incisions and views the procedure on a screen. The other incisions allow for the use of surgical instruments and placement of the band. The gastric band is placed around the upper part of the stomach and set into position with ''sutures''. The port is then placed in the wall of the abdomen and sutured in place.' "
How do I prepare for lap band surgery?,"'Depending on the surgeon or the program, the preparation for surgery will vary. Many centers like to see a commitment from the patient to the necessary lifestyle changes even before surgery. It may be suggested that the patient start eating 5 to 6 small meals a day to prepare for the changes ahead. It may be recommended to wean off ""slippery"" high calorie foods such as ice cream or milk shakes (since these will continue to be easily absorbed after the procedure).''If the BMI is greater than 50, or if there are other medical issues, medical risk reduction may be needed preoperatively and should be discussed in detail. In addition, a ''weight loss'' of 5% to 10% prior to surgery has been shown to improved post operative outcomes, and may be a goal that your surgeon or preoperative care team will discuss with you.' "
How long is the recovery after lap band surgery?,"'Recovery varies with each individual. However, in general, LAGB offers a shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery than gastric bypass procedures. In general, most people can return to work 1 week after surgery (if their job is not too physically demanding). Normal activity can usually resume after 6 weeks.' "
What is a lap band fill?,"'A lap band ""fill"" is the common term for gastric band adjustments. Once surgery is performed, there is a period of healing that must take place before the first adjustment. Usually, the first fill takes place around 6 to 8 weeks. It involves injecting saline into the port just under the skin which is connected to the band. Prior to this, there may be little change in appetite. Fills are painless and are usually performed by the surgeon who performed the procedure. These adjustments may take place to enhance ''weight loss'', especially if there is a plateau phase in ''weight loss'', and they may to performed to overcome side effects such as ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (in this latter case, the band is loosened).' "
What can I expect my lifestyle to be after lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Immediately after surgery, there will be some ''pain'' and discomfort that can be controlled with medications. This is part of the normal recovery phase after any surgical procedure. After 6 to 8 weeks, one can generally return to normal activities. ''Weight loss'' with LAGB is a gradual process. Initially, the ''weight loss'' may be more dramatic- say 2 to 3 pounds per week. However, this generally slows to a pound or so weekly over the long-term. Naturally, the food choices made will govern this weight loss rate. After about 18 months, the weight loss tends to slow significantly. The average weight loss for this procedure is 40% of excess body weight in the first year, with an additional 10% to 20% in the second year. Patients are usually asked to keep in contact with their surgeon regularly during this time period as further band adjustments may be needed. ' "
What are the side effects of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Side effects include ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ulceration at the band site, ''esophageal reflux'' (''indigestion''), weight regain, and ''dehydration''. Since this type of surgery is restrictive and does not cause malabsorption of nutrients, vitamin deficiencies are not usually seen. However, many centers recommend multivitamin supplementation. ''Constipation'' is commonly encountered.' "
What are the risks and complications of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'LAGB has a low risk of surgical complications compared to other weight reduction procedures. The mortality (death) rate is about 1 in 2000. There is the possibility of the band slipping or eroding into the stomach and of mechanical malfunction. Other complications may include infection, bleeding, and/or ''abdominal pain''. ' "
What type of surgeon performs lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'When choosing a surgeon, it is important to search for one who is a qualified bariatric surgeon. In general, practice makes perfect, and the more surgeries performed the better. A surgeon performing 100 or more procedures annually is likely going to have better outcomes. A surgeon who is part of a clinical team of nutritionists, nurses, psychologists, and physicians in general can provide better counseling and support in the pre- and postoperative period. ' "
What is a Liver Biopsy?,"'A ''liver'' biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This is performed as an office or outpatient procedure or during surgery. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of:' Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes). Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice). A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan. Unexplained enlargement of the liver."
Is Liver Biopsy Safe?,"'In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely ''internal bleeding'' may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder.' "
How Do I Prepare for a Liver Biopsy?,"'When preparing for a liver biopsy, there are several things to keep in mind.''Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor.' Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin, Plavix, or Persantine. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor."
What Happens on the Day of a Liver Biopsy?,"'Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a ''platelet count'"", and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot.""'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications and answer any questions you may have. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor cleans and numbs an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor then makes a small incision on your upper abdomen and inserts a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. The procedure takes about 5 minutes. You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may takeacetaminophen (Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity for at least 24 hours after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure."
What other methods of liver biopsy are available?,"'Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous.''During a laparoscopic biopsy'', a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the physician watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver.'' A transvenous biopsy'' may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample.' "
Warning About Liver Biopsy,"'If you have a ''fever''; difficulty ''breathing''; ''chills''; ''dizziness''; or tenderness or severe pain at the site of a liver biopsy or in the chest, shoulder, or abdomen within 72 hours after the procedure, please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.' "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A ''hysterectomy'' is the removal of the uterus (womb). For certain conditions, the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. ''The most common medical reasons for doing a hysterectomy include benign ''fibroid'' tumors of the uterus, abnormal uterine bleeding, ''endometriosis'', genital prolapse, and chronic ''pelvic pain''. Some women choose to have a hysterectomy for other reasons, including other types of tumors. ''Uterine cancer'' is an uncommon, but important reason for doing a hysterectomy.' "
What is a laparoscope?,"'A laparoscope is a viewing tube through which structures within the abdomen and pelvis can be seen. A small surgical incision (cut) is made in the abdominal wall to permit the laparoscope to enter the abdomen or pelvis. Additional tubes can also be pushed through the same or other small incisions allowing the introduction of probes and other instruments. In this way, surgical procedures can be performed without the need for a large surgical incision.' "
What is laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH)?,"'Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a surgical procedure using a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina (birth canal). (A different procedure, called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, is entirely performed using a laparoscope and other instruments inserted through tiny abdominal incisions, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes etc. are removed in tiny portions.) ''Not all hysterectomies can or should be done by LAVH. In certain situations, a laparoscopic hysterectomy (see above) may be sufficient. In other cases, an abdominal hysterectomy or a vaginal hysterectomy (without ''laparoscopy'') is indicated. The surgeon determines the appropriate procedure for each individual case based upon the reason for the hysterectomy and the medical history and condition of the patient.' "
How do doctors perform an LAVH?,"'During LAVH, several small incisions (''cuts'') are made in the abdominal wall through which slender metal tubes known as ""trocars"" are inserted to provide passage for a laparoscope and other microsurgical tools. The laparoscope acts as a tiny telescope. A camera attached to it provides a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen for viewing.''In the course of LAVH, the uterus is detached from the ligaments that attach it to other structures in the pelvis using the laparoscopic tools. If the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are to be removed, they are also detached from their ligaments and blood supply. The organs and tissue are then removed through an incision made in the vagina.' "
What are the disadvantages of LAVH?,"'LAVH can be a longer operation and more expensive than a vaginal hysterectomy and, under certain circumstances, it can be more dangerous.' "
What are the advantages of LAVH?,"'The incisions in an LAVH are relatively small. The ''scars'', ''pain'', and recovery time from LAVH are usually significantly less than with an abdominal hysterectomy, which requires both a vaginal incision and a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) long incision in the abdomen). LAVH is similarly less physically traumatic than a routine vaginal hysterectomy. When LAVH is feasible, it has distinct advantages. It can allow for a vaginal hysterectomy in patients who have not had children.' "
Conditions laparoscopic surgery (laparoscopy) treats,"'Laparoscopy can be used to treat the following conditions' Crohn's disease unresponsive to medical therapy or causing a blockage Colorectal cancer  Diverticulitis with recurrent attacks or failure of medical therapy Familial polyposis, a condition causing multiple colon polyps that puts you at higher risk of  colorectal cancer, 
which then requires total colonectomy (removal of the colon) Bowel incontinence Rectal prolapse Ulcerative colitis unresponsive to medical treatment Colon polyps that are too large to remove by colonoscopy Chronic severe constipation that is not successfully treated with medication 
may require shortening the length of the colon by removing a part of the colon 
using surgery."
How is the laparoscopy procedure performed?,"'Three or more small (5-10 mm) incisions are made in the abdomen to allow access ports to be inserted. The laparoscope and surgical instruments are inserted through these ports. The surgeon then uses the laparoscope, which transmits a picture of the abdominal organs on a video monitor, allowing the operation to be performed.''Laparoscopic intestinal surgery can be used to perform the following operations:' Proctosigmoidectomy. Surgical removal of a diseased section of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Used to treat cancers and noncancerous growths or polyps, and complications of diverticulitis. Right colectomy or Ileocolectomy. During a right colectomy, the right side of the colon is removed. During an ileocolectomy, the last segment of the small intestine - which is attached to the right side of the colon, called the ileum, is also removed. Used to remove cancers, noncancerous growths or polyps, and inflammation from Crohn's disease.  Total abdominal colectomy. Surgical removal of the large intestine. Used to treat ulcerative 
 colitis, Crohn's disease, familial polyposis and possibly constipation.  Fecal diversion. Surgical creation of either a temporary or permanent ileostomy (opening between the surface of the skin and the small intestine) or (colostomy (opening between the surface of the skin and the colon). Used to treat complex rectal and anal problems, including poor bowel control.  Abdominoperineal resection. Surgical removal of the anus, rectum and sigmoid colon. Used to remove cancer in the lower rectum or in the anus, close to the sphincter (control) muscles.  Rectopexy. A procedure in which stitches are used to secure the rectum in its proper position. Used to correct rectal prolapse.  Total proctocolectomy. This is the most extensive bowel operation performed and involves the removal of both the rectum and the colon. If the surgeon is able to leave the anus and it works properly, then sometimes an ileal pouch can be created so that you can go to the bathroom. An ileal pouch is a surgically created chamber made up of the lowest part of the small intestine (the ileum). However, sometimes, a permanent ileostomy (opening between the surface of the skin and the small intestine) is needed particularly if the anus must be removed, is weak, or has been damaged. "
How do I prepare for laparoscopy?,"'Your surgeon will meet with you to answer any questions you may have. You will be asked questions about your health history and a general physical examination will be performed. Your intestine will require cleaning and you will be given a prescription for a ''laxative'' medicine to take the evening before the surgery.''All patients are generally asked to provide a blood sample. Depending on your age and general health, you may also have an ''ECG'' (''electrocardiogram''), a ''chest X-ray'', lung function tests, or other tests. You may also need to meet with another doctor before surgery.''Finally, you will meet with an anesthesiologist, who will discuss the type of ''pain'' medication (anesthesia) you will be given for surgery, and you will learn about pain control after the operation.''The evening before surgery you will need to take the prescribed laxative medicine. It is important to follow the directions carefully and drink all of this medicine. This step will decrease your risk of developing an infection from bacteria normally present in the intestine.''Do not eat or drink anything by mouth after midnight the evening before surgery.' "
What happens the day of the laparoscopic surgery?,"'An intravenous (IV) tube will be inserted into a vein in your arm to deliver medications and fluids. You will be taken to the operating room when it is available and ready.''When you arrive in the operating room, the nurses will help you onto the operating table. The anesthesiologist will inject medicine into your IV that will put you to ''sleep''. After you are asleep, the nurses will clean your abdomen with antibacterial soap and cover you with sterile drapes.''Your surgeon will place a small port just below your bellybutton and advance the port into your abdominal ''cavity''. This port is connected to sterile tubing and carbon dioxide is passed into the abdominal ''cavity'' through the tubing. The ''gas'' lifts the wall of your abdomen away from the organs below. This space will give your surgeon a better view of your abdominal cavity once the laparoscope is in place. The laparoscope is placed through the port and is connected to a video camera. The image your surgeon sees on the laparoscope is projected onto video monitors placed near the operating table.''Before starting the surgery, your surgeon will take a thorough look at your abdominal cavity to make sure that laparoscopy will be safe for you. Some reasons why laparoscopy may not be done include multiple adhesions (''scar tissue'' from previous surgery), infection or other abdominal diseases.''If your surgeon decides that laparoscopic surgery can be safely performed, additional small puncture incisions will be made, which will give your surgeon access to the abdominal cavity. The number and location of the incisions depend on the type of operation you are having.''If needed, one of these small incisions may be enlarged to enable your surgeon to remove the diseased section of intestine, or to create an anastomosis (connection) between two ends of your intestine.''If necessary, your surgeon will begin the removal of part of the intestine by closing the larger blood vessels serving the diseased section of the small or large intestine. Next, he or she will separate the fatty tissue that holds the intestine in place. Once the diseased section of intestine is freed from its supporting structures, it can be removed.''The procedure occasionally requires the creation of a temporary or permanent ''stoma'', an opening of part of the intestine to the outside surface of the abdomen. The stoma acts as an artificial passageway through which ''stool'' (feces) can pass from the intestine to outside the body where it collects in an external pouch, which is attached to the stoma and must be worn at all times.''Most of the time, the surgeon will reconnect the two ends of intestines. The intestine can be rejoined in a number of ways. One method uses a stapling device that positions staples to join the ends of the intestine. Or, the surgeon may pull the intestinal ends up through one of the small incisions and stitch (suture) the ends together. Your surgeon will choose the best method at the time of your surgery. Finally, your surgeon will check that there is no bleeding, rinse out the abdominal cavity, release the gas from the abdomen, and close the small incisions.''When you wake up from the operation, you will be in a recovery room. You will have an oxygen mask covering your nose and mouth. This mask delivers a cool mist of oxygen that helps eliminate the remaining anesthesia from your system and soothes your throat. Your throat may be sore from the ''breathing tube'' that provided you with air and anesthetic gases during the operation, but this soreness usually subsides after a day or two.''Once you are more alert, the nurse may switch your oxygen delivery device to a nasal cannula, small ''plastic'' tubing that hooks over your ears and lies beneath your nose. Depending on the percentage of oxygen measured in your blood, you may need to keep the oxygen in place for a while. The nurse will check the amount of oxygen in your blood (oxygen saturation) by placing a soft clip on one of your fingers (pulse ''oximetry'').''Pain medication will be given as you recover.''After your operation, the nurses will begin to document all the fluids that you drink and measure and collect any urine or fluids you produce, including those from tubes or drains placed during the operation.''The tube that was passed from a nostril into your stomach (a nasogastric tube) during surgery will be removed in the recovery room, if it has not been removed already. You may begin to drink liquids the evening of the operation and will resume a solid ''diet'"" the next morning. If you become nauseated or begin to vomit, your nasogastric tube may be reinserted. If this happens, don't be alarmed. ""'Nausea'' and ''vomiting'' happen in approximately 5% or 10% of people and occur because your intestines are temporarily disabled from the operation. In addition, anesthesia makes many people nauseous. For this reason, food and drink are given slowly for the first few days.''You will be encouraged to get out of bed and walk, starting the first day after the operation. The more you move the less chance for complications such as ''pneumonia'' or the formation of ''blood clots'' in your leg veins. The quicker you pass gas or move your bowels, the quicker you may return home.''The length of your hospital stay will depend on the type of procedure you have and how quickly you recover. For example, the average hospital stay for a laparoscopic rectopexy ranges from 1 to 2 days and for a laparoscopic bowel resection, 1 to 3 days.' "
Your recovery at home after laparoscopy,"'You will be encouraged to steadily increase your activity once you are home. ''Walking'' is great ''exercise''! Walking will help your general recovery by strengthening your muscles, keeping your blood circulating to prevent blood clots, and helping your ''lungs'' stay clear. Avoid ''constipation'' by using ''stool'' softeners, as pain medications usually can cause constipation.''Reviewed by  The Cleveland Clinic Department of ''Colorectal'' Surgery and Thomas E.

What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What is laryngitis?,"'The definition of ''laryngitis'' is an inflammation of the larynx (the voice box that contains the vocal cords). In ''laryngitis'' the vocal cords that are responsible for sounds made by the voice become inflamed and possibly swollen, which results in a voice change that may sound hoarse, raspy, or low volume; so that others can hardly hear what you say. Laryngitis may be acute or chronic, although most cases are acute and not serious. There are both infectious and noninfectious causes of laryngitis.' "
Is laryngitis contagious?,"'The most common cause of laryngitis is a viral infection that lasts about one to two weeks. Other common causes of laryngitis are overuse of the larynx (singing, shouting, for example) or exposure to an irritant. However, other more serious conditions (for example, ''cancer'' of the throat'') may infrequently cause laryngitis.''The ''viruses'' that cause laryngitis are not very ''contagious''. Most researchers suggest that the most contagious time frame for laryngitis is when the infected person has a ''fever''. Less frequent causes of laryngitis that are potentially contagious are bacterial, and rarely, fungal infection.''Other causes of laryngitis that are not contagious are'   mechanical overuse of the larynx (for example, strenuous singing or talking), chemical irritants (pollutants), or other underlying medical problems (throat cancer, for example) that cause laryngitis are not considered to be contagious."
How will I know I have laryngitis?,"'Besides ''hoarseness'', other symptoms of laryngitis are voice changes such as a weak voice or ''loss of voice''. Other symptoms of laryngitis include'""A doctor can diagnose laryngitis by the patient's history and physical exam. Chronic, severe or recurrent laryngitis may require that the larynx be visualized by a specialist who will likely use an endoscope to visualize the vocal cords. Infrequently, a biopsy of laryngeal tissue may be done.""   a raw or irritated feeling in your throat, sore throat, throat seems to be dry, a tickling sensation in the throat, or dry cough."
How is laryngitis spread?,"'Contagious causes of laryngitis (mainly viruses, but potentially, bacteria and fungi) are usually spread from person to person; however, the spread or transfer of the bacteria, viruses, or fungi that cause laryngitis is not particularly effective. If laryngitis is contagious, ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', and saliva are the likely ways it is spread to others.' "
When will I know I'm cured of laryngitis?,"'Usually, a person with laryngitis (acute or chronic) is cured when their voice returns to normal. This usually occurs within two weeks in people with acute laryngitis. Chronic laryngitis may take much longer time for the voice to return to normal. If the vocal cords have been seriously damaged, the voice may never return to normal.'  "
When should I contact a health care professional about laryngitis?,"'Laryngitis caused mainly by viruses, vocal overuse or strain, usually goes away without the need to contact a health care professional. However, you should seek medical attention if you have any of the following:''Chronic laryngitis may indicate other underlying causes of laryngitis (extreme overuse, or ''cancer'', for example) and anyone with chronic laryngitis should see a health care professional.' coughing up blood constant fever increasing pain in the throat trouble swallowing trouble breathing high-pitched breathing sounds (stridor) drooling"
What is laryngitis (laryngeal inflammation)?,"'Laryngitis is inflammation of the vocal cords located in the larynx or voice box. The larynx is the voice box that allows us to speak, shout, whisper, and sing. The larynx consists of a cartilage skeleton that houses the vocal cords, which are covered by a ''mucus'' lining. Muscles inside the larynx adjust the position, shape, and tension of the vocal cords, allowing the voice to make different sounds like whispering, singing, and shouting. Any change in the airflow (which is generated by the ''lungs'' exhaling air) across the vocal cords will affect the voice and the quality of the sound.''The larynx is located at the junction of the mouth and trachea (where air enters the e lungs). There is a flap-like covering called the ''epiglottis'', whose job it is to prevent food and saliva from entering the larynx during swallowing.''Laryngitis is an inflammation of the voice box and vocal cords, causing a person to lose their voice and become hoarse. The quality of the voice becomes gravelly-sounding and sometimes too quiet or soft to hear. Because there is inflammation, throat pain is often an associated symptom.' "
What causes laryngitis?,"'There are a number of different causes of acute and chronic laryngitis.''Laryngitis is considered chronic when symptoms last than three weeks, and it may be caused by:''Not all individuals who have lost their voice have an infection. Not all hoarseness is due to a primary inflammation of the vocal cords.''Diphtheria'' and ''pertussis'' may cause laryngitis-like symptoms, but because most people in the United States have been immunized, these are very uncommon causes. However, with primary immunization decreasing, and people failing to keep their immunizations up to date, there have been a few sporadic outbreaks reported.' Acute laryngitis is most commonly caused by a viral infection that inflames the vocal cords. It also may be caused by voice overuse with excess talking, singing, or shouting. Prolonged alcohol use Smoking Constant exposure to secondhand smoke Exposure to polluted air Excess coughing Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may cause reflux laryngitis and chronic cough. Sometimes people are aware of the presence of the acid and experience waterbrash, a sour taste in their mouth. Repeat spills of acid onto the vocal cords will cause a chemical irritation and result in inflammation and swelling of the cords that hinders appropriate vibration and generation of sound. This reflux may cause a persistent cough. Chronic irritation of the vocal cords also may cause polyps or nodules to form on the vocal cords, which may affect the ability of the vocal cords to vibrate causing chronic hoarseness. Repetitive use of inhalers. Stroke may cause vocal cord muscle paralysis and lead to a weak, hoarse voice, and swallowing problems. Damage to the muscles or to the nerves that control them may lead to hoarseness. These nerves may be damaged if there has been trauma to the neck or if surgery has been performed and the nerves inadvertently irritated or severed. Tumors in the neck and chest may compress the nerves and cause them to function poorly. Thyroid inflammation and enlargement can also cause irritation of nerves that supply the vocal cord muscles."
What are the signs and symptoms of laryngitis?," Hoarseness, loss of voice, and throat pain are the primary symptoms of laryngitis in an adult. In infants and young children, laryngitis often occurs along with inflammation of the trachea and bronchial tubes. This is known as croup. Because these structures have yet to fully develop, the inflammation may make it harder for air to pass through the upper airways, leading to the classic ""seal-like"" barky cough called stridor that is associated with croup."
Symptoms of laryngitis in adults,"'If the cause of laryngitis is infectious'', affected individuals will have symptoms of a viral infection:' Upper respiratory tract infection or cold Dry cough Sore throat Fever Swollen lymph nodes (lymph glands) in the neck Pain with swallowing A feeling of fullness in the throat or neck Runny nose Loss of voice"
Symptoms of laryngitis in infants and children,"'In infants and children with croup, ''breathing'' becomes more difficult. As the child tries to inhale through a swollen and narrow larynx, the cartilage may collapse, just like when attempting to breathe through a straw. As we age, the cartilage becomes stiffer and is able to withstand deeply indrawn breaths, but in children, the cartilage is weaker and with each inspiration, the child may need to work hard to inhale. The maturing of laryngeal cartilage and widening of airways usually occurs by age 6 or 7.''In infants and children with croup, breathing may become more difficult. As the child inhales through a swollen and narrow larynx, the tissues surrounding the upper ''airway'' may collapse, just like when attempting to breathe through a straw. This leads to the classic ""seal-like"" barky cough associated with croup.''Coup is a viral infection of the upper airways. Symptoms may include:''When the cause of laryngitis is not infectious'', cough may be a significant symptom along with the hoarseness. There also can be a fullness felt in the throat. The patient also may complain of ''difficulty swallowing'' and have ''shortness of breath''. Rarely, the patient can cough up blood-tinged saliva if the inflammation causes minor bleeding.'   Croup A hoarse barky cough Fever some measure of respiratory distress where the infant or child works harder to breathe to draw air in through the inflamed voice box area Symptoms that are more severe at night"
Is laryngitis contagious?,"'Laryngitis is only contagious if it is caused by an infection. Laryngitis, upper respiratory infections, and colds are commonly a contagious viral infection spread by aerosol droplets.''Disease transmission can be minimized or prevented by covering the nose and mouth when coughing and ''sneezing'"", and proper hygiene habits (wash your hands often, don't share food utensils, and wipe down door handles)."" "
How does laryngitis last?,"'Laryngitis is self-limiting and should last for only a few days, and symptoms should resolve within 7 days, but can linger up to two weeks. If symptoms persist longer than three weeks, this is considered chronic laryngitis and causes other than a viral infection need to be explored. Croup is often described as a disease of the nighttime because visits to the emergency department peak after midnight with sick infants and children.' "
How is laryngitis diagnosed?,"""The health-care professional often can make the diagnosis of laryngitis in the doctor's office with little testing required. The history of ""'upper respiratory tract infection'' associated with loss of voice is reinforced by the patient answering questions in a hoarse voice. The examination is often brief and limited to the ears, nose, and throat, looking for other potential causes of the ''cold-like symptoms''. If the throat is red and there is a concern about a ''streptococcal throat infection'' (''strep throat'') a throat swab for a ''rapid strep test'' may be ordered.''If the hoarse voice becomes chronic, the health care professional may want to take a more detailed history, trying to learn why the larynx has remained inflamed for such a long time.''The following questions may be asked:''Most cases of laryngitis need no testing to confirm the diagnosis. In those patients with chronic laryngitis, the necessity for blood tests, ''X-rays'' and other diagnostic tests will depend upon the patient presentation and the potential concerns that the health care professional has regarding the cause of the hoarseness.''Laryngoscopy is the most common test performed to look directly at the vocal cords and evaluate their function. This procedure uses a thin tube containing a lighted ''fiber'' optic camera that is inserted through the nose into the back of the throat. The health care practitioner performing the procedure can see whether the vocal cords are inflamed, if there are any polyps or nodules growing on them, and if the vocal cords move appropriately with breathing and speaking. This test is often performed by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist), but many other physicians and specialists are trained to perform direct laryngoscopy. Indirect laryngoscopy may be attempted using a mirror placed in the back of the throat to visualize the vocal cords.' Diet, use of alcohol, aspirin, ibuprofen, and smoking, all of which may cause gastroesophageal reflux disease. Alcohol and smoking can irritate the vocal cords. Work and hobbies may reveal evidence of repeated chemical inhalation and exposure to air pollution. Repeated use of asthma inhalers may cause chronic inflammation of the vocal cords. Any signs or symptoms that suggest the potential of thyroid disease, stroke, or cancers of the head and neck will be explored."
What kinds of doctors treat laryngitis?,"'Laryngitis most is often first evaluated by a primary care provider including internists, pediatricians, and family medicine specialists. Since most often the illness is self-limited, no further treatment is usually required. When laryngitis persists, otolaryngologists (ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist), gastroenterologists, or emergency department doctors may be consulted.' "
What is the treatment for laryngitis?,"'As with any other structure in the body that becomes inflamed, rest is the key to recovery. For laryngitis, this means resting the voice and limiting the amount of talking. If talking is required, the person should speak in a regular voice and avoid whispering, regardless of how it sounds. Whispering requires the vocal cords to be stretched tightly and requires more work by the surrounding muscles, and this delays recovery time.''Patience is required to allow time for the vocal cords to rest and recover.''The treatment of chronic laryngitis will be determined by the cause of the inflammation or loss of function; however, avoiding alcohol and not smoking will help relieve symptoms in the meantime.' The treatment for viral laryngitis is supportive and the person should:Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluidsBreathe humidified airTake acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Aleve, and others) for pain control Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids Breathe humidified air Take acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Aleve, and others) for pain control Dexamethasone as a single dose given orally (Decadron, DexPak) or by intramuscular injection (Adrenocot, CPC-Cort-D, Decadron Phosphate, Decaject-10, Solurex) may be used to treat croup."
Are there any home remedies to soothe and cure laryngitis?,"'It is reasonable not to seek medical care for most cases of laryngitis. Home treatment begins with resting the voice and keeping well hydrated. Symptoms may be controlled by exposure to humidified air. Often, the bathroom is the best place to create a highly humidified area.''A cold water vaporizer also may be used to help with humidity. Avoid hot water vaporizers because of the risk of scalding ''burns''.''Stay well hydrated, especially if the pain makes it difficult to swallow fluid.''Warm water gargles may be soothing. Alternatively, popsicles may offer comfort.''Tylenol and/or ibuprofen may be helpful in decreasing the amount of pain.' Turn on the hot water in the shower until there is plenty of steam. Make certain that all the hot water is drained from the tub or shower to prevent the risk of scalding burns. Spend 15- 20 minutes breathing the warm moist air to help with symptoms."
What are the complications of laryngitis?,"'If the cause of laryngitis is '' vocal cord paralysis'', the swallowing mechanism may also be affected, and food particles may enter the larynx and lungs, leading to coughing. This process can also lead to aspiration ''pneumonia'' and its accompanying symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) when the food is aspirated deep into the lungs and causes irritation and inflammation of lung tissue.''Repeated episodes of gastroesophageal reflux may cause small amounts of acid to get past the inflamed larynx and enter the lung, causing recurrent ''pneumonia'' or ''bronchitis''.''Prior to the advent of ''Haemophilus'' ''influenzae'' immunization, epiglottitis due to ''H. ''flu'' was always considered as a possible alternative diagnosis for children with croup. This was a life-threatening medical emergency because the epiglottis could massively swell, blocking air from entering the larynx and lungs. X-rays of the neck were taken to visualize the epiglottis and look for swelling. The diagnosis was often confirmed in the operating room where the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist would use laryngoscopy to look at the epiglottis and vocal cords and decide whether to insert a ''breathing tube'"" in the child's airway to prevent the airway from swelling shut. Fortunately, because of immunization, this disease is rarely seen."" "
What should you know about laryngitis home remedies and treatments? What is the medical definition of laryngitis?,"'Laryngitis'' is inflammation of the larynx. Usually, inflammation of the larynx is caused by viral infections. Viral infections caused from infections may have symptoms like a ''sore throat'', ''cough'', ''difficulty swallowing'', and with a ''fever''. If the voice changes last longer after the ''fever'' and other symptoms go away the viral infection is cured. You can get ''laryngitis'' because of irritation to the vocal cords. Sports fans, singers, cheerleaders, and small children may be hoarse or have a ''raspy voice'' after bouts of shouting or screaming. Environmental causes of irritation of the ''airway'' that can result in inflammation of the larynx include exposure to tobacco smoke or other chemicals.'  "
What are acute and chronic laryngitis? How long do they last? ,"'Acute ''laryngitis'' lasts a few days up to a couple of weeks. If the symptoms of last more than 3 weeks it is called chronic ''laryngitis'"". If you or your child's laryngitis symptoms last more than 3 weeks call your doctor or your child's Pediatrician for an appointment."" "
 When will you get your voice back?,"'Laryngitis typically lasts few days, and symptoms should resolve within 7 days, but can linger up to two weeks. If symptoms persist longer than three weeks call your doctor for an appointment.' "
What is the best home remedy to treat laryngitis in children and adults?,"'Usually, laryngitis treatment for children and adults are home remedies that relieve ''pain'' and other symptoms by resting your and ''breathing'' humidified air. A great way to humidify the air is to take a steam bath in hot water, and inhale it deeply. You can rub eucalyptus essential oil to your hands while you inhale the steam if it feels good.' "
What home remedies soothe laryngitis in infants and babies?,"'Children with ''croup'' may have more difficulty ''breathing'', like trying to inhale through a swollen and narrow larynx, and the cartilage may collapse. When this happens in infants and ''babies'', the cartilage becomes stiff and the infant or baby when they try to inhale deeply, but in children, the cartilage is weaker and with each inspiration, the child may need to work hard to inhale. The maturing of laryngeal cartilage and widening of airways usually occurs by age 6 or 7.''Infants and children with ''croup'', he or she will have more difficulty inhaling through a swollen and narrow larynx, and the tissues surrounding the upper ''airway'' may collapse. This leads to the classic ""seal-like"" bark ''cough'' associated with symptoms of ''croup'' include croup, a hoarse barky ''cough'', ''fever'', and some respiratory distress when the infant or child works harder to breathe and draw air in through the inflamed voice box area. Symptoms may be more severe at night.''Croup is often described as a ""disease of the nighttime"" because visits to the emergency department peak after midnight with sick infants and children.' "
What treatments work fast for laryngitis in children and adults?,"'Treatment for chronic laryngitis in both children and adults is determined by the cause of the inflammation or loss of function; however, if you avoid drinking ''alcohol'' and stop ''smoking'', it will help relieve painful symptoms until the cause is diagnosed. Bacterial and ''fungal infections'' may need to be treated with antibiotics to cure the infection.' "
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications treat and cure laryngitis?,"'Over-the-counter'' medications that treat the anti-inflammatory properties include ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Aleve''). Note: Do not give ''aspirin'"" to children because of the risk of Reye's syndrome."" "
Which specialties of doctors treat laryngitis in adults and children?,"""Usually, laryngitis is evaluated by your primary care doctor, internist, or your child's pediatrician. If laryngitis goes away within a couple of weeks (acute), you don't need any additional\xa0treatment. If you or your child has laryngitis that hasn't gone away after a couple of weeks, see\xa0an ear, nose, and throat specialist\xa0called an otolaryngologist\xa0or ENT. If the doctors believe that you may have digestive issues, you may need to go to your nearest emergency department or urgent care for immediate treatment."" "
What causes reflux laryngitis? Can it affect the vocal cords or cause cancer?,"'Reflux is caused by ''weakness'"" in the muscle at the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. Normally, this muscular valve, or sphincter, functions to keep food and stomach acid from moving upward from the stomach to the esophagus and larynx. This valve opens to allow food into the stomach and closes to keep the stomach's contents from coming back up. The backward movement of stomach contents (gastric contents) up into the esophagus is called gastroesophageal reflux. Moreover, any increase in abdominal pressure (such as obesity or tight clothing, which can push acid back from the stomach up the esophagus) or a person with a hiatal ""'hernia'' will have an increased risk for reflux. When it causes symptoms or esophageal inflammation it is referred to as ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (or ''GERD''). When the acid backs up into the voice box (larynx), the condition is referred to as reflux laryngitis.''Stomach acid can cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus, larynx, and throat. This can lead to''Rarely, reflux can lead to cancers of the esophagus or larynx.'   erosion of the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis), narrowing of the esophagus (stricture), chronic hoarseness, chronic throat clearing, discomfort swallowing food, foreign body sensation in the throat, asthma or cough, spasms of the vocal cords, sinusitis, and growths on the vocal cords (granulomas)."
What are the symptoms and signs of reflux laryngitis?,"'Heartburn is the most common symptom associated with reflux. The American College of Gastroenterology estimates that more than 60 million Americans experience heartburn at least once a month and some studies suggest that more than 15 million people experience heartburn symptoms each day. The incidence of GERD is on the rise, and the rise in obesity is believed to be a contributing factor. In addition to heartburn, reflux severe enough to cause laryngitis can cause chronic hoarseness, ''asthma'', or a foreign body sensation in the throat (globus phenomenon). Considering the high prevalence of GERD, reflux laryngitis and its symptoms are uncommon.'  "
How is reflux laryngitis diagnosed?,"'In most patients, the presumptive diagnosis of reflux laryngitis is based on the typical history of heartburn and hoarseness. Testing usually is reserved for those patients who do not respond to conservative therapy (as explained below) or drug therapy. Diagnostic tests includes an:' esophagram (and X-ray of the esophagus) endoscopy, laryngoscopy, esophageal pH acid monitoring, and esophageal motility studies."
8 Reflux laryngitis diet tips and home remedies,"'Diet'', home remedies, medications, and lifestyle changes to treat acid reflux, heartburn, and reflux laryngitis.'   Avoid large meals at dinner. Avoid eating before bedtime, and allow several hours after eating before lying down to allow the stomach to empty. Avoid spicy or fried foods, peppermint, citrus, tomatoes, onions, and chocolate, especially if these foods increase symptoms. Diet should be high-protein, high-carbohydrate, and low fat Avoid alcohol, caffeinated beverages, and tobacco. Elevate the head of the bed with wooden blocks under the bedposts to allow gravity to keep the acid in the stomach. Pillows under the head are not helpful, however, wedges that elevate the head and upper chest are effective. Lose weight to reduce reflux. If you smoke, stop."
"What OTC, prescription medications, and surgery to treat acid reflux?","'There are several different types of medications available over the counter (OTC) or by prescription.''Antacids neutralize stomach acid and give immediate relief. Popular choices include ''sodium bicarbonate'' (Alka Seltzer), ''calcium carbonate'' (''Tums'', Rolaids, Alka-Mints), and aluminum and magnesium antacids (''Maalox'', ''Mylanta'', ''Riopan'', Gaviscon). Use antacids 30 to 60 minutes after each meal and at bedtime because they are more effective at these times.''People on a low sodium diet should avoid sodium bicarbonate. Calcium and aluminum can cause ''constipation'', while magnesium antacids can cause ''diarrhea''. Patents with ''kidney disease'' should avoid magnesium and aluminum antacids. Check with your pharmacist or doctor for any interactions with other medications you are taking.''Drugs'' such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDS''), ''theophylline'' (''Theo-Dur'', ''Respbid'', ''Slo-Bid'', ''Theo-24'', ''Theolair'', ''Uniphyl'', Slo-Phyllin), anticholinergics, and ''calcium channel blockers'' should be avoided if feasible, but discuss discontinuing any medication with a doctor first.''The acid-blocking drugs (''famotidine'' [''Pepcid''], ''cimetidine'' [''Tagamet''], ''nizatidine'' [''Axid''], ''ranitidine'' [''Zantac'']) are known as H2-blockers. These are available without a prescription. However, their strength may be inadequate.''Other valuable medications include ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan''), which helps to empty the stomach more rapidly; or proton pump inhibitors, such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec'') and ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid'').''If conservative therapy and medical therapy fail, surgery may be necessary. Traditionally, ''fundoplication'', a procedure that serves to strengthen or recreate the muscular valve (lower esophageal sphincter), requires significant surgical work and hospital stay. Surgery or fundoplication also has been able to be done with an endoscope, which shortens the hospital stay and recovery.' "
What are the difficulties in diagnosing reflux laryngitis?,"'In some patients'' it appears clear that the laryngeal symptoms - hoarseness, cough, ''sore throat'' - are due to reflux, for example, in patients with marked heartburn and regurgitation of acid.''In most patients'' with laryngeal symptoms - those with milder heartburn and no regurgitation who comprise the majority of patients in whom reflux laryngitis is considered - it is not as clear. Examination of the larynx may reveal redness and swelling, but many diseases of the larynx as well as reflux can cause these signs.''There are difficulties with using symptoms to diagnose reflux. For example, cough may occur when there is reflux into the esophagus. Refluxed liquid does not need to reach the larynx.''Finally, it is unclear whether refluxed liquid from the stomach that is not acid can cause reflux laryngitis, and there is no way of testing whether or not non-acid liquid is reaching the larynx. Many physicians use a trial of potent acid-suppression with ''PPIs'' to try to prove that acid reflux is the cause of the laryngeal symptoms. The problem with a trial of PPIs is that some symptoms such as cough and throat clearing can be caused by habit, and the PPIs may have a placebo effect. Thus, a response to PPIs may not be proof that reflux is the cause of symptoms.' "
What is laryngitis?,"'Laryngitis'' is the inflammation of the voice box (larynx). If caused by a virus or bacteria, ''laryngitis'' may be ''contagious''. Generally, laryngitis isn’t a severe condition and should resolve in barely three weeks with proper treatment, but in some cases, laryngitis lasts longer and develops into a chronic stage. The larynx is a voice box that has control over our voice. The vocal cord is located inside the larynx and is covered by the ''mucus'' lining. The muscles present inside the larynx are responsible for the movement of vocal cords, which helps you to speak.' "
What are the symptoms of laryngitis?,'Laryngitis is the inflammation of the voice box (larynx) that causes changes in the voice. It mainly occurs as a result of viral infection and typically manifests ''cough'' or a ''sore throat''. Symptoms of laryngitis include:''Complications of laryngitis from a ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' include:' Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Throat pain Fever Cough Swollen glands in the neck Nasal congestion Sneezing Stuffy nose Chills Runny nose Tightness in throat Pain when you swallow Constant urge to clear the throat Regurgitation of food and stomach content Loss of voice Shortness of breath Trouble speaking Pneumonia Chronic bronchitis Vocal cord paralysis
What causes laryngitis?,"'Laryngitis commonly occurs as a result of viral infection. However, there may be different causes of laryngitis. Laryngitis may be acute or chronic, and each may have different causes.''Causes of acute laryngitis include:''Causes of chronic laryngitis include:''These symptoms may last for more than three months.\xa0' Viral infection Voice overuse due to excess talking, singing, or shouting Smoking Prolonged alcohol use Exposed to polluted air Constant exposure to secondhand smoke Gastroesophageal reflux disease that may cause reflux laryngitis and chronic cough  Chronic irritation of the vocal cords that may cause polyps Repetitive use of an inhaler Excess coughing Allergies Fungal infection such as thrush Sinus disease Certain cancer"
How is laryngitis diagnosed?,"'Usually, patients with chronic laryngitis need to seek medical assistance. Hence, the physician is likely to do the following tests:' Take a throat swab to identify the cause of laryngitis Pass an endoscope (a narrow lighted tube attached to a camera) that helps the physician to get a closer look at the vocal cord Take a sample of tissue for examination (biopsy) if the physician suspects of a lump or nodule Take an X-ray or skin allergy test to rule out other issues"
What is the treatment for laryngitis?,"'More than any other treatment, voice rest is an ultimate option to treat laryngitis. Medications that may be prescribed for treating the symptoms of laryngitis involve:''A speech therapist may teach how to take care of the voice and how to prevent straining of voice.''Numerous home remedies may aid healing, which include:' Antibiotics Steroids Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Anti-reflux medications Mucolytics (medicines that may reduce the viscosity of the mucus) Drink ample amounts of lukewarm water. Better hydration may help in resolving laryngitis. Gargle with warm saltwater because salinity soothes the area and alleviates swelling. Sucking a throat lozenge inclusive of eucalyptus and mint can soothe sore throats. Steam inhalation with menthol may relieve the pain and soreness. Avoid dry, smoky, or dusty rooms Avoid whispering to prevent straining Stay away from decongestants because it may dry out the throat. Avoid coffee or tea Refrain from cigarette smoking"
Facts you should know about croup," Croup is an infection of the larynx, trachea, and the bronchial tubes usually caused by viruses. Less frequently, croup may be caused by bacteria. Croup is contagious, especially during the first few days of the illness. Teens and adults can develop a respiratory infection from the viruses that are associated with what is traditionally is considered croup in younger children. However, since the upper airway (trachea and larynx) in teens and adults are larger, the classic ""bark"" cough and ""Darth Vader"" sound (an abnormal, high-pitched sound while n inhaling). A cough that sounds like a barking seal and a harsh raspy ""Darth Vader"" sound during inhalation are symptoms of croup. Spasmodic croup is a distinct type of croup infection. Initially, the child has no associated signs and symptoms of the infection, for example, fever, runny nose, or sore throat.Classically, a healthy child with spasmodic croup is put to bed and awakens in the early morning with respiratory distress characterized by the barking cough and deep pitched sounds while inhaling. A child with spasmodic croup will have a moderately hoarse voice. Symptoms diminish and often by midday, the child is “back to normal,” only to regain the previous ;s symptoms that evening. This pattern repeats for 3-4 nights.A second phase of spasmodic croup (acute spasmodic croup) follows the above pattern in which the child's symptoms morph into what resembles the common cold. This second and different wave of illness will often last 2-3 days as the child fully recovers.

Cool moist air Saltwater nose drops Pain and fever medication Fluids Rarely antibiotics. In certain circumstances, a pediatrician may prescribe a single dose of an anti-inflammatory medication (dexamethasone). Over-the-counter (OTC) decongestants, cough and cold medications, and aspirin should not be given to children because of the association with aspirin usa and Reye syndrome, a potentially deadly illness affecting the liver, brain, and cardiovascular system. The major concern in croup is progressive breathing difficulty as the air passages narrow. Close monitoring of the breathing of a child with croup is important, especially at night."
What is croup? What causes croup?,"'Croup is an infectious pediatric illness of the respiratory system that involves predominantly the vocal cords (larynx) and windpipe (trachea), and to a lesser degree the upper airways of the ''lungs'"" (bronchial tubes). The majority of a child's symptoms reflect involvement of the larynx. Usually, croup is a viral infection and may be caused by many different viruses, including those responsible for the ""'common cold'' and ''influenza''. Rarely, it is caused by a bacterial infection.'""Croup is more common and concerning in children between 6 months and 3 years of age, and rarely occurs in children over 6 years of age. Commonly, croup is seen from late fall through the early winter months. It has a slightly higher frequency in boys than in girls. Bacterial croup is an infection of the same structures that are affected during a viral process. Treatment varies depending on whether the child's illness is caused by a virus or a bacteria.""  "
What are croup symptoms and signs?,"'Viral croup can have two distinct presentations, both of which are a consequence of swelling of the vocal cords resulting in a narrowing of the airway. The more common variety has symptoms of fever (100 F-103 F), mild ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat'' two to three days after virus exposure. Quick to follow is the characteristic dry ""barking seal"" cough that may be associated with a harsh, raspy sound during inspiration. (This sound, called ""stridor,"" has been noted to resemble the breathing of the ''Star Wars'' character Darth Vader.) The symptoms commonly last for four to seven days.''The alternative and less frequent presentation is called ""acute spasmodic croup."" These children will appear totally well when put to bed at night only to awaken their parents in the middle of the night with the above described barky cough and stridor. Fever and ''sore throat'' are not noted in these children, and the symptoms commonly resolve within eight to 10 hours from onset, and the child appears totally well until this same acute onset recurs the following night. This on/off pattern may occur over three to four nights in a row and then morph in to symptoms more characteristic of the ''common cold'' -- ''mucus''-like nasal discharge and a ""wet"" cough for several days.''These two different presentations are the result of the particular virus that has infected the child. Manifestations of croup vary from mild (common) to life-threatening (rare). The severity of symptoms is proportional to the amount of relative narrowing of the airway. The more severe the vocal cord narrowing the more effort is required to inhale. A severely sick child will refuse to lie down, demanding to remain in an upright position. They will show retractions of the skin above the collarbone and between the ribs with inspiration and may develop facial ''cyanosis'' (bluish skin discoloration). Apparent exhaustion and decreased respiratory effort are an indication of impending respiratory failure and are cause for immediate paramedic evaluation and transport to the emergency department of the closest hospital.''In general, the duration of symptoms of croup is five to seven days. More severe croup may resolve in 14 days.'  "
Can adults get croup?,"'Teens and adults may develop an ''upper respiratory infection'' caused by the viruses which cause croup in younger children. However, since the internal diameter of the upper airway (larynx and trachea) is much larger than in younger children, the classsic barky cough, inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress is rare. More commonly, symptoms seen in a routine “cold” are the primary symptoms and signs.' "
Is croup contagious? How does it spread?,"'Croup is contagious and is usually spread by airborne infectious droplets sneezed or coughed by infected children. When a healthy child inhales infectious droplets, symptoms can develop in two to three days. The infection can also be spread by infected mucus deposited on doors, furniture, toys, and other objects. A healthy child can become infected by accidentally touching the infectious mucus and transferring the infection into his/her mouth.'  "
How long is croup contagious?," Most viral causes of croup have an incubation period of 24-72 hours between exposure to the virus and development of initial symptoms. Most children with viral croup are most contagious during the first days of fever and illness. The infection spreads easily in a household. Older children, teens and adults in the family will often develop a sore throat or a cough, without necessarily developing the characteristic barky cough and stridor seen in croup. Infants and children may return to school or day care when their temperature is normal and they feel better. A lingering cough can last another two weeks but should not be the reason to keep them at home."
What tests and imaging procedures diagnose croup?,"'The diagnosis of croup is most commonly made by obtaining the characteristic history of sudden-onset of hoarse voice, barky cough, stridor during inhalation, and the possibility of low-grade fever. While the child may appear rather ill, the child does not have a look of pure panic or terror. There can be high fever (> 103 F), sitting forward positioning, and excessive ''drooling''. A recent exposure to another child with croup helps to confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are rarely necessary and are mostly limited to severe situations where concern regarding a secondary bacterial infection may have developed and is superimposed upon the primary viral process. A particular X-ray orientation of the neck will often show a characteristic elongated narrowing of the region called a ""steeple sign."" Such an X-ray finding is confirmatory for croup. Rarely will consultation with an otolaryngologist (ENT physician) be necessary to have a direct visual examination of the patient\'s airway. Such a procedure is termed fiberoptic laryngoscopy and is indicated if there is a concern for an anatomical malformation of the upper airway, possible aspiration of a foreign object, or should the child rapidly deteriorate or not respond to routine therapy in the anticipated manner.''Most infants are routinely immunized against the bacteria ''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B (Hib). When the child is not immunized against Hib, the possibility of a more ominous, deep bacterial infection called epiglottitis exists.' "
What is the treatment for croup? Do remedies help symptoms?,"'Croup can be frightening for both children and parents. Therefore, comforting and reassuring the child is the first step. Breathing difficulties can develop and worsen rapidly. Close monitoring of the child is important during the early phases of the illness.''Rarely, a patient may have severe respiratory symptoms that need treatment with inhalation therapy with epinephrine (adrenaline) in the hospital where he or she can be monitored continuously. These therapies provide a temporary (two hour) reduction of symptoms, but is commonly followed by a return of equally severe symptoms. This reappearance of symptoms is commonly termed as a ""rebound"" phenomenon.''Side effects of epinephrine inhalation therapy include:''Because a virus usually causes croup, antibiotics are reserved for those rare occasions when ''bacterial infections'' cause croup or become superimposed on the viral infection.''Even though plenty of fluids are encouraged to avoid ''dehydration'', forcing fluids is generally unnecessary. Popsicles are a popular means of providing fluid. Activity should be restricted to quiet play during the first days of the illness.'   To help the child breathe more comfortably, a cool or warm mist vaporizer can be placed near the child. The humidified air promotes reduction of vocal cord swelling and thus lessens symptoms. To avoid accidental burns, hot water vaporizers should be out of the reach of infants and toddlers. Also effective is having the child breathe in a bathroom steamed up with hot water from the tub or shower. When cough or stridor worsens at night, 10-15 minutes sitting or driving in the cool night air can also help relieve the child's respiratory symptoms. In infants and children, blockage in the nasal passages from mucus can further impair breathing. Careful instillation of saltwater nose drops (¼ teaspoon of table salt in 1 cup of water) into the nasal openings every few hours, followed by gentle suction using a bulb syringe, can be helpful in opening nasal passages. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding most combination cough and cold medicines. Several studies show that these medicines are ineffective in children. They can potentially cause side effects that could lead to more serious symptoms. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) are helpful for pain relief and fever. Aspirin is avoided in the treatment of croup and other viral illnesses since aspirin is suspected as being related to Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a serious illness that causes kidney, liver, and brain damage, which can lead to the rapid onset of coma. Occasionally, an oral cortisone medication (dexamethasone) is prescribed for more severe cases of croup. Rapid heart rate Elevation of blood pressure Nausea Occasionally vomiting and agitation"
What warning signs should parents look for with croup?,"""The major concern in croup is the accompanying breathing difficulties as the upper airway narrows. Close monitoring of the child's breathing is important. The child should be especially observed at night or when napping for breathing difficulty. The doctor should be notified if the child is having progressive breathing difficulty, unusual drooling, agitation or restlessness, fever over 103 F, or if the parent feels frightened.""'The breathing difficulties seen in croup can progress rapidly, turning into a life-threatening emergency. On rare occasions, a child must be rushed by ambulance into the emergency room because of serious breathing problems. Signs of serious trouble include swallowing difficulty, nonstop drooling, bluish discoloration of the skin or lips (cyanosis), sucking in of the chest, and rapid breathing (over 60 breaths per minute).''While most children recover from croup without hospitalization, some children can develop life-threatening breathing difficulties. Therefore, close contact with the doctor during this illness is important.'  "
Is it possible to prevent croup?,"'There is no current vaccination to prevent croup. However, several laboratories are working diligently to develop one. The infectious virus is most commonly transmitted by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''. Touching objects contaminated with infectious viral particles also allows transmission of the virus. Airborne viral particles can be infectious for about one hour. Virus on objects remains infectious for several hours. Avoiding these exposures can prevent croup.' "
What is the prognosis if my child develops croup?, The prognosis for a child who develops croup is excellent. Most cases of croup can be managed at home by exposing the child to cool moist air. Rarely will a child need a dose of oral steroid medication. It is extremely rare for an otherwise healthy child to be hospitalized for croup.
What is throat (larynx) cancer?,"'Throat cancer (''laryngeal cancer'') is a general term that usually refers to cancer of the pharynx and/or larynx (voice box). Regions included when considering throat cancer include the pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx [cancers that occur in the tissues of the throat adjacent to the larynx], glottis, supraglottis, and subglottis); about half of throat cancers develop in the larynx (the part of the throat with the vocal cords), and the other half in the pharynx (pharyngeal cancer). Consequently, any cancers (growth and/or spread of abnormal cells that form tumors or ''metastasize'' to other parts of the body) that develop in these regions of the throat are considered throat cancers. For this article, the terms throat cancer and larynx cancer will be interchangeable. The term laryngeal cancer also is used to refer to larynx cancer. ''Nasopharyngeal cancer'' and oropharyngeal cancer (mouth and pharynx) or will not be discussed in this article.''Some investigators consider throat cancers a subset of esophageal cancers. For this article, only throat cancers will be discussed. Esophageal cancers have the potential to cause throat symptoms such as burning or ''pain'' (pressure) in the throat as well as the chest since they can extend throughout the ''esophagus'' from just below the pharynx to the junction of the esophagus and stomach. Moreover, esophageal cancers may include all of the throat cancer signs, symptoms, and most diagnostic and treatment protocols discussed in this article -- particularly when they are located high in the esophagus.''The American Cancer Society statistics suggest that about 12,410 new cases of laryngeal cancer will occur in 2019 (9,860 in men and 2,550 in women), with about 3,760 deaths. Five-year survival rates vary somewhat with the location of the cancer and its stage (see below). Most types have a 5-year survival rate in stage I and/or II that range from about 53%-64% except for those that occur in the glottis (the part of the larynx including the vocal cords), which is about 74%-90%. Stages III-IV 5-year survival varies from about 6%-24%, with stage IV having the lowest 5-year survival rate.' "
What causes throat cancer?,"'Although it is not clear exactly what causes throat cancers, the cancerous cells develop when genetic mutations allow the cells to grow uncontrollably to form tumors (masses of cancer cells) that may metastasize (spread) to other areas in the body. Some of the factors that can lead to genetic mutations in the cells of the throat include ''cigarette smoking'', infections with the ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'' [or ''HPV''-related infections]), and exposure to toxic substances like ''asbestos'' or large quantities of ''alcohol''.' "
What are the risk factors for throat cancer?,"'Some of the risk factors for throat cancer are related to lifestyle. For example, individuals can increase the risk of such cancers by ''smoking'' or using other tobacco products, chewing betel nuts (a common practice by South Asians), drinking excess alcohol, and consuming insufficient ''vitamin A''. Exposure to asbestos, poor ''dental hygiene'', and especially exposure to HPV human papillomavirus are also risk factors in some case-control studies. HPV exposure is significant because about 50% to 90% of squamous cell carcinomas (squamous cell cancer), the most common type of throat cancers, have been linked to HPV infections that can be acquired with oral sex. Some researchers think infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' is a risk factor. In addition, being male and/or having an African-American heritage also increases risk.' "
What are the types of larynx (throat) cancer?,"'The types of larynx (throat) cancers are as follows:' Squamous cell carcinoma (most common type of throat cancer) Adenocarcinoma (cancer of glandular cells that release mucus, occurs infrequently) Other types that may occur rarely are as follows:LymphoepitheliomaMucoepidermoid carcinomaSpindle cell carcinomaVerrucous cancerLymphomaUndifferentiated carcinomaSarcomaMelanoma Lymphoepithelioma Mucoepidermoid carcinoma Spindle cell carcinoma Verrucous cancer Lymphoma Undifferentiated carcinoma Sarcoma Melanoma"
What are the symptoms and signs of throat cancer?,"'The symptoms and signs of throat cancer often vary from person to person. The most common signs and ''symptoms of throat cancer'' are nonspecific. Not every patient will exhibit each sign and symptom of these ''throat cancer symptoms'', but each patient will usually have at least one or two of the following:''As stated above, these symptoms and signs are not diagnostic for throat cancer because many other problems can mimic the throat cancer. However, any person who develops these signs and symptoms and has risk factors for throat cancer should immediately discuss them with his or her physician.'   Voice change or hoarseness of the voice Cough (usually chronic) Sore throat (usually chronic) Throat discomfort (feeling like something is caught in the throat) Difficulty swallowing or swallowing problems with certain foods A mass or lump in the neck Weight loss (unintentional) Some difficulty with breathing Ear pain Constant phlegm production"
How do health care professionals diagnose throat cancer?,"""The person's individual history (especially the presence of potential risk factors) and physical examination may provide a physician with enough suspicious information that the physician will consider throat cancer as a possible diagnosis. Consequently, the physician may strongly suggest doing additional tests to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of throat cancer. Although imaging tests such as CT, ""'MRI'', PET scan, and others like chest ''X-rays'', laryngoscopy, and barium swallows provide very useful information about extent and location of the cancer, the definitive diagnosis of throat cancer is made by biopsy of the tumor. Biopsy may be done by surgical incision in the neck, fine needle aspiration of the tumor, or by an endoscopic biopsy.' "
How do health care professionals determine throat cancer staging?,"'Throat cancer staging is determined by a TNM staging system. The system was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and is presented below.''All of this information is combined to arrive at a disease stage. After stage 0 (which is ''carcinoma in situ'' or cancer that has not grown beyond the cells lining the throat), stages are labeled using Roman numerals from I through IV (that is, 1 through 4). The smaller the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, for example stage IV, indicates a more serious stage of the disease.' T stands for tumor (how far it has spread within the larynx or pharynx and to nearby tissues). N describes whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. M stands for metastasis (spread of the cancer) to distant organs."
What kinds of specialists treat throat cancer?,"""Most institutions take a team approach to each individual with throat cancer. In general, depending upon the extent of the individual's cancer (see, TMN system above), a person's team of specialists (usually board-certified) may include the following:""'The involvement of many specialists has been found to provide an individual with the best chance of treating and/or surviving the various types of throat cancers, follow-up treatments, and reducing symptoms. These specialists also can identify local support groups that can help the patient and family members cope with the lifestyle changes needed to live well with the disease.' Oncologists Surgeons Plastic surgeons Radiation oncologists Swallowing experts Dentists Speech pathologists Dietitians Therapists (physical, occupational, and speech)"
What is the treatment for throat cancer?,"""The treatment for throat cancer depends upon the extent and seriousness of the disease. As stated by the MD Anderson Cancer Center and others, treatment is tailored to the individual to provide him or her with the best chance for a successful outcome. Treatment strives to preserve the patient's ability to eat, speak, and live a normal healthy life. Treatment plans for throat cancers usually include one or more of the following techniques: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, proton therapy, targeted therapies, and possibly participation in throat cancer ""'clinical trials''. Brief descriptions of the major components for throat cancer therapy are as follows:''Side effects of treatment vary from person to person. However, some of the most common side effects include inflammation of mucous membranes, ''dry mouth'', skin changes (especially after radiotherapy), ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (especially with chemotherapy), ''fatigue'', ''sore throat'', ''difficulty swallowing'', increased sticky phlegm production, ''loss of appetite'', loss of taste, ''hair loss'', and breathing difficulties. In many patients who develop side effects, most effects will last from a few weeks to a few months although in a few patients they may remain indefinitely.'   Surgery: There are many types of surgery for throat cancer, including minimally invasive, transoral laser microsurgery, endoscopic, laser, robotic, and tumor excision surgery, like supracricoid partial laryngectomy to allow more normal function in swallowing and speech without a stoma (a surgically made opening in the neck that allows breathing). Chemotherapy: These are anti-cancer drugs used to shrink tumors and/or kill cancer cells after surgery and/or radiation treatment. Chemotherapy (for example, cetuximab [Erbitux]) often is used in combination with other therapies. Radiation therapy: Brachytherapy involves placement of radioactive beads close to a tumor. 3-D radiation beam therapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be tailored to the specific shape of the tumor. Often, radiation may be used as a first-line treatment; high-energy radiation beams may destroy or shrink the tumor. Proton therapy: This radiation doses using pencil beam technology directed at the tumor while preserving nearby healthy tissue. Targeted therapies: These drugs are used to stop the growth of cancer cells by interfering with proteins and/or other receptors on cancer cells. Cancer clinical trials: This involves the use of experimental drugs or other methods that may show promise in survival and/or reduction in clinical symptoms."
Are there home remedies for throat (larynx) cancer?,"'There are no home remedies that can cure throat cancers. However, there are home remedies that might reduce some of the symptoms in some patients. They are not medically recommended as initial or first treatments but like most home remedies may reduce some symptoms in certain patients. They are as follows:''Patients should discuss with their doctors the use of these home remedies before trying them.' Herbs (for example, green tea and garlic) Dietary supplements including vitamins and foods containing vitamin C and folate Hydrotherapy (hot and/or cold wraps) Acupuncture Physical therapy Lifestyle changes, including exercise, appropriate diet, and avoidance of smoking"
What kind of support is available for those with throat cancer?,"'Most treatment methods involve continued support for those with throat cancer. Patients receive rehabilitation support such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Other patients may require additional surgical treatment such as reconstructive surgery and/or ''dental implants''. In addition, speech pathologists, audiologists, and experts in swallowing rehabilitation may be needed. Support groups may provide additional helpful advice about coping with the disease.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with throat cancer?,"'The prognosis or outcome for patients with throat cancer varies with the stage and location of the cancer. Most prognostic indicators are based on a 5-year relative survival rate that varies with the type of cancer and its stage. The best survival is in cancer of the glottis (90%) and worst is in cancer of the hypopharynx (53%), both beginning at stage I over a 5-year period. Unfortunately, in all individuals with throat cancer, the 5-year survival rate declines as the stages progress from 1 to IV. Consequently, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed (early-stage) and treated the better the potential outcome.' "
Is it possible to prevent throat cancer?,"'Although general throat ''cancer screening'' is not available, those individuals that are at higher risk for throat cancer may need to see their physicians if any signs and symptoms raise suspicion of throat cancer. Consequently, those who are at increased risk such as individuals who smoke or who may have been exposed to HPV, asbestos, nickel, or sulfuric acid fumes are at higher risk. Avoiding such risky situations can reduce the risk of throat cancer but there is no guarantee that it can be prevented. However, one excellent way to reduce the cancer risk is to have young men and women be vaccinated with the ''HPV vaccine''.' "
Introduction to LASEK Laser Eye Surgery,"'LASEK'' ''laser eye surgery'' is a newer surgery that combines many of the benefits of older vision correction surgeries, explain doctors at The Cleveland Clinic.''Laser epithelial keratomileusis, or LASEK, combines benefits of the two most commonly performed procedures -- ''LASIK'' and PRK. LASEK laser eye surgery is used to treat ''astigmatism'', ''nearsightedness'' or ''farsightedness''.''In LASEK laser eye surgery, the epithelium, or outer layer of the ''cornea'', is cut not with the microkeratome cutting tool used in ''LASIK'', but with a finer blade called a trephine and a 20% ''alcohol'' solution.' "
What Are the Advantages of LASEK Laser Eye Surgery?, Complications associated with cutting and reattaching the flap in the cornea are avoided. LASEK laser eye surgery causes dry eye less frequently than LASIK laser eye surgery.
What Are the Disadvantages of LASEK Laser Eye Surgery?," Longer visual recovery time compared to LASIK laser eye surgery. Many LASEK patients will not fully recover functional vision for 1 to 2 weeks while their eye heals, which is similar to the healing time experienced in PRK laser eye surgery. LASIK laser eye surgery patients often have good vision by the day after surgery. LASEK laser eye surgery may cause more pain and discomfort than LASIK , but less pain than PRK laser eye surgery. Most LASEK laser eye surgery patients say the discomfort lasts about 2 days or less. Patients need to wear a ""bandage contact lens"" for about 3 or 4 days after LASEK laser eye surgery to serve as a protective layer between your blinking eyelids and the treated eye surface, which is not necessary after LASIK. Patients must use topical steroid drops for several weeks longer than that used after LASIK laser eye surgery."
What Are the Side Effects of LASEK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'LASEK laser eye surgery shows side effects less frequently than is seen with PRK, however side effects may occur. These may include:' Sensation of having a foreign object in your eye (can 
  last anywhere from 1 to 4 days) 
   Temporary reduced vision under poorly lit conditions 
  (up to 12 months) 
   Dry eyes, requiring the use of moisturizing drops (up to 6 months) 
   Hazy or cloudy vision (should disappear within 6 to 9 months)"
How Do I Know if LASEK Laser Eye Surgery Is for Me?,"'LASEK laser eye surgery may be better for patients who have steep or very thin corneas, which make it difficult for the surgeon to make a proper LASIK flap. Since traumatic injury to the eye is more serious after LASIK than LASEK laser eye surgery, patients who engage in professional or leisure activities that put their eyes at increased risk for injury (such as boxing) may be better suited for LASEK. LASEK laser eye surgery is better for people with ''dry eye syndrome'' because in avoiding a deeper flap, the corneal nerves responsible for the tearing reflex are not cut.' "
How Do I Prepare for LASEK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Before your LASEK laser eye surgery you will have met with a coordinator who will discuss what you should expect during and after the laser eye surgery. During this session your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be tested. Likely tests include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through your evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any further questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the procedure.''If you wear rigid ''gas'' permeable ''contact lenses'"", you should not wear them for three weeks before your surgery. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to surgery. Be sure to bring your ""'eyeglasses'' to the surgeon so your prescription can be reviewed.''On the day of your LASEK laser eye surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor, and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye ''makeup'"" or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you do not feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed."" "
What Happens During LASEK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'LASEK laser eye surgery is done under local anesthesia. During the procedure, the top layer of cells, or epithelium, is treated with alcohol for about 30 seconds to detach it from the underlying tissue. It is then lifted or rolled back so that the eye doctor can access the cornea tissue. The newly exposed tissue is treated with the same laser used in LASIK laser eye surgery and PRK. Then the top layer of cells is replaced.''This is in contrast to LASIK laser eye surgery, in which a cutting device makes a flap in the cornea. LASEK laser eye surgery differs from PRK by preserving the top layer of cells, rather than scraping them away and waiting for them to grow back. This is believed to facilitate healing of the cornea with less discomfort than PRK.' "
What Happens After LASEK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'After LASEK laser eye surgery, expectations are similar to what can expected after LASIK. However, even though the flap created by LASEK laser eye surgery heals in about a day, patient usually wear a special contact lens that acts as a bandage for up to four days after surgery. Patients also may experience irritation in their eye during the first day or two after LASEK laser eye surgery For patients who undergo the LASIK procedure, good vision is usually attained in a few days. For LASEK laser eye surgery this may take as long as a week.''You will revisit the doctor for an evaluation the day after LASEK laser eye surgery, as well as one week and three months after surgery.' "
When to Call the Doctor,"'If you have any questions after your LASEK laser eye surgery or if you experience pain, a sudden decrease in vision, ''red eye''(s), or discharge from your eye(s), contact your eye doctor immediately.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.

Introduction,"'Laser resurfacing is a treatment to reduce facial ''wrinkles'' and skin irregularities, such as blemishes or ''acne'' ''scars''.''The technique directs short, concentrated pulsating beams of light at irregular skin, precisely removing skin  layer by layer. This popular procedure is also called lasabrasion, laser peel, or laser vaporization.' "
Who Is a Good Candidate For Laser Resurfacing?,"'If you have fine lines or ''wrinkles'' around your eyes or mouth or on your forehead, shallow scars from ''acne'', or non-responsive skin after a ''facelift'', then you may be a good candidate for laser skin resurfacing.''If you have active ''acne'' or if you have very dark skin, you may not be a candidate. This technique is also not recommended for ''stretch marks''. You should discuss whether laser resurfacing is right for you by consulting with the doctor before having the procedure done.' "
How Does Laser Skin Resurfacing Work?,'The two types of lasers most commonly used in laser resurfacing are carbon dioxide (CO2) and erbium. Each laser vaporizes skin cells damaged at the surface-level.' 
CO2 Laser Resurfacing,"'This method has been used for years to treat different skin issues, including ''wrinkles'', scars, ''warts'', enlarged oil glands on the nose, and other conditions.''The newest version of CO2 laser resurfacing uses very short pulsed light energy (known as ultrapulse) or continuous light beams that are delivered in a scanning pattern to remove thin layers of skin with minimal heat damage. Recovery takes up to two weeks.' "
Erbium Laser Resurfacing,"'Erbium laser resurfacing is designed to remove surface-level and moderately deep lines and wrinkles on the face, hands, neck, or chest. One of the benefits of erbium laser resurfacing is minimal burning of surrounding tissue. This laser causes fewer side effects -- such as swelling, ''bruising'', and redness -- so your recovery time should be faster than with CO2 laser resurfacing. In some cases, recovery may only take one week Ask your doctor how long recovery is likely to take for you.''If you have a darker skin tone, erbium laser resurfacing may work better for you.' "
Preparing for Laser Resurfacing,"'Start by consulting a ''plastic surgeon'"" or dermatologist to find out if you're a good candidate. Be sure to choose a doctor who has documented training and experience in laser skin resurfacing. The doctor will determine which laser treatment is best for you after considering your medical history, current health, and desired results.""'Tell the doctor if you get ''cold sores'' or ''fever blisters'' around your mouth. Laser skin resurfacing can trigger breakouts in people who are at risk.''If you decide to go ahead with laser skin resurfacing, your doctor will ask you to avoid taking any medications or ''supplements'' that can affect clotting -- such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'', or ''vitamin E'' -- for 10 days before surgery.''If you smoke, you should stop for two weeks before and after the procedure. ''Smoking'' can prolong healing.''Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic beforehand to prevent ''bacterial infections'' and also an antiviral medication if you are prone to ''cold sores'' or ''fever blisters''.' "
What to Expect,"'Generally, laser resurfacing is an outpatient procedure, meaning there is no overnight stay.''The doctor may treat individual wrinkles around your eyes, mouth, or forehead or treat your entire face. For small areas, the doctor will numb the areas to be treated with a local anesthetic. The doctor may also sedate you. You may get general anesthesia if your whole face is being treated.''If the doctor is just treating parts of your face, the procedure will take about 30 to 45 minutes. A full-face treatment takes up to two hours.'""Following the laser procedure, the doctor will bandage the treated area. Starting 24 hours after treatment, you will need to clean the treated area four to five times a day. Then you'll need to apply an ointment, such as petroleum jelly, to prevent scabs from forming. This ""'wound care'' is intended to prevent any scab formation. In general, the areas heal in 10 to 21 days, depending on the condition that was treated.'""It's normal to have swelling after laser skin resurfacing. Your doctor may prescribe steroids to manage swelling around your eyes. Sleeping on an extra pillow at night can help ease swelling. Putting an ice pack on the treated area also helps in the first 24 to 48 hours after laser resurfacing.""'You may feel ''itching'' or stinging for 12 to 72 hours after the procedure. Five to seven days after laser resurfacing, your skin will become dry and peel.''Once the skin heals, you can wear oil-free ''makeup'' to minimize redness, which usually fades in two to three months.''You will probably notice that your skin is lighter for a while after surgery. It is particularly important that you use a ""broad-spectrum"" ''sunscreen'', which screens ultraviolet B and ultraviolet A rays, to protect your skin during that time. When selecting a sunscreen, look for one specially formulated for use on the face. It should have a ''sun protection'' factor (''SPF'') of 50 or higher.''It is also important to keep your new skin well moisturized. If you use ''Retin A'' or glycolic acid products, you should be able to start using them again about six weeks after the procedure or when the doctor says you can.''Once the treated areas have healed, you can wear makeup to hide the pink to red color that is typically seen after laser skin resurfacing. Green-based make-ups are particularly suitable for this camouflage since they neutralize the red color. Oil-free make-ups are recommended after laser resurfacing. The redness in the laser treated sites generally fades in two to three months. But it may take as long as six months for the redness to completely disappear. Redness generally lasts longer in people with fair skin.''People with darker skin tones are more likely to get darker pigmentation. This may be minimized by using  a bleaching agent before and after laser skin resurfacing.' "
Complications of Laser Skin Resurfacing,"'Although skin resurfacing cannot produce perfect skin, it can improve the appearance of your skin. Potential risks of the procedure include:''Milia, which are small white ''bumps'', may appear in the laser-treated areas during healing. Your doctor can treat those.' Burns or other injuries from the laser's heat Scarring Changes in the skin's pigmentation, including areas of darker or lighter skin Reactivating herpes cold sores Bacterial infection"
Cost of Laser Skin Resurfacing,"'In 2011, the national average cost for laser skin resurfacing was about $2,300, according to the American Society of ''Plastic'' Surgeons. However, costs vary widely depending on where the procedure is being done.''Because laser skin resurfacing is considered a cosmetic procedure, most medical insurance companies will not cover it. There may be an exception if you get the procedure to modify scars or remove ''precancerous'' growths on your skin.''Talk with your doctor and your insurance company before the procedure about what the costs will be and what, if anything, insurance will pay for. Most doctors offer financing options.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Introduction to LTK Laser eye Surgery,"'Laser thermokeratoplasty, or LTK ''laser eye surgery'', is a new procedure used to treat ''farsightedness'' and ''astigmatism''.''During LTK laser eye surgery, a laser beam uses heat to shrink and reshape the ''cornea''. Vision problems from ''farsightedness'' or ''astigmatism'' are corrected in a matter of seconds, without any cutting or removal of tissue.''Although highly effective in the short-term, the results of LTK laser eye surgery are not permanent. Your vision gradually regresses, mostly during the first three months following LTK laser eye surgery. To compensate, the doctor will intentionally overcorrect, so you end up with your desired vision.' "
What are the advantages of LTK laser eye surgery?,'The advantages of LTK laser eye surgery include:' Little risk of infection or vision loss since the laser is the only thing that touches the eye during LTK laser eye surgery. LTK laser eye surgery s very fast. Little discomfort results from LTK laser eye surgery and patients are often able to resume normal activities the following day.
What Are the Disadvantages of LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,'The disadvantages of LTK laser eye surgery include:' LTK laser eye surgery is not permanent. Patients experience temporary nearsightedness following the procedure since over-correction of vision is required to account for regression. Some patients may even need to wear glasses for a few weeks following LTK laser eye surgery. It is common for people who have had the LTK laser eye surgery to lose about half of the corrective effects within two years of the surgery.
What Are the Potential Side Effects of LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Other than nearsightedness, you may also feel as if you have a foreign object in your eye. But this sensation should go away after the first day with the help of eye drops given to you by your doctor. You may also experience ''sensitivity to light'' the first day or so following LTK laser eye surgery, but ''pain'' or other discomfort is rarely associated with this procedure.' "
Who's a Candidate for LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Due to its non-permanent effects, LTK laser eye surgery is only performed in people over the age of 40 who are mildly farsighted. Other than age, the qualifications for this surgery are the same as the  qualifications for any refractive surgery.' "
How Should I Prepare for LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Before your LTK laser eye surgery you will meet with a coordinator who will discuss what you should expect during and after the surgery.

To prevent infection or any irritation that may occur, you will be given antibiotic drops as well as anti-inflammatory drops to take for one week after LTK laser eye surgery.''As previously mentioned, for the first week after LTK laser eye surgery it is common to experience nearsightedness, however as the regression slows your distance vision will improve considerably. From the end of the first week to 3 months following LTK laser eye surgery, you should expect some fluctuations of vision.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.    ' "
Introduction,"""Lasers have been used in dentistry since 1994 to treat a number of dentalproblems. But, despite FDA approval, no laser system has received the AmericanDental Association's Seal of Acceptance. That seal assures dentists that theproduct or device meets ADA standards of safety and efficacy, among otherthings. The ADA, however, states that it is cautiously optimistic about therole of laser technology in the field of dentistry. These lasers are differentfrom the ""'cold'' lasers used in phototherapy for the relief of ''headaches'', ''pain'',and inflammation.''Still, some dentists are using lasers to treat:' Tooth decay. Lasers are used to remove decay within a tooth and prepare the surrounding enamel for receipt of the  filling. 
  Lasers are also used to ""cure"" or harden a filling. Gum disease. Lasers are used to reshape gums and remove bacteria during 
  root canal procedures. Biopsy or lesion removal. Lasers can be used to remove a small piece
of tissue (called a biopsy) so that it can be examined for cancer. Laser are
also used to remove lesions in the mouth; and relieve the pain of canker sores. Teeth whitening. Lasers are used to speed up the in-office teeth whitening procedures. A peroxide
bleaching solution, applied to the tooth surface, is ""activated"" by
laser energy, which speeds up of the whitening process."
How Do Lasers Work?,"'All lasers work by delivering energy in the form of light. When used forsurgical procedures, the laser acts as a cutting instrument or a vaporizer oftissue that it comes in contact with. When used for ""curing"" a filling,the laser helps to strengthen the bond between the filling and the tooth. Whenused in ''teeth'' whitening procedures, the laser acts as a heat source andenhances the effect of tooth beaching agents.' "
What Are the Pros and Cons of Using a Laser?,"'Pros'' Compared to the traditional dental drill, lasers:''Cons'' The disadvantages of lasers are that:''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Jay H. Rosoff, DDS, on March 1, 2007''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, on May 1, 2005. ''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2005' May cause less pain in some instances, therefore, reducing the need for anesthesia May reduce anxiety in patients uncomfortable with the use of the dental drill Minimize bleeding and swelling during soft tissue treatments May preserve more healthy tooth during cavity removal Lasers can't be used on teeth with fillings already in place. Lasers can't be used in many commonly performed dental procedures. For
example, lasers can't be used to fill cavities located between teeth, around
old fillings, and large cavities that need to be prepared for a crown. In
addition, lasers cannot be used to remove defective crowns or silver fillings,
or prepare teeth for bridges. Traditional drills may still be needed to shape the filling, adjust the bite, and polish the filling even when a laser is used. Lasers do not eliminate the need for anesthesia. Laser treatment tends to be more expensive since the cost of the laser is
much higher than a dental drill. Lasers can cost between $39,000 and $45,000
compared to about $600 for a standard drill."
What is LASIK eye surgery?,"'LASIK'' stands for Laser in Situ Keratomileusis, which means using a laser underneath a corneal flap (in situ) to reshape the ''cornea'' (keratomileusis). This procedure utilizes a highly specialized laser (excimer laser) designed to treat refractive errors, improve vision, and reduce or eliminate the need for glasses or ''contact lenses''. This laser procedure alters the shape of the cornea, which is the transparent front covering of the eye. Though the excimer laser had been used for many years before, the development of LASIK is generally credited to Ioannis Pallikaris from Greece around 1991.'  "
How does LASIK work?,"'During the LASIK procedure, a specially trained eye surgeon first creates a precise, thin hinged corneal flap using a microkeratome. The surgeon then pulls back the flap to expose the underlying corneal tissue, and then the excimer laser ablates (reshapes) the cornea in a unique pre-specified pattern for each patient. The flap is then gently repositioned onto the underlying cornea without ''sutures''. ' "
How do glasses or contacts improve vision in people with refractive errors?,""" Glasses or contact lenses are used to compensate for the eye's refractive error by bending light rays in a way that complements the eye's specific refractive error. In contrast, LASIK and other forms of refractive surgery are intended to correct the eye's refractive error to reduce the need for other visual aids. "" "
What is refractive error?,"'In the human eye, the front surface (cornea) and ''lens'' inside the eye form the eye\'s ""focusing system"" and are primarily responsible for focusing incoming light rays onto the surface of the retina, much like the lenses of a camera focus light onto the film. In a perfect optical system, the power of the cornea and lens are perfectly matched with the length of the eye and images are in focus; any mismatch in this system is called a refractive error, and the result is a blurred image at some location. ' "
What are the primary types of refractive error?,"'There are three types of refractive errors:' Myopia (nearsightedness): In people with myopia, the mismatch in focusing power and eye length causes distant objects to be blurry and near objects to be clearer. Hyperopia (farsightedness): In people with hyperopia, the mismatch in focusing power and eye length causes near objects to be blurry and distant objects to be relatively clearer. Astigmatism: In people with astigmatism, either the corneal or lens shape is distorted, causing multiple images on the retina. This causes objects at all distances to appear blurry. Many people have a combination of either myopia or hyperopia with astigmatism."
What happens to vision when we age?,"'During our youth, the natural lens has the ability to change shape and power. This allows us to focus on close objects through a process of lens power change called accommodation. As we age, the natural lens becomes stiffer and loses the ability to change shape. This is termed ''presbyopia'', which is the loss of accommodation, and the need for reading glasses, bifocals, or other visual aids to facilitate near work.''LASIK cannot directly ""fix"" accommodation, but there are a variety of strategies that can be successful, including blended vision or monovision, in which one eye is corrected for better distance vision and one eye is corrected for better near vision.' "
Are there different types of LASIK?,"'There are a variety of different types of lasers used in ophthalmology. All LASIK procedures are performed with a specific type of laser (excimer laser), so in one sense, all LASIK procedures are similar. However, there are a variety of different laser manufacturers, including''Further, there are different types of laser ablations that can be performed (see below), including conventional laser treatments, wavefront-optimized treatments, and wavefront-guided treatments. Finally, a completely different type of laser (femtosecond laser) can be used instead of a mechanical microkeratome to create the LASIK (corneal) flap.' Visx, Wavelight, Alcon, Bausch & Lomb, and Nidek, among others, that have all designed specific excimer lasers."
What is conventional LASIK?,"""Conventional LASIK is the ablation pattern available on most lasers that treats directly based upon the patient's glasses prescription, with fixed treatment parameters for each patient. This type of ""'laser eye surgery'' is effective for most patients but can result in more visual aberrations such as glare, halos, and night vision issues than other forms of laser treatment. ' "
What is wavefront-optimized LASIK?,"""Wavefront-optimized LASIK is the type of laser eye surgery available on the Wavelight laser. This treatment is also based on the patient's glasses prescription, but also takes into account corneal curvature and thickness, and applies laser energy in a unique fashion in the periphery of the cornea. This laser has been found to reduce the aforementioned complications such as glare, halos, and other nighttime visual aberrations that can occasionally occur with conventional treatments."" "
What is wavefront-guided LASIK?,"""Wavefront-guided LASIK, also referred to as custom LASIK or wavefront LASIK, is similar to conventional LASIK, except that in addition to treating a patient's basic refractive error, specific alterations in a patient's eye (high order aberrations) can also be treated.""""In wavefront-guided LASIK, special mapping is performed prior to surgery to identify any small irregularities in the patient's optical system. When these irregularities are severe, they can affect vision quality, contrast sensitivity, and night vision. When significant irregularities in a patient's wavefront mapping are found, wavefront-guided LASIK can be used, and the treatment will be based on the wavefront-map generated."" "
What other types of refractive surgery are available?,"'Other types of refractive surgery are available and may be more appropriate than LASIK for certain individuals.''Advanced surface ablation'': There are a variety of other techniques that utilize the excimer laser to reshape the cornea in much the same way as LASIK, but without the creation of a corneal flap. These are generically termed advanced surface ablation (ASA) and include ''photorefractive keratectomy'' (PRK), laser subepithelial keratomileusis (''LASEK''), and epipolis laser in situ keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK). All of these techniques involve first removing the most superficial corneal layer (epithelium) and then performing excimer laser ablation.''Phakic intraocular lenses'': For patients with extreme myopia, LASIK and advanced surface ablation are not reasonable options. In these cases, a phakic ''intraocular lens'' may be used. This lens is implanted inside the eye and can effectively treat nearsightedness up to -20 diopters.''Conductive keratoplasty'': Conductive keratoplasty (CK) is a technique that can be used for the temporary correction of hyperopia or ''presbyopia''. CK involves using radiofrequency waves in the peripheral cornea to cause peripheral corneal shrinkage and central steepening. This procedure is very safe, but its effect is often not long-lasting, and regression is common after a few years.''Intracorneal ring segments'': Intacs (Addition Technology, Inc.) are approved for the correction of low myopia and for patients with ''keratoconus'' in the U.S. Intacs are micro-thin ''plastic'' segments that are implanted into the peripheral cornea in order to flatten the cornea centrally. Once implanted, the rings generally cannot be felt by the patient. These rings can be removed, and their effect is usually completely reversible. They are only able to correct up to -3 diopters of myopia, and visual recovery is generally slower and less predictable than LASIK.' "
Am I a good candidate for LASIK eye surgery?,"'Refractive surgery is not for everyone. In addition to having a complete eye exam to find out if you are a candidate for surgery, there are certain questions you should ask yourself before considering LASIK or other refractive procedures.' Am I willing to accept a low but real risk of surgical complications? Even though modern LASIK is extremely safe with rare complications, there are still times when unavoidable complications occur that can negatively affect your vision. Does my career allow me to have LASIK? Although there are now very few organizations that prohibit their employees or members to have refractive surgery, if there is any doubt, then it is important to ask your employer, professional society, or military service whether or not it is allowed for you to undergo refractive surgery. Has my vision been stable long enough to have LASIK? While minor changes in your prescription are not uncommon from year to year, if your prescription continues to get progressively stronger (for example, more myopic, more hyperopic, or more astigmatism) each year, then you may not yet be a good candidate for refractive surgery. Do I have any health conditions that make me a poor surgical candidate? Certain advanced autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, may influence postoperative healing. Do my recreational activities make me a bad surgical candidate? There is a lifelong risk of LASIK flap dislocation if there is significant trauma to the eye, so people who participate in contact sports such as boxing, martial arts, or wrestling are not likely not be a good LASIK candidate. In these instances, other refractive procedures, especially surface ablation, may be more appropriate choices. Am I too young or too old to have LASIK? There are no hard and fast rules about the appropriate age to have LASIK. However, patients under age 18 are rarely stable enough for LASIK, and older patients may begin to develop cataracts or other eye health issues that preclude them from undergoing LASIK. Again, the best way to determine these things is to have a complete eye exam. Do I have keratoconus? Keratoconus is a corneal disease resulting from decreased corneal strength that can be detected as an abnormal curvature on testing. Patients that have evidence of keratoconus are not candidates for LASIK or surface ablation, but new technologies may become available for these individuals."
What is my doctor looking for during my evaluation?,"'Your eye doctor should look for risk factors prior to surgery that may make you a less than ideal candidate for surgery and discuss any abnormal findings with you at length. The following are considered to be risk factors for refractive surgery.'  High prescriptions: Patients with extreme eyeglass prescriptions (high myopia or high hyperopia) may not be good candidates for LASIK because too much corneal tissue would need to be removed to safely perform the procedure. Thin corneas: Because all excimer laser surgery (LASIK and surface ablation) requires the removal of small amounts of corneal tissue to correct your refractive error, the thickness of your corneas must be measured before surgery. Patients who have very thin corneas are at risk for excessive corneal weakening after surgery and may not be good candidates for LASIK. In these cases, surface ablation or other procedures may be more appropriate. Abnormal corneal curvature: There are many devices used today to measure the overall shape and curvature of your cornea. These devices are called topographers and are an essential part of your initial evaluation. Abnormalities in the shape and curvature of your cornea may indicate that your cornea is weaker than that of the average person, and this will exclude you from having LASIK safely. Dry eyes: Patients with dry eye symptoms, such as burning, redness, and tearing may have worse symptoms after LASIK surgery. This occurs because corneal nerves are cut during this procedure, and these nerves are partly responsible for stimulating tear secretion. Most patients have a full return back to their baseline state after surgery; however, patients with significant dry eye before surgery may not be appropriate surgical candidates Large pupils: Although less common today, some patients still notice glare, halos, or other night vision issues after LASIK. Patients with larger pupils may be more prone to noticing these things, so your screening evaluation should include measurement of your pupil size in a dark room. Previous refractive surgery: Prior corneal surgery or other types of refractive surgery, especially radial keratotomy (RK), may complicate additional procedures. You should talk to your eye doctor about this situation in order to make the best decision possible about your ability to be corrected with further surgery."
What are the risks of LASIK?,"'LASIK has been shown to be a very effective procedure, and most patients are very happy with their vision following the procedure. However, like any surgical procedure, LASIK does come with some risks. In order for you to decide whether LASIK surgery is right for you, you need to be aware of potential risks and complications and weigh these carefully before proceeding with surgery.'  You may be over-corrected or under-corrected. Most patients are satisfied with their vision after a single treatment, but in some cases, you may not achieve quality vision initially and need a second surgery, called an enhancement, to sharpen your vision. Patients with more extreme prescriptions are at higher risk for needing an enhancement. This enhancement cannot be performed for many months after your initial surgery to allow for your eyes to heal appropriately from the first surgery and for your eyeglass prescription to stabilize. In some rare cases, you may not be able to have an enhancement if your corneas are too thin or abnormally shaped after surgery. You may still need glasses or contact lenses after surgery to achieve your best vision. This is extremely rare for the average person; however, it is something you should discuss with your surgeon. In addition, if both of your eyes are corrected for good distance vision, you will still need glasses for close work when presbyopia develops as a part of normal aging process. Your results may not be permanent. Although uncommon, some patients do experience a regression of their desired treatment effect many years after the surgery. This is more common in patients with hyperopia, or farsightedness. Those who need reading glasses are especially prone to having changes in their vision after LASIK surgery. If regression does occur, it may be possible for you to have an additional surgery many years after your initial LASIK. You may experience visual aberrations, especially in low light. Visual effects that can occur with LASIK and decrease visual quality include: anisometropia (difference in refractive power between the two eyes), aniseikonia (difference in image size between the two eyes), double vision, hazy vision, fluctuating vision during the day and from day to day, increased sensitivity to light, glare, shadows, and seeing halos around lights. These visual aberrations are extremely unusual; however, they may be incapacitating for some time and may not ever go away completely. Dry eye symptoms may persist or get worse. Most people experience some dry-eye symptoms immediately after surgery. In some cases, people may develop worsening of dry-eye symptoms, such as burning and redness, or even decreased vision, after surgery. This condition is occasionally permanent and may require medication to improve tear production or punctal plugs, which temporarily close off the drainage system for tears. You may lose vision. Rarely, LASIK may result in worse vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. This could result from flap-related complications, equipment malfunction, infection, scarring, or extreme changes in corneal shape postoperatively."
How do I find the right doctor?,"'If you are considering refractive surgery, it is imperative that you compare all the different variables that go into your surgery. The overall success of your procedure will depend on the type of surgery you are considering, the type of instruments or lasers that are used for that particular surgery, and the level of experience of your surgeon. You should not base your decision solely on how much the procedure costs, and you should compare different eye centers and eye doctors before coming to a decision. Refractive surgery is permanent and will affect your vision for the rest of your life, so you need to carefully consider all of your options. The following are some specific things for you to consider:' Beware of ""guarantees."" Be cautious of eye centers that advertise guarantees on refractive surgeries, including ""lifetime"" guarantees, ""20/20 or free,"" or ""perfect vision."" Remember that there are never any guarantees with surgery. Know your surgeon. Make sure that the surgeon you choose has appropriate training and a good reputation in the community. You should ask your eye doctor to discuss his or her outcomes and compare them to the results of the studies that are printed in the device manufacturer's handbook. It is also important to know that your surgeon will be available to you after surgery should you develop a complication that requires management. Know your surgical center. It is equally important to make sure that the center where you have your surgery is equipped with the latest technology, knowledgeable staff, and has a good reputation in the community. Become an educated consumer. Because this is an important decision, you should read as much information as possible. Ask your eye doctor to provide you with the patient education booklet from the device manufacturer. It is also important to have an in-depth discussion about the most appropriate procedure for your eyes, as this may vary from individual to individual."
What should I expect before surgery?,"'What you should expect before, surgery may vary slightly from patient to patient and from surgeon to surgeon; however, the information listed below is a general guideline for the LASIK process. Each patient may also have slightly different expectations, and it is important to talk to your eye doctor about these expectations before surgery.''Prior to any procedure, you will need a full eye examination by your eye doctor. This process will help determine if you are a good candidate for surgery and whether you have certain risk factors listed above. If you wear contact lenses, you should take them out for many days before your initial examination and use your glasses full-time. This is important because contact lenses will change the shape of your cornea, and if your cornea has not had enough time without the contact lenses, then the measurements taken before surgery may be inaccurate. You should discuss the amount of time you are required to be out of your contact lenses with the surgical center performing your evaluation.''During your initial examination, you should talk to your eye doctor about your past and present medical and ''eye conditions'', including any previous eye surgery or trauma. It is also important to discuss all medicines you are taking, including over the counter medicines, as these can sometimes affect your vision or surgery. Also be sure to mention any medication ''allergies'' you have.''Your doctor should discuss certain topics with you, including whether you are a good candidate for refractive surgery. He or she should discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery, and what you should expect before, during, and after the procedure. Your doctor should also explain what will be expected from you before, during, and following the surgery.''It is quite important that you ask questions during this examination, and ideally you should already have the questions you want answered in mind before your examination. You will need to think about all of the risks and benefits and take time to review handouts that are provided to you by your doctor. After you have had plenty of time to think about these issues and had all of your questions answered, you will need to sign an informed consent form. It is not recommended to have your initial evaluation and surgery performed on the same day, as this does not give you enough time to fully contemplate your decision. It is also not ideal to first meet your LASIK surgeon on the day of surgery, because this again does not give you ample time and opportunity to ask the questions only your surgeon can answer before your procedure.''On the day of the surgery, you will need to avoid using all lotions, creams, ''makeup'', and perfumes. Some of these items build up on the eyelashes and may increase your risk of infection, while others (lotions and perfumes) can affect the function of the laser. In an effort to clean your ''eyelid'' margin, your doctor may ask that you scrub your eyelids and lashes with a gentle soap that is safe for the eyes prior to surgery.''You will also need to arrange for transportation to and from the surgery center both on the day of surgery and for your first follow-up visit the following day. You will not be allowed to drive yourself home after surgery under any circumstances.'  "
What are the advantages of LASIK surgery?,"'In summary, despite the risks outlined above, LASIK has been proven to be safe and effective for most people. With careful patient screening and selection, reasonable expectations, and in the care of an experienced surgeon, most patients will be very pleased with their results. These are some of the other advantages of LASIK:' LASIK is able to accurately correct most levels of myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. The procedure is fast, usually lasting only five to 10 minutes, and is generally painless. Because the laser is guided by a computer, it is very precise and results are very accurate. In most cases, a single treatment will achieve the desired outcome; however, enhancements are possible if needed, even many years after the initial surgery."
What are the disadvantages of LASIK surgery?," Because each patient will heal slightly differently, results may vary from patient to patient. LASIK could make some aspects of your vision worse, including night vision with glare and halos. LASIK may make dry-eye symptoms worse in certain individuals. In rare circumstances, LASIK can make your vision worse and not correctable with regular glasses or contact lenses."

What should I expect during surgery?,"'LASIK eye surgery normally takes less than 30 minutes to perform surgery on both eyes. You will be taken to the surgical suite and placed into a reclining chair or bed where you will lie on your back. The laser system consists of a microscope that is attached to a large machine and a computer screen.''After you are lying down and have been positioned underneath the laser, numbing eye drops will be placed in your eyes, and the area around your eyes will be cleaned thoroughly. After your surgical team, including your LASIK surgeons and assistants, have reviewed and confirmed all of your treatment information, a lid speculum will be placed to keep your eyelids open during the surgery. When it is time to create the LASIK flap, a suction device will be placed on your eye that will fixate it. During this period, you may feel pressure that may be somewhat uncomfortable, and your vision will go dark for a brief period of time. Your doctor will then use the microkeratome to create the corneal flap. After the flap has been created, the microkeratome will be removed, the suction will be off, and your vision will return, although it will likely remain blurry for the remainder of the procedure.''Your doctor will then carefully move the flap in order to expose the underlying corneal tissue. Any excess moisture on the tissue will be dried, and your underlying corneal thickness will be measured. The laser apparatus will then be positioned over your eye. Your doctor will ask you to stare directly at the light. It should be noted that the light you are staring at is not the laser that is being used for the surgery and may have different colors based on the specific laser being used for your treatment. This light is simply used so that your eye will remain in a fixed position.''The laser will be started by your doctor once your eye is in a satisfactory position. Do not be alarmed if you notice ticking sounds and new smells during this part of the procedure. The ticking sound is the sound of the laser pulses and the smell, which has been described by some as that of burning hair, is the evaporation of fluid from your cornea during laser ablation. The amount of laser treatment time varies among patients but is usually less than 60 seconds. After the appropriate amount of corneal tissue has been ablated by the laser, the corneal flap is gently placed back down into its original position.''To protect your eye, a shield will be placed around your eye. This is to prevent you from accidentally rubbing your eye or putting any pressure onto your eye. Your cornea is especially vulnerable in this early postoperative period, which is why it is very important to keep your eye protected. If you are having both eyes treated during the same surgery, the surgeon will reposition the laser over your other eye and the same process will be repeated for the second eye.' "
What should I expect after surgery?,"'As soon as the procedure is finished, you may notice that your eyes feel irritated, ''burn'', ''itch'', or feel like there is something in them. Your eyes will frequently water or tear excessively, and your vision will be somewhat blurry. The most important thing to avoid during this time is rubbing your eyes. Do not rub your eyes under any circumstances, as rubbing can dislocate or shift the corneal flap, which could require you to have an additional procedure to reposition it. Using copious artificial tears and resting with your eyes closed will most effectively ease these sensations. In some instances, there may be increased discomfort or even a mild degree of ''pain'', for which your doctor may advise you to take a ''pain reliever''. In most cases, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', such as ''ibuprofen'', are enough to relieve the ''pain''. In addition to artificial tears, you will have antibiotic drops and anti-inflammatory drops (steroids) to use beginning on the day of surgery that you will continue to use for days to weeks after surgery.''Other symptoms you may notice immediately after surgery include light sensitivity, hazy vision, glare, seeing starbursts or halos around lights, and reddened or bloodshot eyes. All of these symptoms should improve over the first few days following surgery. It is very important that you contact your doctor immediately on the first night after surgery if you are having severe pain or if your vision is getting worse and not better. You do not need to wait until your first follow-up visit if you are experiencing either of these things.''Your first postoperative visit should be scheduled within the first 24 hours following surgery. At that visit, your doctor will check your vision and examine your eyes. You will continue to use your antibiotics and steroid drops as well as artificial tears. Your vision should be clearer but may still be blurry the first few days after surgery, and you may need to adjust your work or travel schedule or even take some time off after surgery to fully recuperate.''You should ask your doctor how long you need to wait to start participating in sports again, such as ''walking'' or jogging. In general, you should wait anywhere from one to three days following surgery to restart low impact sports, and avoid any possible eye trauma, such as more competitive sports, for a minimum of 2 or more weeks. In addition, it is unwise to expose yourself to eye infection risks such as pools, lakes, or hot tubs during the early healing process. Your surgeon will tell you when you can resume these activities.''As mentioned earlier, lotions, creams, makeup, and perfumes can often cause buildup on the eyelids and may increase the risk for infection. Ask your doctor when it is advisable to resume use of these products.''Typically, your vision will stabilize within the first week or two, but it may continue to change over the first couple of months following surgery. It may take anywhere from 3-6 months for your vision to stabilize completely. Other visual symptoms, such as glare, seeing halos, and difficulty driving at night, may continue during this stabilization period. Additional treatments, or enhancements, may be needed after surgery, but the stability of your cornea will need to be established before any repeat treatments are performed. Before enhancements are considered, you should have had consistent eye measurements at two consecutive visits. When considering additional treatments, you should know that while it is likely that your vision can be improved by enhancements, just as with the initial surgery, there are no guarantees, and there are still risks associated with having surgery.''You should not hesitate to call your eye doctor immediately if you develop worsening or unusual symptoms at any time after surgery. These symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem that could result in ''loss of vision'' if not treated properly in a timely fashion.' "
What is LASIK eye surgery?,"'LASIK'' stands for Laser in Situ Keratomileusis, which means using a laser underneath a corneal flap (in situ) to reshape the ''cornea'' (keratomileusis). This procedure utilizes a highly specialized laser (excimer laser) designed to treat refractive errors, improve vision, and reduce or eliminate the need for glasses or ''contact lenses''. This laser procedure alters the shape of the cornea, which is the transparent front covering of the eye. Though the excimer laser had been used for many years before, the development of LASIK is generally credited to Ioannis Pallikaris from Greece around 1991.'  "
How does LASIK work?,"'During the LASIK procedure, a specially trained eye surgeon first creates a precise, thin hinged corneal flap using a microkeratome. The surgeon then pulls back the flap to expose the underlying corneal tissue, and then the excimer laser ablates (reshapes) the cornea in a unique pre-specified pattern for each patient. The flap is then gently repositioned onto the underlying cornea without ''sutures''. ' "
How do glasses or contacts improve vision in people with refractive errors?,""" Glasses or contact lenses are used to compensate for the eye's refractive error by bending light rays in a way that complements the eye's specific refractive error. In contrast, LASIK and other forms of refractive surgery are intended to correct the eye's refractive error to reduce the need for other visual aids. "" "
What is refractive error?,"'In the human eye, the front surface (cornea) and ''lens'' inside the eye form the eye\'s ""focusing system"" and are primarily responsible for focusing incoming light rays onto the surface of the retina, much like the lenses of a camera focus light onto the film. In a perfect optical system, the power of the cornea and lens are perfectly matched with the length of the eye and images are in focus; any mismatch in this system is called a refractive error, and the result is a blurred image at some location. ' "
What are the primary types of refractive error?,"'There are three types of refractive errors:' Myopia (nearsightedness): In people with myopia, the mismatch in focusing power and eye length causes distant objects to be blurry and near objects to be clearer. Hyperopia (farsightedness): In people with hyperopia, the mismatch in focusing power and eye length causes near objects to be blurry and distant objects to be relatively clearer. Astigmatism: In people with astigmatism, either the corneal or lens shape is distorted, causing multiple images on the retina. This causes objects at all distances to appear blurry. Many people have a combination of either myopia or hyperopia with astigmatism."
What happens to vision when we age?,"'During our youth, the natural lens has the ability to change shape and power. This allows us to focus on close objects through a process of lens power change called accommodation. As we age, the natural lens becomes stiffer and loses the ability to change shape. This is termed ''presbyopia'', which is the loss of accommodation, and the need for reading glasses, bifocals, or other visual aids to facilitate near work.''LASIK cannot directly ""fix"" accommodation, but there are a variety of strategies that can be successful, including blended vision or monovision, in which one eye is corrected for better distance vision and one eye is corrected for better near vision.' "
Are there different types of LASIK?,"'There are a variety of different types of lasers used in ophthalmology. All LASIK procedures are performed with a specific type of laser (excimer laser), so in one sense, all LASIK procedures are similar. However, there are a variety of different laser manufacturers, including''Further, there are different types of laser ablations that can be performed (see below), including conventional laser treatments, wavefront-optimized treatments, and wavefront-guided treatments. Finally, a completely different type of laser (femtosecond laser) can be used instead of a mechanical microkeratome to create the LASIK (corneal) flap.' Visx, Wavelight, Alcon, Bausch & Lomb, and Nidek, among others, that have all designed specific excimer lasers."
What is conventional LASIK?,"""Conventional LASIK is the ablation pattern available on most lasers that treats directly based upon the patient's glasses prescription, with fixed treatment parameters for each patient. This type of ""'laser eye surgery'' is effective for most patients but can result in more visual aberrations such as glare, halos, and night vision issues than other forms of laser treatment. ' "
What is wavefront-optimized LASIK?,"""Wavefront-optimized LASIK is the type of laser eye surgery available on the Wavelight laser. This treatment is also based on the patient's glasses prescription, but also takes into account corneal curvature and thickness, and applies laser energy in a unique fashion in the periphery of the cornea. This laser has been found to reduce the aforementioned complications such as glare, halos, and other nighttime visual aberrations that can occasionally occur with conventional treatments."" "
What is wavefront-guided LASIK?,"""Wavefront-guided LASIK, also referred to as custom LASIK or wavefront LASIK, is similar to conventional LASIK, except that in addition to treating a patient's basic refractive error, specific alterations in a patient's eye (high order aberrations) can also be treated.""""In wavefront-guided LASIK, special mapping is performed prior to surgery to identify any small irregularities in the patient's optical system. When these irregularities are severe, they can affect vision quality, contrast sensitivity, and night vision. When significant irregularities in a patient's wavefront mapping are found, wavefront-guided LASIK can be used, and the treatment will be based on the wavefront-map generated."" "
What other types of refractive surgery are available?,"'Other types of refractive surgery are available and may be more appropriate than LASIK for certain individuals.''Advanced surface ablation'': There are a variety of other techniques that utilize the excimer laser to reshape the cornea in much the same way as LASIK, but without the creation of a corneal flap.

Visual effects that can occur with LASIK and decrease visual quality include: anisometropia (difference in refractive power between the two eyes), aniseikonia (difference in image size between the two eyes), double vision, hazy vision, fluctuating vision during the day and from day to day, increased sensitivity to light, glare, shadows, and seeing halos around lights. These visual aberrations are extremely unusual; however, they may be incapacitating for some time and may not ever go away completely. Dry eye symptoms may persist or get worse. Most people experience some dry-eye symptoms immediately after surgery. In some cases, people may develop worsening of dry-eye symptoms, such as burning and redness, or even decreased vision, after surgery. This condition is occasionally permanent and may require medication to improve tear production or punctal plugs, which temporarily close off the drainage system for tears. You may lose vision. Rarely, LASIK may result in worse vision that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. This could result from flap-related complications, equipment malfunction, infection, scarring, or extreme changes in corneal shape postoperatively."
How do I find the right doctor?,"'If you are considering refractive surgery, it is imperative that you compare all the different variables that go into your surgery. The overall success of your procedure will depend on the type of surgery you are considering, the type of instruments or lasers that are used for that particular surgery, and the level of experience of your surgeon. You should not base your decision solely on how much the procedure costs, and you should compare different eye centers and eye doctors before coming to a decision. Refractive surgery is permanent and will affect your vision for the rest of your life, so you need to carefully consider all of your options. The following are some specific things for you to consider:' Beware of ""guarantees."" Be cautious of eye centers that advertise guarantees on refractive surgeries, including ""lifetime"" guarantees, ""20/20 or free,"" or ""perfect vision."" Remember that there are never any guarantees with surgery. Know your surgeon. Make sure that the surgeon you choose has appropriate training and a good reputation in the community. You should ask your eye doctor to discuss his or her outcomes and compare them to the results of the studies that are printed in the device manufacturer's handbook. It is also important to know that your surgeon will be available to you after surgery should you develop a complication that requires management. Know your surgical center. It is equally important to make sure that the center where you have your surgery is equipped with the latest technology, knowledgeable staff, and has a good reputation in the community. Become an educated consumer. Because this is an important decision, you should read as much information as possible. Ask your eye doctor to provide you with the patient education booklet from the device manufacturer. It is also important to have an in-depth discussion about the most appropriate procedure for your eyes, as this may vary from individual to individual."
What should I expect before surgery?,"'What you should expect before, surgery may vary slightly from patient to patient and from surgeon to surgeon; however, the information listed below is a general guideline for the LASIK process. Each patient may also have slightly different expectations, and it is important to talk to your eye doctor about these expectations before surgery.''Prior to any procedure, you will need a full eye examination by your eye doctor. This process will help determine if you are a good candidate for surgery and whether you have certain risk factors listed above. If you wear contact lenses, you should take them out for many days before your initial examination and use your glasses full-time. This is important because contact lenses will change the shape of your cornea, and if your cornea has not had enough time without the contact lenses, then the measurements taken before surgery may be inaccurate. You should discuss the amount of time you are required to be out of your contact lenses with the surgical center performing your evaluation.''During your initial examination, you should talk to your eye doctor about your past and present medical and ''eye conditions'', including any previous eye surgery or trauma. It is also important to discuss all medicines you are taking, including over the counter medicines, as these can sometimes affect your vision or surgery. Also be sure to mention any medication ''allergies'' you have.''Your doctor should discuss certain topics with you, including whether you are a good candidate for refractive surgery. He or she should discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery, and what you should expect before, during, and after the procedure. Your doctor should also explain what will be expected from you before, during, and following the surgery.''It is quite important that you ask questions during this examination, and ideally you should already have the questions you want answered in mind before your examination. You will need to think about all of the risks and benefits and take time to review handouts that are provided to you by your doctor. After you have had plenty of time to think about these issues and had all of your questions answered, you will need to sign an informed consent form. It is not recommended to have your initial evaluation and surgery performed on the same day, as this does not give you enough time to fully contemplate your decision. It is also not ideal to first meet your LASIK surgeon on the day of surgery, because this again does not give you ample time and opportunity to ask the questions only your surgeon can answer before your procedure.''On the day of the surgery, you will need to avoid using all lotions, creams, ''makeup'', and perfumes. Some of these items build up on the eyelashes and may increase your risk of infection, while others (lotions and perfumes) can affect the function of the laser. In an effort to clean your ''eyelid'' margin, your doctor may ask that you scrub your eyelids and lashes with a gentle soap that is safe for the eyes prior to surgery.''You will also need to arrange for transportation to and from the surgery center both on the day of surgery and for your first follow-up visit the following day. You will not be allowed to drive yourself home after surgery under any circumstances.'  "
What are the advantages of LASIK surgery?,"'In summary, despite the risks outlined above, LASIK has been proven to be safe and effective for most people. With careful patient screening and selection, reasonable expectations, and in the care of an experienced surgeon, most patients will be very pleased with their results. These are some of the other advantages of LASIK:' LASIK is able to accurately correct most levels of myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. The procedure is fast, usually lasting only five to 10 minutes, and is generally painless. Because the laser is guided by a computer, it is very precise and results are very accurate. In most cases, a single treatment will achieve the desired outcome; however, enhancements are possible if needed, even many years after the initial surgery."
What are the disadvantages of LASIK surgery?," Because each patient will heal slightly differently, results may vary from patient to patient. LASIK could make some aspects of your vision worse, including night vision with glare and halos. LASIK may make dry-eye symptoms worse in certain individuals. In rare circumstances, LASIK can make your vision worse and not correctable with regular glasses or contact lenses."

What should I expect during surgery?,"'LASIK eye surgery normally takes less than 30 minutes to perform surgery on both eyes. You will be taken to the surgical suite and placed into a reclining chair or bed where you will lie on your back. The laser system consists of a microscope that is attached to a large machine and a computer screen.''After you are lying down and have been positioned underneath the laser, numbing eye drops will be placed in your eyes, and the area around your eyes will be cleaned thoroughly. After your surgical team, including your LASIK surgeons and assistants, have reviewed and confirmed all of your treatment information, a lid speculum will be placed to keep your eyelids open during the surgery. When it is time to create the LASIK flap, a suction device will be placed on your eye that will fixate it. During this period, you may feel pressure that may be somewhat uncomfortable, and your vision will go dark for a brief period of time. Your doctor will then use the microkeratome to create the corneal flap. After the flap has been created, the microkeratome will be removed, the suction will be off, and your vision will return, although it will likely remain blurry for the remainder of the procedure.''Your doctor will then carefully move the flap in order to expose the underlying corneal tissue. Any excess moisture on the tissue will be dried, and your underlying corneal thickness will be measured. The laser apparatus will then be positioned over your eye. Your doctor will ask you to stare directly at the light. It should be noted that the light you are staring at is not the laser that is being used for the surgery and may have different colors based on the specific laser being used for your treatment. This light is simply used so that your eye will remain in a fixed position.''The laser will be started by your doctor once your eye is in a satisfactory position. Do not be alarmed if you notice ticking sounds and new smells during this part of the procedure. The ticking sound is the sound of the laser pulses and the smell, which has been described by some as that of burning hair, is the evaporation of fluid from your cornea during laser ablation. The amount of laser treatment time varies among patients but is usually less than 60 seconds. After the appropriate amount of corneal tissue has been ablated by the laser, the corneal flap is gently placed back down into its original position.''To protect your eye, a shield will be placed around your eye. This is to prevent you from accidentally rubbing your eye or putting any pressure onto your eye. Your cornea is especially vulnerable in this early postoperative period, which is why it is very important to keep your eye protected. If you are having both eyes treated during the same surgery, the surgeon will reposition the laser over your other eye and the same process will be repeated for the second eye.' "
What should I expect after surgery?,"'As soon as the procedure is finished, you may notice that your eyes feel irritated, ''burn'', ''itch'', or feel like there is something in them. Your eyes will frequently water or tear excessively, and your vision will be somewhat blurry. The most important thing to avoid during this time is rubbing your eyes. Do not rub your eyes under any circumstances, as rubbing can dislocate or shift the corneal flap, which could require you to have an additional procedure to reposition it. Using copious artificial tears and resting with your eyes closed will most effectively ease these sensations. In some instances, there may be increased discomfort or even a mild degree of ''pain'', for which your doctor may advise you to take a ''pain reliever''. In most cases, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', such as ''ibuprofen'', are enough to relieve the ''pain''. In addition to artificial tears, you will have antibiotic drops and anti-inflammatory drops (steroids) to use beginning on the day of surgery that you will continue to use for days to weeks after surgery.''Other symptoms you may notice immediately after surgery include light sensitivity, hazy vision, glare, seeing starbursts or halos around lights, and reddened or bloodshot eyes. All of these symptoms should improve over the first few days following surgery. It is very important that you contact your doctor immediately on the first night after surgery if you are having severe pain or if your vision is getting worse and not better. You do not need to wait until your first follow-up visit if you are experiencing either of these things.''Your first postoperative visit should be scheduled within the first 24 hours following surgery. At that visit, your doctor will check your vision and examine your eyes. You will continue to use your antibiotics and steroid drops as well as artificial tears. Your vision should be clearer but may still be blurry the first few days after surgery, and you may need to adjust your work or travel schedule or even take some time off after surgery to fully recuperate.''You should ask your doctor how long you need to wait to start participating in sports again, such as ''walking'' or jogging. In general, you should wait anywhere from one to three days following surgery to restart low impact sports, and avoid any possible eye trauma, such as more competitive sports, for a minimum of 2 or more weeks. In addition, it is unwise to expose yourself to eye infection risks such as pools, lakes, or hot tubs during the early healing process. Your surgeon will tell you when you can resume these activities.''As mentioned earlier, lotions, creams, makeup, and perfumes can often cause buildup on the eyelids and may increase the risk for infection. Ask your doctor when it is advisable to resume use of these products.''Typically, your vision will stabilize within the first week or two, but it may continue to change over the first couple of months following surgery. It may take anywhere from 3-6 months for your vision to stabilize completely. Other visual symptoms, such as glare, seeing halos, and difficulty driving at night, may continue during this stabilization period. Additional treatments, or enhancements, may be needed after surgery, but the stability of your cornea will need to be established before any repeat treatments are performed. Before enhancements are considered, you should have had consistent eye measurements at two consecutive visits. When considering additional treatments, you should know that while it is likely that your vision can be improved by enhancements, just as with the initial surgery, there are no guarantees, and there are still risks associated with having surgery.''You should not hesitate to call your eye doctor immediately if you develop worsening or unusual symptoms at any time after surgery. These symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem that could result in ''loss of vision'' if not treated properly in a timely fashion.' "
What is Lassa fever?,"'Lassa fever is an illness caused by Lassa virus, a single-stranded RNA hemorrhagic fever virus from the family ''Arenaviridae''. It is an acute febrile viral illness lasting one to four weeks, and it occurs in West Africa and some areas beyond.' "
What is the history of Lassa fever?,"'Lassa fever was first described in the 1950s, and the viral particle was identified in 1969 from three missionary nurses who died in Lassa, Nigeria, after caring for an infected obstetrical patient. Lassa fever is one of the hemorrhagic fever ''viruses'', occurring in West Africa sub-regions in similar areas as ''Ebola'' virus. Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, and Nigeria are most often affected. Surrounding regions are also at risk, because the rodents that transmit the virus are very common throughout West through East Africa. There are 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever each year in the world. Lassa fever heavily impacts Sierra Leone and Liberia in particular, where it causes an estimated 5,000 deaths and about 10%-16% of admissions to hospitals each year. Deaths are especially common in children. Case fatality is 1% in general (compared to 70% in ''Ebola virus''). Severe cases have a case fatality of 15%.''An unusually intense outbreak developed in early 2018 in Nigeria with over 300 confirmed positive cases reported in the month of March. Cases were reported in Bauchi, Plateau, Edo, Ondo, and Ebonyi States. Sixteen health workers, at least four of whom died, were diagnosed as of Mar. 4, 2018. Along with high numbers, case fatality rates for this outbreak exceeded 20%. A ''Weekly Epidemiological Report'' has been maintained by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.''Nigerian Minister of Health, Professor Isaac Adewale, announced that ''vaccine'' against Lassa virus would be arriving by the end of 2018. Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, CEO of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, has stressed the important advances of improved awareness and expanded ability to test for Lassa fever virus in recent years. Dr. Ihekweazu has encouraged improved adherence to infection ''prevention'' measures and community sanitation efforts to control current and future outbreaks of Lassa fever. Lassa fever has rarely been diagnosed in the U.S. There have been only six diagnosed cases since 1969. The last case was diagnosed in May 2015, in New Jersey in a patient traveling from Liberia. U.S. cases have involved international ''travelers'' or immigrants who arrived with the infection after exposure to rodents in West Africa.''Among the scientists who have studied hemorrhagic fever viruses, Dr. Susan P. Fisher-Hoch, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Texas School of Public Health, worked extensively with Lassa virus, conducting primate studies and investigating several outbreaks in Nigeria while working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While Deputy Branch Chief of the CDC Special Pathogens Laboratory, Division of Viral Diseases, she supervised the Sierra Leone Lassa Fever Research Unit and published major research articles on Lassa fever ''vaccines'' and other hemorrhagic ''fevers''. Many students of epidemiology (the study of how diseases spread) are familiar with the story of her work with her husband, Dr. Joe McCormick, whom she married while he was Chief, Special Pathogens Laboratory, Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC. Dr. Fisher-Hoch was elected to the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2008 for her extraordinary contributions to science and medicine.' "
What are causes and risk factors for Lassa fever?,"'Lassa fever virus is mainly a zoonosis (a disease that is animal-borne or spread to humans from animals). It is spread to people through contact with household items, food, water, or air contaminated with the droppings or urine of infected multimammate rats (''Mastomyces natalensis''). These rodents live throughout West Africa in homes, and they can shed this virus without being ill. People most often become infected by inhaling air contaminated with aerosols of rodent excretions, swallowing the virus in food or contaminated utensils, preparing and eating multimammate rats (meat of wild or non-domesticated animals, called bush meat or wild meat, is often prized as a delicacy), and contact with open wounds. Lassa fever virus is believed to be endemic (always present) in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria. It has also been detected in Ivory Coast, Benin, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Gambia, and Central African Republic. Reporting of cases is not consistent, and the rats are present throughout West, Central, and East Africa, so cases are possible throughout these areas.''Travelers'' to West Africa staying in homes or areas of poor sanitation or crowding, as well as health care and laboratory professionals serving in health care facilities in West Africa, are most at risk. Infection prevention methods are critical to reducing infection of health care workers and spread within health facilities.''Those at highest risk for serious complications and death are ''pregnant'' women in their ''third trimester''. ''Stillbirth'' or fetal loss occurs in 95% of ''pregnancies''.' "
"Is Lassa fever contagious? If so, what is the contagious period for Lassa fever?","'Person-to-person spread is possible but is not as frequent as with ''Ebola virus''. It can rarely occur upon direct contact with saliva, blood, and bodily fluids and mucous membrane or sexual contact. Casual contact of intact skin with intact skin does not transmit the virus. Laboratory workers and health care professionals can become infected through improper infection-control precautions, and patients in rural hospitals have acquired it through reuse of disposable needles.''No person-to-person spread has been documented in the U.S. from returning ''travelers''..''It is not clear when infected humans are ''contagious'' or for how long they are contagious. The presence of virus in the blood is known to peak four to nine days after symptoms begin. The virus can be transmitted in semen for up to three months.''Lassa fever is one of the hemorrhagic ''fevers'' and may appear with signs and symptoms like ''Ebola'' or Marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses, and until these viruses are ruled out, suspected cases must be managed with infection control precautions to prevent contact with blood, body fluids, and contaminated surfaces. These include basic hand washing or ''alcohol''-based sanitizing between patients. When working within 3 ''feet'' of an affected patient, use of additional barrier personal protective equipment should include an impermeable long-sleeved gown, gloves, and face mask with eye protection. Safe injection practices, safe laboratory handling, and safe mortuary procedures are also important.' "
When is Lassa fever no longer contagious?,"'It is not clear when infected humans are contagious or for how long, but the virus is cleared from the blood during recovery about three weeks after onset of symptoms.' "
What is the incubation period for Lassa fever?,"'The incubation period for Lassa fever is variable, from six days to three weeks. Most people have mild or no symptoms. British researchers suggest the incubation period varies from seven to 10 days and in some people, up to about 21 days.' "
What are Lassa fever symptoms and signs?,"'In those who have symptoms, Lassa fever begins with a ''flu-like'' illness:''Hemorrhage is not common in less serious disease, but the loss of fluid from blood vessels into tissue may occur; this causes facial swelling, reddened whites of the eyes, and fluid around the\xa0''lungs'' and ''heart''.''Dry ''cough'' and respiratory distress may occur if illness involves ''fluid in the lungs''.''Severe disease may cause ''encephalitis'' with ''confusion'', ''tremors'', ''seizures'', and ''coma''.''Organ failure and ''shock'' are often end-stage events.''Fair-skinned individuals may have a faint ''rash'' of the upper body that is not seen in dark-skinned individuals.''Some bleeding from mucous membranes occurs in severe illness.''Lassa virus infects all tissues, but infection of the ''liver'' is especially typical.''Hepatitis'' may be mild or severe, and laboratory tests may not reflect the level of injury.''Lassa fever virus often causes deafness, and this complication may be noted in late-stage disease and during recovery periods.'  fever, malaise, generalized weakness, sore throat (very similar to strep throat and without runny nose), severe headache, chest pain (especially behind the breastbone), back pain, ringing ears,  nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. "
How do physicians diagnose Lassa fever?,"'Without laboratory tests, Lassa fever is difficult to differentiate from other infections common to West Africa; however, this requires specialized laboratories and precautions for handling specimens.' Laboratory tests include enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assays (ELISA) for Lassa IgM and IgG antibodies and Lassa antigen. For definitive testing, virus can be grown in culture in seven to 10 days; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is also available but often limited to research. Immunohistochemistry stains performed on tissue specimens can also be used to make a postmortem diagnosis."
What is the treatment for Lassa fever?,"'Ribavirin'' given intravenously and early in the course of illness is an effective treatment, in addition to support of fluid and ''electrolytes'', oxygenation, and ''blood pressure''. In the only study to evaluate it in 1986, this treatment reduced mortality from 50% to 5% if given early in serious illness. Adverse effects include hemolytic ''anemia'' (rupture of ''red blood cells'') if infused too quickly.' "
What are complications for Lassa fever?,"'Other than acute illness, the most common complication or after-effect of Lassa fever is ''hearing loss'', which has been observed during recovery in 20%-30% of cases. Because most Lassa fever viral infections cause no symptoms, and because people with acute deafness have been shown to have high antibody levels to Lassa virus, suggesting recent infection, Lassa fever virus is believed to be a common cause of sudden deafness in affected areas.''Pregnant'' women, especially in the ''third trimester'', are at risk for serious disease. Spontaneous abortion occurs in 95% of infections with Lassa fever.' "
What is the prognosis of Lassa fever?,"'Prognosis of Lassa fever is generally good, considering that many individuals in affected areas have antibodies to Lassa fever and do not recall illness. Most illness is mild and does not require hospitalization. Of those hospitalized from the community with Lassa fever, up to 15% die. Mortality may be up to 65% in cases of hospital-associated transmission, perhaps because patients do not seek or receive correct treatment until late into illness.' "
Is it possible to prevent Lassa fever? Is there a vaccine for Lassa fever?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' available as yet against Lassa fever. In light of the especially severe 2018 outbreak, the World Health Organization and several global public health entities are working to develop an effective vaccine.''Oral ''ribavirin'' given as prophylaxis or preventive treatment has been studied in a limited fashion during an outbreak, with no evidence of transmission; however, only 40% of the small number of participants completed treatment due to side effects from ribavirin that included ''weakness'', ''dizziness'', ''headache'', and ''nausea''.''There is no clear-cut data to support routine use of oral ribavirin as prophylaxis at this time, and suitable large trials have not been feasible, thus this use will have to rely on experience in the field over time.''The most important preventive methods against Lassa fever outbreaks is to eliminate rodent habitats by improving sanitation, safe food storage and preparation, and clean water access. The public must be taught about limiting consumption or safely preparing bush meat by careful use of gloves and thorough cooking. This measure also helps to prevent other hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, such as Ebola virus.''In health care facilities, suspected cases require strict infection control precautions to prevent contact with blood, body fluids, and contaminated surfaces around infected patients. Hand hygiene requires washing with soap and water and/or using alcohol-based sanitizer between patients. When working within 3 feet of a patient, barrier personal protective equipment should include an impermeable long-sleeved gown, gloves that cover the sleeves, and a face mask with eye protection from splashes. Safe injection practices require use of disposable rather than reusable needles. Similar personal protective measures are needed for safe laboratory handling and safe mortuary services.' "
What research is being done on Lassa fever?,"""Civil unrest and inadequate health care resources often has limited research on prevention and control of Lassa fever in West Africa. The Mano River Union Lassa Fever Network (MRU LFN) was established in 2004 to assist in developing national and regional surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention. This network includes local governments, the World Health Organization, Tulane University, the United Nations, the United States' Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).""'In 2010, Tulane University was awarded a five-year $15 million grant by the National Institute of Health toward developing prevention, treatments, and a vaccine for Lassa and other hemorrhagic fevers. The ''Viral Hemorrhagic Fever'' Consortium was established from this contract, and brings together Tulane, Scripps Research Institute, Broad Institute, Harvard University, University of California at San Diego, University of Texas Medical Branch, Autoimmune Technologies LLC, Corgenix Medical Corporation, Kenema Government Hospital in Nigeria, and Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. In 2017, the National Institutes of Health awarded Tulane University more than $12 million to test a promising drug against Lassa fever virus, as well as to develop a vaccine based on a recently discovered key antibody target on the surface of the virus.' "
Where can people find more information on Lassa fever?,'More information about Lassa fever may be found at the web sites for the World Health Organization (''http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/'') and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (''http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/lassa/index.html'').' 
What is tennis elbow?,"'Tennis elbow is inflammation of the tendon at the outer portion of the elbow, leading to ''pain''. Classically, tennis elbow is a strain injury to this tendon from hitting a backhand shot at tennis. The medical term for tennis elbow is ''lateral epicondylitis'' because it involves inflammation at the insertion point of the tendon at the outer portion of the humerus bone at the elbow joint (the epicondyle). Most people with lateral ''epicondylitis'' actually acquire it from activities other than playing tennis.''In contrast, when the tendon that attaches at the inner portion of the elbow is inflamed, the condition is referred to as medial epicondylitis (or ""golfer\'s elbow"" because golfers commonly injure this area after striking the ground to take a deep divot).' "
What causes tennis elbow?,"'A strain injury to the tendon at the outer portion of the elbow causes tennis elbow. While this can occur by straining during a backhand tennis shot, it can also occur from many repetitive activities that can strain the elbow. These activities include using a screwdriver or work that includes similar motions, Frisbee disc throwing, and lifting objects by extending the wrist, etc.'  "
"What are tennis 
elbow risk factors?","'Risks of tennis elbow include any activity that can strain the elbow joint. Such activities include tennis, falling onto the extended upper extremity, using a screwdriver when unaccustomed, casting a fishing net, etc.' "
What are symptoms of tennis elbow?,"'Symptoms of tennis elbow include dull pain and tenderness at the outer elbow. There can be elbow stiffness and a sensation of weakness. Typically with tennis elbow, people retain the full range of motion of the elbow and there is no significant swelling or discoloration. Holding a beverage cup or ''shaking hands'' can bring on the pain.'  "
How do physicians diagnose tennis elbow?,"'Physicians diagnose tennis elbow based on the history of outer ''elbow pain'' and tenderness often with recent repetitive-use injury. Tenderness at the outer elbow with normal range of motion of the elbow joint assures the diagnosis. Generally, no radiology testing is necessary. ''MRI'' scanning can illustrate inflammation of the outer elbow.' "
What is the treatment for tennis elbow?,"'Resting the elbow and employing measures to reduce the local inflammation are effective treatments for tennis elbow. ''Cold'' application several times daily and anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil''] or ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) can be helpful. Physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises for the elbow that are guided by therapists can be helpful for persisting pain and inflammation. For tennis elbow that is resistant to these measures, local ''cortisone injection'' can be beneficial. Rarely, surgical repair of the injured tendon is considered.'  "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for tennis elbow?,"'Tennis elbow most often has a complete recovery with conservative measures, particularly by resting the joint and avoiding reinjury.' "
Is it possible to prevent tennis elbow?,'Avoiding strain injury of the elbow joint can prevent tennis elbow. Tennis players can benefit by proper instruction in hitting techniques. Tennis elbow straps can be used to minimize the risk of injury to the elbow tendons.''Exercises that strengthen the involved muscles can be helpful to avoid a reoccurrence once symptoms have disappeared.' 
What is latex and where is it found?,"'Latex is a natural product which comes from the light milky fluid extracted from the rubber tree. This milky fluid is often modified during the manufacturing process to form a latex mixture. A person can be allergic to the latex or the mixture or both. Latex-containing products are many and varied (see the list below). Common household latex products include balloons and ''condoms''. Common medical latex products include stoppers on syringes, ''blood pressure'' cuffs, oxygen tubing, and catheters. The powder of surgical gloves was a significant problem before appropriate substitutes were developed, as the powder could be inhaled and could lead to respiratory difficulties.' "
What caused the rise in latex allergies?,"'In the 1980s, with the emergence of the ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), it became increasingly important to take precautions that would prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This effort resulted in the application of universal precautions for protecting a person from infectious material, such as blood and other bodily fluids, using protective barriers. The most commonly used barrier was the latex glove. The prevalence of latex ''allergy'' peaked at 3%-9.5% in the 1990s but now has fallen to less than 1% in countries where active latex avoidance measures are practiced.' "
Who is at risk for developing a latex allergy?,"'Repeated exposure to latex is necessary for an allergy to develop. Health-care workers exposed to latex products (such as gloves and catheters), people who require frequent surgery or catheter use, and workers in the manufacturing or distribution of latex products are at the highest risk for latex allergy. For unknown reasons, people who have surgeries of the spine or urinary tract have a much higher risk of latex allergy.''There is also an association of unique ''food allergy'' among people allergic to latex, known as the fruit latex syndrome. People allergic to latex are frequently allergic to various fruits, particularly avocado, banana, chestnut, and kiwi.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of the two forms of latex allergy?,"'Allergy to latex comes in two different forms. One form is called a ""delayed hypersensitivity,"" which is usually seen as an ''itchy'' skin ''rash'' at the site where the latex product contacts the skin. This ''rash'' is similar to ''poison ivy'' and is generally self-limited. The other form is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (also known as an IgE-mediated reaction) to latex. This type of reaction can lead to ''anaphylaxis'', a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can involve the skin, respiratory system, gastrointestinal system, and ''cardiovascular system''.' "
How do health-care professionals assess and diagnose a latex allergy?,"'Clinical history is the most important aspect of diagnosing any type of latex allergy. A patch test to latex could potentially be performed to diagnose a delayed hypersensitivity response to latex. For an immediate hypersensitivity response to latex, a blood test is the only approved test presently available. In the United States, there is currently no approved skin testing for an immediate hypersensitivity to latex.' "
What is the treatment for a latex allergy?,"'Strict avoidance of latex is the treatment for latex allergy. Latex-free synthetic rubber, such as neoprene, nitrile, SBR, Butyl, and Vitron are polymers available as alternatives to natural rubber. Certain individuals at risk for anaphylaxis may benefit from having an epinephrine autoinjector on hand at all times.''No current treatment is available to desensitize a person who is allergic to latex. For a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to latex, topical or oral steroids may be used to treat the rash. An anaphylactic reaction to latex should be treated promptly with injectable epinephrine, and mild reactions confined to the skin may be treated with oral ''antihistamines''.' "
Latex-containing products (partial list), Band-Aids Rubber bands Erasers Some shoes and articles of clothing Balloons Surgical gloves Catheters Condoms Some items of sporting equipment Blood pressure cuffs Some watch bands Helmets Toothbrush massagers Bowling balls Ventilator tubing.
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A ''hysterectomy'' is the removal of the uterus (womb). For certain conditions, the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. ''The most common medical reasons for doing a hysterectomy include benign ''fibroid'' tumors of the uterus, abnormal uterine bleeding, ''endometriosis'', genital prolapse, and chronic ''pelvic pain''. Some women choose to have a hysterectomy for other reasons, including other types of tumors. ''Uterine cancer'' is an uncommon, but important reason for doing a hysterectomy.' "
What is a laparoscope?,"'A laparoscope is a viewing tube through which structures within the abdomen and pelvis can be seen. A small surgical incision (cut) is made in the abdominal wall to permit the laparoscope to enter the abdomen or pelvis. Additional tubes can also be pushed through the same or other small incisions allowing the introduction of probes and other instruments. In this way, surgical procedures can be performed without the need for a large surgical incision.' "
What is laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH)?,"'Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a surgical procedure using a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina (birth canal). (A different procedure, called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, is entirely performed using a laparoscope and other instruments inserted through tiny abdominal incisions, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes etc. are removed in tiny portions.) ''Not all hysterectomies can or should be done by LAVH. In certain situations, a laparoscopic hysterectomy (see above) may be sufficient. In other cases, an abdominal hysterectomy or a vaginal hysterectomy (without ''laparoscopy'') is indicated. The surgeon determines the appropriate procedure for each individual case based upon the reason for the hysterectomy and the medical history and condition of the patient.' "
How do doctors perform an LAVH?,"'During LAVH, several small incisions (''cuts'') are made in the abdominal wall through which slender metal tubes known as ""trocars"" are inserted to provide passage for a laparoscope and other microsurgical tools. The laparoscope acts as a tiny telescope. A camera attached to it provides a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen for viewing.''In the course of LAVH, the uterus is detached from the ligaments that attach it to other structures in the pelvis using the laparoscopic tools. If the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are to be removed, they are also detached from their ligaments and blood supply. The organs and tissue are then removed through an incision made in the vagina.' "
What are the disadvantages of LAVH?,"'LAVH can be a longer operation and more expensive than a vaginal hysterectomy and, under certain circumstances, it can be more dangerous.' "
What are the advantages of LAVH?,"'The incisions in an LAVH are relatively small. The ''scars'', ''pain'', and recovery time from LAVH are usually significantly less than with an abdominal hysterectomy, which requires both a vaginal incision and a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) long incision in the abdomen). LAVH is similarly less physically traumatic than a routine vaginal hysterectomy. When LAVH is feasible, it has distinct advantages. It can allow for a vaginal hysterectomy in patients who have not had children.' "
What is constipation?,"'Constipation is a condition characterized by infrequent bowel movements that are painful or difficult, or stools that are hard in consistency. Infrequent bowel movements alone are not a reliable indicator of constipation because bowel frequency can vary between three times a day to once a week among normal individuals. ''Hard stools'' that are difficult to pass or infrequent stools accompanied by ''abdominal pain'', ''back pain'', and abdominal ''bloating'' define constipation.' "
What causes constipation?,"'There are many causes of constipation including:'   Diets low in fiber. Fiber is vegetable material resistant to digestion that promotes soft stools by adding bulk to the stool and causing water to be retained in the stool. Side effects of medications such as narcotic painkillers, antidepressants, iron supplements, calcium channel blockers (medications for high blood pressure), and certain types of antacids. Narrowing or blockage of the large intestine (colon) due to scarring from previous surgery, colon cancer or advanced diverticulosis. Ineffective contraction or spasm of the colon's muscles due to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or other diseases of the colon's muscles. Hormonal (endocrine) disturbances such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroid) and diabetes mellitus with nerve damage. Neurologic conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and others."
Which medications cause constipation?,"'Examples of common medications that can cause constipation:' Narcotic pain medications: codeine (Tylenol #3), oxycodone (Percocet), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and others Antidepressants: amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), fluoxetine (Prozac), and imipramine (Tofranil) Anticonvulsants: phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) Iron supplements Calcium channel blockers, for example, diltiazem (Cardizem) and nifedipine (Procardia) Antacids, for example, aluminum hydroxide (Amphojel) and aluminum carbonate (Basaljel)"
What natural and home remedies help cure constipation?,"'Mild constipation without an underlying cause (such as medications, an underactive thyroid, or colon obstruction) can often improve with lifestyle modifications that include:'   Increase fiber in the diet. Fiber improves bowel function by adding bulk and softening the stool. You can increase the fiber in your diet with foods or over-the-counter (OTC) fiber supplements. Increase fluid intake. Although this is widely recommended as a treatment for constipation, there are no studies showing that increasing fluids improves constipation. Regular exercise such as walking, swimming, or running. Similar to increasing fluid intake, although exercise is widely recommended for treating constipation, there are no studies demonstrating its value for constipation."
What foods naturally help cure constipation?,"'Many foods can act as natural laxatives. These foods are high in fiber and can help get things moving, for example:' Seeds, for example, flax, chia, and pumpkin Raisins, figs, and prunes Vegetables, for example, sweet potatoes, greens (spinach, kale), and pumpkin Fruits (include the skin) Whole grain breads and cereals Whole beans (such as kidney beans and pinto beans) Oat bran Corn Barley"
What types of over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives help cure constipation?,"'Laxatives are medicines that increase the frequency and ease of passing stool. Many types of laxatives are available over-the-counter (OTC) for the relief of mild, occasional constipation. If constipation becomes moderate to severe or does not respond to OTC products, consult a doctor.''Most OTC laxatives are safe, effective, and well tolerated. There are distinct types of laxatives that function differently and have varying degrees of effectiveness and potential side effects. Talk to your doctor about the best ''laxative'' for your needs.' "
"What natural laxatives are safe for infants, toddlers, and children?","""If an infant is younger than four months old and seems constipated, contact the child's pediatrician. For older children, home remedies including dietary modifications may help relieve constipation. If a child has been constipated for a short time, changing the diet may be the only treatment needed. It is common for infants to become constipated when they transition to solid foods, and often adding fiber to the diet can ease constipation.""'The following natural treatments may be used for infants older than four months of age, or for children with constipation:''Parents or caregivers should contact the physician immediately if the child has severe ''abdominal pain'', swollen or ''bloated'' abdomen, ''rectal pain'"", or bleeding. If there are any concerns about the child's bowel habits or questions about diet, parents or caregivers should talk to their child's pediatrician.""   Dark corn syrup (Karo syrup) contains complex sugar proteins that keep water in the bowel movement. One teaspoon per four ounces of formula or expressed breast milk until the infant has a bowel movement. Prune or apple juice works best to treat constipation in children. Four ounces/day for children 4 months to 1 year of age. High-fiber foods. If your infant is eating solid foods, barley cereal may be used. Other high-fiber fruits and vegetables (or purés), including apricots, sweet potatoes, pears, prunes, peaches, plums, beans, peas, broccoli, or spinach can be fed to the child. Your doctor may recommend increased fiber in the child's diet, through supplementation. In infants with acute or recurrent constipation, glycerin suppositories or rectal stimulation with a lubricated rectal thermometer may be used to move hard stools. These methods should not be used often because they may cause irritation or tolerance. Infants older than 6 months with recurring constipation despite dietary changes may be treated with osmotic laxatives, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) without electrolytes (polyethylene glycol 3350,, for example, Miralax), lactulose, or sorbitol. Do not use stimulant laxatives (for example, senna, bisacodyl), mineral oil, and enemas in infants because they may have unwanted side effects."
Are laxatives safe to take during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?,"'Hormones from pregnancy, as well as ''prenatal vitamins'' and iron supplements may cause constipation. Pressure from the uterus pushes on the bowels and can cause constipation.'""Dietary and behavioral modifications can ease constipation during pregnancy and are considered safe. It's best to try these natural remedies first to treat constipation during pregnancy.""'Pregnant'' women should talk with their doctor before using over-the-counter laxatives or stool softeners during pregnancy. Laxatives can cause fluid loss and ''diarrhea'', so it is important not to overuse them during pregnancy. Avoid cod ''liver'' oil as a treatment for constipation if you are pregnant because it may prevent the absorption of needed ''vitamins'' and ''minerals''.'  Eat a diet rich in fiber with whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Supplement fiber in the diet with over-the-counter products such as Metamucil, which is considered safe Stay hydrated -- drink at least 6-8 glasses of water per day Drink 1-2 glasses of prune juice per day Exercise regularly -- if permitted by your obstetrician"
Pros and precautions for using stimulant laxatives,"'Stimulant laxatives are fast-acting laxatives that induce bowel movements by increasing the contraction of muscles in the ''intestines'', and are effective when used on a short-term basis. Examples of stimulant laxatives include:''Bisacodyl:'' Bisacodyl (Dulcolax, Correctol) is available over-the-counter in oral pill form and as a suppository or enema. The oral form takes 6 to 10 hours to work. Bisacodyl is commonly used in cleansing the colon for colonoscopies, barium enemas, and intestinal surgeries. While effective for occasional constipation, bisacodyl should not be taken for more than a week, and a doctor should supervise repeated use.''Senna, cascara sagrada, and casanthranol:'"" Other stimulant laxatives include senna (Ex-Lax, Senokot), cascara sagrada (Nature's Remedy), and casanthranol. These laxatives are converted by the bacteria in the colon into active compounds, which then stimulate the contraction of colon muscles. After taking these products orally, bowel movements occur quickly, after only 8 to 24 hours. Prolonged, chronic use of these laxatives can cause the lining of the colon to become darker than normal (""'melanosis coli'') due to the accumulation of a pigment (''melanin'').''Castor oil:'' Castor oil (an ingredient of Purge Concentrate) is a liquid stimulant laxative that works in the small intestine. It causes the accumulation of fluid in the small intestine and promotes evacuation of the bowels. Castor oil should not be taken with food, although juice or other flavored liquids can help hide its unpleasant taste. This laxative works rather quickly, usually within 2 to 6 hours. Castor oil is usually used to cleanse the colon for surgery, ''barium enema'', or ''colonoscopy''. The absorption of nutrients and minerals by the small intestine can be impaired by the frequent use of castor oil. This medicine is not recommended for the repeated treatment for constipation.' Aloe Cascara Senna compounds Bisacodyl Castor oil The intensity of the action of stimulant laxatives is dose related. A large dose of any stimulant laxative can produce serious adverse effects. Side effects include severe cramps, excess fluid loss and dehydration, blood electrolyte disturbances such as low levels of blood potassium (hypokalemia), and malnutrition with chronic use. There is concern that chronic, long-term use of stimulant laxatives can lead to loss of colon function (cathartic colon). After years to decades of frequent use of stimulant laxatives, the nerves of the colon slowly disappear, the colon muscles wither, and the colon becomes dilated. Consequently, constipation may become increasingly worse and unresponsive to laxatives. It is not clear, however, which comes first; a progressive decrease in colon function that leads to the use of stimulant laxatives, or the use of laxatives that leads to a decrease in colon function. Nevertheless, long term use of stimulant laxatives usually is reserved for use after other treatments have failed."
Pros and precautions for using stool softeners (emollient laxatives),"'Stool softeners, called emollient laxatives, prevent hardening of the feces by adding moisture to the stool. The active ingredient in most stool softeners is a medicine called docusate. Agents containing docusate do not by themselves stimulate or increase the number of bowel movements. They are used more to prevent constipation than to treat it.''Stool softeners are commonly recommended for individuals who should avoid straining while defecating, including those:''Softening the stool in these affected individuals can help reduce ''pain'' during defecation.''Stool softeners available OTC include:''Some preparations (for example, Peri-Colace) combine a stool softener with a stimulant laxative to activate bowel movements.''Stool softeners are generally safe and well tolerated.''They should not be combined with mineral oil, a lubricant laxative, because stool softeners may increase the absorption and toxicity of mineral oil. Mineral oil droplets absorbed into the body can deposit and cause inflammation in the lymph glands, liver, and spleen.' Who are recovering from abdominal, pelvic, or rectal surgery, childbirth, or heart attack With severe high blood pressure or abdominal hernias With painful hemorrhoids and/or anal fissures Colace Surfak Pharmacy or store-branded products containing docusate"
Pros and precautions for using bulk-forming laxatives,"'Bulk-forming laxatives are the most commonly recommended initial treatments for constipation as they tend to be the most gentle. Bulk-forming laxatives may work as quickly as 12 hours or take as long as three days to be effective. Some bulk-forming laxatives are derived from natural sources such as agar, psyllium, kelp (alginates), and plant gum. Others are synthetic cellulose compounds such as methylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose. Natural and synthetic bulk-forming laxatives act similarly. They dissolve or swell in the intestines, lubricate and soften the stool, and make the passage of stool easier and more frequent.''Examples of bulk-forming laxatives include:''Many of these agents are available as powders and are taken mixed with fluids. Fruit ''drinks'', fruit juice, and soft drinks mask the gritty taste of these laxatives better than water. Some are available as wafers, which are designed to be eaten with a separate beverage.' Methylcellulose (Citrucel) Psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (Metamucil) Polycarbophil (FiberCon) Guar gum (Benefiber) Malt soup extract (Maltsupex). Bulk-forming laxatives are not absorbed from the intestines into the body and are safe for long-term use. They are also safe for elderly patients with constipation. They are helpful in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), diverticulosis, and colostomies. Some bulk-forming laxatives (such as guar gum) are used as fiber supplements in patients whose diets contain insufficient fiber. High fiber consumption can help control weight gain and sometimes modestly lower the level of cholesterol in the blood. Each dose of a bulk-forming laxative should be taken with at least a full glass (8 ounces) of fluid to be safe and effective. Bulk-forming laxatives may not be appropriate for individuals who must restrict oral fluid intake (such as patients with kidney failure). Individuals with narrowing of the digestive tract (including esophageal stricture, intestinal stricture, or severe adhesions from previous surgery) should not use bulk-forming agents without their doctors' approval due to the risk of blockage of the intestine or the esophagus. Some individuals may be allergic to the laxative or other substances contained in the product, such as coloring or artificial sweeteners. Abdominal bloating, discomfort, and flatulence (gas) can be bothersome to some people using bulk-forming laxatives. By trying different types of bulk-forming laxatives, it usually is possible to find one that does not cause discomfort. Some of these products contain sugar. People with diabetes mellitus may need to select sugar-free bulk-forming laxatives. Bulk-forming laxatives can decrease the absorption of certain medications such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)), and carbamazepine (Tegretol) and can also reduce blood sugar levels."
Pros and precautions for using lubricant laxatives,"'Mineral oil (liquid petrolatum) coats and softens stool. Like stool softeners, mineral oil is used by patients who need to avoid straining (for example, after ''hernia'' repair, ''hemorrhoid'' surgery, ''heart attacks'', and ''childbirth'').' Mineral oil should be avoided in individuals taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin). Mineral oil decreases the absorption of vitamin K (important in forming clotting factors in the blood) from the intestines. The decreased absorption of vitamin K in patients taking warfarin can potentially lead to ""over-thinning"" of the blood and increasing the risk of excessive bleeding. Mineral oil should not be taken during pregnancy since it may inhibit vitamin absorption and decrease the availability of vitamin K to the fetus. Mineral oil can cause pneumonia if it leaks into the lungs. Leakage of secretions and other contents from the mouth and the esophagus into the lungs is called aspiration. Certain individuals (for example, the very young, the elderly, stroke victims, and those with swallowing difficulties) are prone to aspirate, especially while lying down. Therefore, mineral oil should not be given at bedtime or to individuals who are prone to aspirate. Mineral oil should only be used for short periods of time. A significant absorption of mineral oil into the body can occur if used repeatedly over prolonged periods."
Pros and precautions for using saline laxatives and osmotic laxatives," The active ingredients in saline laxatives are mostly magnesium, sulfate, citrate, and phosphate ions. These ions draw water into the intestines. The additional water softens the stool, increases pressure within the intestines, and increases intestinal contractions resulting in the discharge of softer stool. Fleet Phospho-Soda, milk of magnesia, and magnesium citrate are examples of saline laxatives. Oral doses of saline laxatives should be taken with one to two 8 ounce glasses of water. The onset of bowel response is usually 1/2 to 3 hours after consuming the laxative. Small doses are sometimes recommended for the treatment of occasional constipation, while larger doses can produce complete evacuation of the intestine. Complete cleansing of the bowel is useful in preparing for colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and barium enema. The active ingredient in osmotic-type laxatives such as GoLYTELY, GlycoLax, and MiraLax is polyethylene glycol (PEG). These work by holding water in the stool to soften the stool and increasing the number of bowel movements. Osmotic-type laxatives are often used to cleanse the bowel prior to colonoscopies or colon surgery. Since there may be some absorption of the active ingredients from the intestines into the blood circulation, saline laxatives should not be used in certain individuals. Individuals with impaired kidney function should not use laxatives containing magnesium or phosphate salts. Excess accumulation of magnesium and phosphate in the blood of these individuals can lead to toxicity. Those who need to limit their sodium intake, such as those with congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and high blood pressure, should not use laxatives that contain sodium. Side effects of osmotic-type laxatives include nausea, abdominal cramping, or gas. People who have a history of abdominal surgery or bowel obstruction should consult their doctor before using this medication. Caution is advised when using this drug in the elderly because they may be more sensitive to its side effects, especially diarrhea."
Pros and precautions for using enemas and suppositories,"'Rectally administered enemas and suppositories are commonly used to cleanse the rectum and the sigmoid colon (the part of the colon closest to the rectum) prior to surgery, ''childbirth'', and ''flexible sigmoidoscopy''. Enemas and suppositories are used to relieve constipation and rectal fecal impaction (blockage of the rectum by hard, compacted stool). They can also be used in conjunction with oral laxatives in cleansing the colon in preparation for barium enema studies. Some suppositories contain stimulant laxatives.''Enemas and suppositories include docusate (Microenema), bisacodyl (Dulcolax Suppository), and sodium phosphate (Fleet Enema). These products are intended for occasional use and are not recommended as a chronic laxative regimen unless directed by a physician.''Individuals should carefully follow instructions in using enemas. The person should lie on the left side with the knees bent. The enema solution should be inserted slowly into the rectum. The person should retain the solution in the rectum until definite rectal pressure and the urge to have a bowel movement are felt. Evacuation usually occurs within minutes to an hour.' Soapsuds enemas can cause rectal irritation and sometimes rectal gangrene and are not recommended. Enema solutions can cause fluid and electrolyte disturbances in the blood if used on a chronic basis."
When should a doctor be consulted for constipation?,"'Many people have a life-long tendency toward constipation while others have occasional constipation alternating with a normal bowel pattern or even ''diarrhea''. While mild and intermittent constipation in these individuals is usually not a cause for concern, a doctor should be consulted under the following circumstances:'  A new onset of constipation or recent change in bowel habits Moderate to severe constipation, or constipation that does not respond to self-treatment with simple bulking agents that provide fiber Constipation that is accompanied by rectal bleeding, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea and vomiting, or involuntary weight loss Constipation during pregnancy or while breastfeeding."
Are laxatives safe to take for weight loss?,"'Laxatives are not intended as weight loss supplements. It may seem as if you lost weight once a laxative has taken effect and your constipation is relieved, but by the time stool reaches the large intestine (colon), most of the fat and calories from your food has already been absorbed by the small intestines. What you do lose is water, electrolytes, minerals, and indigestible fiber. Any ""water weight"" you may lose comes back as soon as you drink fluids.''Laxative abuse occurs when people frequently take laxatives to ''lose weight''. Often, laxatives are taken after binge eating in an attempt to purge calories. This is part of an eating disorder called ''bulimia''. There are serious health consequences to laxative abuse, including life-threatening complications. Laxatives deplete the body of needed electrolytes and minerals, which the body needs. This can lead to malfunctions of your vital organs. ''Dehydration'' caused by laxative abuse can lead to ''tremors'', ''fainting'', kidney damage, and even death.''When people use laxatives consistently, dependence can develop and the colon stops working the way it should, and it can take larger and larger doses of laxatives to result in bowel movements. Chronic abuse of laxatives can increase the risk of developing colon ''cancer''.''If you are abusing laxatives in the hope of losing weight, or if you think you may be addicted to laxatives, talk to your doctor to get help.' "
What is cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat that the body needs to produce important structures and chemicals. It is one of the main components of cell membranes, the outer lining that protects the internal structures that make body cells work and function properly. Cholesterol is also a building block for many of the hormones in the body including mineralocorticoids that control ''electrolyte'' levels in the body, glucocorticoids involved in carbohydrate ''metabolism'', and sex hormones including testosterone, ''estrogen'', and ''progesterone''. Cholesterol is one of the building blocks that assists in forming ''vitamin D'' in the body. ''Vitamin D'' is responsible for calcium ''metabolism'' in the body.''There are two important types of cholesterol, ''high density lipoprotein (HDL)'' and ''low density lipoprotein (LDL)''. LDL is the bad cholesterol that deposits in arteries when too much is present. HDL is considered the good cholesterol because it can bind to ''LDL cholesterol'' and return it to the ''liver'' where it can be removed from the body. ''While most of the cholesterol in the body is obtained through the foods we eat, it is also produced in the ''liver'"" to meet the body's demands. The body attempts to regulate the amount of total cholesterol, but when too much cholesterol is present, the excess can be deposited in arteries throughout the body. This leads to artery narrowing and increases the risk of ""'heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. Elevated LDL levels increase the risk of these diseases, and elevated HDL levels decrease the risk.' "
What does a cholesterol test measure?,"'Cholesterol tests are blood tests that measure the amount of cholesterol in the body. The health-care professional may order only a cholesterol test with results showing:''In addition to cholesterol level, the health-care professional also may order a ''lipid profile'' test. \xa0The ''lipid'' profile test will also measure ''triglyceride levels'' and another fatty substance found in the blood.'   The total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels."
How do I prepare for a cholesterol test?,"'For the best and most accurate results, it is important to fast for many hours before the cholesterol blood test is taken. Each laboratory has its own guidelines for not eating, and the fast may range from 9-16 hours. It is acceptable to drink water.' "
Do I need to call my doctor for my test results?,"'It usually takes a day or two from the time the blood is drawn until your health-care professional receives the results of the cholesterol test. Ideally, the health-care professional will contact you with those results and explain their significance. However, if you have not been contacted in a short period of time, it is reasonable to contact your health-care professional and ask for the test results.''There are home cholesterol test kits available that have been U.S. FDA approved, but their accuracy is not necessarily as good as that of a certified laboratory. These tests usually measure total cholesterol only, but some also can measure HDL, LDL and cholesterol. If you use one of the home kits, it is wise to discuss the results with your health-care professional.''The purpose of the cholesterol blood test is to determine whether treatment is needed for ''high cholesterol''. That treatment may include dietary and lifestyle modifications, medications, or both to control ''cholesterol levels'' and decrease the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and peripheral ''vascular disease''. ' "
How do I interpret my cholesterol test results?,"'Cholesterol levels'' are but one of the risk factors for ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. It is important to control cholesterol levels to minimize risk just as it is important to control ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', and avoid ''smoking''.''Guidelines for cholesterol levels have been developed by many health organizations including the American ''Heart'' Association. It is important to remember that tests may need to be repeated over time to help monitor treatment and disease risk ''prevention''.\xa0' "
What are HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol'' is a fat-like (''lipid''-like) substance that your body uses as a building block to produce hormones, ''vitamin D'', and digestive juices that help you break down ''fats'' in your ''diet''. ''HDL'' (high-density lipoprotein, or “good” cholesterol) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or “bad” cholesterol) are two types of lipoproteins that carry cholesterol to and from the body’s cells in the blood.''The body needs some cholesterol to function, but when levels get too high, fatty deposits can accumulate in blood vessels, which causes them to narrow. This narrowing of the blood passageways by these ''lipids'' can lead to ''heart attacks'', ''coronary artery disease'', ''strokes'', or other vascular diseases.''Triglycerides'' are components found in body fat, and fats from the foods you eat. ''Triglycerides'' show what you have recently eaten, and cholesterol shows what you have eaten over a long period. If you eat a fatty meal, it gets absorbed as ''triglycerides'', so in the first few days after eating a fatty meal you will have high levels of triglycerides in your blood. The ''liver'' then packages these triglycerides as fats in your adipose tissue, and turns some of it into cholesterol. This leads to high ''cholesterol levels'' in the blood for a few days to weeks after eating a fatty meal. Like cholesterol, you need some triglycerides to keep the body healthy, but increased levels can cause health problems.' "
What do HDL and LDL mean?,"'LDL and HDL are the two main types of cholesterol (blood fats, or lipids) that make up your total cholesterol.''There is a third type of cholesterol called VLDL (very-low-density lipoproteins), which is another type of “bad” cholesterol produced in the liver, and contains a high amount of triglycerides.' HDL (high-density lipoproteins), or “good” cholesterol, may protect the body against narrowing blood vessels LDL (low-density lipoproteins), or “bad” cholesterol, may make arterial narrowing worse"
Why is HDL the good cholesterol and LDL the bad?,"'Your total cholesterol is the sum of the fats in your blood, which includes the LDL and ''HDL cholesterol''. This number can give you an indication of your risk factors for developing ''cardiovascular disease'', ''coronary artery disease'', ''vascular disease'', or ''stroke''.''More importantly, the amounts of each type of cholesterol are a better predictor of risk for disease than the total amount. Doctors and other health care professionals consider ''LDL cholesterol'' the “bad” cholesterol. Increased numbers of ''LDL cholesterol'' indicate more risk for blocked arteries and health problems.''Doctors consider ''HDL cholesterol'' the “good” cholesterol, and they interpret its levels in the opposite manner of LDL. The higher your HDL cholesterol numbers, the lower your risk is for ''heart disease'', vascular disease, and ''stroke''. HDL cholesterol also may have a protective effect on the blood vessels, and a high level of HDL in your body may keep cardiovascular disease from developing.''Triglycerides also are part of a cholesterol profile, and these numbers are more indicative of the amount of fats you have eaten recently. High ''triglyceride levels'' greatly increase your risk for developing coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and ''stroke''.' "
Chart of normal HDL and LDL cholesterol numbers and ratios,'Chart courtesy of the National Institutes of Health.' 
What causes high levels of LDL cholesterol?," High-fat diet Obesity (including metabolic syndrome, also called syndrome X) Sedentary lifestyle Genetics Alcoholism Liver disease Smoking Diabetes"
What can lower LDL cholesterol levels?,"'Lifestyle and ''diet'' modifications are the main way to prevent high ''LDL cholesterol'', and to keep a healthy level of ''HDL cholesterol''. Eat a low-fat/high-''fiber'' ''diet'', ''exercise'' regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and do not smoke.''Some risk factors for high ''LDL cholesterol'' are genetic and may require medical treatment to keep ''cholesterol levels'' in a healthy range.' "
What foods help lower LDL cholesterol?,"'A ''heart''-healthy diet that is high in ''fiber'' and plant-based foods can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels. Mainly ''vegetarian'' or vegan diets have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of blocked arteries. Foods that can help lower LDL cholesterol include:'   Oatmeal Whole grains Barley Beans Fruits and vegetables Leafy greens such as spinach, kale, collard greens, lettuce Avocado Eggplant Nuts Soybeans and tofu Fatty fish such as salmon and tuna (in moderation) Red wine (in moderation) Black tea Garlic Fiber supplements"
What lifestyle changes and medications help lower LDL cholesterol numbers?,"'The first step in ''lowering cholesterol'' is diet and ''exercise''. Talk with your doctor, nutritionist, or other healthcare professional to come up with a diet and ''exercise'' plan that is right for you.''Other lifestyle modifications and changes can be made to help lower your cholesterol, for example;''If diet, ''exercise'', and lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your cholesterol to healthy ranges, then your doctor may prescribe medication. The type of cholesterol lowering medication depends upon your levels of LDL, ''HDL'', and ''triglycerides''; and any current medications you are currently taking, and your overall health.''Medication options to reduce cholesterol include ''statins'', ''niacin'', and fibric acid agents (''fibrates''). Your doctor may prescribe one or several types of these ''drugs'' to reduce your cholesterol levels to a healthy range.'   quit smoking, reduce the amount of alcohol you drink or avoid it, and reduce stress by using stress reduction techniques like Yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation."
What increases HDL (good) cholesterol?,"'Raising your HDL levels by diet alone is very difficult. Your best solution to increase your HDL levels is to eat a heart-healthy diet low in fat and high in fiber. You also can help improve your HDL number if you ''lose weight'', ''quit smoking'', and cut ''sugar'' out of your diet.''Some statin medications may potentially increase HDL levels moderately. Discuss this treatment option with your doctor.' "
Lead Poisoning Tips,"'Lead poisoning'' is entirely preventable. The key is stopping children from coming into contact with lead and treating children who have been poisoned by lead.'""The goal is to prevent lead exposure to children before they are harmed. There are many ways parents can reduce a child's exposure to lead. The key is stopping children from coming into contact with lead. Lead hazards in a child's environment must be identified and controlled or removed safely."" "
How Are Children Exposed to Lead?,"'Lead-based paint and lead contaminated dust are the main sources of exposure for lead in U.S. children. Lead-based paints were banned for use in housing in 1978. All houses built before 1978 are likely to contain some lead-based paint. However, it is the deterioration of this paint that causes a problem. Approximately 24 million housing units have deteriorated leaded paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust. More than 4 million of these dwellings are homes to one or more young children.' "
Who Is At Risk For Lead Poisoning?,"'All children under the age of 6 years old are at risk because they are growing so rapidly and because they tend to put their hands or other objects, which may be contaminated with lead dust, into their mouths.''However, children living at or below the poverty line who live in older housing are at greatest risk. Additionally, children of some racial and ethnic groups and those living in older housing are disproportionately affected by lead.' "
Can Lead Poisoning Be Prevented?,"'It is important to determine the construction year of the house or the dwelling where your child may spend a large amount of time (e.g., grandparents or daycare). In housing built before 1978, assume that the paint has lead unless tests show otherwise.''Talk to your state or local health department about testing paint and dust from your home for lead.''Make sure your child does not have access to peeling paint or chewable surfaces painted with lead-based paint.''Pregnant'' women and children should not be present in housing built before 1978 that is undergoing renovation. They should not participate in activities that disturb old paint or in cleaning up paint debris after work is completed.'""Create barriers between living/play areas and lead sources. Until environmental clean-up is completed, parents should clean and isolate all sources of lead. They should close and lock doors to keep children away from chipping or peeling paint on walls. You can also apply temporary barriers such as contact paper or duct tape, to cover holes in walls or to block children's access to other sources of lead.""""Regularly wash children's hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or exterior soil. Both are known lead sources.""'Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, parents should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. They should be kept clean. If feasible, windows should be shut to prevent ''abrasion'' of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash.''Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Parents should plant grass on areas of bare soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. Until the bare soil is covered, parents should move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the house. If using a sandbox, parents should also cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste.'""To further reduce a child's exposure from non-residential paint sources:""  avoid using traditional home remedies and cosmetics that may contain lead; avoid eating candies imported from Mexico; avoid using containers, cookware, or tableware to store or cook foods or liquids that are not shown to be lead free; remove recalled toys and toy jewelry immediately from children. Check Lead Recalls lists. use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and for making baby formula (Hot water is more likely to contain higher levels of lead. Most of the lead in household water usually comes from the plumbing in your house, not from the local water supply.); shower and change clothes after finishing a task that involves working with lead-based products such as stain glass work, bullet making, or using a firing range."
What are learning disabilities?,"'Learning disability'' is a general term that describes specific kinds of learning problems. A learning disability can cause a person to have trouble learning and using certain skills. The skills most often affected are: ''Learning disabilities (LD) vary from person to person. One person with learning disabilities may not have the same kind of learning problems as another person with learning disabilities. One person may have trouble with reading and writing. Another person with learning disabilities may have problems with understanding math. Still another person may have trouble in each of these areas, as well as with understanding what people are saying.''Researchers think that learning disabilities are caused by differences in how a person\'s brain works and how it processes information. Children with learning disabilities are not ""dumb"" or ""lazy."" In fact, they usually have average or above average intelligence. Their brains just process information differently.''The definition of ""learning disability"" just below comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The IDEA is the federal law that guides how schools provide special education and related services to children with disabilities. ''There is no ""cure"" for learning disabilities. They are life-long. However, children with learning disabilities can be high achievers and can be taught ways to get around the learning disability. With the right help, children with learning disabilities can and do learn successfully. ''IDEA\'s Definition of ""Learning Disability"" '""Our nation's special education law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, defines a specific learning disability as . . . ""'"". . . a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, ''brain injury'', minimal brain dysfunction, ''dyslexia'', and developmental ''aphasia''."" ''However, learning disabilities do not include, ""...learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, ''hearing'', or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage."" ''34 Code of Federal Regulations §300.7(c)(10)'   reading, writing,  listening,  speaking,  reasoning, and  doing math. "
How common are learning disabilities?,"'Very common! As many as 1 out of every 5 people in the United States has a learning disability. Almost 3 million children (ages 6 through 21) have some form of a learning disability and receive special education in school. In fact, over half of all children who receive special education have a learning disability (T''wenty-fourth Annual Report to Congress'', U.S. Department of Education, 2002).' "
What are the signs of a learning disability?,"""There is no one sign that shows a person has a learning disability. Experts look for a noticeable difference between how well a child does in school and how well he or she could do, given his or her intelligence or ability. There are also certain clues that may mean a child has a learning disability. We've listed a few below. Most relate to elementary school tasks, because learning disabilities tend to be identified in elementary school. A child probably won't show all of these signs, or even most of them. However, if a child shows a number of these problems, then parents and the teacher should consider the possibility that the child has a learning disability. ""'When a child has a learning disability, he or she: ''If a child has unexpected problems learning to read, write, listen, speak, or do math, then teachers and parents may want to investigate more. The same is true if the child is struggling to do any one of these skills. The child may need to be evaluated to see if he or she has a learning disability. '   may have trouble learning the alphabet, rhyming words, or connecting letters to their sounds;  may make many mistakes when reading aloud, and repeat and pause often;  may not understand what he or she reads;  may have real trouble with spelling;  may have very messy handwriting or hold a pencil awkwardly;  may struggle to express ideas in writing;  may learn language late and have a limited vocabulary;  may have trouble remembering the sounds that letters make or hearing slight differences between words;  may have trouble understanding jokes, comic strips, and sarcasm;  may have trouble following directions;  may mispronounce words or use a wrong word that sounds similar;  may have trouble organizing what he or she wants to say or not be able to think of the word he or she needs for writing or conversation;  may not follow the social rules of conversation, such as taking turns, and may stand too close to the listener;  may confuse math symbols and misread numbers;  may not be able to retell a story in order (what happened first, second, third); or  may not know where to begin a task or how to go on from there. "
What about school and learning disabilities?,"'Learning disabilities tend to be diagnosed when children reach school age. This is because school focuses on the very things that may be difficult for the child - reading, writing, math, listening, speaking, and reasoning. Teachers and parents notice that the child is not learning as expected. The school may ask to evaluate the child to see what is causing the problem. Parents can also ask for their child to be evaluated. '""With hard work and the proper help, children with learning disabilities can learn more easily and successfully. For school-aged children (including preschoolers), special education and related services are important sources of help. School staff work with the child's parents to develop an ""'Individualized Education Program'"", or IEP. This document describes the child's unique needs. It also describes the special education services that will be provided to meet those needs. These services are provided at no cost to the child or family. ""'Supports or changes in the classroom (sometimes called accommodations) help most students with learning disabilities. Some common accommodations are listed below in ""Tips for Teachers"". Assistive technology can also help many students work around their learning disabilities. Assistive technology can range from ""low-tech"" equipment such as tape recorders to ""high-tech"" tools such as reading machines (which read books aloud) and voice recognition systems (which allow the student to ""write"" by talking to the computer). '""It's important to remember that a childs learning disabilities may need help at home as well as in school.

Tips for parents of children with learning disabilities,"'Learn about learning disabilities. The more you know, the more you can help yourself and your child. See the list of resources and organizations at the end of this article. ' Praise your child when he or she does well. Children with learning disabilities are often very good at a variety of things. Find out what your child really enjoys doing, such as dancing, playing soccer, or working with computers. Give your child plenty of opportunities to pursue his or her strengths and talents.  Find out the ways your child learns best. Does he or she learn by hands-on practice, looking, or listening? Help your child learn through his or her areas of strength.  Let your child help with household chores. These can build self-confidence and concrete skills. Keep instructions simple, break down tasks into smaller steps, and reward your child's efforts with praise.  Make homework a priority. Read more about how to help your child be a success at homework. (See resource list at the end.)  Pay attention to your child's mental health (and your own!). Be open to counseling, which can help your child deal with frustration, feel better about himself or herself, and learn more about social skills.  Talk to other parents whose children have learning disabilities. Parents can share practical advice and emotional support. Call NICHCY (1.800.695.0285) and ask how to find parent groups near you. Also let us put you in touch with the parent training and information (PTI) center in your state.  Meet with school personnel and help develop an educational plan to address your child's needs. Plan what accommodations your child needs, and don't forget to talk about assistive technology!  Establish a positive working relationship with your child's teacher.

Is there any treatment for learning disabilities?,"""The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. Specially trained educators may perform a diagnostic educational evaluation assessing the child's academic and intellectual potential and level of academic performance. Once the evaluation is complete, the basic approach is to teach learning skills by building on the child's abilities and strengths while correcting and compensating for disabilities and weaknesses. Other professionals such as speech and language therapists also may be involved. Some medications may be effective in helping the child learn by enhancing attention and concentration. Psychological therapies may also be used. "" "
What is the prognosis for learning disabilities? ,"'Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions. In some people, several overlapping learning disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single, isolated learning problem that has little impact on their lives. ' "
What research is being done for learning disabilities? ,"'The NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health including the National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development, the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the National Institute of Mental Health support research on learning disabilities.

What is LEEP?,"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), uses a low-voltage electrical current to remove abnormal tissues of the cervix. It has an advantage, therefore, over the destructive techniques (CO2 laser and cryocautery) in that an intact tissue sample for analysis can be obtained. LEEP also is popular because it is inexpensive, simple, and typically has few risks or side effects. LEEP is also known as large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).''This procedure is used most often for treating moderate dysplasia (abnormal changes of the cells lining the cervix or precancers) that have been identified by ''colposcopy'' and/or ''cervical biopsy''. In certain situations, severe dysplasia and noninvasive ''cancer'' that are localized and can be removed may also be treated by LEEP.'  "
How is a LEEP done?,"'The patient lies on an examining table with the ''feet'' elevated in stirrups (the position used to obtain a ''Pap smear''). A speculum  (as used for the ''Pap test'') is inserted to open the vaginal walls. Sometimes a special solution, either vinegar (acetic acid) or ''iodine'', is applied to the cervix prior to the procedure, which makes the abnormal areas of tissue more recognizable).''The area is numbed using a local anesthetic (cervical block). Oral or intravenous medications to control ''pain'' may also be given. A low-voltage electrical current is delivered via a thin wire that is passed through tissues to remove the abnormal areas of the cervix. A chemical is applied afterwards to prevent bleeding. ''Mild ''pain'' and cramping that can be relieved by oral medications may occur for the first few hours following the procedure. ''Vaginal discharge'' and ''spotting'' commonly occur after this procedure for up to a few weeks. Sexual intercourse and tampons use should be avoided for several weeks to allow better healing. ''Douching'' should also be avoided.'  "
How effective is LEEP?,"'LEEP has been shown to be comparable to ''cryotherapy'', ''cold'' knife conization (surgical removal of the abnormal area), laser ablation (destruction of the abnormal tissue), and laser conization for the removal of abnormal or ''precancerous'' tissues of the cervix. Studies have shown that a majority of these methods result in a cure (removal of all the affected tissue).''Further treatment is not typically necessary if all of the abnormal area has been removed, although the precancerous changes may develop again (recur) at a later time. Regular follow-up Pap tests are required following LEEP to evaluate for possible recurrence of the cellular abnormalities.' "
What are complications of LEEP?,"'Complications occur in about a small percentage of women undergoing LEEP, including narrowing (stenosis) of the opening of the cervix, greater than expected amounts of bleeding, or infection of the cervix or uterus.'  "
What is cardiac catheterization?,"'Cardiac catheterization'', also known as cardiac cath or ''heart'' cath, is a procedure to examine the functioning of the heart.''A thin, narrow tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel of an arm or a leg, and is guided to the arteries of the heart using an X-ray camera. The doctor then injects\xa0contrast dye into the blood vessel through the catheter to get an X-ray view of the valves, arteries, and the heart chambers.' "
What is the difference between left and right heart catheterization?," Catheterization of the left side of the heart is performed by passing the catheter through the artery. In catheterization of the right side of the heart, the catheter passes through the veins."
Why is cardiac catheterization done?,"'Cardiac catheterization is done for diagnosing the following heart conditions:' Atherosclerosis: Deposits of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and clotting materials, known as fibrin in the innermost layer of arteries (endothelium), which results in clogging of the arteries. Cardiomyopathy: Enlargement of the heart due to thickening or weakening of the heart muscle. Congenital heart disease: Defects in one or more heart structures formed during fetal development. Heart failure: A condition in which the heart muscles become too weak to pump blood well, leading to congestion in the blood vessels and lungs. Heart valve disease: Failure of one or more heart valves, leading to reduced blood flow within the heart. To determine the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with confusing clinical presentations"
Who should not undergo cardiac catheterization?,'Patients with the following conditions shouldn’t undergo cardiac catheterization:' Severe uncontrolled blood pressure Severe anemia Kidney failure Allergic to contrast dyes Stroke Heavy bleeding in the stomach and intestine Abnormal changes in the electrolytes Severe coagulopathy (impaired ability of the body to clot) Ventricular arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat in the heart chamber) Untreated infection or unexplained fever
How to prepare for a cardiac catheterization?,"'Your physician will explain the procedure, along with its risks and benefits. In addition, you will also be instructed to do the following:' Sign an informed consent What foods and liquids can be taken 24 hours before the test Fast for six to eight hours before the cath procedure Inform the doctor of any allergies to the dyes used in the cath procedure. Inform the doctor about any medical and medication history, especially any drug allergies. Stop taking specific medicines before the procedure. Ask someone to accompany you during the procedure."
What happens during a cardiac catheterization?," Before the cath procedure, a nurse will put an intravenous (IV) line into the vein of the arm to inject sedatives to make you relax. Your doctor will use a local anesthetic to numb the area, where the catheter goes in. The groin area is cleaned and shaved. The doctor will puncture your skin with a needle to gain access to the blood vessel. The doctor will insert an instrument known as an introducer sheath from which the catheter advances toward the blood vessels. You might feel some pressure. If you feel any pain, immediately inform the doctor. When the catheter reaches the arteries, it will inject a small amount of dye into the arteries. The X-ray camera will take pictures of your arteries and heart chambers. The catheter is removed gradually once the procedure ends."
What happens after cardiac catheterization?,"'You will be sent to the recovery room for a few hours. During this time:' Pressure will be applied to the puncture site to stop bleeding You will have to lie straight on the bed.  Your vital signs such as blood pressure and pulse will be checked during your recovery Inform the doctor about any swelling, pain, or bleeding at the puncture site."
How serious is a heart catheterization?,"'A heart cath is generally very safe. But as with any procedure, there are some risks with heart catheterization too.''Risks include:' Heart attack Blood clots Infection Kidney damage Stroke Bruises Bleeding Arrhythmia Allergic reaction to the dye Air embolism (where air enter into the blood vessel)"
What is the right brain vs. left brain theory? What is brain lateralization (split-brain)?,"'Some neuroscience researchers believe that the function of the human brain is be best explained by the concept of lateralization, meaning that the right and left hemispheres of the brain perform very different functions, and that the two communicate through their connections.''Other researchers believe that the hemisphere of the brain in charge of certain operations is more dependent upon which hemisphere is dominant for an individual.''Brain hemisphere dominance for a person often is predicted by whether he or she is right- or left-handed, and the way in which a person learns best often is categorized as left brain or right brain functioning.'  "
What are the differences between the left brain and right brain (hemispheres)?,"'Many neuroscientists consider the concept of purely left-brain vs right-brain characteristics a myth. There are numerous theories and concepts that exist to explain how the right and left hemispheres of the human brain function. Many of which, have merits, and limitations.''Researchers Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Sperry proposed the concept of lateralization. In lateralization the left hemisphere and right hemispheres of the brain have very different functions, but they communicate with each other through their physical connections. An example of lateralization is language. For most people language function is located in the left hemisphere of the brain, particularly for right-handed people. The foundation for this split-brain theory often is based on research that has been performed on patients who had their right and left hemispheres of their brain surgically disconnected to treat severe ''epilepsy''. Split-brain theory describes the left side of the brain as giving rational orders to the right side of the brain, and the right hemisphere as giving emotionally based commands.''Brain lateralization occurs in certain brain functions. In brain lateralization, certain regions of the brain perform specific functions. Many recent studies have shown that the right and left halves of the brain mostly are used equally, which shows the functional and physical connections between both the right and left hemispheres of the brain.'""Regions of the brain that are in charge of functions like memory seem to vary depending upon which hemisphere is dominant for a particular person. While people's brain becomes more left-brained or right-brained (laterlized) with age, there is no difference in physical appearance (phenotype) that is correlated to being more left- (left-lateralized) or -right-brained (right-lateralized)."" "
Which side of the brain is dominant (characteristics and functions)?,"'While no single theory completely explains the multiple complexities of brain functions, neuroimaging techniques show some distinct differences (asymmetries) between the left and right brain hemispheres, which is referred to as lateralization.''Examples of these differences include language function in the Broca surface area (sulcus) and Wernicke area of the left side of the brain, and emotional and nonverbal functions in the right side of the brain.''The areas responsible for language tends to be on the dominant side of the brain, and opposite of the handedness of a person. For example, if you are left handed, the language function areas of your brain are more likely to be located on the right side of your brain. Moreover, if you are right-handed, your speech functions are more likely to be located on the left side of your brain.''Left-brain functions are thought to include:''According to neuroscience research, the left side of the brain or hemisphere:'""Left-brain and right-brain psychology further describes left-brain functions as including: the ability to pay attention to details, fine motor movement skills, and the ability to convert sounds to language and translate their meaning. Left-brain networks also are thought to control analytical/logical thinking, including a person's mathematics ability and problem-solving skills."" Understanding the sum of any situation, getting ""the big picture” Large muscle movements like walking Sensing where one’s body is in space Balance Nonverbal communication Emotional functioning Sensing smells, sounds and taste Regulating avoidance behaviors Is positively stimulated by new experiences. Controls the immune system. Is responsible for the involuntary bodily functions, for example, breathing, heart rate, and digestion. The right brain hemisphere is thought to allow young children to understand concepts of more versus less, but the understanding of specific number values involves the left hemisphere. Other cognitive activities that tend to be governed by the right hemisphere of the brain include attention to, and processing the overall visual shape of items, understanding verbal ambiguity, and emotional and implied meanings. In terms of brain development, neuroscience research indicates that until about 3 years of age, the right brain hemisphere tends to have the primary role (is dominant) in brain function."
Is there a right brain vs. left brain test?,"'While recent research often contradicts the concept of strict right-brain vs. left-brain laterality, the way a person learns most effectively may be described by what is often categorized as left-brain or right-brain functioning. Brain Works software is thought to be an effective left-brain vs right-brain test. The test uses questions in the form of written text and graphs to calculate the dominant side of a person’s brain.' "
How does left-brain vs. right-brain dominance effect learning styles?,"'Understanding which brain hemisphere is dominant in the way a person learns can help determine the most effective way to teach that person, and how they most efficiently study and \xa0acquire information. Specifically, left-brainers are thought to be more visual learners and right-brainers more auditory learners.' "
What Is an LVAD?,"""The left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, is a mechanical pump that is implanted inside a person's chest to help a weakened ""'heart ventricle'' pump blood throughout the body.''Unlike a total ''artificial heart'"", the LVAD doesn't replace the ""'heart''. It just helps it do its job. This can mean the difference between life and death for a person whose heart needs a rest after open-heart surgery, or for some patients waiting for a ''heart transplant'' (called ""''bridge'' to transplant"").''LVADs may also be used as destination therapy, which is an alternative to transplant. Destination therapy is used for long-term support in some terminally ill patients whose condition makes them ineligible for heart transplantation.'  "
How Does an LVAD Work?,"'Like the heart, the LVAD is a pump. The LVAD is surgically implanted just below the heart. One end is attached to the ''left ventricle'"" -- that's the chamber of the heart that pumps blood out of the ""'lungs'' and into the body. The other end is attached to the ''aorta'"", the body's main artery. Blood flows from the ventricles into the pump which passively fills up. When the sensors indicate it is full, the blood is ejected out of the device to the aorta.""'A tube passes from the device through the skin. This tube, called the driveline, connects the pump to the external controller and power source.''The pump and its connections are implanted during open-heart surgery. A computer controller, a power pack, and a reserve power pack remain outside the body. Some models let a person wear these external units on a belt or harness outside.''The power pack has to be recharged at night.' "
What Are the Benefits of an LVAD?,"'An LVAD restores blood flow to a person whose heart has been weakened by ''heart disease''. This helps relieve some symptoms such as being constantly tired or short of breath. And sometimes it lets the heart recover normal function by giving it a chance to rest (although this is rare). It maintains or improves other organ functions, improves ''exercise'' performance, and enables participation in cardiac rehabilitation.' "
What Are the Risks of Getting an LVAD?,"'As with any surgery, there are risks involved. Your surgeon will discuss the risks of the procedure with you.''After surgery, there are other risks, including:''In studies, therapy with the permanent LVAD device doubled the one-year survival rate of patients with end-stage heart failure as compared with drug treatment alone. However, there were some risks, including infection, ''stroke'', and bleeding.''Talk to your doctor to find out if a LVAD is right for you.''WebMD Medical Reference' Infection Internal bleeding Heart failure Device failure Blood clots Stroke Respiratory failure Kidney failure"
What are nocturnal leg cramps?,"'Nocturnal'' ''leg cramps'', also known as ''sleep''-related leg ''cramps'' or charley horse, are sudden, painful muscle contractions occurring at night that can disturb ''sleep''. It usually affects the calf or foot and may last for several seconds to minutes. Nocturnal leg cramps affect approximately 50-60% of adults and 7% of children. The prevalence of nocturnal leg cramps increases with age, and older women are more susceptible to leg cramps.' "
What happens when you get leg cramps at night?,"'Nocturnal leg cramps occur while you are fast asleep. It makes your leg muscles tight and sore, and you may find it difficult to fall asleep. The frequency of leg cramps depends on the person—yearly, monthly, weekly, or nightly. ''Pregnant'' women may also be affected by nocturnal leg cramps due to the strained muscle caused by excess weight.' "
What causes leg cramps?,"'Usually, there would be no cause for leg cramps, that is, they are idiopathic; however, some cases of leg cramps may be symptoms or complications of a more serious health condition (secondary). Idiopathic causes of leg cramps include:''Secondary causes of leg cramps include:' Nerve damage (seen in spinal disease, diabetes, and kidney disorders) Restriction in blood supply Stress Vigorous physical exercise Prolonged sitting Overuse of muscles Improper seating position Living or working on concrete floors Pregnancy Dehydration Flat feet Hypermobile joints Parkinson’s disease Myopathies (muscle weakness due to dysfunction of the muscle fiber) Excessive fluid loss Diabetes Hypoglycemia (decreased blood sugar level) Excessive alcohol drinking Hypothyroidism Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) Kidney failure Heart diseases Liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) Hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (progressive neuromuscular disease)"

What are the different causes of leg pain?,"'Leg pain'' can occur as a result of conditions that affect the bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin of the leg.''Some common causes of leg ''pain'' include:''Some other causes of leg pain include medications (diuretics and ''statins'') and bone tumors.' Peripheral artery disease: Inadequate blood supply to the leg is the main reason for peripheral artery disease. You may have numbness, weakness, or cramps in the leg when you attempt to walk. Painkillers and medicines that increase the blood flow to legs can relieve the pain, but surgery may be recommended in some cases. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot in the lower limb vein is called DVT. It may be manifested by redness, pain, swelling, and warmth in the legs. Clots may burst and travel to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening. The physician might prescribe blood thinners to prevent clot formation. Peripheral neuropathy: It is a condition where the nerves that are connected to the blood vessel and muscles are damaged. Diabetes, certain health conditions, medicines, injuries, and infections can contribute to peripheral neuropathy. It can cause tingliness, numbness and weakness, and stabbing pain in the legs. Electrolyte imbalance: Excessive loss of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and calcium may cause cramps, weakness, or numbness in the legs. Taking electrolyte-rich drinks may help to restore the lost electrolytes. Spinal stenosis: The spaces on the inner side of the bone of the spinal cord narrow, putting pressure on the nerves of that area leading to tingliness, numbness, or weakness in the legs. Abnormal walking patterns may also be seen, which can be eased with medication. Sciatica: The nerves in the lower spine get pinched, causing leg pain that can range from bad cramps to a strong shooting pain that makes it difficult to stand or sit. The physician may prescribe painkillers or physical therapy. Surgery may be reserved for a more serious case. Arthritis: It is the most common condition affecting the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. Arthritis can restrain your everyday activities when affecting the hips, knees, or ankles. Painkillers are the first-line treatment for arthritis. Pulled muscle: Intense leg pain occurs when the muscle gets stretched extensively. Applying cold-packs for 20 minutes a day, wrapping it with a bandage, or taking painkillers can relieve the ache. Sprain: Stretching or tearing of the ligament can cause a sprain, leading to swelling and pain. Resting, applying ice, compression, and elevation can ease the swelling and pain. Muscle cramp: Tightening of the muscle in the calf leads to muscle cramps, which is manifested by sharp pain and the feeling of a hard lump of muscle under the skin. They usually do not require any treatment and go away on their own. Stress fracture: Overuse of muscles around the shinbone can cause a stress fracture, which may not go away with splints. Resting for six to eight weeks is the best way to heal the bones completely.  Tendinitis: It is the inflammation of the tendon that attaches the muscle to bone, causing severe pain and swelling. Resting, applying ice, compression, and elevation can ease the swelling and pain. Varicose veins: In this condition, the veins need to work extra hard to get blood back to the heart making them look bulgy and twisted. Being overweight or pregnant may cause varicose veins, which can be relieved by exercising or wearing compression stockings."
When to contact a physician?,"'Call your physician, if you observe these symptoms:' Fever Worsening pain when you walk or exercise Blue or black legs Cold and pale legs Severe pain"
What causes legionellosis?  What is the history of Legionnaires' disease?,"'Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by a ''Legionella'' species called ''Legionella pneumophila''. The disease has two distinct forms:'   Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia. The onset of this form of the disease is usually two to 10 days after infection but can occur up to 16 days later. Legionnaires' disease acquired its name in 1976 after an outbreak of pneumonia occurred among people attending the American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. Later, the bacterium causing the illness was named Legionella pneumophila. Pontiac fever is a milder illness that develops from hours to two days after initial infection and resolves spontaneously. Sometimes, it may not even cause symptoms."
Where is the Legionella bacterium found?,"'Legionella'' organisms can be found in many types of water systems. However, the bacteria reproduce to high numbers in warm, stagnant water (95 F-115 F), such as that which is found in certain plumbing systems and hot-water tanks, cooling towers, and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems, and hot tubs. Cases of legionellosis have been identified throughout the United States and in several other countries. The disease likely occurs worldwide.''The bacterium thrives in the mist aerosolized from air-conditioning ducts. Thus, it can infest an entire building or airplane. Factors that are now known to enhance the growth of ''Legionella'' bacteria in human-made water environments include the following:' Water temperatures of 77 F-107.6 F Stagnation of the water Scale and sediment in the water Certain free-living amoebae organisms in water capable of supporting intracellular growth of Legionellae"
What are risk factors for Legionnaires' disease?,"""People of any age can develop Legionnaires' disease, but the illness most often affects middle-aged and older people, particularly those who smoke cigarettes or have chronic lung disease, as these individuals have a greater likelihood of developing any respiratory illness.""""People at an increased risk for Legionnaires' disease also include people whose immune systems are suppressed by diseases and conditions such as ""'cancer'', ''kidney failure'' requiring ''dialysis'', ''diabetes'', or ''AIDS''. Those who take medications that suppress the immune system are also at risk including those chronically on steroids.''Pontiac fever most commonly occurs in healthy people.' "
How is Legionnaires' disease spread? How does a person get Legionnaires' disease?,"'Outbreaks of legionellosis have occurred after people have inhaled aerosols that come from a water source (for example, air-conditioning cooling towers, hot tubs, or showers) contaminated with ''Legionella'' bacteria.

How do you know if you have restless leg syndrome?,"'The National Institutes of Health says that four criteria must be met for the diagnosis of RLS in a person (adult or child):' A strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms. Symptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting. Relief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings. Symptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night."
What is the treatment for restless leg syndrome? Is there a cure?,"'Treatment of restless leg syndrome is first directed toward any underlying illness, if known. For example:''There is no cure for restless leg syndrome; however, the condition usually responds well to home remedies and medications. The outlook is excellent for people with restless leg syndrome as long as it does not weaken or damage the function of the legs.'   Blood testing to reveal underlying iron deficiency anemia may reveal the underlying cause. If varicose veins are thought to be the cause, then surgery to repair the circulation may be considered. Reduction or elimination of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol from a person's diet can be very helpful. Stopping smoking can significantly diminish or prevent symptoms. Getting better sleep and exercise can help some persons affected by restless legs. Pregnant women who do not sleep well at night and other people with sleep disorders may develop RLS."
What medications treat restless leg syndrome and its symptoms?,"'Medications used to treat restless leg syndrome include:' natural supplements (such as iron), carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet), opioids (such as hydrocodone, or tramadol [Ultram] for intermittent symptoms), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equetro, Carbatrol), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), baclofen (Lioresal) bromocriptine, clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Jenloga), gabapentin (Neurontin), gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant ER), ropinirole (Requip), and pramipexole (Mirapex)."
6 natural home remedies for restless leg syndrome symptoms,"'Other treatments that have been helpful for some people with restless leg syndrome include:''Some of these natural remedies to reduce symptom of restless leg syndrome and may cause side effects. Discuss any problems or side effects you have after using home remedies or alternative treatments for restless leg syndrome with your doctor.'   Warm/cold baths Electric nerve stimulation Oral magnesium Acupuncture Natural treatments such as quinine water at bedtime (tonic water) Anxiety may trigger or increase RLS symptoms according to some researchers.  Some people have experienced a decrease in anxiety by using over-the-counter (OTC) products and natural home remedies and naturopathic treatments for anxiety, for example, lavender soap fumes or acupuncture. These natural treatments may reduce symptoms of RLS. "

What is leishmaniasis?,"'Leishmaniasis is a ""vector-borne"" infection, meaning that an insect from another host or ""reservoir"" (disease carrier) transmits it. Various animals, including ''dogs'', rats, sloths, cattle, and humans can act as hosts for ''Leishmania'' parasites. ''Leishmania'' spreads to people through the bite of over 30 ''Phlebotomus'' genus of sand flies. These flies are only up to 2 mm long, they make no sound, and their bite can be painless. The females need a blood meal to produce eggs. Phlebotomine flies that transmit ''Leishmania'' live in the warm tropical and subtropical areas of the world. As climate changes and temperatures shift, tropical diseases are shifting, as well. Health researchers expect human leishmaniasis to follow the spread of ''Phlebotomus'' flies into regions of increasing warmth and humidity. Human migration and increasing urban encroachment into rural areas also offer increased opportunities for spread of these organisms.''While many Western doctors are unfamiliar with it, leishmaniasis has a tremendous human impact on a global scale. It is difficult to pinpoint how many cases occur globally, since most may occur in rural, poor areas without established systems of reporting, but the World Health Organization (WHO) reports over 1 million cases of cutaneous (skin) leishmaniasis in the last five years. About 300,000 cases of visceral (organ) leishmaniasis occur yearly, with over 20,000 deaths. Over 1 billion people live in areas where ''Leishmania'' is common. Despite its prevalence, few Western clinicians are aware of it, and it remains on the WHO\'s list of ""neglected tropical diseases."" Research, treatment, and eradication of diseases affecting very poor and resource-limited areas often require outside investment.''Leishmaniasis occurs primarily in South America, East Africa, the Middle East, Southern Europe, and Asia.''In traditional or older terminology, geography divides leishmaniasis. ""Old World"" (Eastern hemisphere) leishmaniasis occurs in tropical parts of Asia, the Middle East, East and North Africa, and southern Europe. The Old World species include ''Leishmania major'', ''L. tropica'', ''L. donovani'', and others. ""New World"" (Western hemisphere) leishmaniasis occurs in tropical parts of Mexico and Central and South America. New World species include ''L. mexicana'', ''L. amazonensis'', ''L. braziliensis'', and others.''Cases in the United States and Europe are usually occur in ''travelers'' or immigrants from these endemic areas. In fact, due to the increasing popularity of ""adventure travel"" and ""ecotourism"" to Central and South America, new cases of leishmaniasis are on the rise in the U.S. Given the general unfamiliarity and limited knowledge about this parasitosis, a comprehensive guideline for diagnosing and treating these cases appeared in the journal of the Infectious Disease Society of America Clinical Infectious Diseases (''Clin Infect Dis'') in 2016.''There have been autochthonous cases (those acquired without travel) described in the U.S. In 2012, 13 people acquired cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Texas and Oklahoma without travel. This suggests spread of the sand fly vector and parasite into the U.S. and/or spread of human habitats into more rural areas.''Large epidemics of leishmaniasis can occur among people displaced into crowded urban areas through war or migration, or when high rates of malnutrition weaken people in affected regions. Generally, dogs and rodents are the reservoir for most species of ''Leishmania''. In poverty-stricken, densely populated areas, humans may become the primary ""reservoir"" and source of recurrent infection with leishmaniasis, particularly with ''L. donovani''. This is ""anthroponotic"" transmission.' "
What are the different types of leishmaniasis?,"'Many species of ''Leishmania'' cause leishmaniasis, a very diverse infection described by syndromes according to what part of the body it affects most. Several ''Leishmania'' species cause three syndromes: visceral (kala-azar), cutaneous, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Each type may occur more commonly in certain parts of the world than others and depends on the species of ''Leishmania''. It may take weeks to months or even years for symptoms to appear after the infecting bite.''Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of leishmaniasis and, as the name implies, the skin is the predominant site of infection. People acquire most cases of CL in the Middle East, East Africa, Asia (Old World), and Central and South America. Less commonly, cases occur in other countries, including Southern Europe. Of note, U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan have acquired CL.''Some species of ''Leishmania'' cause CL but also spread to the tissues of the face and upper respiratory tract and cause a mucocutaneous form of the disease many years later. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (ML) occurs only in the New World and is most common in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru (the ""mucosal belt"" south of the Amazon basin). ML causes terribly disfiguring and progressive destruction of the nose, nasal septum, mouth, and mid-face. Untreated, death results from secondary infections like ''pneumonia''.''A more severe form of CL with many lesions, disseminated CL may occur in people with poor immunity. It may appear very similar to ''lepromatous leprosy'' or fungal infection.''In visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the parasite spreads from the skin via the blood and lymph fluids to the vital organs of the body, particularly the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. This type of infection is less common but more life threatening than CL.''Post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis occurs in India and Sudan. Skin lesions may appear months to years after apparently healed VL.''VL is also an important yet under-recognized opportunistic infection in HIV-infected people. There have been cases of HIV-VL reported primarily in southern Europe and the Mediterranean where 70% of those with VL are HIV co-infected, however, over 30 countries have reported HIV-VL cases, including North Africa and Latin America. HIV-VL incidence in Brazil has increased from 0.7% in 2001 to 8.5% in 2012. People with immune suppression due to HIV are 100 to 2,000-fold more likely to develop severe VL, because they lack the cell-mediated immunity needed for defense and recovery from it. HIV-VL co-infection then leads to accelerated progression of HIV infection to advanced disease. Treatment failure and relapse of VL is high in these individuals, although anti-retroviral (anti-HIV) therapy helps improve cell-mediated immunity and may have some anti-leishmanial effects as well. Because the parasites multiply in high number, these individuals also become effective human reservoirs, often transmitting both HIV and ''Leishmania'' via IV ''drug use''. Of concern, VL may follow spread of HIV to new geographic areas when co-infected populations migrate.' "
What causes leishmaniasis? How does leishmaniasis spread?,"'Intracellular protozoal parasites from the ''Leishmania'' genus cause leishmaniasis. The organisms are microscopic in size. Over 20 species of ''Leishmania'' affect humans. The life cycle is relatively simple. Uninfected sand flies acquire the parasite by feeding on infected people or animals. When the sand fly bites a human, it injects small numbers of parasites that mononuclear blood cells rapidly take up. This stage is the promastigote stage. Once inside the human mononuclear cells, the parasite enters the amastigote stage and begins to multiply and infect other cells and tissues. Depending on the species, the parasites may spread via blood and lymph fluid to other body sites, such as the skin or major organs.''Blood transfusions and IV drug users sharing contaminated needles transmit parasites. A ''pregnant'' mother may transmit ''Leishmania'' to her fetus.'  "
What are risk factors for leishmaniasis?,"'The major risk factor for leishmaniasis is exposure to infected phlebotomine sand flies. The sand flies are most active from dusk to dawn and are more common in rural areas. Casual travelers do not usually visit these areas at night, so infection is more common in adventure travelers, missionaries, humanitarian aid workers (such as Peace Corps workers), soldiers, and those with occupational activities that require them to live in rural areas. In healthy people, the degree of immune response to leishmaniasis appears to be genetically determined and is primarily cell-mediated; antibodies are not protective. CL lesions in people with normal immunity will resolve without treatment in several weeks. These individuals are immune to CL thereafter. In visceral leishmaniasis, a weak cell-mediated immune response is associated with more severe disease. Factors that weaken cell-mediated immunity include malnutrition and co-infection with the ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (HIV). The cause of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis remains unclear, but an overactive immune response may play a part. Interestingly, Leishmaniavirus can infect the ''Leishmania'' parasite itself, which may cause the parasite to be more dangerous by overstimulating the inflammatory response from the human immune system.''Leishmania'"" may live quietly for years in the body and then begin to multiply (reactivate) if the person's immune system becomes suppressed. For example, people with HIV who are being treated with anti-HIV ""'drugs'' and whose immunity is improving may develop CL or VL as part of an immune reconstitution syndrome (this refers to hidden infections that reveal themselves as the body begins to fight them). Thus, people born in a country with leishmaniasis and those who have had travel-related exposure are at risk if they become immunosuppressed by conditions such as ''chemotherapy'', use of steroids, or infection with HIV. Patients who have previously had cutaneous leishmaniasis acquired in certain parts of the New World are at risk for developing mucocutaneous leishmaniasis.' "
What are leishmaniasis symptoms and signs?,"""Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar may be mild or severe. Some patients are asymptomatic and do not realize that they carry the parasite. Symptoms appear in weeks to months after the bite of the sand fly. Less commonly, symptoms arise only years later when a person's immune system becomes suppressed. The five classic findings of more severe disease are""'In very advanced disease in India, the skin may turn dark (hyper-pigmentation), which prompted VL to be called ""kala-azar,"" which means ""black fever"" in Hindi. The hyper-pigmentation is due to increased ''melanin'' in the skin. Inflammatory products due to VL stimulate the ''pituitary gland'' to make high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, which increases melanin production. Hyper-pigmentation usually resolves with effective treatment of VL. It no longer appears as often due to earlier treatment. It also affects the kidney, which may lead to ''renal failure'', although some of the anti-leishmanial drugs may also be responsible for kidney toxicity. Leishmaniasis may affect other organs, including the bowel and the lung.''There are a host of other names for cutaneous or dermal leishmaniasis (CL), including ""pian bois"" and ""chiclero ulcer"" in South America, ""Aleppo ''boil''"" in the Middle East, and ""Delhi boil"" in India, among others. The site of the sand fly bite usually forms a raised papule that expands and ulcerates, with a heaped up border on the edges. The disease becomes manifest over several weeks. There may be only one lesion, or multiple lesions may appear over time. The skin lesions take on a variety of appearances and may resemble ''acne'', ''warts'', or ''psoriasis''. They may look like large scaly, ulcerated plaques or form shallow ulcerated nodules. The lesions may be dry or weeping and are not usually painful unless secondarily infected by bacteria. Sores occur predominately on the extremities and face. They heal over months to years, leaving scars that often resemble old ''burns''. In severe cases, such as diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, nodular lesions may occur widely and last for years or even for life.''Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (ML) involves the nose, mouth, and larynx. It is less common than VL and CL. Initially, the patient experiences a nodule at the site of the sand fly bite with symptoms consistent with CL. Subsequently, mucocutaneous involvement leads to nodules inside the nose, perforation of the nasal septum, and enlargement of the nose or lips. If the larynx is involved, the voice changes as well. Ulcerated lesions may lead to scarring and tissue destruction that can be disfiguring.'   weight loss, which may be severe, low blood counts (pancytopenia), enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), which may distend the abdomen, fever, which is usually intermittent, high levels of immune globulin in the blood (hypergammaglobulinemia)."
How do health care professionals diagnose leishmaniasis?,"'In countries where the disease is common, medical professionals may presume that patients with compatible clinical symptoms and findings have leishmaniasis. Other patients require definitive diagnosis, done by examining tissue under a microscope (Figure 5) to detect the parasite or through a blood test to detect antibodies (see below). There is a skin test called the Montenegro skin test, but it is imperfect and not used for diagnosis of disease.''The guideline, ""Diagnosis and Treatment of Leishmaniasis: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH),"" published in 2016, recommends full thickness ''skin biopsy'' for diagnosis of CL, which allows testing for more than one infection. Bone marrow aspirate is preferred for diagnosis of VL by examining it for amastigotes and sending to a reference laboratory for ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') and/or culture. ''Lymph nodes'', liver, and ""buffy coat"" (white cells) from a blood specimen may also be used. The latter may be helpful in immune-suppressed individuals. Medical professionals can culture the specimen on special media, which allows the parasite to multiply, making detection easier under the microscope. In the United States, physicians should contact the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) to obtain testing advice and the appropriate media.''Anti-leishmanial antibodies in the blood can be detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (''ELISA''). Antibody assays are usually positive in VL but are not useful in CL and ML, because these conditions do not stimulate reliably and/or consistently elevated antibody titers in the blood. Antibody assays may be falsely negative in immune-suppressed individuals with VL, and health care providers should use other diagnostic methods.''It is important to remember that there are many diseases that can cause fever, ''weight loss'', skin lesions, or enlargement of organs. Conditions like ''malaria'', ''typhoid fever'', ''toxoplasmosis'', ''Chagas disease'', ''schistosomiasis'', ''tuberculosis'', ''histoplasmosis'', ''syphilis'', ''leprosy'', and others may be present with or mimic leishmaniasis. It is important not to miss other conditions, as well.' "
What is the treatment for leishmaniasis?,"'Because of the diversity of species and manifestations, and lack of extensive data, there is no drug or treatment of choice for leishmaniasis. Per the IDSA guideline and CDC recommendations, medical professionals must individualize treatment based on the species, type of syndrome, and geographic area. Physicians should consult with CDC experts and an infectious disease specialist. The only FDA-approved anti-leishmanials in the U.S. are liposomal amphotericin B and oral miltefosine. Amphotericin B has frequent side effects, including renal toxicity, and is FDA-approved for VL. Generally, patients tolerate miltefosine (Impavido) well, and it is FDA-approved for CL, VL, and ML caused by ''Leishmania braziliensis'', ''L. panamensis'', and ''L. guyanensis''. It is the first highly active oral agent for VL. ''Ketoconazole'' and ''fluconazole'' are azole antifungals that may be effective against certain species.''Patients may use traditional agents based on antimony, called pentavalent antimonial (SbV) compounds, intravenously or intramuscularly. Sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) is available in the U.S. for VL through the CDC Drug Service under an investigational new drug (IND) protocol. Some areas, such as the Indian state of Bihar, report high rates of drug-resistant VL. Short-course amphotericin B or even single-dose liposomal amphotericin B has been successful in Bihar. Pentamidine has been used second-line for VL and has a number of toxicities.''CL in a person with normal immunity may not require any treatment, depending on severity of the lesion, since it will resolve on its own in several weeks. Health care providers sometimes simply monitor cases with few lesions that are small and appear to be healing. More significant cases of disease is treated with medications, but treatment recommendations vary with where the disease was acquired and the species of ''Leishmania'' (if known). Possible treatments for cases arriving in the U.S. include oral ketoconazole (''Nizoral'', ''Extina'', ''Xolegel'', ''Kuric'') or topical compound of 15% ''paromomycin'' (Leshcutan). Other treatments include local heat therapy (requires local anesthesia) or repeated ''cryotherapy'' with liquid nitrogen over several weeks.'""Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is less common, and there is no clear consensus on treatment; as such, it's important to consult with the CDC and an infectious diseases physician.""  "
What is the prognosis of leishmaniasis?,"'Cutaneous leishmaniasis is rarely fatal but may result in disfiguring scars. People with CL should be educated about the manifestations of ML and monitored periodically for one or two years for this. Untreated, visceral leishmaniasis is usually fatal. Death can result directly from the disease through organ failure or wasting syndromes. It may also occur due to secondary bacterial infection, such as ''pneumonia''. Physicians should test patients with leishmaniasis for HIV because co-infection worsens both conditions if they are not treated together.' "
Is it possible to prevent leishmaniasis?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' for leishmaniasis, but some countries have practiced leishmanization in the recent past, using ''L. major'' to produce self-limited cases of CL that healed with immunity. While successful in reducing disease, it was discontinued due to cases of nonhealing lesions; ongoing research into non-live or milder ''strains'' seeks to revive safer options.''The best way to prevent leishmaniasis is to avoid the bite of the sand fly. Simple insect precautions, including protective clothing (long sleeves, shirts tucked into pants, long pants, and socks) and insect repellents containing N, N-diethylmetatoluamide (DEET) reduce the risk of bites. Because phlebotomine flies are most active in the evening and nighttime, people should make an effort to reduce exposure in sleeping accommodations. Sand flies are smaller than mosquitoes. People may use finely meshed bed nets impregnated with insecticides such as permethrin (''Elimite'', ''NIX'') or deltamethrin. Tuck bed nets under mattresses. Treat clothing with permethrin to repel insects and retreat the clothing every five washings. Treat domestic dogs that must travel to areas where ''Leishmania'' is transmissible with topical agents that kill or repel insects, such as Adantix, or an insecticide-containing collar, such as Scalibor, which contains deltamethrin. Keep dogs indoors in the evenings, as well. An anti-leishmanial canine vaccine (Cani Leish) is available in Europe.''From a larger perspective, treatment of infected animals and people along with judicious use of insecticide has the potential to reduce the burden of infection in endemic areas.' "
Where can people get more information about leishmaniasis?, The CDC has an excellent web site with information regarding leishmaniasis: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/. Additional information is available from the World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/en/.
What is leprosy?,"'Leprosy is a disease mainly caused by the bacteria ''Mycobacterium leprae'', which causes damage to the skin and the peripheral nervous system. The disease develops slowly (from six months to 40 years) and results in skin lesions and deformities, most often affecting the cooler places on the body (for example, eyes, nose, earlobes, hands, ''feet'', and testicles). The skin lesions and deformities can be very disfiguring and are the reason that historically people considered infected individuals outcasts in many cultures. Although human-to-human transmission is the primary source of infection, three other species can carry and (rarely) transfer ''M. leprae'' to humans: chimpanzees, mangabey monkeys, and nine-banded armadillos. The disease is termed a chronic granulomatous disease, similar to ''tuberculosis'', because it produces inflammatory nodules (granulomas) in the skin and peripheral nerves over time.' "
What is the history of leprosy (Hansen's disease)?,"'Unfortunately, the history of leprosy and its interaction with man is one of suffering and misunderstanding. The newest health research suggests that ''M. leprae'"" has infected people since at least as early as 4000 B.C., while the first known written reference to the disease was found on Egyptian papyrus in about 1550 B.C. The disease was well recognized in ancient China, Egypt, and India, and there are several references to the disease in the Bible. Many cultures thought the disease was a curse or punishment from the gods because they did not understand the disease, it's very disfiguring, slow to show symptoms and signs, and had no known treatment. Consequently, priests or holy men treated leprosy, not physicians.""'Since the disease often appeared in family members, some people thought it was hereditary. Other people noted that if there was little or no contact with infected individuals, the disease did not infect others. Consequently, some cultures considered infected people (and occasionally their close relatives) as ""unclean"" or as ""lepers"" and ruled they could not associate with uninfected people. Often infected people had to wear special clothing and ring bells so uninfected people could avoid them.''The Romans and the Crusaders brought the disease to Europe, and the Europeans brought it to the Americas. In 1873, Dr. Hansen discovered bacteria in leprosy lesions, suggesting leprosy was an infectious disease, not a hereditary disease or a punishment from the gods. However, many societies still ostracized patients with the disease, and religious personnel at missions cared for those with leprosy. Patients with leprosy were encouraged or forced to live in seclusion up to the 1940s, even in the United States (for example, the leper colony on Molokai, Hawaii, that was established by a priest, Father Damien and another colony or leprosarium established at Carville, La.), often because no effective treatments were available to patients at that time.'""Because of Hansen's discovery of ""'M. leprae'', researchers made efforts to find treatments (anti-leprosy agents) that would stop or eliminate ''M. leprae.'"" In the early 1900s to about 1940, medical professionals injected oil from Chaulmoogra nuts into patients' skin was with questionable efficacy. At Carville in 1941, promin, a sulfone drug, showed efficacy but required many painful injections. ""'Dapsone'' pills were found to be effective in the 1950s, but soon (1960s-1970s), ''M. leprae'' developed resistance to dapsone. Fortunately, drug trials on the island of Malta in the 1970s showed that a three-drug combination (dapsone, rifampicin [''Rifadin''], and ''clofazimine'' [''Lamprene'']) was very effective in killing ''M. leprae''. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended this multi-drug treatment (MDT) in 1981 and remains, with minor changes, the therapy of choice. MDT, however, does not alter the damage done to an individual by ''M. leprae'' before starting MDT.''Currently, there are several areas (India, East Timor) of the world where the WHO and other agencies (for example, the Leprosy Mission) are working to decrease the number of clinical leprosy cases and other diseases such as ''rabies'' and ''schistosomiasis'' that occur in remote regions. Although health researchers hope to eliminate leprosy like ''smallpox'', endemic (meaning prevalent or embedded in a region) leprosy makes complete eradication unlikely. In the U.S., leprosy has occurred infrequently but is endemic in Texas, Louisiana, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands by some investigators.''Leprosy is often termed ""Hansen\'s disease"" by many clinicians in an attempt to have leprosy patients forgo the stigmas attached to a leprosy diagnosis.'

What causes leprosy?,"'Leprosy is caused mainly by ''Mycobacterium leprae'', a rod-shaped slow-growing bacillus that is an obligate intracellular (only grows inside of certain human and animal cells) bacterium. ''M. leprae'' is termed an ""acid fast"" bacterium because of its chemical characteristics. When medical professionals use special stains for microscopic analysis, it stains red on a blue background due to mycolic acid content in its cell walls. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is an example of the special staining techniques used to view the acid-fast organisms under the microscope.'""Currently, the organisms cannot be cultured on artificial media. The bacteria take an extremely long time to reproduce inside of cells (about 12-14 days as compared to minutes to hours for most bacteria). The bacteria grow best at 80.9 F-86 F, so cooler areas of the body tend to develop the infection. The bacteria grow very well in the body's macrophages (a type of immune system cell) and Schwann cells (cells that cover and protect nerve axons). ""'M. leprae'' is genetically related to ''M. ''tuberculosis'' (the type of bacteria that cause tuberculosis) and other mycobacteria that infect humans. They are leprosy-related diseases. As with ''malaria'', patients with leprosy produce anti-endothelial antibodies (antibodies against the lining tissues of blood vessels), but the role of these antibodies in these diseases is still under investigation.''In 2009, investigators discovered a new ''Mycobacterium'' species, ''M. lepromatosis'', which causes diffuse disease (''lepromatous leprosy''). Considered one of the tropical diseases, this new species (determined by genetic analysis) appeared in patients located in Mexico and the Caribbean islands.' "
What are the risk factors for leprosy?,"'People at highest risk are those who live in the areas where leprosy is endemic (parts of India, China, Japan, Nepal, Egypt, and other areas) and especially those people in constant physical contact with infected people. In addition, there is some evidence that genetic defects in the immune system may cause certain people to be more likely to become infected (region q25 on chromosome 6). Additionally, people who handle certain animals known to carry the bacteria (for example, armadillos, African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque) are at risk of getting the bacteria from the animals, especially if they do not wear gloves while handling the animals.'  "
What are leprosy early symptoms and signs?,"'Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms of leprosy are very subtle and occur slowly (usually over years). The symptoms are similar to those that may occur with ''syphilis'', ''tetanus'', and ''leptospirosis''. The following are the major signs and symptoms of leprosy:''This long-term developing sequence of events begins and continues on the cooler areas of the body (for example, hands, feet, face, and knees).'

   Numbness (among the first symptoms) Loss of temperature sensation (among the first symptoms) Touch sensation reduced (among the first symptoms) Pins and needles sensations (among the first symptoms) Pain (joints) Deep pressure sensations are decreased or lost Nerve injury Weight loss Blisters and/or rashes Ulcers, relatively painless Skin lesions of hypopigmented macules (flat, pale areas of skin that lost color) Eye damage (dryness, reduced blinking) Large ulcerations (later symptoms and signs) Hair loss (for example, loss of eyebrows) Loss of digits (later symptoms and signs) Facial disfigurement (for example, loss of nose) (later symptoms and signs) Erythema nodosum leprosum: tender skin nodules accompanied by other symptoms like fever, joint pain, neuritis, and edema"
Are there different forms (classifications) of leprosy?,"""There are multiple forms of leprosy described in the literature. The forms of leprosy depend on the person's immune response to ""'M. leprae''. A good immune response can produce the so-called tuberculoid form of the disease, with limited skin lesions and some asymmetric nerve involvement. A poor immune response can result in the lepromatous form, characterized by extensive skin and symmetric nerve involvement. Some patients may have aspects of both forms. Currently, two classification systems exist in the medical literature: the WHO system and the Ridley-Jopling system. The Ridley-Jopling system is composed of six forms or classifications, listed below according to increasing severity of symptoms:''Globally, health care professionals use the Ridley-Jopling classification in evaluating patients in clinical studies. However, the WHO classification system is more widely used. It has only two forms or classifications of leprosy. The 2009 WHO classifications depend on the number of skin lesions as follows:''However, the WHO further modifies these two classifications with clinical criteria because ""of the non-availability or non-dependability of the skin-smear services. The clinical system of classification for the purpose of treatment includes the use of number of skin lesions and nerves involved as the basis for grouping leprosy patients into multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy."" Investigators state that up to about four to five skin lesions constitutes paucibacillary leprosy, while about five or more constitutes multibacillary leprosy.''Multidrug therapy (MDT) with three antibiotics (dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine) treat multibacillary leprosy, while a modified MDT with two antibiotics (dapsone and rifampicin) is recommended for paucibacillary leprosy and composes most current treatments today (see treatment section below). Paucibacillary leprosy usually includes indeterminate, tuberculoid, and borderline tuberculoid leprosy from the Ridley-Jopling classification, while multibacillary leprosy usually includes the double (mid-) borderline, borderline lepromatous, and lepromatous leprosy.' Indeterminate leprosy: a few hypopigmented macules; can heal spontaneously, this form persists or advances to other forms Tuberculoid leprosy: a few hypopigmented macules, some are large and some become anesthetic (lose pain sensation); some neural involvement in which nerves become enlarged; spontaneous resolution in a few years, persists or advances to other forms; cell-mediated immune response appears in this classification but is almost absent in lepromatous leprosy Borderline tuberculoid leprosy: lesions like tuberculoid leprosy but smaller and more numerous with less nerve enlargement. This form may persist, revert to tuberculoid leprosy, or advance to other forms Mid-borderline leprosy: many reddish plaques that are asymmetrically distributed, moderately anesthetic, with regional adenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). The form may persist, regress to another form, or progress Borderline lepromatous leprosy: many skin lesions with macules (flat lesions) papules (raised bumps), plaques, and nodules, sometimes with or without anesthesia; the form may persist, regress or progress to lepromatous leprosy Lepromatous leprosy: Early lesions are pale macules (flat areas) that are diffuse and symmetric. Later medical professionals can find many M. leprae organisms in the lesions. Alopecia (hair loss) occurs. Often patients have no eyebrows or eyelashes. As the disease progresses, nerve involvement leads to anesthetic areas and limb weakness. Progression leads to aseptic necrosis (tissue death from lack of blood to area), lepromas (skin nodules), and disfigurement of many areas, including the face. The lepromatous form does not regress to the other less severe forms. Histoid leprosy is a clinical variant of lepromatous leprosy that presents with clusters of histiocytes (a type of cell involved in the inflammatory response) and a grenz zone (an area of collagen separating the lesion from normal tissue) seen in microscopic tissue sections. Paucibacillary leprosy: skin lesions with no bacilli (M. leprae) seen in a skin smear Multibacillary leprosy: skin lesions with bacilli (M. leprae) seen in a skin smear"
How does leprosy spread? Is leprosy contagious?,"'Researchers suggest that ''M. leprae'' spreads person to person by nasal secretions or droplets from the upper respiratory tract and nasal mucosa. However, the disease is not highly ''contagious'' like the ''flu'"". They speculate that infected droplets reach other peoples' nasal passages and begin the infection there. Some investigators suggest the infected droplets can infect others by entering breaks in the skin. ""'M. leprae'' apparently cannot infect intact skin. Rarely, humans get leprosy from the few animal species mentioned above. Occurrence in animals makes it difficult to eradicate leprosy from endemic sources. Medical researchers are still investigating routes of transmission for leprosy. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that several genes (about seven) are associated with an increased susceptibility to leprosy. Some researchers now conclude that susceptibility to leprosy may be partially inheritable. The incubation period for leprosy varies from about six months to 20 years.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose leprosy?,"'Physicians diagnose the majority of cases of leprosy by clinical findings, especially since most current cases are diagnosed in areas that have limited or no laboratory equipment available. Hypopigmented patches of skin or reddish skin patches with loss of sensation, thickened peripheral nerves, or both clinical findings together often comprise the clinical diagnosis. Skin smears or biopsy material that show acid-fast bacilli with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or the Fite stain (biopsy) can diagnose multibacillary leprosy, or if bacteria are absent, diagnose paucibacillary leprosy. Other tests can be done, but specialized labs perform most of these, which may help a clinician to place the patient in the more detailed Ridley-Jopling classification and are not routinely done (lepromin test, phenolic glycolipid-1 test, ''PCR'', lymphocyte migration inhibition test or LMIT). Health care providers may perform other tests such as ''CBC'' test, ''liver function'' tests, ''creatinine'' test, or a nerve biopsy to help determine if other organ systems have been affected.' "
What is the treatment for leprosy?,"'Antibiotics treat the majority of cases (mainly clinically diagnosed) of leprosy. The recommended antibiotics, their dosages, and length of time of administration are based on the form or classification of the disease and whether or not the patient is under medical supervision. In general, two antibiotics (dapsone and rifampicin) treat paucibacillary leprosy, while multibacillary leprosy is treated with the same two plus a third antibiotic, clofazimine. Usually, medical professionals administer the antibiotics for at least six to 12 months or more to cure the disease.''Antibiotics can treat paucibacillary leprosy with little or no residual effects on the patient. Multibacillary leprosy can be kept from advancing, and living ''M. leprae'' can be essentially eliminated from the person by antibiotics, but the damage done before antibiotics are administered is usually not reversible. Recently, the WHO suggested that single-dose treatment of patients with only one skin lesion with rifampicin, ''minocycline'' (''Minocin''), or ''ofloxacin'"" (Floxin) is effective. Studies of other antibiotics are ongoing. Each patient, depending on the above criteria, has a schedule for their individual treatment, so a clinician knowledgeable about that patient's initial diagnostic classification should plan a patient's treatment schedules. .""'Medical professionals have used steroid medications to minimize pain and acute inflammation with leprosy; however, controlled trials showed no significant long-term effects on nerve damage.''The role for surgery in the treatment of leprosy occurs after a patient completes medical treatment (antibiotics) with negative skin smears (no detectable acid-fast bacilli) and is often only needed in advanced cases. Medical professionals individualize surgery for each patient with the goal to attempt cosmetic improvements and, if possible, to restore limb function and some neural functions that were lost to the disease.'""Special clinics run by the National Hansen's Disease Program may treat some people in the United States.""'As is the case with many diseases, the lay literature contains home remedies. For example, purported home remedies include a paste made from the neem plant, ''Hydrocotyle'', also known as ''Cantella asiatica'', and even aromatherapy with frankincense. Patients should discuss any home remedies with their physician before using such methods; often there is little or no scientific data to uphold these cure claims.'

What are the complications of leprosy?,"'The complications of leprosy depend on how quickly medical professionals diagnose and effectively treat the disease. Very few complications occur if physicians treat the disease early enough, but the following is a list of complications that can occur when diagnosis and treatment is either delayed or started late in the disease process:''In addition, the sensory loss causes people to injure body parts without the individual being aware that there is an injury. This can lead to additional problems such as infections and poor ''wound'' healing.' Sensory loss (usually begins in extremities) Permanent nerve damage (usually in extremities) Muscle weakness Progressive disfigurement (for example, eyebrows lost, disfigurement of the toes, fingers, and nose)"
What health care specialists treat leprosy?,"'Although pediatricians and primary care doctors usually follow patients with leprosy, health care professionals often make the initial diagnosis and treatment in consultation with infectious disease specialists, dermatologists, neurologists, and/or immunologists. Some patients may require consultation with a surgeon to restore some functions of movement and/or do cosmetic repairs.' "
Is it possible to prevent leprosy?,"'Prevention'' of contact with droplets from nasal and other secretions from patients with untreated ''M. leprae'' infection is currently the most effective way to avoid the disease. Treatment of patients with appropriate antibiotics stops the person from spreading the disease. People who live with individuals who have untreated leprosy are about eight times as likely to develop the disease, because investigators speculate that family members have close proximity to infectious droplets. Leprosy is not hereditary, but recent findings suggest susceptibility to the disease may have a genetic basis.'""Many people have exposures to leprosy throughout the world, but the disease in not highly contagious. Researchers suggest that most exposures result in no disease, and further studies suggest that susceptibility depends, in part, on a person's genetic ""'makeup''. In the U.S., there are about 200-300 new cases diagnosed per year, with most coming from exposures during foreign travel. The majority of worldwide cases occur in the tropics or subtropics (for example, Brazil, India, and Indonesia). The WHO reports about 500,000 to 700,000 new cases per year worldwide, with curing of about 14 million cases since 1985.''There is no commercially available ''vaccine'' available to prevent leprosy. However, there are reports that using BCG vaccine alone, the BCG vaccine along with heat-killed ''M. leprae'' organisms, and other preparations may be protective, help to clear the infection or possibly shorten treatment. Except for BCG being obtainable in some countries, these other preparations are not readily available.''Animals (chimpanzees, mangabey monkeys, and nine-banded armadillos) rarely transfer ''M. leprae'' to humans. Nonetheless, it is not advisable to handle such animals in the wild. These animals are a source for endemic infections.' "
What is the prognosis of leprosy?,"""The prognosis of leprosy varies with the stage of the disease when medical professionals diagnose and treat it. For example, early diagnosis and treatment limits or prevents tissue damage so the person has a good outcome. However, if the patient's infection has progressed to more advanced disease, the complications listed above can markedly affect the patient's lifestyle, and thus the condition has a fair to poor prognosis.""

Where can I find more information on leprosy?,"'""Leprosy Elimination,"" World Health Organization''http://www.who.int/lep/mdt/en/''""Hansen\'s Disease,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''https://www.cdc.gov/leprosy/' "
What is leprosy?,"'Leprosy'"", also termed Hansen's disease, is a chronic infection caused by the bacterium ""'Mycobacterium leprae'', a rod-shaped organism that stains reddish when an acid-fast stain is applied. Historians suggest leprosy was recognized as a disease as early as 600 BC; because of the disfigurement of individuals with untreated leprosy, people with leprosy have been shunned and isolated for many centuries. Fortunately, current multidrug therapy (MDT) has reduced leprosy so effectively that only a few countries still have individuals with this disease. Currently, the disease is rarely seen in the United States.''Leprosy has been classified into two major types: tuberculoid and lepromatous. However, there are intermediate subtypes (borderline, mid-borderline, and others). Tuberculoid leprosy has a more limited disease pattern and relatively few bacteria located in the infected tissue, while patients with ''lepromatous leprosy'' have widespread disease and much larger numbers of bacteria in infected tissue. These terms are still seen in the literature but are being replaced by the terms ''paucibacillary'' (for tuberculoid) and ''multibacillary'' (for lepromatous) types.''Mycobacterium leprae'' can infect armadillos that are indigenous to the southwest United States; occasionally, people can get leprosy if they handle these animals. Another form of leprosy is seen in ''dogs'' and cats (canine leprosy). Although canine leprosy is caused by ''Mycobacterium'' species, there is no good evidence that canine leprosy is transmitted to humans by pets.' "
Is leprosy contagious?,"'Leprosy is ''contagious'' but is considered to be only mildly contagious. However, acquisition of the disease usually occurs after long-term (months to years) contact with an untreated individual with the disease. It is passed from person to person via droplets from the nose and mouth during close and frequent contact with an untreated individual with leprosy.' "
What is the incubation period for leprosy?,"'The bacteria are slow-growing; the incubation period for leprosy is about five years (two to 10 years), and it can take as long as about 20 years before symptoms and signs of leprosy (skin lesions, nerve damage, for example) develop in some patients. ' "
How will I know if someone has leprosy?,"'Because symptoms appear so slowly after infection (from about two to 10 years), it may be difficult to tell that someone has leprosy. Skin lesions (lumps, ''bumps'', or sores), loss of eyebrows, and numbness in the skin where lesions are present are often among the first signs and symptoms of leprosy. Other signs and symptoms include thick ''dry skin'', muscle ''weakness'' or ''paralysis'', nosebleeds, ulcers (especially on the ''feet''), numbness, and/or severe ''pain''. As the disease progresses, extremities may be slowly lost (for example, toes, fingers, and nose). The diagnosis of leprosy can be made by scraping lesions and staining the skin scrapings of lesions and/or mucous secretions with an acid-fast stain to demonstrate the presence of ''Mycobacterium leprae''.' "
How is leprosy transmitted?,"""Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is spread from person to person. This spread can occur with direct person-to-person contact and/or by contaminated droplets that are released during ""'coughing'' or ''sneezing''. Individuals who inhale the contaminated droplets can develop leprosy.' "
How will I know someone is cured of leprosy?,"'Before the 1940s, there was no effective cure for leprosy. Since that time, antimicrobial medications have been used to stop or limit the disease. The key to the cure of leprosy is early treatment before irreparable damage to the patient occurs. Currently, leprosy is treatable with combination antibiotic therapy that lasts for about six months to two years, depending on the extent of the disease in an individual patient. Most individuals can be cured of leprosy; this occurs when all of the slow-growing ''Mycobacterium leprae'"" bacteria are killed by the antibiotic treatment and the patient's immune response. However, even though the person is cured of leprosy by antibiotic treatment, damage to organ systems (nerve damage, tissue loss) that has occurred during the infection will not be repaired."" "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about leprosy?,"'Individual should contact medical ''caregiver'' if they have a high risk of exposure to leprosy and develop any symptoms or signs of the condition. For example, individuals who live in a country where leprosy is endemic, like Brazil, India, Nepal, the Marshall Islands, and several other countries (see references for an extensive list), have a higher chance of developing leprosy.''Armadillos, commonly found in the southern United States, can be naturally infected and carry ''Mycobacterium leprae''. It is possible to become infected after handling these animals. People who handle armadillos and develop any signs or symptoms of leprosy should inform a physician about their contact with armadillos.'  "
What is leptospirosis?,"""Leptospirosis (also known as Weil's disease, grippotyphosa, and canicola) is a disease caused by bacteria (""'Leptospira interrogans'') that produce a wide range of symptoms that may occur in two phases; some patients may develop kidney or ''liver'' failure, respiratory failure, meningitis, or even death. The bacterial infection is spread by the urine of infected animals from many species, both domesticated (such as ''dogs'' and horses) and wild infected animals (such as rodents or wild pigs). It is termed a ''zoonotic disease'' or a ''zoonosis'' because it occurs in wild animals. The bacteria can survive in freshwater and soil for months. The disease is most common in temperate and tropical climates. The infecting bacteria occur worldwide (for example, in the United States, ''Leptospira'"" has been found in Hawaii's freshwater ponds and waterfalls)."" "
What causes leptospirosis?,"'The cause of leptospirosis is bacteria (genus ''Leptospira'' and species ''interrogans''), a Gram-negative spirochete (spiral-shaped bacteria). The ''Leptospira'' bacteria infect many types of animals (many wild animals, rodents, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, for example) that subsequently contaminate water, lakes, rivers, soil, and crops when they urinate because the bacteria are present in urine. The bacteria then infect humans when they invade through breaks in the skin or ''mucus'' membranes or when people ingest them. The bacteria multiply in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Person-to-person transfer of this disease is rare.' "
Is leptospirosis contagious? What is the contagious period for leptospirosis?,"'In general, human leptospirosis is considered weakly ''contagious''. This is because, like other animals, humans can shed leptospirosis in the urine during and after illness. Consequently, individuals exposed to the urine of humans who are infected may become infected. For example, although the bacteria are not airborne and have a low risk of being in saliva, individuals handling wet bedding or blood-soaked material from an infected person can increase the chances of getting the infection. There are a few reports of transmission between sexual partners, but the incidence of this type of spread seems very low. Unfortunately, ''pregnant'' mothers who get leptospirosis can infect their fetus.''The contagious period for leptospirosis depends on how long viable organisms are shed in the urine. Most individuals will shed organisms in the urine for a few weeks but there are reports that humans can continue to shed the organisms in urine for as long as 11 months. Some experts suggest that there is risk for up to 12 months after getting the initial infection.' "
What is the incubation period for leptospirosis?,'The incubation period for leptospirosis is approximately seven to 12 days but it may range from two to 30 days.' 
What are risk factors for leptospirosis?,"'Risk factors include occupational exposure in people to with farm animals, wild animals, and to contaminated water and soil (farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, miners, military personnel, disaster workers and victims, for example). People who participate in outdoor activities such as camping or kayaking are also at higher risk for infection. Any exposure to sewage or animal waste, including stools from infected dogs, increases the risk of getting leptospirosis. Heavy rainfall may cause the bacterial infection to increase in a population that experiences flooding. This is evidenced by a reported four deaths from leptospirosis due to flooding in Puerto Rico.' "
What are leptospirosis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of leptospirosis are variable and are similar to those seen in many other diseases (''dengue fever'', ''hantavirus'', ''brucellosis'', ''malaria'', and others). Symptoms can arise about two days to four weeks after exposure to the bacteria. Although some people have no symptoms, others may exhibit''These symptoms usually occur in the first phase of the infection, and when present, they often occur abruptly. Some patients resolve their symptoms and do not progress to the second phase. Others may seem to briefly recover but relapse (about 5%-10%) with more severe symptoms and organ damage in the severe form of the disease. The second-phase symptoms may overlap with the first-phase symptoms in severe disease and include the following:'""This is the second phase of leptospirosis, called Weil's disease. If it's not treated, it may not resolve for several months, and some patients may develop long-term complications such as kidney and lung problems. The death rate is about 1%-5%.""  high fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and muscle pain, fatigue, sore throat, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, pain in the joints or muscles, rash, and reddish eyes. Jaundice Renal failure (kidney damage) Pulmonary hemorrhage Cardiac arrhythmias Pneumonitis Septic shock"
What specialists treat leptospirosis?,"'Clinic doctors, primary care doctors, pediatricians, and emergency-medicine specialists often treat leptospirosis in countries where it is endemic and the patients are in the first phase of the disease. Other specialists are often consulted if the patient begins to enter the second phase of the disease. These specialists may include critical care, infectious-disease, hospitalists, internists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, and kidney specialists.' "
How do physicians diagnose leptospirosis?,"""Physicians make a presumptive diagnosis based on the patient's history and physical exam. Only specialized labs perform serological serology tests for leptospirosis serogroups (specific types of the bacteria that react with certain antibodies). Health care professionals may perform definitive tests by isolating the bacteria from the patient (blood or CSF) or by a positive microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Other tests (""'ELISA'', ''PCR'', urine dipsticks) may provide additional evidence of infection. Patients with severe symptoms should be treated as confirmatory tests are time consuming.' "
What is the treatment for leptospirosis?,"'Although there is controversy about using antibiotics in the first phase of leptospirosis, antibiotics (''penicillin'' - penicillin G, ''ampicillin'' [Omnipen, Polycillin, Principen], ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', ''Trimox'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid''], or ''erythromycin'' [E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''PCE'', Pediazole, Ilosone]) are recommended for treatment of patients with phase two or more severe symptoms. Some patients may require IV antibiotics and supportive hospital care such as rehydration.''For those clinicians who choose to treat phase-one patients, the choice of antibiotics includes the above, but many choose to treat with doxycycline.' "
What is the prognosis of leptospirosis?,"""Overall, the prognosis of leptospirosis is good. Many people become infected and spontaneously recover without treatment. However, the prognosis worsens as the symptoms increase. People with Weil's disease may have a prognosis ranging from good to poor, depending on their response to treatment. Pregnant women who become infected have a high rate of fetal mortality, especially if they acquire the disease early in ""'pregnancy''.' "
Is a vaccine available for leptospirosis? Is it possible to prevent leptospirosis?,"'A leptospirosis vaccine is not currently available in the U.S.; however, high-risk workers in some European and Asian countries may have access to a vaccine. Unfortunately, the ''vaccines'' are serovar-specific (bacterial-strain specific) and thus do not offer widespread protection as there are over 200 serovars (immunologically distinct types of the bacteria). Some vaccines are available for animals but these, like the human vaccines, are only effective against a narrow range of serovars. In addition, side effects of the vaccine can cause painful swelling. Chemoprophylaxis (using ''drugs'' to prevent illness) is possible under certain circumstances. Some individuals who may have high short-time risk (for example, military personnel) may take doxycycline (200 mg/week), beginning one to two days before potential exposure to have about a 95% chance of preventing infection with chemoprophylaxis. This preventive treatment is not recommended for long terms of exposure.''Avoiding contact with animal excrement, good hygiene, and avoiding contaminated water and soil are other ways to reduce the chance of getting leptospirosis.'""Dogs, and many other animals, can be infected with leptospirosis. Veterinarians have access to vaccines that can protect (or prevent) leptospirosis in dogs and other animals for at least 12 months. This vaccination may help protect the animals' owners and other local or family owned animals from the disease for approximately one year."" "
What Is a Lesionectomy?,"'A lesionectomy is an operation to remove a lesion -- a damaged or abnormally functioning area -- in the brain. ''Brain lesions'' include tumors, ''scars'' from a ''head injury'' or infection, abnormal blood vessels, and hematomas (a swollen area filled with blood).''A lesion causes ''seizures'' -- also called the ''seizure'' focus -- in about 20% to 30% of people with ''epilepsy'' that do not improve after taking medication (intractable or refractory ''epilepsy''). It is not known for certain if the lesion itself triggers the ''seizures'', or if the seizures result from irritation to the brain tissue surrounding the lesion. For this reason, surgery may also include the removal of a small rim of brain tissue around the lesion, called lesionectomy plus corticectomy.' "
Who Is a Candidate for Lesionectomy?,"'Lesionectomy may be an option for people whose ''epilepsy'' is linked to a defined lesion and whose seizures are not controlled by medication. In addition, it must be possible to remove the lesion and surrounding brain tissue without causing damage to areas of the brain responsible for vital functions, such as movement, sensation, language, and memory. There also must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery.' "
What Happens Before a Lesionectomy?,"'Candidates for lesionectomy undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation-including ''seizure'' monitoring, electroencephalography (''EEG'') and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'""). These tests help to pinpoint the location of the lesion and confirm that the lesion is the source of the seizures. Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures."" "
What Happens During a Lesionectomy?,"'A lesionectomy requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (""Crani"" refers to the skull and ""otomy"" means ""to cut into."") After the patient is put to ''sleep'' with general anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts special instruments for removing the brain tissue. Surgical microscopes are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of the lesion and surrounding brain tissue. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during pre-surgical brain imaging to help identify abnormal brain tissue and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions.''In some cases, a portion of the surgery is performed while the patient is awake, using medication to keep the person relaxed and ''pain''-free. This is done so that the patient can help the surgeon find and avoid vital areas of the brain. While the patient is awake, the doctor uses special probes to stimulate different areas of the brain. At the same time, the patient is asked to count, identify pictures, or perform other tasks. The surgeon can then identify the area of the brain associated with each task. After the brain tissue is removed, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using ''stitches'' or staples.' "
What Happens After a Lesionectomy?,"'After a lesionectomy, the patient generally stays in an intensive care unit for 24 to 48 hours after surgery and then stays in a regular hospital room for three to four days. Most people who have a lesionectomy will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure medication. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is a Lesionectomy?,'Lesionectomy results are excellent in patients whose seizures are clearly associated with a defined lesion. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed.' 
What Are the Side Effects of a Lesionectomy?,"'Side effects of a lesionectomy vary, depending on the location and extent of the lesion and the tissue removed. The following side effects may occur after surgery, although they generally go away on their own:' Scalp numbness. Nausea. Feeling tired or depressed. Headaches. Difficulty speaking, remembering, or finding words."
What Risks Are Associated With a Lesionectomy?,"'The risks associated with lesionectomy include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia. Failure to relieve seizures. Swelling in the brain. Damage to healthy brain tissue."
Facts you should know about brain lesions," The brain is perhaps the most important organ in the body, responsible for the unconscious autonomic activities like breathing, blood pressure and temperature control, sensation, movement, and thought processes. Neurons and glia are the two types of cells that make up the brain. Each area of the brain has a responsibility for brain function. A brain lesion describes an area of damaged brain. It may be isolated or there may be numerous areas affected. Symptoms of a brain lesion depend upon what part of the brain is affected and may be minimal or life-threatening. Diagnosis of brain lesions begin with a careful history and physical examination of the affected individual. The brain may be imaged in a variety of ways including CT, MRI and angiography. Treatment and prognosis of brain lesions depend upon the underlying illness or injury, and the amount of damage sustained by the brain."
Brain anatomy,"'The brain is responsible for regulation the functions of the body, from the unconscious (controlling ''blood pressure'', ''heart'' rate and respiratory rate) to the conscious acts like ''walking'' and talking. Add the intellectual processes of thought and the brain is a busy part of the ''human body''. ''The brain has many parts. The cerebrum consists of two hemispheres which are responsible for movement, sensation, thought, judgment, problem solving, and emotion. The brain stem sits beneath the cerebrum and connects it to the spinal cord. The brain stem houses the structures that are responsible for the unconscious regulation of the body such as wakefulness, heart and lung function, hunger, temperature control, and swallowing. The cerebellum is located beneath and behind the cerebrum and is responsible for posture, balance, and coordination.''While the brainstem is important in maintaining body function, the cerebrum allows body motion and most importantly, is responsible for all the things that make humans special, like thinking and emotion. There are four lobes in each hemisphere: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital.''Brain cells use ''glucose'' almost exclusively for their energy needs and unlike other organs in the body, the brain cannot store glucose for future use. If ''blood sugar'' levels fall, brain function can be immediately compromised.''The brain gets its blood supply through four major arteries, the right and left carotids and the right and left vertebral arteries. They join together at the base of the brain at the Circle of Willis. Smaller blood vessels then branch out to provide oxygen and glucose rich blood to all regions of the brain.''The brain is composed of billions of cells that use chemicals and electricity to communicate between themselves and the rest of the body. There are two major types of cells, neurons and glial cells; there are subtypes of these cells.' Frontal lobe is the area responsible for personality and movement. The pre-frontal portion is perhaps the most evolved part of the brain and specifically allows judgment, planning and organization, problem solving, and critical thinking. This is the area that gives us the ability to feel emotion and have empathy. Finally, this is where impulse control resides. Parietal lobes are where sensation is processed and interpreted. Aside from touch, pressure and pain, there is also the concept of spatial cognition, where the brain recognizes where the body is in relationship to the area around it. Temporal lobes are where the functions of memory, speech, and hearing are located. Occipital lobes are where vision is located. Neurons are the cells that process and transmit information in the brain. Each cell has two connectors, the axon and dendrite. The axon of one neuron connects with the dendrite of another at junction or synapse. Special chemicals called neurotransmitters help transfer the electrical impulse across the synapse so that one neuron can excite another. Glial cells are located between neurons and help support their activity.  Microglial cells are part of the immune system within brain tissue helping clear dead cells and other debris.  Astrocytes help clear neurotransmitter chemicals so that the synapse can be ready to react to the next signal that might arrive.  Oligodendrocytes produce and maintain the myelin sheath that coats and insulates the axon making electrical conduction more efficient.  Ependymal cells produce CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) which is located within the ventricles of the brain and in the subarachnoid space that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Aside from allowing the brain to float in the skull, CSF acts as a cushion against trauma and also helps wash away some of the metabolic waster protects that are produced with brain function."
What are brain lesions?,"'A brain lesion describes damage or destruction to any part of the brain. It may be due to ''trauma'' or any other disease that can cause inflammation, malfunction, or destruction of a brain cells or brain tissue. A lesion may be localized to one part of the brain or they may be widespread. The initial damage may be so small as to not produce any initial symptoms, but progresses over time to cause obvious physical and mental changes.''A brain lesion may affect the neuron directly or one of the glial cells thereby indirectly affecting neuron functions.' "
What causes brain lesions?,"   Trauma is the most widely recognized cause of an acute brain injury. Bleeding or swelling within the skull can directly damage brain cells or the pressure that can build within the skull can compress the brain and compromise its ability to function. Trauma can also damage the brain on a microscopic level. Shear injuries describe damage to the synapse connections between brain cells decreasing their ability to communicate with each other. Recent reports have linked concussions to the gradual destruction of brain cells that can affect personality and thinking. Inflammation within brain tissue can affect function. This inflammation may be due to infections that cause meningitis and encephalitis. Other infections may cause discrete changes within the brain tissue. Neurocysticercosis, for example, is the most common cause of epilepsy in the developing world; the parasite causes small calcifications that are scattered throughout the brain. Infections may also form abscesses within the brain that can lead to symptoms. Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that may affect brain function include sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Some of the brain damage may be caused by inflammation to the blood vessels in the brain, which causes strokes. Certain diseases affect only specific cells within the brain. For example, the symptoms of multiple sclerosis are caused by damage to the glial cells that manufacture and maintain the myelin sheath that insulates axons. Without this normal nerve covering, electrical transmission is compromised and symptoms may occur. Alzheimer's disease and other dementias occur when neuron cells are affected and die prematurely. Stroke or cerebral infarction (cerebral=brain + infarction=loss of blood supply) describes the condition where blood supply to part of the brain is lost and the brain stops functioning. There are numerous reasons for blood supply to decrease. There may be gradual narrowing of an artery to part of the brain, blockage may occur should debris from a diseased carotid artery break loose, or a clot may travel or embolize from the heart. Bleeding may occur from a cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation or because of uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). Tumors that originate from brain cells or those that metastasize from other organs can affect brain function in two ways. The tumor can destroy brain cells so that their function is lost, or the tumor can take up space and cause pressure and swelling that affects brain cell function. This may occur with benign or cancerous tumors. Common tumors that arise from the brain include meningiomas, adenomas, and gliomas. Pituitary adenomas are common benign tumors that grow in the sella tursica, where the pituitary gland sits and near where the optic nerves travel from the eyes to the occiput in the back of the brain. As the tumor grows it can push on the optic nerve and cause visual changes and blindness. Glioblastoma multiforme, a malignant tumor is the most common type of astrocytoma that arises from astrocytes and is a glioma. Victims of this tumor include Senator Ted Kennedy, George Gershwin, and Ethel Merman. Cerebral palsy describes the condition where a developing infant's brain is deprived of oxygen and fails to develop normally. This may occur in the uterus before birth or may be due to an injury or illness that happens within the first couple of years of life. Often it is an infection or bleeding that is the cause, though many times the reason for cerebral palsy is never found."
What are the types of brain lesions?,"'There are many types of brain lesions. The brain can be affected by a host of potential injuries that can decrease its function. The type of lesion depends upon the type of insult that the brain receives.''Aging'':'' Some lesions occur as a result of ''aging'' with loss of brain cells as they naturally age and die. If enough cells die, atrophy can occur and brain function decreases. This may present with symptoms of loss of memory, poor judgment, loss of insight and general loss of mental agility.''Genetic:'"" Lesions related to a person's genetic ""'makeup'', such as people with ''neurofibromatosis''.''Vascular:'' Loss of brain cells also occurs with ''stroke''. With ischemic strokes (CVA) blood supply to an area of the brain is lost, brain cells die and the part of the body they control loses its function.''Bleeding:'' Strokes can also be hemorrhagic, where bleeding occurs in part of the brain, again damaging brain cells and causing loss of function. Uncontrolled ''high blood pressure'', AV malformations, and brain aneurysms are some causes of bleeding in the brain.''Trauma:'' Bleeding in the brain may be caused by trauma and a blow to the head. Bleeding may occur within brain tissue or in the spaces surrounding the brain. Epidural and subdural hematomas describe ''blood clots'' that form in the spaces between the meninges or tissues that line the brain and spinal cord. As the clot expands, pressure increases within the skull and compresses the brain.''Acceleration/deceleration injury:'' Sometimes trauma can affect the brain with no evidence of bleeding on ''CT scan''. Acceleration deceleration injuries can cause significant damage to brain tissue and connections causing microscopic swelling. ''Shaken baby syndrome'' is a good example of acceleration/deceleration type injury, where the brain bounces against the inner lining of the skull.''Infection and inflammation:'' Infectious agents resulting in diseases such as ''meningitis'', brain abscesses or ''encephalitis''Tumors:'' Tumors are types of brain lesions and may be benign (meningiomas are the most common) or ''malignant'' like ''glioblastoma'' multiforme. Tumors in the brain may also be metastatic, spreading from ''cancers'' that arise primarily from another organ. Symptoms occur depending upon the location and size of the tumor.''Immune:'' Immunologic causes may also affect the brain, for example diseases like ''multiple sclerosis''.''Plaques:'' Some investigators suggest that abnormal deposits of material that form plaques may be a type of disease that causes damage and eventual brain cell death in diseases like '""Alzheimer's disease""'.''Toxins:'' Toxins may affect brain function and may be produced within the body or may be ingested. The most common ingested poison is ''alcohol'', though other chemicals can adversely affect the brain. Individuals can develop ''encephalopathy'' due to a variety of chemicals and substances that build up in the blood stream. Ammonia levels rise in patients with ''liver'' failure while patients with ''kidney failure'' can become uremic.''Multiple types:'' The type of lesion depends upon its cause and symptoms depend upon its location and amount of brain irritation or damage that has occurred. Some brain lesions types may occur from more than one cause, such as '""Alzheimer's disease""' that may be related to plaque formation, brain cell death, and possibly genetics. Research is ongoing and is likely to provide better insights into these various brain lesion types.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of brain lesions?,"'Symptoms of a brain lesion depend upon what part of the brain is affected. Large parts of the brain can be involved in some diseases and there may be relatively few symptoms. Alternatively, very tiny lesions may be catastrophic if they occur in a critical part of the brain. For example, the reticular activating system (RAS) is a tiny area located within the brainstem that is effectively the master on/off switch of the brain. If a midbrain ''stroke'' affects this area, the result is permanent ''coma'"". A patient needs the RAS and one functioning hemisphere of the cortex to be awake. If the patient is unconscious, then the RAS isn't working or there is significant damage to both sides of the brain.""'Initial signs and symptoms of a brain lesion are often non-specific and may include:''If any of these symptoms arise suddenly, the person should be evaluated immediately, usually in an emergency department that is well equipped (CT scanner, ''MRI'', easy access to neurosurgeons and neurologists). '   Headache Nausea Fever (if an infection is present) Neck pain and stiffness (if the meninges are inflamed) Affected vision (if there is damage along the pathway from the optic nerve to the occiput) Affected speech (if there is damage to Broca's area) Speech includes saying and understanding words.  Difficulty making words (due to weakness of the muscles that control the mouth) Weakness or paralysis to one side of the body Seizures Memory loss and confusion Personality changes, loss of concentration, aggression and loss of personal control Worst headache of your life"
How do doctors diagnose brain lesions?,"'The diagnosis of a brain lesion begins with the health care practitioner taking a history and asking the patient questions about the symptoms such as:''Depending upon the circumstances, the patient may not have insight or may not remember the symptoms or complaints, and it may be up to a family member, ''caregiver'', or friend to supply the appropriate information.''Medical history and physical exams''Past medical history of the patient, exploring associated symptoms and complaints may be helpful in determining the diagnosis.''Physical examination is very helpful in trying to localize a potential brain lesion. A careful neurologic exam may be useful in finding weakness, change in sensation (including light touch, ''pain'', vibration, and position sense), and coordination. Mental status, agility, other organ systems are often assessed. For example, patients who have an irregular heart rate called ''atrial fibrillation'' are at risk for ''stroke''. ''Stroke'' risk may also be increased in patients with carotid stenosis and the health care practitioner may listen over the neck for a bruit (an abnormal sound made by blood rushing through a narrowed carotid artery).''Depending upon the clinical situation, imaging of the brain such as ''computerized tomography'' (CT) and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) may be useful in making the diagnosis of a brain lesion. ''Angiography'' can be added to either CT or MRI to visualize the blood vessels in the brain.''Lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'') is often considered to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for infection, bleeding, or abnormal proteins; depending upon the clinical situation.''Blood tests are usually preformed, to explore any illnesses that can also involve the brain.'   When did they start? Do they come and go or are they constant? Have they progressed over time? What makes them better or worse?"
What is the treatment for brain lesions?,'Treatment for brain lesions depends upon the specific diagnosis of the brain lesion.'  
Is it possible to prevent brain lesions?,"'Many brain lesions are neither preventable nor predictable. However, general guidelines for health maintenance may help prevent some brain lesions. The same recommendations to help prevent ''heart disease'' also are appropriate to help prevent strokes:' Don't smoke Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes Always wear a helmet when participating in activities where the head is exposed to danger (for example, riding a bicycle or motorcycle, skiing, skateboarding, and rollerblading). Avoiding radiation and environmental toxins may reduce the chances for brain cancer development."
What is the prognosis for brain lesions?,"'The prognosis for surviving and recovering from a brain lesion depends upon the cause. In general, many brain lesions have only a fair to poor prognosis because damage and destruction of brain tissue is frequently permanent. However, some people can reduce their symptoms with rehabilitation training and medication. ''A few brain lesions may have a good prognosis if only a small amount of less vital brain tissue is involved and/or early interventions are successful (for example, surgical removal of a small benign tumor, early effective antimicrobial treatment of meningitis, or ''transient ischemic attack'' [''TIA'' or ''mini-stroke'']). ''Unfortunately, some brain lesions are relentless, progressive and ultimately have a poor prognosis (for example, '""Alzheimer's""' disease). ' "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient. ' "
What is leukemia? What are the different types of leukemia?,"'Leukemia is a ''malignancy'' (cancer) of blood cells. In leukemia, abnormal blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. Usually, leukemia involves the production of abnormal white blood cells -- the cells responsible for fighting infection. However, the abnormal cells in leukemia do not function in the same way as normal white blood cells. The leukemia cells continue to grow and divide, eventually crowding out the normal blood cells. The end result is that it becomes difficult for the body to fight infections, control bleeding, and transport oxygen.''There are different types of leukemia, based upon how quickly the disease develops and the type of abnormal cells produced. Leukemia is called an acute leukemia if it develops rapidly. Large numbers of leukemia cells accumulate very quickly in the blood and bone marrow, leading to symptoms such as ''tiredness'', ''easy bruising'', and susceptibility to infections. Acute leukemia requires fast and aggressive treatment.''There are around 60,000 new cases of leukemia each year in the U.S. and over 24,000 deaths due to leukemia. Leukemia makes up about 3.7% of all new cancer cases.''Chronic leukemias develop slowly over time. These leukemias may not cause specific symptoms at the beginning of their course. If left untreated, the cells may eventually grow to high numbers, as in acute leukemias causing similar symptoms.''Leukemias are further classified as myeloid or lymphoid, depending upon the type of white blood cell that makes up the leukemia cells. A basic understanding of the normal development of blood cells is needed to understand the different types of leukemia. Normal blood cells develop from ''stem cells'' that have the potential to become many cell types. Myeloid stem cells mature in the bone marrow and become immature white cells called myeloid blasts. These myeloid blasts further mature to become either ''red blood cells'', platelets, or certain kinds of white blood cells. Lymphoid stem cells mature in the bone marrow to become lymphoid blasts. The lymphoid blasts develop further into T or B lymphocytes (T-cells or B-cells), special types of white blood cells. Myeloid or myelogenous leukemias are made up of cells that arise from myeloid cells, while lymphoid leukemias arise from lymphoid cells. Knowing the type of cell involved in leukemia is important in choosing the appropriate treatment.''The four most common types of leukemia are acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ''acute myeloid leukemia'', and ''chronic myeloid leukemia''.''Less common types of leukemia account for about 6,000 cases of leukemia each year in the U.S.'   Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia) is the most common type of leukemia in children, but it can also affect adults. In this type of leukemia, immature lymphoid cells grow rapidly in the blood. It affects almost 6,000 people per year in the U.S. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML, also called acute myelogenous leukemia) involves the rapid growth of myeloid cells. It occurs in both adults and children and affects about 19,500 people each year in the U.S. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a slow-growing cancer of lymphoid cells that usually affects people over 55 years of age. It is estimated to affect about 21,000 people in the U.S. every year. It almost never occurs in children or adolescents. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, also known as chronic myelogenous leukemia) is a type of chronic myeloproliferative disorder that primarily affects adults and occurs in about 8,400 people every year in the U.S. Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is another type of chronic leukemia that develops from myeloid cells. Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a type of myeloid leukemia that usually occurs in children under 6 years of age. Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL leukemia) is a type of chronic leukemia that develops from lymphoid cells. It can be slow- or fast-growing. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML."
What causes leukemia? Is leukemia hereditary?,"""The exact cause of leukemia is not known, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Leukemia cells have acquired mutations in their DNA that cause them to grow abnormally and lose functions of typical white blood cells. It is not clear what causes these mutations to occur. One type of change in the cells' DNA that is common in leukemias is known as a chromosome translocation. In this process, a portion of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to a different chromosome. One translocation seen in almost all cases of CML and in sometimes in other types of leukemia is an exchange of DNA between chromosomes 9 and 22, which leads to what is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This creates an oncogene (cancer-promoting gene) known as BCR-ABL. This change in DNA is not ""'inherited'' but occurs sometime in the life of the affected individual.''Most cases of leukemia are not believed to be hereditary, but certain genetic mutations and conditions can be passed along to offspring that increase the chances of developing leukemia. A condition known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome is characterized by an inherited mutation in a ''tumor'' suppressor gene known as TP53, and individuals with this condition have an increased risk of leukemia and other ''cancers''. Other hereditary conditions that can increase the risk of developing leukemia include ''Down syndrome'', ''neurofibromatosis type 1'', ''ataxia telangiectasia'', and ''Noonan syndrome''.' "
What are leukemia risk factors?,"'Exposure to radiation is known to increase the risk of developing AML, CML, or ALL. Increases in leukemia were observed in people surviving atomic bombs. Radiation therapy for cancer can also increase the risk of leukemia. Exposure to certain chemicals, including benzene (used commonly in the chemical industry), increases the risk of leukemia. ''Cigarette smoking'' is known to increase the risk of developing AML.''Certain genetic disorders can increase the risk; ''Down syndrome'', Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and other medical conditions can increase the risk of developing leukemia. ''Blood disorders'' known as myelodysplastic syndromes confer an increased risk of developing AML. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a virus that causes a rare type of leukemia. Certain chemotherapy ''drugs'' for cancer can increase the risk for AML or ALL.''Having risk factors does not mean that a person will definitely get leukemia, and most people with risk factors will not develop the disease. Likewise, not everyone who develops leukemia has an identifiable risk factor.' "
What are leukemia symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of leukemia depend upon the type of leukemia. As stated earlier, slow-growing or chronic leukemia may not cause any symptoms at the outset, while aggressive or rapidly growing leukemia may lead to severe symptoms. The ''symptoms of leukemia'' arise from a loss of function of the normal blood cells or from accumulation of the abnormal cells in the body.''Signs and symptoms of leukemia typically include the following:''If leukemia cells have infiltrated the brain, symptoms such as ''headaches'', ''seizures'', ''confusion'', loss of muscle control, and ''vomiting'' can occur.'   Fevers Night sweats Swollen lymph nodes that are usually painless Feelings of fatigue, tiredness Easy bleeding or bruising, causing bluish or purplish patches on the skin or tiny red spots on the skin, or recurring nosebleeds Frequent infections Bone or joint pain Weight loss that is unintentional and otherwise unexplained, or loss of appetite Enlargement of the spleen or liver, which can lead to abdominal pain or swelling Red spots on the skin (petechiae)"
How do physicians diagnose leukemia?,"'Hematologists are specialist physicians who diagnose and treat blood diseases, including leukemia; hematologist-oncologists treat blood diseases like leukemia, as well as other types of cancers.''In addition to a medical history (asking about symptoms and risk factors) and a physical exam to look for signs of leukemia (''lymph node'' enlargement, enlargement of spleen), the diagnosis of leukemia typically involves laboratory studies of a blood sample. Abnormal numbers of blood cells may suggest a diagnosis of leukemia, and the blood sample may also be examined under the microscope to see if the cells appear abnormal. A sample of the bone marrow may also be obtained to establish the diagnosis. For a bone marrow aspirate, a long, thin needle is used to withdraw a sample of bone marrow from the hip bone, under local anesthesia. A ''bone marrow biopsy'' involves insertion of a thick, hollow needle into the hip bone to remove a sample of the bone marrow, using local anesthesia.''Cells from the blood and bone marrow are further tested if leukemia cells are present. These additional tests look for genetic alterations and expression of certain cell surface markers by the cancer cells (immunophenotyping). The results of these tests are used to help determine the precise classification of the leukemia and to decide on optimal treatment.''Other tests that may be useful include a ''chest X-ray'' to determine if there are ''enlarged lymph nodes'' or other signs of disease and a ''lumbar puncture'' to remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid to determine if the leukemia cells have infiltrated the membranes and space surrounding the brain and spinal cord.''Imaging tests such as ''MRI'' and CT scanning can also be useful for some patients to determine the extent of disease.' "
What are leukemia treatment options?,"""There are a number of different medical approaches to the treatment of leukemia. Treatment will typically depend upon the type of leukemia, the patient's age and health status, as well as whether or not the leukemia cells have spread to the cerebrospinal fluid. The genetic changes or specific characteristics of the leukemia cells as determined in the laboratory can also determine the type of treatment that may be most appropriate.""'Watchful waiting may be an option for some people with a chronic leukemia who do not have symptoms. This involves close monitoring of the disease so that treatment can begin when symptoms develop. Watchful waiting allows the patient to avoid or postpone the side effects of treatment. The risk of waiting is that it may eliminate the possibility of controlling the leukemia before it worsens.''Treatments for leukemia include chemotherapy (major treatment modality for leukemia), radiation therapy, ''biological therapy'', targeted therapy, and stem cell transplant. Combinations of these treatments may be used. Surgical removal of the spleen can be a part of treatment if the spleen is enlarged.''Acute leukemia needs to be treated when it is diagnosed, with the goal of inducing a remission (absence of leukemia cells in the body). After remission is achieved, therapy may be given to prevent a relapse of the leukemia. This is called consolidation or maintenance therapy. Acute leukemias can often be cured with treatment.''Chronic leukemias are unlikely to be cured with treatment, but treatments are often able to control the cancer and manage symptoms. Some people with chronic leukemia may be candidates for stem cell transplantation, which does offer a chance for cure.'""Many patients opt to receive a second opinion before beginning treatment for leukemia. In most cases, there is time to receive a second opinion and consider treatment options without making the treatment less effective. However, in rare cases of very aggressive leukemias, treatment must begin immediately. One should discuss with a doctor the possibility of obtaining a second opinion and any potential delays in treatment. Most doctors welcome the possibility of a second opinion and should not be offended by a patient's wish to obtain one.""'Chemotherapy is the administration of drugs that kill rapidly dividing cells such as leukemia or other cancer cells. Chemotherapy may be taken orally in pill or tablet form, or it may be delivered via a catheter or intravenous line directly into the bloodstream. Combination chemotherapy is usually given, which involves a combination of more than one drug. The drugs are given in cycles with rest periods in between.''Sometimes, chemotherapy drugs for leukemia are delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid (known as ''intrathecal chemotherapy''). Intrathecal chemotherapy is given in addition to other types of chemotherapy and can be used to treat leukemia in the brain or spinal cord or, in some cases, to prevent spread of leukemia to the brain and spinal cord. An Ommaya reservoir is a special catheter placed under the ''scalp'' for the delivery of chemotherapy medications. This is used for children and some adult patients as a way to avoid injections into the cerebrospinal fluid.''Side effects of chemotherapy depend on the particular drugs taken and the dosage or regimen. Some side effects from chemotherapy drugs include ''hair loss'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''mouth sores'', loss of appetite, tiredness, easy bruising or bleeding, and an increased chance of infection due to the destruction of white blood cells. There are medications available to help manage the side effects of chemotherapy.''Some adult men and women who receive chemotherapy sustain damage to the ovaries or testes, resulting in ''infertility''. Most children who receive chemotherapy for leukemia will have normal ''fertility'' as adults, but depending on the drugs and dosages used, some may have ''infertility'' as adults.''Biological therapy is any treatment that uses living organisms, substances that come from living organisms, or synthetic versions of these substances to treat cancer. These treatments help the immune system recognize abnormal cells and then attack them. Biological therapies for various types of cancer can include antibodies, tumor ''vaccines'', or cytokines (substances that are produced within the body to control the immune system). Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that react against a specific target that are used in the treatment of many kinds of cancer. An example of a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of leukemia is alemtuzumab, which targets the CD52 antigen, a protein found on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Interferons are cell signaling chemicals that have been used in the treatment of leukemia.''Side effects of biological therapies tend to be less severe than those of chemotherapy and can include ''rash'' or swelling at the injection site for IV infusions of the therapeutic agents. Other side effects can include ''headache'', muscle aches, ''fever'', or tiredness.''Targeted therapies are drugs that interfere with one specific property or function of a cancer cell, rather than acting to kill all rapidly growing cells indiscriminately. This means there is less damage to normal cells with targeted therapy than with chemotherapy. Targeted therapies may cause the target cell to cease growing rather than to die, and they interfere with specific molecules that promote growth or spread of cancers. Targeted cancer therapies are also referred to as molecularly targeted drugs, molecularly targeted therapies, or precision medicines.''Monoclonal antibodies (described above in the section on biologic therapy) are also considered to be targeted therapies since they specifically interfere and interact with a specific target protein on the surface of cancer cells. ''Imatinib'' (''Gleevec'') and ''dasatinib'' (''Sprycel'') are examples of targeted therapies that are used to treat CML, some cases of ALL, and some other cancers. These drugs target the cancer-promoting protein that is formed by the BCR-ABL gene translocation.''Targeted therapies are given in pill form or by injection. Side effects can include swelling, ''bloating'', and sudden ''weight gain''. Other side effects can include ''nausea'', vomiting, ''diarrhea'', ''muscle cramps'', or ''rash''.''Radiation therapy uses high energy radiation to target cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be used in the treatment of leukemia that has spread to the brain, or it may be used to target the spleen or other areas where leukemia cells have accumulated.''Radiation therapy also causes side effects, but they are not likely to be permanent. Side effects depend on the location of the body that is irradiated. For example, radiation to the abdomen can cause nausea, vomiting, and ''diarrhea''. With any radiation therapy, the skin in the area being treated may become red, dry, and tender. Generalized tiredness is also common while undergoing radiation therapy.''In stem cell transplantation, high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation are given to destroy leukemia cells along with normal bone marrow. Then, transplant stem cells are delivered by an intravenous infusion. The stem cells travel to the bone marrow and begin producing new blood cells. Stem cells may come from the patient or from a donor.'""Autologous stem cell transplantation refers to the situation in which the patient's own stem cells are removed and treated to destroy leukemia cells. They are then returned to the body after the bone marrow and leukemia cells have been destroyed.""'An allogeneic stem cells transplant refers to stem cells transplanted from a donor. These may be from a relative or an unrelated donor. A syngeneic stem cell transplant uses stem cells taken from a healthy identical twin of the patient.''Stem cells may be removed (harvested) in different ways. Typically, they are taken from the blood. They can also be harvested from the bone marrow or from umbilical cord blood.''Stem cell transplantation is done in a hospital, and it is necessary to remain in the hospital for several weeks. Risks of the procedure include infections and bleeding due to the depletion of normal blood cells. A risk of stem cell transplant with donor cells is known as ''graft-versus-host disease'' (''GVHD'""). In GVHD, the donor white blood cells react against the patient's normal tissues. GVHD can be mild or very severe, and often affects the liver, skin, or digestive tract. GVHD can occur at any time after the transplant, even years later. Steroids or medications that suppress the immune response may be used to treat this complication.""""Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment is a new form of treatment in which a patient's own normal T lymphocytes are re-engineered in a laboratory to attack the leukemia cells and are then reintroduced into the patient's bloodstream. This treatment has been used for people with B-cell ""'lymphomas'' that have relapsed or are refractory to treatment. It is also an approved treatment option for certain cases of leukemia. The U.S. FDA approved tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) in 2018 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.''CAR-T therapy is also available in ''clinical trials''. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially serious side effect frequently associated with CAR T-cell therapy. Cytokines are chemical messengers produced when the CAR T-cells multiply in the body and kill cancer cells. CRS may cause a range of symptoms from mild ''flu-like symptoms'' to more serious symptoms including fast ''heart'' rate, ''low blood pressure'', and heart problems. Other side effects can include nerve damage, suppressed immune function, and a condition known as tumor lysis syndrome that results when cancer cells are rapidly destroyed.''Because CAR T-cell therapy is so new, the patients who have had this treatment have not been followed over the long term. Studies are under way to determine whether CAR-T treatment may be useful in other types of leukemia.''Because many of the treatments for leukemia deplete normal blood cells, increasing the risk for bleeding and infection, supportive treatments may be needed to help prevent these complications of treatment. Supportive treatments may also be needed to help minimize and manage unpleasant side effects of medical or radiation therapy.''Types of supportive and preventive treatments that can be used for patients undergoing treatment for leukemia include the following:'   Vaccines against the flu or pneumonia Blood or platelet transfusions Anti-nausea medications Antibiotics or antiviral medications to treat or prevent infections White blood cell growth factors to stimulate white blood cell production (such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], made up of filgrastim [Neupogen] and pegfilgrastim [Neulasta] and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating growth factor [GM-CSF], made up of sargramostim [Leukine]) Red cell growth factors to stimulate red blood cell production (darbepoetin alfa [Aranesp] or epoetin alfa [Procrit]) Intravenous injections of immunoglobulins to help fight infection"
What are complications of leukemia?,"'Many of the challenges of leukemia relate to the depletion of normal blood cells as well as the side effects of treatments as described in the previous section, such as frequent infections, bleeding, and GVHD in recipients of stem cell transplants. Weight loss and ''anemia'' are further complications of leukemia and its treatment. Complications of any leukemia also include a relapse or a progression of the disease after a remission has been achieved with treatment.''Other complications of leukemia relate to the specific type of leukemia. For example, in 3% to 5% of cases of CLL, the cells change characteristics and transform into an ''aggressive lymphoma''. This is known as a Richter transformation. Autoimmune hemolytic ''anemic'', in the body attacks and destroys red blood cells, is another potential complication of CLL. People with CLL are also more likely to develop second cancers and other blood disorders and blood cancers.''Tumor lysis syndrome is a condition caused by the rapid death of cancer cells during acute treatment. It can occur in almost any type of cancer, and it is seen with some cases of leukemia, particularly when large numbers of leukemia cells are present such as with AML or ALL. The rapid destruction of the leukemia cells leads to the release of large amounts of phosphate, which further causes metabolic abnormalities and can lead to ''kidney failure''.''Children who receive therapy for ALL may experience late adverse effects including central nervous system (CNS) impairment, slowing of growth, infertility, ''cataracts'', and an increased risk for other cancers. The incidence of these late effects varies depending upon the age at treatment and the type and strength of therapies.' "
What is the prognosis of leukemia?,"'The prognosis of leukemia depends upon the type of leukemia that is present and the age and health status of the patient. Mortality (death) rates for leukemia are higher in the elderly than in younger adults and children. In many cases, leukemia can be managed or cured with treatments available today. In particular, childhood ALL has a very high 5-year survival rate.''Modern treatments have led to a greater than fourfold increase since 1960 in five-year survival rates for leukemia. Five-year survival rates for different types of leukemia from 2007-2013 are approximately:''CML: 68%''CLL: 86%''AML: 27% overall, 66% for children and ''teens'' younger than 15''ALL: 71% overall, over 90% for children' "
How often does leukemia recur?,"""The likelihood that leukemia will recur (come back after successful treatment) depends upon the type of leukemia including the specific molecular characteristics of the cancer cells and the patient's response to initial treatment. Some acute leukemias are successfully treated, and the patient never experiences a recurrence. In chronic leukemias, such as CML, ongoing symptoms and recurrences are common, and treatments may be directed at keeping the leukemia under control."" "
Is it possible to prevent leukemia?,"'Most people who develop leukemia do not have a known risk factor, and it is generally not possible to prevent leukemia. Certain risk factors, such as exposure to radiation or benzene, may be minimized, but this does not guarantee ''prevention'' of leukemia.' "
What support groups are available for people with leukemia?,"'Support groups for people with leukemia and their families offer a variety of resources.''The Leukemia and ''Lymphoma'' Society (''http://www.lls.org/#/diseaseinformation/''getinformationsupport/'') offers information for patients and families, discussion boards, online chats, support groups, and 1:1 support from information specialists. They also offer family support groups.''Information specialists at 1-800-4-CANCER and at LiveHelp (''http://www.cancer.gov/help'') can help someone locate programs, services, and publications.'""Throughout the U.S., hospitals and health systems offer support groups and resources for people living with leukemia. A doctor or other members of a patient's treatment team can provide information about support groups in the area. The National Cancer Institute has publications for patients on coping with leukemia and other cancers (""'http://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education#coping-and-support'').' "
What research is being done on leukemia?,"'Leukemia is an active area of biomedical research. Ongoing studies are examining the risk factors and causes of leukemia, as well as examining new and improved treatment options.'""Clinical trials are studies that examine new drugs or new combinations of drugs and existing treatments. Trials are under way to test new targeted therapy, biological therapy, and chemotherapy regimens. Patients should discuss their situation and care with their doctor if they are interested in being part of a clinical trial. The NCI's web site includes a section on clinical trials at ""'https://clinicaltrials.gov''.' "
What is leukemia?,"'Leukemia'' is a ''cancer of the blood'' cells and bone marrow (the soft, spongy tissue present in the center of the bones).''Treatment of leukemia varies according to the type of leukemia besides other factors such as the person’s age, stage of leukemia and presence of complications.' Any cancer is caused by an uncontrolled or unregulated growth of abnormal cells. Leukemia involves the uncontrolled growth of the bone marrow cells Leukemia cells, unlike other types of cancers, generally do not clump to form a mass (tumor). Due to the absence of tumor (mass) formation, leukemia is not diagnosed through imaging tests such as X-rays. Leukemia is most often a cancer of the white blood cells or WBCs. Some leukemia, however, may start in other types of blood cells.  Leukemia is of many types. Some types of leukemia mostly affect adults while some are more common in children.  Some leukemias are fast-growing (acute) while others are slow-growing or chronic leukemia.  Leukemia may also be divided based upon their cells of origin as myeloid or lymphoid leukemia."
What causes leukemia?,"'Leukemia results when the genetic material (DNA) of a single cell in the bone marrow transforms, this is called a mutation. A mutated cell does not perform body function, but it eats away the ''nutrition'' meant for the normal cells. Every single mutated cell acts as the mother cells producing more abnormal cells.''The exact cause of the mutation is not well understood. Certain factors may put a person at risk of leukemia. These include:' Previous cancer treatment: Previous treatment for cancer with radiation or chemotherapy may increase the risk of leukemia. Environmental chemicals: Exposure to certain chemicals such as benzene (used in several industries to make rubber, plastics, dyes, etc.) and formaldehyde (found in building materials and several household products like soaps and shampoos) can put a person at risk of leukemia. Cigarette smoking: Present or previous history of smoking increases the risk of several cancers including leukemia.  Genetic disorders: Certain genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, neurofibromatosis, and Klinefelter syndrome may increase the risk of having leukemia Family history of leukemia: In most cases, there is no family history of leukemia, however, if a family member has been diagnosed with leukemia or a genetic disorder, it may increase your risk of leukemia."
What are the early signs and symptoms of leukemia?,"'The early signs and ''symptoms of leukemia'' are usually very subtle and non-specific.''Early symptoms are:''Other symptoms are:' Fever which keeps coming frequently Feeling tired and weak Looking pale The tendency for bruising and bleeding:  The person may complain of frequent nose and gum bleeds. There may be tiny reddish spots on the skin, called petechiae. Purplish patches or bruises may be seen on the skin. Pain and tenderness in bones or joints Swollen lymph nodes which may be felt in the neck, underarm, groin, or stomach An enlarged spleen or liver may be felt as heaviness or pain in the belly. Frequent infections. Unintended or unplanned weight loss. Night sweats. Breathlessness. Pain or fullness felt under the ribs on the left side."
What are the complications of leukemia?,"'The complications of leukemia include:' Anemia Frequent infections Bleeding Tumor lysis syndrome (a condition caused by the rapid death of cancer cells during aggressive treatment) Organ damage such as liver and kidney failure Risk of other cancers Children receiving leukemia therapy may experience problems such as central nervous system (CNS) impairment, slowing of growth, infertility, cataract apart from an increased risk for other cancers. "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient.

Introduction,"""Leukoplakia is a white or gray patch that develops on the tongue or the inside of the cheek. It is the mouth's reaction to chronic irritation of the mucous membranes of the mouth. Leukoplakia patches can also develop on the female genital area; however, the cause of this is unknown.""'The growth can occur at any time in your life, but it is most common in the elderly.''""Hairy"" leukoplakia of the mouth is an unusual form of leukoplakia that is seen only in people who are infected with ''HIV'', have ''AIDS'', or ''AIDS-related complex''. It consists of fuzzy, hence the name ""hairy,"" white patches on the tongue and less frequently elsewhere in the mouth. It may resemble ''thrush'', an infection caused by the fungus Candida which, in adults, usually occurs if your immune system is not working properly, and may be one of the first signs of infection with the ''HIV'' virus.' "
What Causes Leukoplakia?," Irritation from rough teeth, fillings, or crowns, or ill-fitting dentures that rub against your cheek or gum Chronic smoking, pipe smoking, or other tobacco use Sun exposure to the lips Oral cancer, although rare HIV or AIDS"
What Are the Symptoms?,"'The presence of white or gray colored patches on your tongue, gums, roof of your mouth, or the inside of the cheeks of your mouth may be a sign of leukoplakia. The patch may have developed slowly over weeks to months and be thick, slightly raised, and may eventually take on a hardened and rough texture. It usually is painless, but may be sensitive to touch, heat, spicy foods, or other irritation.'  "
How Is Leukoplakia Diagnosed?,"'Your dentist may suspect leukoplakia upon examination; however, a biopsy will likely be taken to rule out other causes, such as ''oral cancer''. During the biopsy, a small piece of tissue from the lesion will be removed to be examined in a lab. A numbing agent will be used so that you will not feel any ''pain''.' "
How Is Leukoplakia Treated?,"'Treatment, if needed, involves removing the source of irritation. For example, if leukoplakia is caused by a rough tooth or an irregular surface on a ''denture'' or filling the tooth will be smoothed and dental appliances repaired. If leukoplakia is caused by ''smoking'', you will be asked to minimize or stop smoking or using other tobacco products.''Leukoplakia is usually harmless, and lesions usually clear in a few weeks or months after the source of irritation is removed. If eliminating the source of irritation is ineffective in reducing leukoplakia, the lesion may need to be surgically removed. The lesion can be removed either by your general dentist or by an ''oral surgeon'' in their office under local anesthesia.''Hairy leukoplakia requires treatment with an antiviral medication.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E.

What are Lewy bodies?,"'\tLewy bodies are named for Dr. Friederich Lewy, a German neurologist. In 1912, he discovered abnormal protein deposits that disrupt the brain\'s normal functioning in people with Parkinson\'s disease. These abnormal deposits are now called ""Lewy bodies.""''\tLewy bodies are made of a protein called alpha-synuclein. In the healthy brain, a protein associated with alpha-synuclein plays a number of important roles in neurons (nerve cells) in the brain, especially at synapses, where brain cells communicate with each other. In LBD, alpha-synuclein forms into clumps inside neurons throughout the brain. This process may cause neurons to work less effectively and, eventually, to die. The activities of brain chemicals important to brain function are also affected. The result is widespread damage to certain parts of the brain and a decline in abilities affected by those brain regions.''\tLewy bodies affect a few different brain regions in LBD:' 
		the cerebral cortex, which controls many functions, including information processing, perception, thought, and language 
		the limbic cortex, which plays a major role in emotions and behavior 
		the hippocampus, which is essential to forming new memories 
		the midbrain, including the substantia nigra, which is involved in movement 
		areas of the brain stem important in regulating sleep and maintaining alertness 
		brain regions important in recognizing smells (olfactory pathways)"

What are the types of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tLewy body dementia includes two related conditions - dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia. The difference between them lies largely in the timing of cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms. In dementia with Lewy bodies, cognitive symptoms are noted within a year of ''parkinsonism'"", any condition that involves the types of movement changes seen in Parkinson's disease. In Parkinson's disease dementia, movement symptoms are most pronounced, with cognitive symptoms developing years later.""'\tPeople with dementia with Lewy bodies first have a decline in cognitive skills that may look somewhat like Alzheimer’s disease. But over time they also develop movement and other distinctive symptoms that suggest dementia with Lewy bodies.''\tSymptoms that distinguish this form of dementia from others may include:'""\tThis type of LBD starts as a movement disorder, with symptoms such as slowed movement, muscle stiffness, tremor, or a shuffling walk. These symptoms lead to a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Later on, cognitive symptoms of dementia and changes in mood and behavior may arise.""""\tNot all people with Parkinson's develop dementia, and it is difficult to predict who will.

What are the causes and risk factors for Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tThe precise cause of LBD is unknown, but scientists are learning more about its biology and genetics. For example, they know that an accumulation of Lewy bodies is associated with a loss of certain neurons in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters, chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells. One of these messengers, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, ''sleep'', and mood.''\tScientists are also learning about risk factors for LBD. Age is considered the greatest risk factor. Most people who develop the disorder are over age 50.''\tOther known risk factors for LBD include the following:' 
Diseases and health conditions: Certain diseases and health conditions, particularly Parkinson's disease and REM sleep behavior disorder, are linked to a higher risk of LBD. 
Genetics: While having a family member with LBD may increase a person's risk, LBD is not normally considered a genetic disease. A small percentage of families with dementia with Lewy bodies has a genetic association, but in most cases, the cause is unknown. At this time, no genetic test can accurately predict whether someone will develop LBD. Future genetic research may reveal more information about causes and risk. 
Lifestyle: No specific lifestyle factor has been proven to increase one's risk for LBD. However, some studies suggest that a healthy lifestyle - including regular exercise, mental stimulation, and a healthy diet - might reduce the chance of developing age-associated dementias."
What are the common symptoms of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tPeople with LBD may not have every LBD symptom, and the severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. Throughout the course of the disease, any sudden, major change in functional ability or behavior should be reported to a doctor.''''\tThe most common symptoms include changes in cognition, movement, sleep, and behavior.' "
Cognitive symptoms of Lewy body dementia,"'\tLBD causes changes in thinking abilities. These changes may include:''''Dementia:'"" Severe loss of thinking abilities that interferes with a person's capacity to perform daily activities. Dementia is a primary symptom in LBD and usually includes trouble with visual and spatial abilities (judging distance and depth or misidentifying objects), multitasking, problem solving, and reasoning. Memory problems may not be evident at first but often arise as LBD progresses. Dementia can also include changes in mood and behavior, poor judgment, loss of initiative, ""'confusion'' about time and place, and difficulty with language and numbers.''''Cognitive fluctuations:'' Unpredictable changes in ''concentration'', attention, alertness, and wakefulness from day to day and sometimes throughout the day. A person with LBD may stare into space for periods of time, seem drowsy and lethargic, and sleep for several hours during the day despite getting enough sleep the night before. His or her flow of ideas may be disorganized, unclear, or illogical at times. The person may seem better one day, then worse the next day. These cognitive fluctuations are common in LBD but are not always easy for a doctor to identify.''''Hallucinations:'' Seeing or ''hearing'' things that are not present. Visual hallucinations occur in up to 80 percent of people with LBD, often early on. They are typically realistic and detailed, such as images of children or animals. Auditory hallucinations are less common than visual ones but may also occur. Hallucinations that are not disruptive may not require treatment. However, if they are frightening or dangerous (for example, if the person attempts to fight a perceived intruder), then a doctor may prescribe medication.' "
Behavoiral and mood symptoms of Lewy body dementia,"'\tChanges in behavior and mood are possible in LBD. These changes may include:' 
Depression: A persistent feeling of sadness, inability to enjoy activities, and trouble with sleeping, eating, and other normal activities. 
Apathy: A lack of interest in normal daily activities or events, and less social interaction. 
Anxiety: Intense apprehension, uncertainty, or fear about a future event or situation. A person may ask the same questions over and over or be angry or fearful when a loved one is not present. 
Agitation: Restlessness, as seen by pacing, hand wringing, an inability to get settled, constant repeating of words or phrases, or irritability. 
Delusions: Strongly held false beliefs or opinions not based on evidence. For example, a person may think his or her spouse is having an affair or that relatives long dead are still living. A delusion that may be seen in LBD is Capgras syndrome, in which the person believes a relative or friend has been replaced by an imposter. 
Paranoia: An extreme, irrational distrust of others, such as suspicion that people are taking or hiding things."
Sleep disorders associated with Lewy body dementia,"'\tSleep disorders are common in people with LBD but are often undiagnosed. A sleep specialist can play an important role on a treatment team, helping to diagnose and treat sleep disorders. Sleep-related disorders seen in people with LBD may include:''''REM sleep behavior disorder:'' A condition in which a person seems to act out dreams. It may include vivid dreaming, talking in one’s sleep, violent movements, or falling out of bed. Sometimes only the bed partner of the person with LBD is aware of these symptoms. REM sleep behavior disorder appears in some people years before other LBD symptoms.''''Excessive daytime sleepiness:'' Sleeping 2 or more hours a day.''''Insomnia:'' Difficulty falling or staying asleep, or waking up too early.''''Restless leg syndrome:'' A condition in which a person, while resting, feels the urge to move his or her legs to stop unpleasant or unusual sensations. Walking or moving usually relieves the discomfort.' "
Movement symptoms of Lewy body dementia,"""\tSome people with LBD may not experience significant movement problems for several years. Others may have them early on. At first, signs of movement problems, such as a change in handwriting, may be very mild and thus overlooked. Parkinsonism is seen early on in Parkinson's disease dementia but can also develop later on in dementia with Lewy bodies. Specific symptoms of parkinsonism may include:"" 
		muscle rigidity or stiffness 
		shuffling gait, slow movement, or frozen stance 
		tremor or shaking, most commonly in the hands and usually at rest 
		balance problems and falls 
		stooped posture 
		loss of coordination 
		smaller handwriting than was usual for the person 
		reduced facial expression 
difficulty swallowing or a weak voice"
Other Lewy body dementia symptoms,"'\tPeople with LBD can also experience significant changes in the part of the nervous system that regulates automatic actions such as those of the heart, glands, and muscles. The person may have:' 
		frequent changes in body temperature 
		problems with blood pressure 
dizziness 
fainting 
		frequent falls 
		sensitivity to heat and cold 
		sexual dysfunction 
urinary incontinence 
constipation 
		a poor sense of smell"
How is Lewy body dementia (LBD) diagnosed?,"'\tIt\'s important to know which type of LBD a person has, both to tailor treatment to particular symptoms and to understand how the disease will likely progress. Clinicians and researchers use the ""1-year rule"" to diagnose which form of LBD a person has. If cognitive symptoms appear within a year of movement problems, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies. If cognitive problems develop more than a year after the onset of movement problems, the diagnosis is Parkinson\'s disease dementia.'""\tRegardless of the initial symptoms, over time all people with LBD will develop similar symptoms due to the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. But there are some differences. For example, dementia with Lewy bodies may progress more quickly than Parkinson's disease dementia.""""\tDementia with Lewy bodies is often hard to diagnose because its early symptoms may resemble those of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. As a result, it is often misdiagnosed or missed altogether. As additional symptoms appear, it is often easier to make an accurate diagnosis.""'\tThe good news is that doctors are increasingly able to diagnose LBD earlier and more accurately as researchers identify which symptoms help distinguish it from similar disorders.''\tDifficult as it is, getting an accurate diagnosis of LBD early on is important so that a person:''\tWhile a diagnosis of LBD can be distressing, some people are relieved to know the reason for their troubling symptoms. It is important to allow time to adjust to the news. Talking about a diagnosis can help shift the focus toward developing a treatment plan.''''Who Can Diagnose LBD?''\tMany physicians and other medical professionals are not familiar with LBD, so patients may consult several doctors before receiving a diagnosis. Visiting a family doctor is often the first step for people who are experiencing changes in thinking, movement, or behavior. However, neurologists - doctors who specialize in disorders of the brain and nervous system - generally have the expertise needed to diagnose LBD. Geriatric psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians may also be skilled in diagnosing the condition.''\tIf a specialist cannot be found in your community, ask the neurology department of the nearest medical school for a referral. A hospital affiliated with a medical school may also have a dementia or movement disorders clinic that provides expert evaluation.''''Tests Used to Diagnose LBD''\tDoctors perform physical and neurological examinations and various tests to distinguish LBD from other illnesses. A thorough evaluation includes:''\tThere are no brain scans or medical tests that can definitively diagnose LBD. Currently, LBD can be diagnosed with certainty only by a brain ''autopsy'' after death.'""\tHowever, researchers are studying ways to diagnose LBD more accurately in the living brain. Certain types of neuroimaging - positron emission tomography and SPECT - have shown promise in detecting differences between dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease. These methods may help diagnose certain features of the disorder, such as dopamine deficiencies. Researchers are also investigating the use of ""'lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'"") to measure proteins in cerebrospinal fluid that might distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders.""'''Other Helpful Information''\tIt is important for the patient and a close family member or friend to tell the doctor about any symptoms involving thinking, movement, sleep, behavior, or mood. Also, discuss other health problems and provide a list of all current medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter ''drugs'', ''vitamins'', and ''supplements''. Certain medications can worsen LBD symptoms.'""\tCaregivers may be reluctant to talk about a person's symptoms when that person is present. Ask to speak with the doctor privately if necessary. The more information a doctor has, the more accurate a diagnosis can be."" 
		gets the right medical treatment and avoids potentially harmful treatment 
		has time to plan medical care and arrange legal and financial affairs 
		can build a support team to stay independent and maximize quality of life 
		Medical history and examination: A review of previous and current illnesses, medications, and current symptoms and tests of movement and memory give the doctor valuable information. 
		Medical tests: Laboratory studies can help rule out other diseases and hormonal or vitamin deficiencies that can cause dementia. 
		Brain imaging: Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can detect brain shrinkage or structural abnormalities and help rule out other possible causes of dementia or movement symptoms. A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan can help support a diagnosis of LBD. 
		Neuropsychological tests: These tests are used to assess memory and other cognitive functions and can help identify affected brain regions."
What is the treatment and management of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tWhile LBD currently cannot be prevented or cured, some symptoms may respond to treatment for a period of time. A comprehensive treatment plan may involve medications, physical and other types of therapy, and counseling. Changes to make the home safer, equipment to make everyday tasks easier, and social support are also very important.''\tA skilled care team often can provide suggestions to help improve quality of life for both people with LBD and their caregivers.''''Building a Care Team''\tAfter receiving a diagnosis, a person with LBD will benefit from seeing a neurologist who specializes in dementia and/or movement disorders. A good place to start is an academic medical center in your community. Ask if it has a dementia or movement disorders clinic, which is where you may find LBD specialists. If such a specialist cannot be found, a general neurologist should be part of the care team. Ask a primary care physician for a referral.'""\tA doctor can work with other types of healthcare providers. Depending on an individual's particular symptoms, other professionals may be helpful:""'\tSupport groups are another valuable resource for both people with LBD and caregivers. Sharing experiences and tips with others in the same situation can help people identify practical solutions to day-to-day challenges and get emotional and social support.'  
		Physical therapists can help with movement problems through cardiovascular, strengthening, and flexibility exercises, as well as gait training and general 
		physical fitness programs. 
		Speech therapists may help with low voice volume and voice projection, poor speaking ability, and swallowing difficulties. 
		Occupational therapists help identify ways to more easily carry out everyday activities, such as eating and bathing, to promote independence. 
		Music or expressive arts therapists may provide meaningful activities that can reduce anxiety and improve well-being. 
		Mental health counselors can help people with LBD and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors and plan for the future."
Medications for Lewy body dementia,'\tSeveral drugs and other treatments are available to treat LBD symptoms. It is important to work with a knowledgeable health professional because certain medications can make some symptoms worse. Some symptoms can improve with nondrug treatments.' 
Medications for cognitive symptoms,"""\tSome medications used to treat Alzheimer's disease are also used to treat the cognitive symptoms of LBD. These drugs, called cholinesterase inhibitors, act on a chemical in the brain that is important for memory and thinking. They may also improve behavioral symptoms.""""\tThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves specific drugs for certain uses after rigorous testing and review. However, doctors can prescribe a drug for any use if they think it will help a patient. The FDA has approved one Alzheimer's drug, ""'rivastigmine'' (''Exelon'""®), to treat cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease dementia. This and other Alzheimer's drugs can have side effects such as ""'nausea'' and ''diarrhea''.' "
Medications for movement symptoms,"""\tLBD-related movement symptoms may be treated with a Parkinson's medication called ""'carbidopa''-levodopa (''Sinemet''®). This drug can help improve functioning by making it easier to walk, get out of bed, and move around. However, it cannot stop or reverse the progress of the disease.'""\tSide effects of this medication can include hallucinations and other psychiatric or behavioral problems. Because of this risk, physicians may recommend not treating mild movement symptoms with medication. If prescribed, carbidopa-levodopa usually begins at a low dose and is increased gradually. Other Parkinson's medications are less commonly used in people with LBD due to a higher frequency of side effects.""""\tA surgical procedure called deep brain stimulation, which can be very effective in treating the movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease, is not recommended for people with LBD because it can result in greater cognitive impairment.""'\tPeople with LBD may benefit from physical therapy and ''exercise''. Talk with your doctor about what physical activities are best.' "
Medications for sleep disorders,"'''Sleep problems'' may increase confusion and behavioral problems in people with LBD and add to a ''caregiver'""'s burden. To help alleviate ""'sleeplessness'' in people with LBD, a physician can order a sleep study to identify any underlying sleep disorders such as ''sleep apnea'', ''restless leg syndrome'', and REM sleep behavior disorder.'""\tREM sleep behavior disorder, a common LBD symptom, involves acting out one's dreams, leading to lost sleep and even injuries to sleep partners. ""'Clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''®), a drug used to control ''seizures'' and relieve ''panic attacks'', is often effective for the disorder at very low dosages. However, it can have side effects such as ''dizziness'', unsteadiness, and problems with thinking. ''Melatonin'', a naturally occurring hormone used to treat ''insomnia'', may also offer some benefit when taken alone or with clonazepam.''''Excessive daytime sleepiness'' is also common in LBD. If it is severe, a sleep specialist may prescribe a stimulant to help the person stay awake during the day.''\tSome people with LBD may have difficulty falling asleep. If trouble sleeping at night (''insomnia'') persists, a physician may recommend a prescription medication to promote sleep. It is important to note that treating insomnia and other sleep problems in people with LBD has not been extensively studied, and that treatments may worsen daytime sleepiness and should be used with caution.''\tCertain sleep problems can be addressed without medications. Increasing daytime exercise or activities and avoiding lengthy or frequent naps can promote ''better sleep''. Avoiding alcohol, ''caffeine'', or ''chocolate'' late in the day can help, too. Some over-the-counter medications can also affect sleep, so review all medications and ''supplements'' with a physician.' "
Medications for behavioral and mood problems,"'\tBehavioral and mood problems in people with LBD can arise from hallucinations or ''delusions''. They may also be a result of ''pain'', illness, ''stress'' or ''anxiety'', and the inability to express frustration, fear, or feeling overwhelmed. The person may resist care or lash out verbally or physically.'""\tCaregivers must try to be patient and use a variety of strategies to handle such challenging behaviors. Some behavioral problems can be managed by making changes in the person's environment and/or treating medical conditions. Other problems may require medication.""'\tThe first step is to visit a doctor to see if a medical condition unrelated to LBD is causing the problem. Injuries, ''fever'', urinary tract or pulmonary infections, pressure ulcers (bed sores), and ''constipation'' can cause behavioral problems to suddenly grow worse. Increased confusion can also occur.''\tCertain medications used to treat LBD symptoms or other diseases may also cause behavioral problems. For example, some over-the-counter ''sleep aids'', strong ''pain'' medications, bladder control medications, and drugs used to treat LBD-related movement symptoms can cause confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and delusions. Similarly, some anti-anxiety medicines can actually increase anxiety in people with LBD. Review your medications with your doctor to determine if any changes are needed.'""\tNot all behavior problems are caused by illness or medication. A person's surroundings - including levels of stimulation or ""'stress'', lighting, daily routines, and relationships - can lead to behavior issues. Caregivers can alter the home environment to try to minimize anxiety and stress for the person with LBD. In general, people with LBD benefit from having simple tasks, consistent schedules, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. Large crowds or overly stimulating environments can increase confusion and anxiety.'""\tHallucinations and delusions are among the biggest challenges for LBD caregivers. The person with LBD may not understand or accept that the hallucinations are not real and become agitated or anxious. Caregivers can help by responding to the fears expressed instead of arguing or responding factually to comments that may not be true. By tuning in to the person's emotions, caregivers can offer empathy and concern, maintain the person's dignity, and limit further tension.""'\tCholinesterase inhibitors may reduce hallucinations and other psychiatric symptoms of LBD. These medications may have side effects, such as ''nausea'', and are not always effective. However, they can be a good first choice to treat behavioral symptoms. Cholinesterase inhibitors do not affect behavior immediately, so they should be considered part of a long-term strategy.''''Antidepressants'' can be used to treat depression and anxiety, which are common in LBD. Two types of antidepressants, called selective ''serotonin'' reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are often well tolerated by people with LBD.''\tIn some cases, ''antipsychotic'' medications are necessary to treat LBD-related behavioral symptoms to improve both the quality of life and safety of the person with LBD and his or her caregiver. But these types of medications must be used with caution because they can cause severe side effects and can worsen movement symptoms. Consult a doctor before using these types of medications.''\tIf antipsychotics are prescribed, it is very important to use the newer kind, called atypical antipsychotics. These medications should be used at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time possible to control symptoms. Many LBD experts prefer ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''®) or ''clozapine'' (''Clozaril''®) to control difficult behavioral symptoms.''\tOlder drugs called typical (or traditional) antipsychotics, such as ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''®), generally should not be prescribed for people with LBD. They can cause dangerous side effects.' "
Other treatment considerations,"'\tLBD affects the part of the nervous system that regulates automatic actions like blood pressure and ''digestion''. One common symptom is ''orthostatic hypotension'', ''low blood pressure'' that can cause dizziness and ''fainting''. Simple measures such as leg elevation, elastic stockings, and, when recommended by a doctor, increasing salt and fluid intake can help. If these measures are not enough, a doctor may prescribe medication.''\tUrinary ''incontinence'' (inability to control urinary movements) should be treated cautiously because certain medications may worsen cognition. Consider seeing a urologist. Constipation can usually be treated by exercise and changes in ''diet'', though laxatives and stool softeners may be necessary.''\tPeople with LBD are often sensitive to prescription and over-the-counter medications for other medical conditions. Talk with your doctor about any side effects seen in a person with LBD.'""\tIf surgery is planned and the person with LBD is told to stop taking all medications beforehand, ask the doctor to consult the person's neurologist in developing a plan for careful withdrawal. In addition, be sure to talk with the anesthesiologist in advance to discuss medication sensitivities and risks unique to LBD. People with LBD who receive certain anesthetics often become confused or delirious and may have a sudden, significant decline in functional abilities, which may become permanent.""'\tDepending on the procedure, possible alternatives to general anesthesia include a spinal or regional block. These methods are less likely to result in confusion after surgery.' "
How are lice and dandruff different?,"'Lice'' and ''dandruff'' are two things that have been confused with each other for a long time. However, they are very different. Here are a few things that differentiate them from each other.' Cause: Dandruff is caused by a fungus called Malassezia globosa. Your scalp reacts to this microbe by shedding the outer layer of the skin in the form of flakes. You can get lice when your head touches the head of someone who has been infested with lice. Itching is caused when head lice bite you and release their saliva. It is not caused by poor hygiene as misunderstood by many people. Risk factors: In the United States, infestation with head lice is the most common in children between the ages of 3 and 7 years old. Anyone who comes in head-to-head contact with someone who already has head lice is at the highest risk. Additionally, someone who uses personal wear such as hats, scarves, coats, combs, brushes or towels used by an infected person is at a risk of head lice. Dandruff usually begins in young adulthood and continues through middle age. People who do not wash their heads often are more likely to get dandruff due to the buildup of oil on the scalp. Sensitivity to certain hair care products can also put you at a risk of a red, itchy and scaly scalp.  Appearance: Dandruff looks like flakes of white or yellow skin on the scalp and hair. The scalp appears dry and red patches may appear on the scalp. If you have lice on your head, lice eggs (“nits”) attached to the hair fiber appear as small white bumps on the hair. There may be red itchy bite marks. Location: Dandruff is not localized and can be found everywhere on the scalp. Head lice are usually found on the scalp, behind the ears and on the back of the neck.  Treatment: Dandruff can be easily removed, but the nits of head lice are firmly attached to the hair shaft. The treatment of dandruff involves washing the hair often with a gentle cleanser or using a medicated (zinc pyrithione and ketoconazole) anti-dandruff shampoo once or twice a week or washing the hair often. Dandruff disappears in the first wash itself. To prevent it from reappearing, washing the hair often is recommended, which removes oil from the scalp and helps prevent the buildup of dandruff. Head lice rarely go away in the first wash. A dedicated therapy of four to six weeks that’s targeted to kill the lice is needed. The nits also need to be destroyed along with the lice. For this, first, you need to use an over-the-counter pediculicide that can be in the form of a shampoo or lotion, which kills the hatched lice. Then, you’ll need to use a special fine-tooth lice comb to get rid of the eggs. "
What are lice?,"'Lice'' are tiny parasites that can infest the human skin and ''scalp''. They are wingless insects that are about the size of a sesame seed. Infestation with lice is known as ''pediculosis'' and can occur on the head (''head lice''), body, or genital area (''pubic lice''). Different types of lice tend to infest the scalp, body, or genitals.' "
What are fleas?,"'Fleas, like lice, are small wingless insects. Unlike lice, which can only crawl, fleas can jump from one host (such as a pet) to another. Fleas mainly feed on non-human hosts but are able to infest humans. Lice can only live for a day or two without a host, but fleas may live for up to 100 days without a human or animal host. Fleas can live in fabrics and carpets in the home and may be carried by pets.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of lice and fleas?,"'Head lice'' cause an intense ''itching'' or tickling feeling in the hair. It is usually worse at night when the lice are most active. The lice themselves may be visible, or you may recognize the nits (eggs) attached to hair shafts. On the body, lice also cause severe ''itching'' and may cause a red ''rash'' as an ''allergic reaction''. If the lice have been present for some time, the skin may thicken or become dark. ''Pubic lice'' cause a similar reaction in the genital areas.''Fleabites may not produce a visible reaction in many people, so no symptoms may be apparent. In others, fleabites may appear as small bites with a central red spot on the skin. They may appear in groups or form a scab. Uncommonly, people may develop an ''allergic'' reaction to fleabites that includes skin swelling, irritation, and ''hives''.' "
When to seek medical care for lice and fleas,'Seek medical advice if you have symptoms suggestive of lice or fleabites and if home remedies or ''over-the-counter'' medications are ineffective.' 
What specialists treat lice and fleas?,"'Health care professionals who practice primary care -- including family practitioners, internists, and pediatricians -- typically treat lice and fleas. Sometimes dermatologists or skin specialists treat these conditions.' "
How do doctors diagnose lice and fleas?,"'Doctors diagnose a lice infestation by observing the skin directly and identifying the lice or their eggs. They diagnose fleabites typically by looking at the affected skin. Fleabites may sometimes be confused with ''bedbug bites'', but ''bedbug'' bites may form ''blisters'', while fleabites typically do not. No special tests are usually required for the diagnosis of lice or fleas.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for lice and fleas?,"'Body lice'' are usually managed by washing the body well along with any personal belongings that could be contaminated. There are a number of ''over-the-counter products'' available that kill ''head lice'' and pubic lice. Prescription medications are available if over-the-counter products are not effective.''Home remedies that may manage fleabites include over-the-counter cortisone creams, ''tea tree oil'', ''calamine lotion'', and vinegar. ''Antihistamine'' medications may be necessary for allergic reactions to fleabites.' "
What is the prognosis for lice and fleas?,"'Scratching or irritation of the affected areas can sometimes lead to complications like skin and soft tissue infections. However, lice infestations and fleabites are treatable and typically do not cause any long-term problems.' "
How to prevent lice and fleas,"'If someone has been infested with lice, it is important to de-contaminate personal belongings.''Prevent fleas by:\xa0'  Wash bedding, towels, and clothing with hot, soapy water with a temperature of at least 130 F (54 C), and dry them on high heat for at least 20 minutes.  Dry cleaning is also effective. Seal non-washable materials in a plastic bag and store them in a warm area for two weeks. Lice-killing sprays and other products are available for mattresses and furniture. Properly treating family pets with veterinarian-recommended anti-flea medications Regularly cleaning and vacuuming furniture and floors Regularly washing bedding and home textiles"
What is lichen planus?,"'Lichen planus is a chronic recurrent inflammatory disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by small, flat-topped, polygonal ''bumps'' that may coalesce into rough, scaly plaques on the skin. There may also be involvement of the lining tissue (mucous membranes) of the mouth and/or vagina.''Lichen planus is a poorly understood skin condition. Its name is descriptive in that to some it resembles a simple plant, a lichen, which grows on rocks and tree bark, while ''planus'' is Latin for flat.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for lichen planus?,"'The cause of lichen planus is unknown. In certain locales, patients with extensive lichen planus seem to be more likely to have a ''hepatitis C'' virus infection of the ''liver''. However, it seems unlikely that the virus is the cause of lichen planus in such situations.''Some ''drugs'', such as those containing arsenic, bismuth, or gold, can produce an eruption which appears identical to lichen planus. Exposure to certain chemicals used in the development of color photographs can also produce a similar ''rash''. The long-term use of the drugs quinacrine or ''quinidine'' (''Quinidine Gluconate'', ''Quinidine Sulfate''), may produce hypertrophic lichen planus of the lower legs. Lichenoid eruptions can occur in ''graft-versus-host disease'' in people who have received bone marrow transplants. Tissue examination by a pathologist (biopsy) is frequently necessary to distinguish such lichenoid drug eruptions from classical lichen planus. Of course, stopping the offending drug is associated with resolution of the eruption.' "
How is the rash of lichen planus different from that of most other common rashes?,"'Lichen planus can be distinguished from ''eczema'', ''psoriasis'', and other common ''rashes'' purely on the basis of its clinical appearance in that lesions are small bumps or aggregations of bumps that are flat-topped, shiny, polygonal, and purple to gray in color. They tend to occur at the wrists and elbows and ankles. Individual ''papules'"" contain thin white lines called Wickham's striae. When lichen planus involves mucosal tissues, such as the lips or cheeks, these white filmy, web-like lines are easy to detect. It is not unusual for lichen planus to appear at sites of ""'trauma'', especially along lines of scratches (excoriations).' "
What are lichen planus symptoms and signs?,"'Lichen planus ''itching'' varies from mild to severe.''The onset of lichen planus can be sudden or gradual. The first attack may last for weeks or months, and recurrences may happen for years. The bumps at first are 2 mm-4 mm in diameter, with angular borders and a violet color. An excess of pigment (''hyperpigmentation'') may develop in the affected skin as the lesions persist. If lichen planus involves the ''scalp'', it can permanently damage the hair follicles, producing a patch of bald skin called lichen planopilaris. If lichen planus involves the finger or toenails, scarring often occurs, producing permanently malformed nails. Ulcerative lichen planus may occur if oral or vaginal lining tissue (mucosa) are involved.'  "
What does lichen planus look like?,"'The appearance of lichen planus depends on whether the skin or the lining (mucous membranes) inside the mouth or vagina are affected:' Skin involvement: The usual skin involvement with lichen planus consists of flat-topped lilac or violet to brown spots a few millimeters in diameter on the skin. These spots tend to be located on the inner wrists, forearms, the lower legs just above the ankles, and the lower part of the back. A variant of this disease is called hypertrophic lichen planus. This condition appears as thick, reddish-brown lesions that are covered with scales. These spots tend to be on the shins, but they can occur anywhere on the body. This is an especially itchy and persistent (chronic) variant of lichen planus. Atrophic lichen planus produces slightly depressed lesions that otherwise resemble typical lichen planus. Mucous membranes: Lichen planus of the mucous membranes of the mouth and genitals is common. It appears as a white, lacy rash on the inside of the cheeks or the vagina and may not cause symptoms. The oral rash often occurs prior to any skin involvement. More troublesome, although rare, is erosive lichen planus, which can be quite sore and uncomfortable. This erosive form typically causes the patient to complain of the shallow and often quite painful, recurrent ulcers in the mouth or genitals. Lichen planus of the female genitalia can involve the external vulvar mucosa and the internal vaginal mucosa. There is an association with cancer in these areas, so both the oral and vaginal tissues need to be monitored by a medical professional. Nail malformation may be produced by lichen planus. Lichen planus may involve the scalp, producing a permanent, scarring type of balding."
What physicians diagnose and treat lichen planus?,"'Most dermatologists, gynecologists, and some oral surgeons diagnose and treat lichen planus.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose lichen planus?,"'Usually, lichen planus is relatively straightforward to diagnose. Physicians can make the diagnosis in typical cases simply by looking at the rash. If necessary, a ''skin biopsy'' may be done to help confirm the diagnosis because, under the microscope, lichen planus is distinctive in appearance.''Because there are a number of other lichenoid eruptions that resemble lichen planus a biopsy confirmation is frequently necessary. Persistent oral or vaginal lichen planus, with spots that thicken and grow together, can sometimes be difficult to distinguish clinically from whitish ''precancerous'' plaques called ''leukoplakia''. A biopsy can be helpful in this situation. Ulcerative lichen planus precedes the development of ''oral cancer'' in a few patients.'  "
Are there home remedies for lichen planus?,"'Although there is little objective evidence of its benefits, ''green tea'' has been suggested as a treatment for lichen planus. It is likely to be a safe approach.' "
What is the treatment for lichen planus?,"'Most lichen planus is relatively mild. Affected individuals who do not have symptoms do not need treatment. Ultimately, there is no agreed-upon cure for this condition.''Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams or topical calcineurin inhibitors like ''tacrolimus'' or ''pimecrolimus'' may alleviate the ''itch'' and rash. For localized, itchy, thick lesions, injections of ''corticosteroids'' directly into the plaque may help. ''Antihistamines'' may blunt the ''itch'', particularly if it is only moderate. This effect is in part due to the sedative effect of antihistamines. For oral lesions, topical steroids (cortisone) in special oral preparations are available.''In more severe lichen planus, physicians may recommend oral medications or therapy with ultraviolet light. Oral medications may include a course of oral ''prednisone'' or ''acitretin'' or ''griseofulvin''. Occasionally, other immunosuppressive agents may be employed. However, the ''itching'' may return after the drug has been discontinued. A low-dose oral corticosteroid every other morning also may be prescribed. For painful lesions within the mouth, special mouthwashes containing a painkiller (such as ''lidocaine'') before meals may provide some relief. Any drug or chemical suspected of being the cause of the lichen planus should be discontinued.'  "
What is the long-term prognosis of lichen planus?,'Lichen planus usually goes away by itself in time. Some drugs can produce ''rashes'' that are similar in appearance to lichen planus. These rashes can be distinguished from lichen planus in that they go away when the offending drug is stopped.'

"Who gets 
it?",'Lichen sclerosus appears:' Most often in women (usually after menopause). Less often in men. Rarely in children.
What are the symptoms?,"'You may have no symptoms if you have a mild form of the disease. If you do have signs, they can include:'   Small white spots on the skin (early in the disease).

How is it treated?,"'Patches on the arms or upper body usually go away after time without treatment. The disease may also go away after ''puberty''.'""Patches of the genital skin should be treated, even if they aren't painful or ""'itchy''.

What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,"'AAT deficiency can cause ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). ''COPD'' is a group of diseases causing an inflammatory reaction and irreversible damage in the lungs. They cause obstruction of airflow and difficulty ''breathing''. ''Emphysema'' and ''chronic bronchitis'' are the most common diseases that ''makeup'' ''COPD''. ''Emphysema'' is a disease of the alveoli (the tiny air sacs in the lungs). Chronic ''bronchitis'' is a disease of the bronchus (the tubes through which air passes in the lungs). The trachea can also be involved.\xa0''During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes called bronchi. The bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. The ends of bronchioles open into little air sacs called alveoli, which aid in gaseous exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels through which the exchange of gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place.' "
Life expectancy in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,"'There is no cure for the disease, but various treatment options are available to manage the disease and associated lung and liver problems. With appropriate treatment, most patients would be able to live a good life with normal life expectancy, work,\xa0play sports and ''exercise''. The symptoms and complications of liver and lung damage can be managed medically. If patients are not diagnosed and treated appropriately, the disease can potentially lead to severe organ damage, which can be fatal.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,'The disease may not present until adulthood. Most people develop symptoms between the ages of 20 to 40 years old. Some patients may have severe problems while others may have few or no symptoms.''Lung symptoms''Liver symptoms''Skin symptoms''General symptoms''Signs and symptoms in ''babies' Shortness of breath on exertion or at rest in severe cases Wheezing (whistling sound while breathing) Cough Frequent lung infections Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin) Swelling of the legs Dark yellow urine Coughing blood Easy bleeding and bruising Panniculitis are painful lumps or patches on the skin. Fatigue Increased heart rate Weight loss Jaundice  Dark yellow urine Nose bleeding Enlarged abdomen due to liver enlargement Difficulty gaining weight
How is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency treated?,"'There is no cure for AAT deficiency, but various treatment options are available to manage the disease. Patients typically require lifelong treatment and lifestyle modifications to live a normal life and prevent complications. Treatment options include''Lifestyle modifications' Augmentation or replacement therapy: This involves AAT replacement to increase it to normal levels. AAT protein is typically administered once a week intravenously (IV). The goal of replacement therapy is to protect, slow down or stop the damage of the lungs, liver and other organs. It doesn’t reverse the disease or repair any organ damage that has already happened. Bronchodilators may be prescribed to widen the airway and improve lung symptoms. Oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation may be required in some cases. Antibiotics are administered whenever there is any infection. Vaccinations against lung infections like pneumonia and annual flu shots are usually advised. Healthy diet Regular exercise Avoiding cigarette smoking Limiting alcohol consumption Avoiding exposure to cigarette smoke, dust, industrial fumes, etc. Maintaining hand and overall body hygiene to prevent infections"
What exactly is Dravet syndrome?,"'Dravet syndrome is a rare, severe, and lifelong form of epilepsy (''seizure'' disorder) that causes frequent, prolonged ''seizures''. The ''seizures'' are often triggered by health problems such as high body temperature (hyperthermia). They are often associated with developmental delay, speech impairment, incoordination (''ataxia''), low muscle tone (hypotonia), and ''sleep'' disturbances. The seizures begin in the first year of life and may become more frequent and with time. Seizures in Dravet syndrome are often difficult to manage with medications. Most patients with Dravet syndrome have a faulty gene called the SCN1A gene. Although the syndrome is often ''inherited'', most patients do not have a family history of Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis is important to reduce the frequency and length of the seizures. Doctors diagnose the syndrome thorough medical history, clinical examination, and genetic testing.' "
What are the symptoms of Dravet syndrome?,"'The symptoms of Dravet syndrome usually begin in infancy (first year of life). The average age for the onset of the first seizure is 5.2 months, although it can occur at any time between 1 and 18 months of age. A seizure is often triggered by high body temperature or ''fever''. The type and frequency of seizures may vary from person to person. The severity and number of symptoms may also differ from person to person. The typical symptoms and signs include:' Seizures of different types and duration; they are characteristically prolonged and frequent Developmental delay or loss of developmental skills Myoclonus (sudden muscle jerking) Intellectual disability Difficulty in walking Problems with balancing Speech and language impairment Frequent and long-term infections Sleep disturbances Hypotonia (poor muscle tone) Autistic-like behavior (includes difficulty in social interaction, having repetitive and patterned movements, and lack of eye contact)"
Is there a cure for Dravet syndrome?,"'Presently, there is no cure for Dravet syndrome. Treatment is primarily aimed at reducing the frequency and length of the seizures. Dravet syndrome is a spectrum disorder, which means that the patients present with varying signs and symptoms. The treatment is customized to suit the individual patient. Seizures in Dravet syndrome are usually difficult to manage. Multiple anti-seizure medications are often needed. Some medications that work in other forms of epilepsy, such as the sodium-channel agents, may make the seizures worse and must not be given to a person with Dravete syndrome.\xa0''The FDA-approved medications for this syndrome are Epidiolex, Diacomit (stiripentol), and Fintepla.''Some medications are given as a “rescue treatment” to stop a seizure. They include ''drugs'' such as ''clonazepam'', ''diazepam'', ''lorazepam'', and midazolam.' "
What does Addison disease mean?,"'Addison’s disease is a rare disease of the adrenal glands. Adrenals are two small organs situated atop the kidneys. They secrete hormones (chemical substances) in the blood that help maintain salt and water balance and other essential body functions. In this disease, the adrenal glands no longer produce the required hormones, which may cause life-threatening complications.''In the\xa0United States,\xa0Addison disease\xa0affects 1 in 100,000 people. It occurs in both genders with equal frequency, most commonly in the 30-50-year-olds.' "
How do you get Addison disease?,"'You may get Addison disease because of the weakening or malfunctioning of the immune system. The body attacks the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of substances called aldosterone and cortisol. The other causes of Addison disease are:' Injury Infections, such as tuberculosis, HIV, fungal infections Cancer Tumor of the pituitary gland (regulates body functions by controlling hormones) Hereditary (rare) Amyloidosis (a disease where waxy substance deposits in the body and chokes the cells)"
What are the signs and symptoms of Addison disease?,"'If you are diagnosed with Addison disease, you may have' Fatigue, the main sign of Addison disease Muscle weakness is another common sign Pain in the muscles and joints Low blood pressure leading to dizziness and fall, especially while standing Thirst Cravings for salt (in initial stages) Low blood glucose Excessive sweating (common in children with Addison disease) Irregular menses in women Irritability Loss of appetite Weight loss Sometimes, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Darkening of skin on the face, neck, and back of your hands (in initial stages) that covers exposed and nonexposed parts. These are, mostly, visible on skin folds, scars, pressure points, such as the elbows, knees, toes, lips, and knuckles."
What can go wrong with the treatment of Addison disease?,"'Steroid medications (Hydrocortisone) usually need to be taken daily two to three times, at the right time of day. A delay of 2 hours in taking the next dose may lead to weakness, ''dizziness'', ''nausea'', and forgetfulness.''In case of serious illness or injury, extra medication is needed immediately, or an emergency injection of Hydrocortisone may be required.''Untreated Addison disease may prove life-threatening. You may quickly become sick and may have an adrenal crisis, which is a life-threatening situation. In this adrenal crisis, you may have''You must receive an emergency Hydrocortisone injection or immediately reach the hospital. You should be always prepared for an adrenal crisis and must carry extra spare injections of Hydrocortisone.''Around 8% of people with Addison disease experience an adrenal crisis each year, some people experience it more frequently than others.' Weakness Dizziness A lot of vomiting Dangerously high potassium levels in the blood, which may cause a heart attack Diarrhea A rapid drop in blood pressure Stroke (blockage of blood flow in the brain)"
What is Leukemia?,"'Leukemia'' is a\xa0group of ''cancers'' of the blood affecting the white blood cells. White blood cells are the infection-fighting cells of the body. In ''leukemia'', white blood cell production becomes abnormal in the bone marrow. The abnormal white blood cells divide uncontrollably and eventually outnumber the healthy white blood cells. In the end, it becomes difficult for the body to fight infections, control bleeding, and transport oxygen.\xa0''White blood cells can be of myeloid or lymphoid origins and corresponding leukemia derives their names as myeloid or lymphoid leukemia.' "
What is the first sign of leukemia?,"'Leukemia symptoms'' develop slowly. Generally, leukemia starts with ''flu-like symptoms'', including ''night sweats'', ''fatigue'' (''weakness'') and ''fever''. If the ''fever'' symptoms continue for longer than usual, it is important to consult your doctor.\xa0''Other\xa0early ''symptoms of leukemia''\xa0include:' Fever of unknown origin Swollen lymph nodes (lumps along the neck, armpits, groins) Frequent infections Easy bruising or heavy bleeding Bone and joint pain Difficulty breathing Loss of appetite Weight loss"
What are the common types of leukemia?,"'There are four common types of leukemia which include:' Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): In this type of leukemia, immature lymphoid cells grow rapidly in the blood.It is the most common type of leukemia in children and rarely affects adults. In this type of leukemia, immature lymphoid cells grow rapidly in the blood. It is the most common type of leukemia in children and rarely affects adults. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML): In this type of leukemia, immature myeloid cells grow rapidly in the blood.It occurs in both adults and children In this type of leukemia, immature myeloid cells grow rapidly in the blood.

What is the life expectancy of a person with leukemia?,"'In adults, leukemia is most common in people older than 55 years, with the average age of diagnosis being 66 years. It is also one of the most common\xa0cancers\xa0in children and adults younger than 20 years. The survival rate is higher for younger people.\xa0''According to the\xa0National ''Cancer'' Institute, the percentage of deaths by age group is as follows:''Below are a few common risk factors that affect the survival rate of the patient which include:''Below is the life expectancy depending on the type of leukemia:' Patients younger than 44 years have high chances of life expectancy.  Patients aged 44-54 years have average chances of life expectancy.  Patients aged 55-84 years have less chance of survival; however, patients aged 75-84 years have very little chance of survival.  Age Time of diagnosis, Progression and spread of the cancer Type of leukemia A family history of blood conditions and leukemia The extent of bone damage Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene and some petrochemicals Exposure to certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy Chromosome mutations The body’s response to treatment Blood cell count Tobacco use Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL): In general, the disease goes into remission in nearly all children who have it. More than four out of five children live at least 5 years. The prognosis for adults is not as good. Only 25 to 35 percent of adults live 5 years or longer. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML): With proper treatment, most people with this cancer can expect to go into remission. About 80 percent who go into remission will do so within 1 month of therapy. In some people, however, the disease will return, lowering the cure rate. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): On average, people with this cancer survive 9 years, although some have lived for decades, cancer always comes back at some point. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): The outlook for people with chronic myeloid leukemia has improved dramatically over the past 10 years. "
Can leukemia be cured?,"'Acute leukemias can often be cured. Chronic leukemias can be managed with therapy.''Treatment can last several months or even years depending on the type and severity of the condition.' There are different medical approaches to the treatment of leukemia. Treatment will typically depend upon the type of leukemia, the age of the patient, and health status, as well as whether leukemia has spread to other organs. The goal of cancer treatment includes eliminating cancer, preventing it from coming back and increasing the survival rate.  Treatment can include: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Stem cell transplant Targeted therapy Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment Supportive therapy and manage symptoms and complications"
What are the causes of myasthenia gravis?,"""Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition that affects the nerves and muscles. Autoimmune conditions are caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking its own body or tissue. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies (proteins) that block or damage muscle receptor cells. This prevents messages from being passed from the nerve endings to the muscles, which results in the muscles not contracting (tightening) and becoming weak. It is thought that the thymus gland, part of the immune system located in the upper chest, may be linked to the production of these antibodies. Approximately, 10% of people with myasthenia gravis have a benign ""'tumor'' of the thymus gland. Myasthenia gravis can also be triggered in some people by particular ''viruses'' or medicines. It is also thought that some people’s genes (maybe also ''inherited'') make them more likely to develop autoimmune diseases.' "
What are the common symptoms of myasthenia gravis?,"'Symptoms may sometimes be missed or diagnosed only after a period of time. For most people with myasthenia gravis, symptoms are mild at first but get steadily worse over several months, reaching their most severe within the two years. Myasthenia gravis becomes worse when the affected muscle/s is used and improves when it is rested; symptoms often get worse as the day goes on but may get better with rest or a good night’s ''sleep''. The most common symptoms include:''When muscle weakness can cause severe swallowing or breathing problems (known as a myasthenic crisis), it requires urgent medical attention.' Tiring easily just from the act of chewing, especially chewy food such as meat Weak or droopy eyelids The weakness of the facial muscles causing a “snarling” smile Blurred or double vision Slurred or nasal speech Difficulty breathing, particularly when exercising or lying flat Difficulty with neck leading to difficulty in holding up the head Difficulty walking Difficulty balancing and lifting Difficulty swallowing food and/or drinks"
What are the treatment options for myasthenia gravis?,"'In initial and mild cases, patients may need plenty of rest and avoid stressors in life. Treatment options include:''Medications'':''Surgery:''Plasmapheresis:'' In this treatment, the blood is circulated through a machine that removes harmful antibodies from the plasma.''Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy:'' In this treatment, patients may be injected with normal antibodies from donated blood that temporarily change the way the immune system operates.' Pyridostigmine or Neostigmine: These may be prescribed for myasthenia gravis. They prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important chemical that helps the muscles contract (tighten). They can improve muscle contractions and strengthen the affected muscles. They are often used as the first line of treatment for myasthenia gravis if the initial symptoms are not too severe. Side effects include stomach cramps, muscle twitching, diarrhea, and nausea. Steroid: Prednisolone is usually prescribed if symptoms are worsening despite using Pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants: Azathioprine, Methotrexate, or Mycophenolate may be prescribed to suppress the immune receptors that may cause myasthenia gravis.  Thymectomy: In a few cases, the doctor may recommend surgery to remove the thymus gland. It is thought that the immune system resets itself after the thymus gland is removed. However, the improvement may take some time to occur. It is usually seen within the first year, although in some cases, it can take up to three years. It is usually recommended for people aged under 60 years."
What is Crohn’s disease?,"'Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the gut (digestive tract). Crohn’s disease belongs to a group of conditions known as ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''). It can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to anus, but it generally affects the small intestine and the initial part of the ''large intestine''.''Crohn’s disease is similar to other types of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' such as ''ulcerative colitis'' (UC) and ''microscopic colitis''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease?,"'The signs and symptoms vary from individual to individual. In patients with Crohn’s disease, there are times when symptoms worsen known as flares and times when individuals recuperate from the symptoms known as remission. The most common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include the following''Other less common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include' Abdominal pain or cramps Persistent diarrhea Urgent desire to defecate Feeling of incomplete bowel emptying Constipation Weight loss Rectal bleeding Anemia Eye redness or pain Fatigue Fever Joint pain or soreness Nausea or loss of appetite Red, tender bumps under the skin Night sweats Rectal pain"
What causes Crohn’s disease?,"'The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown; however, an autoimmune reaction can incite Crohn’s disease. In an autoimmune reaction, the immune system may attack its healthy cells to cause inflammation of the tissues within the digestive tract. Heredity can also play an important role in causing Crohn’s disease. ''Stress'"" and eating certain foods do not cause Crohn's disease; however, they can worsen the symptoms."" "
Who gets Crohn’s disease?,"'People\xa0with the following risk factors are at an increased risk of Crohn’s disease''According to the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'', people meeting the following descriptions are more likely to report having ''irritable bowel'' disease (''IBD'""), whether Crohn's disease or ""'ulcerative colitis'':'""The numbers of men and women with Crohn's disease are about the same.""

At what age is Crohn's disease diagnosed?," For the age of onset in Crohn's disease, the first peak occurs between the ages of 15 and 30 years.  The second peak occurs mainly in women between the ages of 60 and 70 years. Most cases of Crohn's disease begin before age 30.  Approximately 20-30% of people with Crohn's disease are diagnosed before age 20."
How is Crohn's disease diagnosed?,'There are no specific tests or procedures to diagnose Crohn’s disease. The physician evaluates the symptoms and uses information from diagnostic testing to exclude other potential causes.''The common diagnostic tests includes' Blood tests X-rays of the upper and lower digestive tract Endoscopy Biopsy of the colon while performing endoscopy Imaging tests such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
What is the treatment for Crohn’s disease?,"'Various treatment options help to control the disease and help patients lead a rewarding life. Treatment options include''Medications suppress inflammation by reducing the activity of the immune system. They also help reduce symptoms or complications. Mostly, antidiarrheals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antibiotics are used.''Bowel rest involves restricting eating any food by mouth to give the bowel a rest.\xa0''Surgery is useful to treat complications and reduce symptoms when other treatments are not useful.''Incorporating the following dietary changes helps to reduce symptoms' Use of medication Alterations in diet and nutrition Surgical procedures Avoiding carbonated beverages Avoiding popcorn, nuts and high-fiber food Drinking more liquids Eating smaller meals more often"

What are the signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome?,"'Marfan syndrome is a rare disorder; however, it is the most common ''inherited'' disorder of connective tissue.''Other signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome include:' In Marfan syndrome, the connective tissue is weaker than normal, so it stretches, bulges, or tears. This syndrome most commonly affects the heart, eyes, blood vessels, skin, and skeleton. In most cases, the disease tends to worsen with age. The serious condition of Marfan syndrome is when a patient has an enlarged aorta (the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body) this may result in complications that are usually life-threatening if not treated. Disproportionately long arms, legs, and fingers Flat feet Tall and slender build A breastbone that protrudes outward or dips inward A high, arched palate and crowded teeth Extreme nearsightedness Heart problems: The aorta may become stretched and may tear (aortic dissection) or burst (aortic rupture). They can also develop leaking heart valves that can be detected by a doctor as a heart murmur. An abnormally curved spine Tiredness, chest pain, and shortness of breath is noticed in severe cases"
What is the cause of Marfan syndrome?,"'The causes of Marfan syndrome include:' Marfan’s syndrome is a hereditary condition in 75% of cases. In the remaining 25% of cases, it is caused by a new gene mutation. The condition is inherited dominantly, and therefore, children of a person with Marfan’s syndrome have a 50% chance of developing the condition. People with Marfan syndrome are born with the disorder, although they may not be diagnosed with it until later in life. Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation in a gene that determines the structure of fibrillin (defect in the gene on chromosome 15 that determines the structure of fibrillin). Fibrillin is an important part of human connective tissue. Fibrillin-1 is a protein present in the body’s connective tissues. The genetic defect of fibrillin-1 leads to an increase in the production of another protein, transforming growth factor-beta or TGF-B. Its overproduction is responsible for the features present in a person with Marfan syndrome. Connective tissue helps hold the body together by binding tendons to muscles and muscles to bones and is made of microscopic fibers. This tissue provides the stretchy strength of tendons and ligaments around joints and in blood vessel walls. In Marfan’s syndrome fibrillin is abnormal, which causes tissue to become unusually stretchy and weak causing body abnormalities."
Can Marfan syndrome be treated?,"'There is no cure established for Marfan syndrome yet. Treatment focuses on preventing the various complications of the disease.' Doctors often prescribe blood pressure-lowering drugs to prevent the aorta from enlarging and reduce the risk of dissection and rupture. If the aorta has significant enlargement (about 2 inches) or if it enlarges rapidly, the doctor may recommend an operation to replace a portion of the aorta with a tube made of synthetic material. This can help prevent a life-threatening rupture. The aortic valve may need to be replaced as well depending on symptoms. The vision problems may be corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Sometimes, surgery may also be necessary to treat eye problems. Bracing and surgery may be needed to treat spine disorders. Surgical options are available to correct the appearance of a sunken or protruding breastbone."
What is the life expectancy of someone with Noonan syndrome?,"'There is a wide range in the severity of signs and symptoms in people with ''Noonan syndrome'' (NS). Therefore, the prognosis (long-term outlook) of this disease may vary in every case.''NS is a genetic (heredity) disorder. It may be diagnosed during the routine first-trimester sonography during the ''pregnancy'' if the fetus (unborn) has ''cysts'' around the neck or nuchal abnormalities (fluid under the neck fold in utero).''It may be diagnosed at birth as well with genetic testing.''Although most people reach adulthood, the risk of blood ''cancer'' is higher in these individuals than in the normal population. These kids may also have ''heart'' defects, the most common being pulmonic stenosis.''In the absence of a large, longitudinal study, reliable information about long-term morbidity and mortality is lacking. However, those with ''heart failure'' around two years of age have a poor chance of living a long life.''The life expectancy of a person with NS is likely to be normal if serious heart defects are absent. About 50% of people with NS have a heart defect since birth such as a hole in the heart (patent ductus arteriosus), heart valve hardening (stenosis), etc.''Some affected children may also have other ongoing health problems\xa0such as problems urinating,\xa0''blood disorders'', etc. However, with special care and counselling, the majority of children with NS grow up and function normally as adults.'

What are the causes?,"'Noonan syndrome (NS) is caused by faulty genes (basic physical and functional unit of heredity). Around 75% of the cases are ''inherited'' (run in their families). These faulty genes can be transmitted from the parent to their child. Each child of a parent who carries these faulty genes has 50% chances of inheriting the gene and developing this condition. There is no evidence of environmental factors such as ''diet'' or exposure to ''radiation'' that can cause any of these changes in genes. Sometimes, there may be no family history.''It is seen in about 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 2,500 children. It affects both men and women.' "
What are the treatment approaches for Noonan syndrome?,"'Currently, there is no cure for Noonan syndrome (NS). However, the multidisciplinary treatment approach and proper management of disease conditions may ease some of the associated issues with NS. If your child has been diagnosed with NS, the treatment options may include the following''Because every NS child shows variability in presentation, multidisciplinary care is necessary to manage these conditions. It is essential that conditions such as developmental disabilities are identified and addressed early and managed carefully.''You should speak to a genetic counsellor if you, your child or a member of your family have been diagnosed with NS or if NS runs in your family. A genetic counsellor may help with better approaches to managing the condition and may also support a family in finding resources.' Careful screening of your child can be done for mild heart irregularities on an outpatient basis. Severe heart structural defects can be corrected with a surgery. Feeding problems can be managed by inserting a nasogastric (a tube in the child’s nose down the food pipe and into the stomach). Shortsightedness can be corrected with prescription glasses. Certain regular injections of growth hormones may help your child achieve a more normal height. However, it is controversial. Undescended gonads (testicles, which are the male reproductive organs) can be corrected by surgery. Seizures can be managed with anticonvulsant medications. In the case of communication skill problems, speech therapy may help to improve your child’s speech and communication skills. About 10% of children with NS may need special education to overcome learning issues. Mild blood clotting problems can be managed with regular medications. Dental structural defects and malpositioning can be corrected with dental surgeries and braces to a certain extent. Ear problems such as a glue ear can be managed by inserting a grommet (a drainage tube) inside the ear. In some cases, appropriate behavior management may help."

How is ulcerative colitis diagnosed?,"'The physician would do a complete physical assessment, advice a series of specialized blood and radiological investigations (X-ray, computed tomography [CT] scan, etc.). Colonoscopy, ''endoscopy'', biopsy, ''stool'' examination, and other tests may be done.' "
What is the treatment of ulcerative colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a lifelong disease with constant periods of flare-ups and remission (relief in symptoms). Presently, there is no permanent medical cure for it, but there are various medications that can provide symptomatic relief, reduce inflammation, and manage flare-ups.''Treatment involves medical and surgical management depending on the disease severity. Patients would also require dietary and lifestyle changes.' Medical treatment includes the following:Medication to suppress and/or modulate the immune systemPainkillersAntibioticsAnti-diarrhea medication Medication to suppress and/or modulate the immune system Painkillers Antibiotics Anti-diarrhea medication Surgical treatment includes the following:Colectomy (surgical removal of part of the colon or whole colon) may be required in severe cases. Colectomy (surgical removal of part of the colon or whole colon) may be required in severe cases. Dietary changes:Diet low in fat, meat, sulfur and milk Diet low in fat, meat, sulfur and milk Management of psychological stress and emotional support"
What are the complications of ulcerative colitis?,"'The possible complications of ulcerative colitis are as follows:' Bleeding: The ulcers and erosions in the inner lining of the large intestine can perforate through the layers of the intestine causing bleeding.  Nutrition loss and dehydration: Chronic diarrhea and inflammation lead to dehydration, nutrition loss, and a decrease in the absorption of nutrients. Inflammation of other organs: Inflammation of the eyes, joints, skin, liver, and lungs Toxic megacolon: A rare complication that causes swelling and ballooning of the colon manifesting as:Swollen and painful abdomenDiarrheaPalpitationsFever Swollen and painful abdomen Diarrhea Palpitations Fever Colon cancer and ulcerative colitis (UC): The chances of colon cancer increase if the patient has had UC for over eight years. Appropriate treatment and the availability of new treatment options for UC have lowered the risk of colon cancer."
What is Treacher Collins syndrome?,"'Treacher Collins syndrome or ''mandibulofacial dysostosis'' is a genetic and congenital (by birth) condition that usually affects the development of bones and structures of the face. ''Babies'' who have it are usually born with deformed\xa0ears, eyelids, cheekbones, and jawbones.\xa0These differences often cause problems with breathing, swallowing, chewing, hearing, and speech. Problems with ''teeth''\xa0and\xa0''dry eyes''\xa0may lead to infections.' The other common signs and symptoms include: Flat, sunken, or sad look on the face Really small cheekbones Eyes that slant down Missing eyelid tissue Notch in the lower eyelid An opening or split in the roof of the mouth cleft palate and upper lip (cleft lip) Abnormal airway Small upper and lower jaw and chin Misshapen or missing ears Skin growth in front of the ear Causes: Treacher Collins syndrome is caused by an abnormality in someone’s genes, and it arises before they are born. If neither parent has TCS, the chances of having a child with TCS is very low. An adult with TCS has a 50% chance of passing on TCS to their children. In over 80 to 93% of cases, Treacher Collins syndrome is caused by changes (mutations) in any of these genes: TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D. These genes appear to play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face. They are involved in making proteins that help make ribosomal RNA (rRNA). rRNA is a chemical needed to make new proteins that are necessary for normal function and survival of cells. Mutations in these genes can reduce the production of rRNA, which may cause cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues to die early. This premature cell death may lead to the signs and symptoms of TCS. It is still unclear why the effects of these mutations are generally limited to facial development. In a few cases, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown. Genetic mutations are usually thought of as inherited, but most of the mutations that cause this syndrome are found in people without any affected relatives. Treacher Collins syndrome is normally caused by a new mutation that occurs at random in a sperm or egg cell before or at the time of conception. There are over 120 different identified mutations that can cause this disorder. Treacher Collins syndrome can occur for the first time in a family as a new genetic change in a person (de novo mutation) or may be inherited in families."
Can we treat Treacher Collins syndrome?,"'Treacher Collins syndrome cannot be cured; however, signs and symptoms may be managed to give the child a near to normal appearance with better functional ability:''Final corrections are usually completed between the ages of 16 and 20 years.' Breathing problems: Initially, stabilizing a child’s breathing problems will require treatment as it may be life-threatening. An artificial opening into the windpipe to allow patients to breathe is one of the surgeries. Other cases may only need breathing support at night. Feeding problems: Feeding problems may be helped with a feeding tube or gastrostomy tube directly into the stomach bypassing the mouth and throat. Facial reconstruction: Patients may undergo facial reconstruction surgery to get a normal appearance through bone grafts or implants. It may also help in closing the opening in the roof of the mouth, repairing the underdeveloped jaw, cheekbones, ears. Hearing problems: Addressing any issues with hearing is crucial. The hearing ability must be tested at birth and routinely thereafter. Hearing aids and speech-language therapy are often required. Regular eye exams may be done to look for problems with vision, eye movements, and cornea exposure."
What are lighted stylet-assisted tracheal intubation devices?,"'Intubation'' or ''endotracheal intubation'' is a medical procedure in which a tube (endotracheal tube) is placed into the windpipe (trachea) through the mouth or nose. In most emergencies, endotracheal intubation is performed through the mouth.\xa0''Lighted stylet-assisted tracheal intubation devices ''are tube-like devices with a light source at one end. They help in easy and fast intubation by providing support and their shape aids navigation of the endotracheal tube toward the trachea, whereas the light at the end of the stylet guides the correct placement of the endotracheal tube.\xa0''Light-guided intubation'' is simple and effective in many patients. When the tip of the stylet carrying the light source (lightwand) enters the opening of the trachea (glottis), a bright glow can be observed externally on the front of the neck just below Adam’s apple.\xa0''By contrast, if the lightwand is placed in the food pipe (''esophagus''), no such glow on the neck is observed. For a better view of the glow, room lights are dimmed during the procedure.''Various lighted stylets are available for intubation such as Light Wand (Vital Signs Inc, Totowa, NJ), Trachlight (Laerdal Medical, Wappingers Falls, NY) and Tube Stat lighted stylet (Xomed, Jacksonville, FL). Because these devices rely on the principle of transillumination (appearance of a glow on the front of the neck from the lightwand underneath), direct visualization of the glottis is not required for their use.' "
What is the main use of lighted stylet-assisted tracheal intubation devices?,"'The main indication is in patients with a difficult ''airway'' for whom a direct laryngoscopy (a procedure for visualization of the vocal cords) has failed, for example, a ''trauma'' patient with bleeding in the area behind the mouth (oropharynx).''Patients who have been given muscle relaxants (pharmacologically paralyzed) and cannot be intubated with a direct laryngoscopy are also the candidates for light-guided tracheal intubation.' "
What happens during a lighted stylet-assisted tracheal intubation?," If the patient is awake, the doctor applies a local anesthetic spray and administers sedation. If a neck injury is not a concern, the patient’s head and neck are placed in a relatively extended position (chin-up position) with the help of a towel roll placed under the shoulders. This allows maximal exposure of the front of the neck, thereby enhancing visualization of the transilluminated light. If a neck injury is a concern, the patient’s head is placed in a neutral position. The practitioner generally stands at the head end of the patient and inserts the lubricated lighted stylet into the endotracheal tube. The practitioner bends the tube and stylet in the shape of a hockey stick, with a 90° curve beginning just above the tube cuff. They grasp the patient’s jaw near the corner of the mouth using the thumb, index and middle fingers and lift the jaw to elevate the tongue and the covering of the voice box (epiglottis). A glow in the midline of the neck indicates the location of the tube tip. Positioning is optimal when the glow can be observed in the midline of the neck, just below Adam’s apple. The practitioner then slides the endotracheal tube off while holding the stylet steady and advances into the trachea up to the proper depth. The doctor confirms the tube placement by using a stethoscope and capnography (measurement of carbon dioxide in a patient’s exhaled breath). Finally, the doctor secures the endotracheal tube with a tube holder or an adhesive tape."
Cosmetic Procedures and Lip Augmentation,"""So you want to improve the appearance of your lips? You've got your reasons. Plumping your pucker often improves self-confidence and sexual confidence.""'The good news is that you have many options to improve the appearance of your lips. The methods we discuss here also reduce fine lines and ''wrinkles'"" around your lips. It's important to be realistic, too. Injections or implants can enhance and improve your natural look, but they're not about performing miracles. "" "
Who Are the Best Candidates for Lip Augmentation?,"'You must be in good general health overall. You are not a good candidate for lip augmentation if you have: ''Like any other ''cosmetic surgery'"", lip augmentation requires a lot of responsibility. You can only determine for yourself if you're ready. We've included the most popular injections and implants here. This information should serve as a general overview only and should not replace your doctor's advice. Once you've selected a doctor, you will communicate with him or her and decide together which option best suits your needs. ""' As with any medical procedure, you should tell your doctor of any ''allergies'' or any medications that you are taking and you will be required to discuss your medical history. Certain diseases such as ''diabetes'' can increase your chances of complications. If you are a smoker, this may also be a complicating factor.' Current cold sores Certain diseases such as diabetes or lupus Any scarring of the lips  Blood clotting problems"
Injections for Lip Augmentation,"""Your surgeon will most likely use topical anesthesia (painkiller applied directly to the lips) for injections. These are performed on an outpatient basis in your doctor's office or an outpatient center and you will be sent home the same day.""' Here are the options: ' Artecoll is a synthetic material that plumps up the lips. Because it's synthetic, you are at higher risk of having an allergic reaction to it than if you got an injection of collagen or fat, but it lasts longer than either. Autologen is an injection of your own collagen, extracted from another place on your body. There's no risk of allergic reaction, however, the results are only temporary. This may be good for people who aren't ready to commit to a permanent result. Collagen can be extracted from cows and injected into the lips. There's a risk of allergic reaction, so it's best to have your surgeon give you a test dose before proceeding to the full dose. The results are temporary lasting 
	four weeks to three months. Dermalogen is collagen extracted from deceased human donors. This is also a temporary fix, but your body should not reject it. Fascia injections use a specific type of connective tissue harvested either from your own body or from a deceased human donor. It can be implanted surgically or injected. The main drawback is that within a year of injection, your body will reabsorb the fascia. Fat from your own thighs or abdomen can be injected into your lips. There's no risk of allergic reaction and you may achieve permanent results. This can also be implanted surgically (see below). If you gain weight, your lips may enlarge since the fat cells will get bigger.  Hylaform is a material created from a natural body substances known as hyaluronic acid. There's no risk of infection, but you will need repeated treatments to maintain the result as it's only a temporary fix. Restylane is a clear gel. It contains hyaluronic acid. It's biodegradable, so your body will absorb it within about six months of the injection. "
Lip Implants and Surgeries,"""You will most likely receive local anesthesia if you get a lip implant or have lip augmentation surgery. A procedure can take up to two hours at your doctor's office or outpatient center, depending on the complexity, and you will be sent home the same day.""'Here are the options:''Your surgeon may also be able to make an incision along the upper line of your lip.' Alloderm is a sheet of collagen created from deceased humans. Your surgeon inserts them through tiny incisions made on the inside part of the lip. This material offers only a temporary fix, lasting up to 12 months. Fat grafting is the surgical method of inserting your own fat into your lips to achieve the desired fullness. You may achieve permanent results, but this method varies from person to person. Because it's your own fat, there is a chance that your body can reabsorb it. Goretex, SoftForm, and soft ePTFE are synthetic materials that can achieve a permanent result. Unlike some of the other options we've listed above, your body will not absorb these. However, because they are synthetic, there is a risk of allergic reaction. Local flap grafts is a 
  surgical procedure that takes tissue and skin from the inside flap of your 
  mouth. It's far more invasive than any other technique, and is often the last resort among plastic surgeons."
How Long Will Recovery Take After Lip Augmentation?,"""It's important that you have someone with you who can drive you home after a lip augmentation procedure.""'If you are having surgical implants or grafts, your recovery can take up to two weeks after the surgery.'""It's important that you know yourself. Discuss how much time you think you'll need for recovery with your doctor. It may be necessary to take some time off work. You will need at least three days off from work, at minimum. If you are physically active, you will not be able to ""'exercise'' for a few days after injections and perhaps for a few weeks after surgical implants. ' "
How to Prepare for Lip Augmentation:,"""It's important that you have someone with you who can drive you home from the operation.""'If you are a smoker, you may be required to stop ''smoking'"" for a period before the procedure. You should follow your doctor's instructions carefully on this.""'Make sure you wear loose, comfortable clothing. Be especially mindful of the shirt or blouse you choose to wear that day. It should be button down, if possible, so you do not have to pull it over your face.''You should not take ''aspirin'' or painkillers like ''ibuprofen'' or ''Motrin'' before having the procedure.''Before Your Procedure, Establish a Home Recovery Area With the Following:' Ice Comfortable pillows on which you can prop yourself Ointment or cream as recommended by your doctor Plenty of soft foods, such as jello, pudding, oatmeal and yogurt that do not require chewing Telephone within reaching distance of your recovery

Does Health Insurance Cover Lip Augmentation?,"""Insurance may cover lip augmentation if the procedure is being completed for reconstructive purposes, such as a congenital defect or as reconstruction after an injury or accident. However, if you are undergoing this procedure purely for cosmetic purposes, you're most likely on your own to pay the bill.

LDL and HDL: What are triglycerides?,"'Triglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.''The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with ''cholesterol'' to form chylomicrons. This is the source of energy for cells in the body. Fat cells and ''liver'' cells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.''Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease''. Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty ''liver disease'' and pancreatitis.''Certain diseases and conditions may cause elevated triglyceride blood levels, for example:''Alcohol'' consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase ''HDL'' (the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of ''heart disease''. ''However, it is not recommended that people start to drink alcohol to obtain these effects.' Poorly-controlled diabetes Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver or other liver diseases Hypothyroidism Some medications (for example, beta blockers, diuretics, birth control pills)"
How are triglyceride levels measured?,"'Triglyceride levels in the blood are measured by a simple blood test. Often, triglycerides are measured as part of a lipoprotein panel (''lipid'' panel) in which triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) are measured at the same time.''Fasting for 8-12 hours before the test is required. Fat levels in the blood are affected by recent eating and ''digestion''. Falsely elevated results may occur if the blood test is done just after eating.' "
What are normal triglyceride levels? What do elevated triglyceride levels mean?,'Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and ''cholesterol levels'' are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk.' Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. Extremely high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
What causes low triglyceride levels?,"'Returning triglyceride levels to normal may decrease the risk of ''heart'' attack, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease. Controlling high triglycerides and ''high cholesterol'' is a lifelong challenge. A healthy lifestyle includes eating well, exercising routinely, ''smoking cessation'', and ''weight loss''. This may be all that is needed, but some people additionally require medications to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Your health-care professional will help make decisions with you to decide what treatment combination is most appropriate.' "
Changes in diet to lower triglycerides,"'The following dietary changes may be helpful in lowering triglycerides.''Switch to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of trans or saturated fats. The best sources of these fats are olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, lake trout, sardines, herring, and albacore tuna. Learning to interpret food labels will help you understand the kinds of fat in the food you buy and consume.'   Decreasing your intake of sugar: If you have a sweet tooth, try to set limits on how often and how much sugar you consume. You can cut your intake in half to begin with, and continue cutting back from there. Remember to read the labels to check for sugar content in both food and beverages. Changing from white to brown: If you eat white rice, bread, and pasta, switch to whole wheat products. It may take a little while to get used to the difference in taste, but it's worth the effort for the benefits to your health. A variety of whole-wheat products are available so experiment until you find the one that you like best. Switching fats: Limit or avoid foods with saturated and trans fats. These include fried foods, lard, butter, whole milk, ice cream, commercial baked goods, meats, and cheese. Read the nutrition labels to determine whether these unhealthy fats are present."
Types of lipodystrophy,"'There are many different types of lipodystrophy. It can be acquired, or genetic (inherited). The inherited form may be present at birth or develop during childhood (congenital). It may result in fat loss in only one area of the body or throughout the body (generalized).' Generalized lipodystrophy refers to the situation in which the fat tissue throughout the body is affected (sometimes mistaken for weight or fat gain). Partial, or localized, lipodystrophy affects only one area of the body and is not associated with abnormal health generally. Both generalized lipodystrophy and partial lipodystrophy can be acquired or congenital."
What is generalized lipodystrophy?,"'Lipodystrophy is a term that refers to abnormalities of the fat (adipose) tissue in the body. It is a group of rare conditions that are characterized by progressive loss or redistribution of fat, mainly from the tissues beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissues), but loss of fat surrounding the internal organs (visceral fat) also is possible.' "
What is inherited (familial) lipodystrophy?,"'Inherited lipodystrophy results from a genetic cause.' Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL, the Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. There also are several types of the familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD), such as FPLD type 1 (Kobberling's syndrome), FPLD type 2 (Dunnigan's syndrome), and other rare types of the disease."
What is acquired lipodystrophy?,"'Acquired lipodystrophy'' is a form of the syndrome that is not genetic, but develops as a response to another condition. The acquired forms include:' Acquired generalized lipodystrophy (AGL), or Lawrence syndrome Acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome) is a disorder that leads to loss of fat in the upper trunk and face, which begins in childhood or adolescence. Lipodystrophy induced by protease inhibitors used in HIV infection treatment; this can involve both fat loss and abnormal fat buildup for the patient with HIV. Localized, or partial, lipodystrophy, such as at an injection site (for example, from cortisone injection), which typically does not affect the overall health of the patient."
What are the signs and symptoms of the types of lipodystrophy?,"'The characteristic symptom of lipodystrophy is the loss of or abnormal distribution of fat. Loss of fat also is referred to as ''lipoatophy'"". In the congenital (inherited) form, the loss of fat causes an abnormal appearance that's usually noticed within the first two years of life. Depending upon the exact cause, the abnormalities may be seen all over the body or localized to one area. For example, some individuals may have areas on their body that appear thin, while other areas might appear larger (where the excessive fat is located). Others might have very little fat on the lower areas of the body and excess fat on the upper areas. Some people will have reduced fat all over the body.""'Children with the condition may have other associated symptoms and signs, for example, the child may:''In generalized lipodystrophy, fat can be found in abnormal locations in the body including the ''heart'', kidneys, ''liver'', and pancreas. The presence of fat deposits in these organs can cause problems such as:''Acquired generalized lipodystrophy has signs and symptoms similar to the inherited forms, but occurs in previously healthy children or adults. In all forms of lipodystrophy, women appear to be more severely affected than men.'  Want and devours food (has a voracious appetite) Grow faster and is taller than his or her piers (accelerated linear growth) Have an increased metabolic rate Have advanced bone age Have a belly that sticks out (protrudes) Have highly developed muscles (prominent musculature) Go through puberty early (precocious sexual development) Have mental retardation Have dark, velvety skin patches (acanthosis nigricans) Insulin resistance Diabetes High cholesterol Fatty liver disease Pancreatitis Heart disease"
What causes lipodystrophy?,"'Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is a result of specific genetic mutations that are passed from one generation to the next (inherited). Mutations in the genes known as AGPAT2 and BSCL2 account for the majority (about 95%) of cases of CGL. Mutations in other genes, including CAV1 and PTRF, have also been associated with this form of the disease.'""Leptin is a natural chemical that is responsible for the metabolism of fat. Some patients  with generalized lipodystrophy have been shown to be deficient in a substance known as leptin. Low leptin levels cause abnormalities in the body's metabolism, which creates excess fat. This excessive fat tissue, as mentioned previously, can cause metabolic complications and diseases like ""'insulin'' resistance, ''diabetes'', ''high cholesterol'', ''fatty liver disease'', and ''heart disease''.''Acquired lipodystrophy'' syndrome has been reported after infections; diseases in which your immune system attacks your body (autoimmune disease); injury (''trauma''); or if pressure is put on, or repeated injections placed in same place on your body (for example, if you have ''diabetes'"" and you give yourself insulin shots on the same place on your skin every day, you might get it at the injection site). Sometimes, doctors and clinicians don't know what caused the trigger event.""'Medical treatment with antiretroviral ''drugs'', for example protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) for HIV infection has been found to cause lipodystrophy in patients infected with the HIV virus.' "
Are there tests to diagnose lipodystrophy?,"'To make the medical diagnosis of lipodystrophy the doctor will first examine the abnormal appearance caused by changes in fat loss or gain, and then he or she will look for the characteristic clinical symptoms and signs.''Blood tests to measure leptin levels as well as to confirm the presence of other metabolic problems (like insulin resistance, diabetes, or elevated blood ''lipid'' levels) are other important diagnostic tests, but not all patients with lipodystrophy have low levels of leptin.''Genetic testing may be performed to evaluate whether a genetic mutation is present in a patient that causes the inherited form.' "
How are the different types of lipodystrophy treated and managed?,"  Generalized lipodystrophy: In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called metreleptin for injection (Myalept) as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency. Metreleptin is used in addition to dietary changes for patients with the congenital generalized or acquired generalized type. Metreleptin is given by injection and is an analog of human leptin produced by recombinant DNA technology. T-cell lymphoma has occurred in patients with the acquired type who had immunodeficiency before beginning metreleptin treatment. Common side effects of metreleptin can include:FatigueHypoglycemiaHeadacheDecreased weightAbdominal pain Fatigue Hypoglycemia Headache Decreased weight Abdominal pain Diet and lipodystrophy: There is no diet plan or therapy that reverses the symptoms of lipodystrophy, but a low-fat diet is recommended for people with the disorder. Treatment of associated diseases: Medical treatment of any associated metabolic abnormalities, including diabetes or high blood cholesterol, is the same as for other patients with these health problems. These treatments include both lifestyle modifications and medications. Acquired lipodystrophy: Your doctor will tailor your treatment based upon the specific cause. For example, if you give yourself insulin shots don't use the same location on the skin every time. Treatment for HIV patients: There are several treatments described for HIV-associated lipodystrophy. HIV treatment options include thiazolidinedione drugs (such as pioglitazone [Actos]), growth hormone, growth hormone-releasing hormone, metformin (Glucophage), and recombinant human leptin. Surgery: Surgical treatments have also been used to improve the cosmetic appearance in some people."
How common is lipodystrophy?,"'In general, lipodystrophy syndromes are rare.' Generalized lipodystrophy (whether inherited or acquired) is estimated to affect less than one out of every one million people. Approximately 250 cases of acquired partial lipodystrophy have been reported. HIV-associated lipodystrophy is more common, but it is difficult to estimate how common it actually is. Estimates of lipodystrophy associated with HIV have ranged from 10% to over 80% of patients infected with HIV."
What is the prognosis and lifespan for a person with lipodystrophy?,"""It is difficult to estimate the health prognosis for a given person with lipodystrophy because there are many different kinds of the disorder. Moreover, the health of people is affected to varying degrees. Prognosis or outcome on the patient health will be dependent upon the severity of the disorder as well as the extent of associated problems, such as diabetes, HIV, or other diseases and health problems.

Why Have the Procedure?,"'Some people have stubborn areas of fat cells that will not shrink no matter how much they ''diet'' or ''exercise''. The common areas for these fat pockets include the chin, neck, hips, abdomen, thighs, buttocks and even calves and ankles. ''A newer technique called ultrasonic-assisted lipoplasty (UAL) may help you address that unwanted fat. UAL is an enhancement to the currently used tumescent ''liposuction'' method. To keep your new shape and new weight after this lipoplasty, you will need to follow a proper ''diet'' and ''exercise'' plan. ' "
How Does Lipoplasty Differ From Other Liposuction Techniques?,""" UAL uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before removing it with gentle suction. Tumescent liposuction and traditional liposuction cannot liquefy fat cells, and this makes the fat more difficult to remove. "" "
What Are the Benefits of Lipoplasty?,"'Early results by a select group of ''plastic'' surgeons internationally have been encouraging. However, further study is needed to determine if lipoplasty will replace existing  liposuction  techniques.''UAL allows physicians to remove significant amounts of fat in a single session because the fat is liquefied by sound waves. It can be especially useful in areas of dense fat such as the back. The use of sound waves prevents surrounding blood vessels and connective tissue from being damaged because fat cells are selectively destroyed and removed. ' "
What Happens During Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"' Several steps are involved. Similar to traditional liposuction, the skin is marked to indicate the precise area from which the fat will be removed. Next, a large amount of very dilute anesthetic solution is injected into the body site to numb and swell the fatty area (tumescent technique). '' Then, in a step unique to lipoplasty, a thin tube-like instrument called an ultrasonic probe is inserted beneath the skin through a small incision. The probe is maneuvered in a crisscross pattern while sound waves generate negative pressure, causing the fat cells to implode, or collapse, and liquefy. The liquefied fat and anesthetic fluid are removed using gentle suction. ' "
What Happens After Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"' Patients are instructed to wear a tight-fitting garment, such as a girdle or thick support hose for up to six weeks after the procedure. Sometimes, postoperative ''pain'' medication is not needed because the injected anesthetic solution keeps the area numb for 12 hours or more. '"" Every person's outcome will vary somewhat based on factors such as volume of fat cells removed and area of removal. Your doctor will discuss what results you can expect to achieve, and how to best maintain your new body shape. "" "
Are The Results of Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty Permanent?,"' The fat cells are removed permanently, so if you gain weight after the procedure, it will usually not concentrate in the treated area. This is because you now have less cells in the treated area in which fat can be deposited. However, ultrasonic-assisted lipoplasty will not prevent you from regaining weight. ' "
Who Is a Good Candidate for Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"' A thorough evaluation by a board-certified ''plastic surgeon'' experienced in lipoplasty will determine if you are a good candidate. But in general, a good candidate for lipoplasty (as well as other liposuction techniques) is a person of average or slightly above average weight, in good health, with a localized area of fat that does not respond well to diet and exercise. ' "
Who Can Perform Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"'Board-certified plastic surgeons who have undergone specialized training required by the Ultrasonic Liposuction Task Force can perform lipoplasty. This task force was established by three major ''plastic surgery'' societies: The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, The Aesthetic Society and The Lipoplasty Society. Its mission is to set safety standards for the performance of UAL. Do not hesitate to ask your doctor about credentials and training and how many lipoplasty procedures he or she has performed. ' "
Are There Risks Involved With Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty?,"'UAL has a good safety record to date, but carries the same risks as all liposuction surgery, such as rare occurrence of infection, blood or fat clots; or cosmetic risks like a change in skin pigmentation, or skin texture. Post-operative fluid collections, known as seromas may also form. However these can be drained with a needle and a syringe.''Unique to UAL is the risk of ''burns'' caused by heat from the ultrasonic probe. This risk is minimized when performed by a surgeon skilled in lipoplasty. Some patients may have an adverse reaction to the anesthetic, and may develop redness or other pigment changes. ' "
How Much Does Ultrasonic-Assisted Lipoplasty Cost?,"'Ask to talk with a representative who can explain the costs of the procedure and payment options. Like other elective cosmetic procedures, UAL is not covered by health insurance plans. ''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic, Department of Plastic Surgery.''Edited by  Charlotte E. Grayson , MD, Sept. 2003. ''''Portions of this page ©  ''The Cleveland Clinic''  2000-2003' "
LDL and HDL: What are triglycerides?,"'Triglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.''The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with ''cholesterol'' to form chylomicrons. This is the source of energy for cells in the body. Fat cells and ''liver'' cells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.''Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease''. Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty ''liver disease'' and pancreatitis.''Certain diseases and conditions may cause elevated triglyceride blood levels, for example:''Alcohol'' consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase ''HDL'' (the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of ''heart disease''. ''However, it is not recommended that people start to drink alcohol to obtain these effects.' Poorly-controlled diabetes Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver or other liver diseases Hypothyroidism Some medications (for example, beta blockers, diuretics, birth control pills)"
How are triglyceride levels measured?,"'Triglyceride levels in the blood are measured by a simple blood test. Often, triglycerides are measured as part of a lipoprotein panel (''lipid'' panel) in which triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) are measured at the same time.''Fasting for 8-12 hours before the test is required. Fat levels in the blood are affected by recent eating and ''digestion''. Falsely elevated results may occur if the blood test is done just after eating.' "
What are normal triglyceride levels? What do elevated triglyceride levels mean?,'Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and ''cholesterol levels'' are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk.' Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. Extremely high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
What causes low triglyceride levels?,"'Returning triglyceride levels to normal may decrease the risk of ''heart'' attack, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease. Controlling high triglycerides and ''high cholesterol'' is a lifelong challenge. A healthy lifestyle includes eating well, exercising routinely, ''smoking cessation'', and ''weight loss''. This may be all that is needed, but some people additionally require medications to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Your health-care professional will help make decisions with you to decide what treatment combination is most appropriate.' "
Changes in diet to lower triglycerides,"'The following dietary changes may be helpful in lowering triglycerides.''Switch to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of trans or saturated fats. The best sources of these fats are olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, lake trout, sardines, herring, and albacore tuna. Learning to interpret food labels will help you understand the kinds of fat in the food you buy and consume.'   Decreasing your intake of sugar: If you have a sweet tooth, try to set limits on how often and how much sugar you consume. You can cut your intake in half to begin with, and continue cutting back from there. Remember to read the labels to check for sugar content in both food and beverages. Changing from white to brown: If you eat white rice, bread, and pasta, switch to whole wheat products. It may take a little while to get used to the difference in taste, but it's worth the effort for the benefits to your health. A variety of whole-wheat products are available so experiment until you find the one that you like best. Switching fats: Limit or avoid foods with saturated and trans fats. These include fried foods, lard, butter, whole milk, ice cream, commercial baked goods, meats, and cheese. Read the nutrition labels to determine whether these unhealthy fats are present."
What is a liposarcoma?,"'Liposarcoma is a ''malignant'' tumor that arises from mesenchymal cells (specifically, abnormal fat cells in deep soft tissue that multiply in an unregulated manner), mainly affecting middle-age people at sites such as the thigh, gluteal region, retroperitoneum, and leg and shoulder area. Occasionally, the liposarcoma can become very large. For example, the news media has described a 30-pound liposarcoma removed from the abdomen of a 63-year-old man. Liposarcomas are one type of soft tissue sarcomas.' "
What are the causes of liposarcoma?,"'Liposarcoma ''cancer'' cells are similar to fat cells but are thought to develop from deeper fat tissues instead of superficial fat cells beneath the skin or mucous membranes. Although liposarcomas may develop almost anywhere in the body, most develop in the abdomen and limbs. Liposarcomas are rare. They represent less than 1% of all newly diagnosed ''cancers''. Although it is not known what triggers the development of liposarcomas, they are usually noted after ''trauma'' when a ""hard lump"" develops and remains but ''trauma'' or injury is not a risk factor.' "
What are liposarcoma risk factors?,"'Risk factors for liposarcomas may include radiation, certain family ''cancer'' syndromes (for example, ''neurofibromatosis'', Gardner syndrome), a damaged lymph system, and/or exposure to certain chemicals (for example, vinyl chloride, dioxin).' "
Liposarcoma vs. lipoma,"'Liposarcomas do not develop from common lipomas, which are benign tumors of fat cells.' "
What are liposarcoma symptoms and signs?,"'Many liposarcoma patients do not feel sick initially so the patients seek help only late in the disease process when other symptoms arise. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and the extent to which it has spread in the body. Symptoms and signs that may occur later in the disease can include' painful swelling and/or a growing lump under the skin; numbness; enlargement of varicose veins; fatigue and/or weakness, especially of the affected limb; abdominal pain, although some patients have no pain, others can experience constipation, feeling of fullness sooner when eating, and/or blood in the stool (these symptoms are more likely to develop in patients with liposarcoma the forms in the abdomen); chest pain; urinary difficulty and/or pain; difficulty swallowing; nausea; vomiting; and decreased range of motion in the limbs."
How do health care professionals diagnose a liposarcoma?,"'Many patients with liposarcoma will complain of a mass that they can feel. The mass can be soft and fleshy or even firm to palpation. Some doctors may initially try ''ultrasound'', but the diagnosis usually requires standard ''X-rays'' that will help show whether or not any bony elements are involved. However, an ''MRI'' is usually obtained and may help suggest a diagnosis that must be confirmed by a biopsy. For many individuals, a chest CT is done because the chest is the most common site of ''metastasis'' (spread) of liposarcomas.' "
What are the various types of liposarcoma?,"'There are five subtypes of liposarcoma now recognized by WHO (World Health Organization):' The most common type is termed well-differentiated liposarcoma (about 50% of sarcomas). The next type is termed myxoid (resembling mucus). Round cell liposarcoma is an intermediate grade of fat-cell cancers that includes round-cell variants and is the most common type of liposarcoma in children and teens. A rare type is termed pleomorphic (meaning the cancer cells look different in size and shape) liposarcoma and makes up only about 5%-10% of liposarcomas. This type can be very aggressive. The last type is termed combined, mixed-type, or dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which is a high-grade sarcoma with an increased risk of metastasis."
What are the stages of liposarcoma?,"'Once the tumor has been typed, it is usually staged to determine the extent of spread of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. The stages range from I to IV, with IV representing the most extensive ''cancer'' with metastatic spread.' "
What are liposarcoma treatment options?,"'The treatment of liposarcoma is mainly surgical, with the goal to remove the tumor entirely and prevent its recurrence (achieving a cure) by removing all of the tumor cells. In the past, amputation was the surgical option for these tumors in the limbs. Currently, tumors that occur in limbs only require about 5% of patients to undergo amputation. Tumor removal by surgery in other areas of the body is the treatment of choice for liposarcomas. However, many patients are treated by a combination of surgery and ''radiation therapy''. In fact, some patients are given ''radiation therapy'' before surgery to shrink the tumor.''Chemotherapy'' in the treatment of liposarcoma is controversial, and experts in the field consider the question of chemotherapy for liposarcoma to be best addressed on a case-by-case basis. Some investigators consider chemotherapy of liposarcomas to be experimental. Because liposarcomas are relatively rare, your doctor should be a specialist with experience treating sarcomas.''Chemotherapy has been done (for example, using anthracycline ''drugs'') without great success. For unresectable (cannot be treated by surgery) or metastatic liposarcomas, trabectedin (Yondelis) and ''eribulin mesylate'' (''Halaven'') have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat the disease in patients who had received a prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen, as both these ''drugs'' showed an improvement in progression-free survival as compared to other drugs.' "
What is the prognosis of liposarcoma? What is the survival rate for people with liposarcoma?,"'The prognosis of liposarcomas varies with the type and location of the tumors. Extremity tumors that are appropriately treated have a good prognosis as do the well-differentiated types and myxoid type tumors. However, round-cell and poorly differentiated cell types have a poor prognosis with a survival rate of about 50% over five years.''As stated previously, if any mass or lump is noticed near or at a site of trauma, or if you develop any of the late symptoms of a liposarcoma described above, you should contact your doctor immediately. Many conditions other than ''malignant'' tumors can cause a mass or lump, and it is important to find out the cause so that appropriate treatment can be given.' "
Is it possible to prevent a liposarcoma?,"'Most liposarcomas develop in people with no known risk factors. Consequently, there is no way to prevent liposarcomas other than to avoid exposure to their risk factors listed above.' "
Introduction to Liposuction,"""Liposuction is a cosmetic procedure that removes fat that you can't seem to get rid of through ""'diet'' and ''exercise''.''A ''plastic'' or dermatologic surgeon usually does the procedure on your hips, belly, thighs, buttocks, back, arms, or face to improve their shape.

Are the Results Permanent?,"'The fat cells are removed permanently during liposuction. But you can gain weight back, with new fat cells, which usually go to different areas of your body.''To keep your new shape after surgery, follow a diet that includes lots of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy.

What is listeriosis? What causes listeriosis?,"'Listeriosis is an infection caused by a rod-shaped gram stain-positive motile bacterium named ''Listeria monocytogenes''. The foodborne illness produces ''fever'', muscle aches, and, in many people, ''diarrhea''. Severe infections can cause ''headaches'', ''meningitis'', convulsions, and death. Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria have minor or no symptoms, but a few people, especially the elderly, pregnant females and their fetus, newborns, and anyone with a compromised immune system are especially susceptible to these organisms. ''Listeria'' bacteria are widespread throughout the world and are often associated with farm animals that may show no signs of infection. Research shows that many animals are uninfected carriers, and they suggest that some humans carry these organisms as part of their bowel flora. Except for pregnant women, fetuses, or newborns, there is no direct transfer of ''Listeria'' from human to human.''The organisms (''Listeria monocytogenes'') that cause listeriosis have probably been infecting humans for centuries. ''Listeria'' was first isolated from an infected WWI soldier in 1918 and had many different names until 1940, when the genus and species names were firmly established. However, people first recognized the bacteria as a food-borne (''food poisoning'') pathogen in 1979. The bacteria can penetrate human cells and can multiply inside them. People with altered or impaired immune systems have cells that are less able to control the spread of these organisms into the blood or into other cells. In 2010, health researchers discovered that a known species, ''Listeria ivanovii'', thought only to infect cattle, also infects humans -- so there are two ''Listeria'' species that can infect humans.''Outbreaks of listeriosis can occur with some frequency. For example, in 2017, soft raw milk cheese was a source of an outbreak (Vulto Creamery). In this outbreak, eight people were infected and two died. Other recalls of products in 2017 include 3 tons of cheese for possible ''Listeria'"" contamination (La Nica Products INC.), macadamia nuts (Simple Truth brand), Ava's Organic Cashews, and Queso Fresco cheese, for the same problem. In 2018, at least nine people have died from ""'Listeria''-contaminated frozen sweet corn. British authorities have recalled 43 products with possible ''Listeria'' contamination to halt this significant outbreak.'

  "
What are the risk factors for listeriosis?,"'The major risk factor for getting listeriosis is eating or drinking foods and liquids contaminated with ''Listeria'' bacteria. Foods and liquids contaminated with animal feces or soil are the most frequently identified sources for these organisms. Drinking inadequately treated or unpasteurized liquids, especially milk products, is another source of infection.''Some individuals have an increased risk for getting listeriosis. In general, people with an altered or damaged immune system have a higher risk of getting listeriosis and its more severe complications. Specifically, people at much higher risk include pregnant females, newborns, the elderly, diabetics, ''cancer'' patients, ''AIDS'' patients, patients with kidney diseases, ''alcoholics'', and those patients undergoing any immune-suppression therapy. Most individuals who get severe infections and/or die from listeriosis have one or more of the medical problems listed above.' "
Is Listeria contagious?,'The bacteria are not contagious from person to person in most instances. The one exception is that a pregnant woman can transfer the bacteria to the fetus or the newborn.' 
"How 
does listeriosis spread?","'Listeriosis is mainly a food-borne disease; except in the situation in which a pregnant woman can transfer the bacteria to the fetus or newborn, the disease is not contagious from person to person.''Foods that have been associated with ''Listeria'' outbreaks are many (for example, soft cheeses, yogurt, apples, smoked seafood, deli meats, hot dogs, fruits, and vegetables). There have been many outbreaks of the disease over the world. The year 2015 had at least three outbreaks of listeriosis. Bidart Brothers of Bakersfield, Calif., produced apples contaminated with the bacteria. People first noticed the organisms in caramel-coated apples. Hummus produced by the Sabra Dipping Company was recalled (30,000 cases of hummus) due to ''Listeria'' contamination. Also in 2015, the very popular brand of ice cream, Blue Bell, caused a serious outbreak of listeriosis. The company shut down its facilities in Alabama, Oklahoma, and Texas to rid them of ''Listeria''. During the outbreak, health care professionals hospitalized 10 individuals and three people died. In 2016, CRF Frozen Foods of Pasco, Washington, recalled 11 frozen vegetable products because of ''Listeria'' contamination. Health care providers admitted nine people to the hospital and three died during this outbreak to date. Unfortunately, this outbreak is complicated by the fact that some of the vegetable products in the recall date back as far as 2014. Individuals who have stored frozen CRF products that date back as far as 2014 need to get rid of the potentially contaminated frozen products, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).' "
What are listeriosis symptoms and signs?,"'However, in some people, the organisms can spread to the brain.' 

Read Doctor's View
   Fever, muscle aches, and occasionally, gastroenteritis (nausea and/or diarrhea) are the usual symptoms associated with listeriosis. Some individuals may also experience fatigue and a decrease or loss of appetite. These flu-like symptoms usually last up to one week and may spontaneously resolve. The symptoms of meningitis and/or encephalitis (stiff neck, headache, and fever) may appear, including altered mental status (confusion and reduced mental activity), Loss of balance problems and seizures (convulsions) may develop in brain infections. Brain abscesses may also occur and cause similar symptoms."
What is the incubation period for Listeria?,"'Pregnant women who are otherwise healthy usually have only minor symptoms. However, ''Listeria'' infection during pregnancy often cause problems for the fetus:''Breastfeeding'' in humans does not transmit the bacteria to newborns; however, animal studies show the organisms are transferred in ''breast milk'' of other mammalian species. Researchers consider it theoretically possible for organism transmission in human breast milk.''Occasionally, localized skin infections may occur, especially in people who handle animals infected with ''Listeria''. These skin infections rarely lead to further complications such as brain infection.' miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or cause infection and, potentially, death of newborns."
How long does a Listeria infection last?,"'Normal healthy people infected with ''Listeria'' usually recover from the infection. However, more serious infections that require antibiotic treatment may last longer. For example, if abscesses develop in the brain, the antibiotic therapy will be required for about six weeks.' "
What types of doctors treat listeriosis?,"'Although primary care physicians can treat listeriosis, other specialists may be involved, especially if the illness is serious. Other specialists such as infectious disease, critical care, and ob-gyn physicians, especially if a woman is pregnant, are likely to be consulted. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians who are treating the cause of the immunosuppression should also be consulted.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose listeriosis?,"""Physicians base their preliminary diagnosis on the patient's clinical history and physical exam, especially after the patient gives a history of likely exposure to a contaminated food source during a ""'Listeria'' outbreak. Without this information, the diagnosis is difficult to sort out from many other diseases; this situation may result in a delay of treatment as the physician may do other tests to rule out other diseases such as salmonellosis, ''shigellosis'', ''botulism'' and ''E. coli'' infections. Definitive diagnosis of listeriosis is by culturing ''Listeria monocytogenes'"" bacteria from the patient's blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or ""'amniotic fluid'', usually on a medium that is selective for ''Listeria'"" (for example, RAPID'L mono agar). Currently, no reliable tests are available to detect the bacteria in the ""'stool''; also, there are no reliable serological tests available (blood tests that can identify specific proteins associated with the bacteria or antibodies to the bacteria) according to the CDC.' "
What is the treatment for listeriosis?,"'The majority of people with ''Listeria'' infections spontaneously clear the infection in about seven days. However, those patients at increased risk, especially pregnant women, usually require immediate IV antibiotic treatment to prevent, halt, or slow the development of more severe disease. For example, early effective antibiotic treatment of pregnant females may be lifesaving for the fetus.''In general, the length of antibiotic treatment increases with the severity of the infection. The treatment for meningitis lasts three weeks while brain ''abscess'' treatment lasts six weeks. The initial choice of antibiotics is usually IV ''ampicillin''. Doctors have used ''Bactrim'' (''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole''seizures'

  "
Are there home remedies for listeriosis?,"'There are no ''over-the-counter'' diagnostic tests for listeriosis, so it will be difficult or impossible to know if you have a ''Listeria'' infection; that makes it difficult to decide if you can treat the problem at home. Because listeriosis can be fatal in about 20%-30% of those who develop the disease, home remedies may be a dangerous option without consulting a physician. However, there are suggestions to try, like activated charcoal, syrup of ipecac, ''garlic'', and/or alcohol-free ''goldenseal'' to treat ''food poisoning'' in general. However, before trying any of these options, you should discuss them first with your doctor.' "
How does a person get listeriosis?,"'The majority of people who get listeriosis have consumed ''Listeria''-contaminated foods. Because the bacteria exist in both soil and water, cultivated foods like vegetables can easily become contaminated, especially from fertilizer or animal waste. ''Listeria'' has been found in many types of raw food (even seafood) but especially in meats, vegetables, and cheeses. It has even been found in processed foods because of contamination during or after processing. After someone ingests the contaminated food or fluid, it may take up to three weeks for the organisms to cause symptoms.''The fetus may become infected after the mother ingests the organisms; the bacteria apparently reach the fetus via the bloodstream. Newborn infants can acquire the bacteria during a cesarean procedure or be exposed to them while traversing the vagina.' "
What are the complications of listeriosis?,"'The major complications of listeriosis include' blood infection (septicemia/bacteremia), meningitis and/or encephalitis, brain abscesses, seizures, miscarriage, premature birth, neonatal sepsis (potentially fatal), stillbirth, and death."
Is it possible to prevent listeriosis?,"""Yes, it's possible to prevent listeriosis. The CDC recommends the following ""'food safety'' measures:''General recommendations:''Here are food safety recommendations for people at high risk, such as pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, in addition to the recommendations listed above:''There is no commercially available ''vaccine'' to protect against infection by ''Listeria''.' Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork, or poultry. Wash raw vegetables thoroughly (scrub with a clean produce brush in uncontaminated running water) before eating. Keep uncooked meats separate from vegetables and from cooked foods and ready-to-eat foods. Avoid unpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk. Wash hands, knives, and cutting boards after handling uncooked foods. Consume perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as possible. Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, or deli meats, unless heated until steaming hot. Avoid getting fluid from hot-dog packages on other foods, utensils, and food preparation surfaces, and wash hands after handling hot dogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats. Do not eat refrigerated pâtés or meat spreads. It's OK to eat canned or shelf-stable pâtés and meat spreads. Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is contained in a cooked dish, such as a casserole. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod, tuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as ""nova-style,"" ""lox,"" ""kippered,"" ""smoked,"" or ""jerky."" The fish is found in the refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and delicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten. Avoid cross-contaminating other foods, utensils, and food-preparation surfaces with fluid from hot-dog packages, and wash hands after handling hot dogs. Do not eat soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, and Camembert, blue-veined cheeses, or Mexican-style cheeses such as queso blanco, queso fresco, and Panela, unless they have labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk. Cheeses that are OK to eat include hard cheeses, semi-soft cheeses such as mozzarella, pasteurized processed cheeses such as slices and spreads, cream cheese, and cottage cheese. Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain unpasteurized milk."
What is the prognosis for Listeria infections?,"'Since most infections go unnoticed or only produce minor symptoms, the prognosis is excellent. However, the prognosis for people with altered or impaired immune systems range from good (with early appropriate therapy) to poor, depending on how debilitated the patient is when first infected.''The pregnant woman usually has a good prognosis. However, her fetus or newborn has a good to guarded prognosis, again depending how quickly the mother or newborn is effectively treated.' "
"If a person has eaten recalled food potentially contaminated with 
Listeria, what should he or she do?","""The CDC recommends the following to all people. If the person has no symptoms, they recommend no tests or treatment be done. However, if the person is in a high-risk group (see risk factor section above), they recommend contacting the person's physician only if the person develops fever or signs of serious illness within two months of eating the food. The CDC makes these conservative suggestions because the chance of developing ""'Listeria'' infection, even after ingestion of a contaminated product, is very small.''However, people in the high-risk groups should have no delays in contacting their doctor if they suspect symptoms of listeriosis are developing.'  "
What is the government doing about listeriosis?,"'The following is information modified from the CDC web site in response to the above question.''Government agencies and the food industry have taken steps to reduce contamination of food by the ''Listeria'' bacterium. The Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture monitor food regularly. When health officials discover contaminated processed food, food monitoring and plant inspection are intensified, and if necessary, the implicated food is recalled.''The Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID) is studying listeriosis in several states to help measure the impact of prevention activities and recognize trends in disease occurrence. CCID also assists local health departments in investigating outbreaks. Early detection and reporting of outbreaks of listeriosis to local and state health departments can help identify sources of infection and prevent more cases of the disease.''In addition, the FDA publishes its list of product recalls on the Internet with frequent updates. The following web site will allow individuals to check on specific products and describe how to identify them: ''http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/''.' "
What is the liver? What is its function?,"'The liver has multiple functions. It makes many of the chemicals required by the body to function normally, it breaks down and detoxifies substances in the body, and it also acts as a storage unit.''Hepatocytes (hepar=liver + cyte=cell) are responsible for making many of the proteins (protein synthesis) in the body that are required for many functions, including blood clotting factors, and albumin, required to maintain fluid within the circulation system. The liver is also responsible for manufacturing cholesterol and ''triglycerides''. Carbohydrates are also produced in the liver and the organ is responsible for turning glucose into glycogen that can be stored both in the liver and in the muscle cells. The liver also makes bile that helps with food ''digestion''.''The liver plays an important role in detoxifying the body by converting ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism in the body, into urea that is excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The liver also breaks down medications and drugs, including alcohol, and is responsible for breaking down ''insulin'' and other hormones in the body.''The liver is also stores ''vitamins'' and chemicals that the body requires as building blocks. These includes:''The liver is one of the vital organs of the body, responsible for hundreds of chemical actions that the body needs to survive. It is also a gland because it secretes chemicals that are used by other parts of the body. For these reasons the liver is both an organ and a gland; in fact, it is the largest internal organ in the body.' vitamin B12, folic acid, iron required to make red blood cells, vitamin A for vision, vitamin D for calcium absorption, and vitamin K to help the blood to clot properly."
What are the symptoms and signs of liver disease?,"'The liver is a large organ and a significant amount of liver tissue needs to be damaged before a person experiences symptoms of disease. Symptoms also may depend upon the type of liver disease.'   The inflammation of hepatitis may be associated with pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, nausea and vomiting. This may also be seen in people with gallstones. People may have jaundice (have a yellow-orange hue to their skin) because the liver cannot metabolize bilirubin (the normal breakdown product of old red blood cells). There may be a tendency to bleed excessively or bruise easily because the liver is unable to manufacture blood clotting factors in adequate amounts. Fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and shortness of breath because of muscle wasting; due to the inability of the liver to manufacture proteins. Because the liver is involved in the metabolism of sex hormones, gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue in men) and impotence may occur. In end-stage liver disease, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and leg swelling may occur because of inadequate production of albumin by the liver. There also may be difficulty in metabolizing ammonia causing its levels in the blood to rise, resulting in confusion due to encephalopathy (encephala=brain + pathy=dysfunction)."
What does the liver look like? Where is it located in the body?,"'The liver is divided into two lobes and has a rich blood supply obtained from two sources:\xa0''The biliary tree describes a system of tubes that collect bile, used to help digest food, and drains it into the gallbladder or the intestine. Intrahepatic ducts are located inside the liver (intra=inside + hepar=liver) while extrahepatic ducts are located outside the liver.' the portal vein delivers blood from the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestine, colon) and spleen, and the hepatic artery supplies blood from the heart."
"Liver disease causes (fatty liver, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and infections)","'Many diseases may affect the liver directly or as a consequence of an illness or disease that begins in another organ.''Hepatitis is an infection of the liver that causes liver inflammation.''Infections may affect the liver, including:'   Fatty liver disease, caused by accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides within the liver is not associated with alcohol abuse. Fatty liver disease is also referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Cirrhosis of the liver describes a condition of scarring in the liver that is not reversible and may lead to liver failure. Alcohol abuse causes cirrhosis of the liver and is the most common cause of liver disease in North America. Hepatitis A is often spread by poor sanitary habits including poor handwashing and may be transmitted by food handlers. It tends to be self-limited. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are spread by contact with infected body fluids. Hepatitis D is spread in conjunction with hepatitis B and needs the B virus for it to survive in the body and cause liver damage. Hepatitis E is a food or water borne infection. There are vaccinations available to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Epstein Barr virus that causes infectious mononucleosis Adenovirus Cytomegalovirus Toxoplasmosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever"
"Liver disease causes (medications, toxins, genetics, cancer, and others)","'Liver inflammation is a relatively common side effect of medications. Some commonly prescribed medications include the following:''Genetic disorders can affect the liver, examples include the following:''Abnormalities of bile flow from the liver may lead to liver inflammation, for example:''Decrease in blood flow draining out of the liver may cause the liver to become congested and inflamed, two examples include:'   acetaminophen over the counter (Tylenol, Panadol) but also in prescription pain medications (hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Lortab, Vicodin, Norco) Statins (medications used to control elevated blood cholesterol levels) Antibiotics (amoxiciilin-clavulinic acid [Augmentin, Augmentin XR], nitrofurantoin [Macrodantin, Furadantin, Macrobid], tetracycline, isoniazid) methotrexate (Trexall, Rheumatrex) disulfiram (Antabusel) Herbal remedies, for example, kava kava, mahuang, comfrey Poisonous mushrooms may damage the liver and cause liver failure. Alcohol in large doses can be toxic for the liver and damages the liver over time. Aflatoxins produced by certain fungi are toxic to the liver Industrial chemicals may be toxins that affect the liver, such as arsenic and carbon tetrachloride Hemochromatosis with abnormal iron storage Wilson's Disease with abnormal copper storage Gilbert's Disease with abnormal bilirubin metabolism Primary liver cancers arise directly from cells within the liver. Metastatic liver disease describes cancer that arises from another organ and invades the liver Gallstones (the most common disease) Primary biliary cirrhosis Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a condition in which the heart is not strong enough to pump all of the blood it receives, and that blood can back up into the liver. Budd Chiari syndrome is a disease in which blood clots form in the hepatic veins, preventing blood from leaving the liver."
What are liver function blood tests?,"'The liver is located in the abdomen but the health care professional will want to examine the whole body to look for the consequences of liver disease.' The abdomen may be palpated to feel for an enlarged liver. As it grows, the liver edge may be felt below the right rib margin. An inflamed liver in acute hepatitis may be tender but a liver that is cirrhotic, small and shrunken, may not be able to be felt. If liver disease is a consideration, the health care professional also may feel for an enlarged spleen and assess whether excess fluid is present in the abdomen (ascites), perhaps indicating the presence of portal hypertension. The skin, including the sclera of the eyes, may be assessed for color looking for jaundice. Spider nevi, or angiomata, are a collection of blood vessels under the skin and may be normal, but in the proper setting may indicate liver disease. If the person is confused (hepatic encephalopathy), the doctor may attempt to illicit asterixis, or flap on the physical examination. These people may not be able to keep their wrists cocked when their arms are held outstretched but instead see their wrists rhythmically flapping. Blood tests may be ordered to help make the diagnosis. Liver enzymes levels may reveal liver inflammation. However, in patients with end-stage liver disease, the liver can burn itself out and the enzymes may be normal even in the face of severe disease. Other blood tests that may be appropriate include a complete blood cell count (CBC), hepatitis virus screen, and blood clotting tests (a sensitive way to measure function since the liver is responsible for manufacturing the proteins involved in the blood clotting mechanism). On occasion, ultrasound may be helpful in assessing the anatomy of the liver and this may lead to other tests including CT scan to further assess the anatomy and structure of the liver and surrounding tissues."
What is a liver biopsy? Is it painful?,"'Most often, diseases of the liver can be diagnosed by history, physical examination, and blood tests. On occasion, should the diagnosis be unclear or to assess the degree of damage to the liver, a ''liver biopsy'' may be necessary.''Using a very thin needle, a ''gastroenterologist'' or hepatologist (two types of liver specialists) or an interventional radiologist will insert a very fine needle through the skin and into the liver, to retrieve a small bit of tissue. This can then be examined under the microscope by a pathologist to help make the diagnosis. This procedure is done under sterile conditions to prevent infection, and a local anesthetic is injected into the skin to decrease the potential for pain.''If there is concern about only one area of the liver, instead of a disease that would affect the whole organ, an ultrasound may be used to help guide the needle into the proper position.'  "
Can liver disease be prevented?," Moderate alcohol consumption to decrease the risk of the most common cause of liver disease in North America. The risk of contracting hepatitis B and hepatitis C can be decreased by minimizing exposure to body fluids. As mentioned previously, vaccinations are available for hepatitis A and B. Maintain a healthy weight and eat a balanced diet to decrease the risk of developing fatty liver disease."
Which types of doctors treat liver disease?," Diseases of the liver may be treated by primary care or internal medicine specialists. Gastroenterologists are specialists that focus on the digestive organs and liver. A hepatologist is a specialist focused exclusively on the liver. Depending upon the exact type of liver disease, other specialists may be involved in the care of patients with liver disease, including infectious disease specialists, surgeons, oncologists, critical care specialists, hematologists, and emergency medicine specialists."
What is a Liver Biopsy?,"'A ''liver'' biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This is performed as an office or outpatient procedure or during surgery. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of:' Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes). Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice). A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan. Unexplained enlargement of the liver."
Is Liver Biopsy Safe?,"'In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely ''internal bleeding'' may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder.' "
How Do I Prepare for a Liver Biopsy?,"'When preparing for a liver biopsy, there are several things to keep in mind.''Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor.' Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin, Plavix, or Persantine. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor."
What Happens on the Day of a Liver Biopsy?,"'Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a ''platelet count'"", and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot.""'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications and answer any questions you may have. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor cleans and numbs an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor then makes a small incision on your upper abdomen and inserts a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. The procedure takes about 5 minutes. You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may takeacetaminophen (Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity for at least 24 hours after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure."
What other methods of liver biopsy are available?,"'Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous.''During a laparoscopic biopsy'', a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the physician watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver.'' A transvenous biopsy'' may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample.' "
Warning About Liver Biopsy,"'If you have a ''fever''; difficulty ''breathing''; ''chills''; ''dizziness''; or tenderness or severe pain at the site of a liver biopsy or in the chest, shoulder, or abdomen within 72 hours after the procedure, please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.' "
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "

"Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent 
cancer.","'Avoiding ''cancer risk factors'' may help prevent certain ''cancers''. Risk factors include ''smoking'', being ''overweight'', and not getting enough ''exercise''. Increasing protective factors such as quitting ''smoking'' and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. ' "
The following risk factors may increase the risk of liver cancer:,"'Having chronic ''hepatitis B'' or chronic ''hepatitis C'' increases the risk of developing liver cancer. The risk is even greater for people with both ''hepatitis'' B and C. Also, the longer the ''hepatitis'' infection lasts (especially hepatitis C), the greater the risk. ''In a study of patients with chronic ''hepatitis C'', those who were treated to lower their iron levels by having blood drawn and eating a low-iron ''diet'' were less likely to develop liver cancer than those who did not have this treatment.''The risk of developing liver cancer is increased for people who have ''cirrhosis'', a disease in which healthy liver tissue is replaced by ''scar tissue''. The ''scar'' tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and keeps it from working as it should. Chronic ''alcoholism'' and chronic ''hepatitis C'' are the most common causes of cirrhosis. ''The risk of developing liver cancer may be increased by eating foods that contain aflatoxin (poison from a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts, that have not been stored properly). ' "
The following protective factor may decrease the risk of liver cancer:,'Preventing ''hepatitis B'' infection (by being vaccinated for hepatitis B) has been shown to lower the risk of liver cancer in children. It is not yet known if it lowers the risk in adults. ' 
Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.,"'Cancer ''prevention'' clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. ''The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting ''smoking'', or taking certain medicines, ''vitamins'', ''minerals'', or food ''supplements''. ' "
New ways to prevent liver cancer are being studied in clinical trials.,'Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the ''Clinical Trials'' section of the NCI website.' 
Where is the liver located?,"'The liver is the largest organ inside the body and is located under the right ribs and beneath the right lung. The liver has several functions. It secretes bile into the ''intestines'' to absorb ''fats'', breaks down and stores nutrients, manufactures clotting factors needed to stop bleeding, and breaks down toxic agents, like ''alcohol'' and ''drugs''. Once the toxic agents are broken down, they can be eliminated from the body through urine or ''stool''. One of the causes of ''cirrhosis'', the scarring of the liver, is ''alcoholism''. A person cannot live without a liver, so liver shut down or liver failure is fatal.''Hepatitis'' is an inflammation of the liver, which can progress to scarring (fibrosis) or liver cancer. ''Hepatitis'' can be caused by toxic substances, infection, or autoimmune diseases. Common ''viruses'"" that cause hepatitis are referred to as types A, B, C, D, and E. It's possible to prevent hepatitis with a ""'vaccine'' available for types A, B, and E.' "
What is liver cancer?,"'Primary liver cancer is a condition or disease that happens when normal cells in the liver become abnormal in appearance and behavior. The cancer cells can then become destructive to adjacent normal tissues, and can spread both to other areas of the liver and to organs outside the liver. Liver cancer is also called hepatic cancer.''Malignant'' or cancerous cells that develop in the normal cells of the liver (hepatocytes) are called hepatocellular ''carcinoma''. A cancer that arises in the ducts of the liver is called ''cholangiocarcinoma''.'  "
What is metastatic liver cancer?,"'Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the place where it first started (the primary site) to another place in the body (secondary site). Metastatic cancer in the liver is a condition in which cancer from other organs has spread through the bloodstream to the liver. Here the liver cells are not what has become cancerous. The liver has become the site to which the cancer that started elsewhere has spread. Metastatic cancer has the same name and same type of cancer cells as the original cancer. The most common ''cancers'' that spread to the liver are breast, colon, bladder, kidney, ovary, pancreas, stomach, uterus, and ''lungs''.''Metastatic liver cancer is a rare condition that occurs when cancer originates in the liver (primary) and spreads to other organs (secondary) in the body.''Some people with metastatic tumors do not have symptoms. Their metastases are found by ''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', ultrasounds, or other tests. Enlargement of the liver or ''jaundice'' (yellowing of the skin) can indicate cancer has spread to the liver.' "
What causes liver cancer?,"'Most people who get liver cancer get it in the setting of chronic ''liver disease'' (long-term liver damage called ''cirrhosis''), which ''scars'' the liver and increases the risk for liver cancer. Conditions that cause cirrhosis are alcohol use/abuse, ''hepatitis B'', and ''hepatitis C''.''The causes of liver cancer may be linked to environmental, dietary, or lifestyle factors. For example, in November 2014, researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that long-term exposure to triclosan, a common ingredient in soaps and detergents, causes liver fibrosis and cancer in laboratory mice. Although triclosan has not been proven to cause human liver cancer, it is currently under scrutiny by the FDA to determine whether it has negative health impacts.'  "
What are the risk factors for liver cancer? Is liver cancer hereditary?,"'Incidence rates of hepatocellular cancer are rising in the United States due to increasing prevalence of cirrhosis caused by chronic ''hepatitis C'' and steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic ''fatty liver'' disease).''Cirrhosis of the liver due to any cause is a risk factor for liver cancer. The risk factors for liver cancer in cirrhosis are being male, age 55 years or older, Asian or Hispanic ethnicity, family history in a first-degree relative, ''obesity'', ''hepatitis B'' and C, alcohol use, and elevated iron content in the blood due to ''hemochromatosis''.''Chronic ''hepatitis B'' infection even without cirrhosis is a risk factor for liver cancer.' "
What are liver cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Liver ''cancer causes'' no symptoms of its own. As the ''tumor'' grows, it may cause symptoms of ''pain'' in the right side of the abdomen or feeling overly full after eating a little. Some patients may have worsening of symptoms of chronic ''liver disease'' or cirrhosis, which often precedes the development of cancer of the liver. For example, patients may complain of'   unexplained weight loss, wasting (cachexia), decreased appetite, nausea or vomiting, feeling of an enlarged liver (feeling a mass under the ribs on the right side), enlarged spleen (feeling a mass under the ribs on the left side), pain in the abdomen or near the right shoulder blade, increased swelling of the feet and belly, fluid build-up in the belly, itching, swollen legs, and yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)."
How do health care professionals diagnose liver cancer?,"'The best way to detect liver cancer is through surveillance ''ultrasound'' of the liver done by an oncologist every 6 months in a patient with a diagnosis of cirrhosis. As with most forms of cancer, it is best to treat the liver cancer as soon as it is detected.''Once a suspicion of liver cancer arises, a physician will order one the following to confirm a diagnosis:' 

Read Doctor's View
   Blood tests: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which may be elevated in 70% of patients with liver cancer. AFP levels could be normal in liver cancer. A rising level of AFP is suspicious for liver cancer. The AFP may be elevated with cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis. Other labs tests include des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin, which can be elevated in most patients with liver cancer. Imaging studies: Multiphasic helical CT scan and MRI with contrast of the liver are the preferred imaging for detecting the location and extent of blood supply to the cancer. If any imaging study is inconclusive, then an alternative imaging study or follow-up imaging study should be performed to help clarify the diagnosis. Lesions smaller than 1 cm are usually difficult to characterize. Liver biopsy is performed to sample tissue from the lesion in the liver, which is analyzed by a pathologist to confirm the suspected diagnosis of liver cancer. Liver biopsy is not needed in every case, especially if the imaging study and lab markers are characteristic for liver cancer. Risks of liver biopsy are infection, bleeding, or seeding of the needle track with cancer. Seeding is when cancer cells get on the needle used for a biopsy and spread to other areas touched by the needle. Liver biopsy of suspected liver cancer carries the added risk of seeding the liver biopsy needle track in 1%-3% of cases. If a liver biopsy is inconclusive, then a repeat imaging study is recommended at 3- to 6-month intervals."
How do medical professionals stage liver cancer?,"'According to the American Cancer Society, ""The stage of cancer is a description of how widespread it is. The stage of a liver cancer is one of the most important factors in considering treatment options. A staging system is a standard way for the ''cancer care'' team to sum up information about how far a cancer has spread. Doctors use staging systems to get an idea about a patient\'s prognosis (outlook) and to help determine the most appropriate treatment. There are several staging systems for liver cancer, and not all doctors use the same system.""''Liver biopsy as well as imaging studies help in classifying liver cancer stages as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system, the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) system, or the Okuda system.' "
What are the types of liver cancer and liver tumors?,"'Benign liver tumors: This type of ''tumor'' can become large enough to cause problems but will not spread to other areas of the body. The treatment is usually surgery.''Hemangioma'': A ''hemangioma'' is a blood vessel tumor that only requires treatment if it bleeds.''Hepatic adenoma: This is a type of benign liver tumor, which may cause ''abdominal pain'' or blood loss. Surgical removal is usually recommended.''Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH): This tumor is made up of several different types of cells (liver, bile duct, and connective tissue cells).''Liver angiosarcoma (or hepatic angiosarcoma) and hemangiosarcoma are rare. This is a cancer of the inner lining of the blood vessels. Since the symptoms of liver angiosarcoma are nonspecific, usually this type of liver cancer is not discovered until it is too late to be treated effectively.''Hepatocellular carcinoma: This is the most common form of primary cancer. Primary liver cancer is cancer that began in the liver. It can occur as a single tumor or many small cancer nodules throughout the liver. Primary liver cancer will commonly spread to the ''lungs'', the portal vein (kidney), and portal ''lymph nodes''.''Intrahepatic ''cholangiocarcinoma'' (''bile duct cancer''): As described by its name, this cancer starts where the bile duct connects to the liver. Between 10%-15% of liver ''cancers'' are of this type. This type of cancer commonly spreads (''metastasis'') to the ''lymph nodes'', lung, and bone marrow.''Hepatoblastoma: This is a rare cancer found in children, usually under age 4. This cancer is treated, successfully in most cases, with surgery and ''chemotherapy''.''Secondary cancer: This is a cancer that started elsewhere in the body and spread to the liver. This spread of cancer from a primary site to other parts of the body is called ''metastasis''. Secondary liver cancer is more common in the United States than primary liver cancer. A secondary cancer will be treated by the techniques that have been successful for the primary type of cancer. For example, ''lung cancer'' that has spread to the liver will be treated using ''lung cancer'' protocols, which are the standards of medical care that have been effective for ''lung cancer''.''Lymphoma'', a cancer of the immune system including the lymph nodes, also commonly spreads to the liver. ''Pancreatic cancer'' may also spread to the liver.' "
Is liver cancer curable?,"""Liver cancer is difficult to cure, as it is most often not caught in the early stage. When successfully treated, Liver cancer may never go away completely, so follow-up is very important. Blood tests and imaging tests may be part of a patient's survivorship plan. Statistics for liver cancer are difficult to apply to a specific patient, as the forms, stages and responses to treatment vary per individual. The statistics for deaths due to liver cancer in 2017 are estimated at 19,610 men and 9,310 women."" "
What are liver cancer treatment options?,"'The medical treatment chosen depends upon how much the cancer has spread and the general health of the liver. For example, the extent of cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver can determine the treatment options for the cancer. Similarly, the spread and extent of spread of cancer beyond the liver tissue plays an important part in the types of liver cancer treatment options that may be most effective.''Surgery'': Liver cancer can be treated sometimes with surgery to remove the part of liver with cancer. Surgical options are reserved for the smaller sizes of cancer tumors. Complications from surgery may include bleeding (which can be severe), infection, ''pneumonia'', or side effects of anesthesia.''Liver transplant'': The doctor replaces the cancerous liver with a healthy liver from another person. It is usually used in very small unresectable (inoperable or not able to be removed) liver tumors in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Liver transplantation surgery may have the same complications as noted above for surgery. Also, complications from medications related to a ''liver transplant'' may include possible rejection of the liver transplant, infection due to suppression of the immune system, ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', ''diabetes'', weakening of the kidneys and bones, and an increase in body hair.''Ablation therapy'': This is a procedure that can kill cancer cells in the liver without any surgery. The doctor can kill cancer cells using heat, laser, or by injecting a special alcohol or acid directly into the cancer. This technique also may be used in palliative care when the cancer is unresectable.''Embolization'': Blocking the blood supply to the cancer can be done using a procedure called embolization. This technique uses a catheter to inject particles or beads that can block blood vessels that feed the cancer. Starving the ''cancer of the blood'' supply prevents the growth of the cancer. When this technique uses ''chemotherapy'' and synthetic material, it is sometimes called chemoembolization, as it blocks off the blood supply and traps the chemotherapy agent in a tumor. This technique is usually used on patients with large liver cancer for palliation. Complications of embolization include ''fever'', ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting''.''Radiation therapy'': ''Radiation'' uses high-energy rays directed to the cancer to kill cancer cells. Normal liver cells are also very sensitive to ''radiation''. Complications of ''radiation therapy'' include skin irritation near the treatment site, ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting''.''Chemotherapy'"": Chemotherapy uses a medicine that kills cancer cells. The medicine can be given by mouth or by injecting it into a vein or artery feeding the liver. People can have a variety of side effects from chemotherapy, depending on the medications used and the patient's individual response. Complications of chemotherapy include ""'fatigue'', ''easy bruising'', ''hair loss'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', swollen legs, ''diarrhea'', and ''mouth sores''. These side effects are usually temporary.''Targeted agent'': Sorafenib (Nexavar) is an oral medication that can prolong survival (up to 3 months) in patients with advanced liver cancer. Side effects of sorafenib (Nexavar) include ''fatigue'', ''rash'', ''high blood pressure'', sores on the hands and ''feet'', and ''loss of appetite''.''Clinical trial'': A clinical trial is a way to receive specific treatments in a carefully controlled way to determine whether a new therapy approach is safe, effective, and better than existing therapies. A new treatment may be a drug, a device, a different way to do a surgery, a combination of two or more ''drugs'', or methods of treatment or even ''diet''. The government maintains a web site at ClinicalTrials.gov where more information on trials related to liver cancer can be found. The research from ''clinical trials'', including the statistics supporting the effectiveness of the intervention being tested, is important in the introduction of new treatment methods and ways to change the standard of medical care for all types of liver cancer.'

What is the follow-up after treatment for liver cancer?,'Patients are advised to follow up with the doctor for lab tests and office visits. Patients with chronic ''liver disease'' should avoid alcohol and any drugs that can harm the liver. Patients with liver transplants will need to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their life to prevent their body from rejecting the new liver.' 
What is the prognosis of liver cancer? What are the survival rates for liver cancer?,"'The prognosis for liver cancer depends on multiple factors such as the size of the liver cancer, the number of lesions, the presence of spread beyond the liver, the health of the surrounding liver tissue, and the general health of the patient. Life expectancy depends on many factors that impact whether a cancer is curable.''The American Cancer Society states the overall 5-year survival rate for all stages of liver cancer is 15%. One of the reasons for this low survival rate is that many people with liver cancer also have other underlying medical conditions such as cirrhosis. However, the 5-year survival rate can vary depending on how much the liver cancer has spread.''If the liver cancer is localized (confined to the liver), the 5-year survival rate is 28%. If the liver cancer is regional (has grown into nearby organs), the 5-year survival rate is 7%. Once the liver cancer is distant (spread to distant organs or tissues), the survival time is as low as 2 years.''Survival rate can also be affected by the available treatments. Liver cancers that can be surgically removed have an improved 5-year survival rate of over 50%. When caught in the earliest stages, and the liver is transplanted, the 5-year survival rate can be as high as 70%.''Primary liver cancer deaths are usually from liver failure, bleeding, or advanced cancer.' "
Are there alternative and complementary therapies for liver cancer?,"'Currently, there are no specifically approved alternative or complementary treatment options for liver cancer. Clinical research on the use of ''complementary and alternative medicine'' for liver cancer is limited. Studies suggest that certain alternative therapies may offer benefits for people being treated for all types of cancer, including liver cancer. Some alternative treatments have been found to alleviate unwanted side effects of conventional cancer treatments such as nausea and vomiting.''Acupuncture'': Studies have shown ''acupuncture'' can help with nausea and vomiting among people with cancer.''Herbal therapy'': ''Milk thistle'' has been used for centuries to treat liver problems. Mistletoe may also show promise in liver cancer in experimental studies.''Some herbal preparations, such as those mentioned above, may be helpful in treating symptoms associated with liver cancer. Even so, people who have liver cancer need to take extra precautions before taking an herbal remedy.''A person with cancer of the liver may have a harder time processing alcohol than people without liver disease and should avoid alcohol-containing products. Since many herbal preparations in extract form are alcohol-based, people with liver cancer should always check the ingredients for the presence of any alcohol before taking these herbs.''Additionally, some herbal ''supplements'"", such as gingko biloba, can cause excess bleeding. Because the liver releases important substances that help the blood to clot, liver cancer can decrease the body's ability to stave off bleeding. People with liver cancer should discuss any new medications, including herbal ""'supplements'', with their doctor before taking them.' "
Is it possible to prevent liver cancer?,"'Prevention'' of cirrhosis, which is the underlying cause of liver cancer, will help in preventing the development of liver cancer.''Routine surveillance for liver cancer by performing ''ultrasound'' of the liver every 6 months in patients with a cirrhotic liver will detect early liver cancer.' "
Where can you learn more about liver cancer?,"'Patients can find many resources to learn more about cancer. A popular source is the American Cancer Society. Another is the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which has a lot of information for consumers on resources and support groups.' "
What is liver disease? ,"'Liver disease is any disturbance of ''liver function'' that causes illness. The liver is responsible for many critical functions within the body and should it become diseased or injured, the loss of those functions can cause significant damage to the body. Liver disease is also referred to as hepatic disease.''Liver disease is a broad term that covers all the potential problems that cause the liver to fail to perform its designated functions. Usually, more than 75% or three quarters of liver tissue needs to be affected before a decrease in function occurs.''The liver is the largest solid organ in the body; and is also considered a gland because among its many functions, it makes and secretes bile. The liver is located in the upper right portion of the abdomen protected by the rib cage. It has two main lobes that are made up of tiny lobules. The liver cells have two different sources of blood supply. The hepatic artery supplies oxygen rich blood that is pumped from the ''heart'', while the portal vein supplies nutrients from the intestine and the spleen.''Normally, veins return blood from the body to the heart, but the portal vein allows nutrients and chemicals from the digestive tract to enter the liver for processing and filtering prior to entering the general circulation. The portal vein also efficiently delivers the chemicals and proteins that liver cells need to produce the proteins, ''cholesterol'', and glycogen required for normal body activities.'  "
What is the function of the liver?,"'As part of its function, the liver makes bile, a fluid that contains among other substances, water, chemicals, and bile acids (made from stored cholesterol in the liver). Bile is stored in the gallbladder and when food enters the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), bile is secreted into the duodenum, to aid in the ''digestion'' of food.''The liver is the only organ in the body that can easily replace damaged cells, but if enough cells are lost, the liver may not be able to meet the needs of the body.''The liver can be considered a factory; and among its many functions include:''Cirrhosis'' is a term that describes permanent scarring of the liver. In ''cirrhosis'', the normal liver cells are replaced by ''scar tissue'' that cannot perform any liver function.''Acute liver failure may or may not be reversible, meaning that on occasion, there is a treatable cause and the liver may be able to recover and resume its normal functions.' Production of bile that is required in the digestion of food, in particular fats Storing of the extra glucose or sugar as glycogen, and then converting it back into glucose when the body needs it for energy Production of blood clotting factors Production of amino acids (the building blocks for making proteins), including those used to help fight infection The processing and storage of iron necessary for red blood cell production The manufacture of cholesterol and other chemicals required for fat transport The conversion of waste products of body metabolism into urea that is excreted in the urine Metabolizing medications into their active ingredient in the body"
What are the symptoms of liver disease?,"'Classic symptoms of liver disease'' include ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', right upper quadrant ''abdominal pain'', and ''jaundice'' (a yellow discoloration of the skin due to elevated ''bilirubin'' concentrations in the bloodstream). ''Fatigue'', weakness and ''weight loss'' may also occur. However, since there are a variety of liver diseases, the symptoms tend to be specific for that illness until late-stage liver disease and liver failure occurs. Examples of liver disease symptoms due to certain conditions or diseases include:''Gallstones''. A person with ''gallstones'' may experience right upper ''abdominal pain'' and vomiting after eating a greasy (fatty) meal. If the gallbladder becomes infected, ''fever'' may occur.'""Gilbert's disease""' has no symptoms, and is an incidental finding on a blood test where the bilirubin level is mildly elevated.''Cirrhosis of the liver '""will develop progressive symptoms as the liver fails. Some symptoms are directly related to the inability of the liver to metabolize the body's waste products. Others reflect the failure of the liver to manufacture proteins required for body function and may affect blood clotting function, secondary sex characteristics and brain function.""'Symptoms of cirrhosis of the liver include the following: ''Easy bruising'' may occur due to decreased production of clotting factors; bile salts can deposit in the skin causing ''itching''; ''gynecomastia'' or enlarged breasts in men may occur because of an imbalance in sex hormones, specifically an increase in ''estradiol''; ''impotence'' (''erectile dysfunction'', ''ED''), poor sex drive and shrinking testicles are due to decrease in function of sex hormones; ''confusion'' and lethargy may occur if ammonia levels rise in the blood stream (ammonia is a waste product formed from protein metabolism and requires normal liver cells to remove it); ''ascites'' (fluid accumulation within the abdominal ''cavity'') occurs because of decreased protein production; and muscle wasting may occur because of reduced protein production. Additionally, there is increased pressure within the cirrhotic liver affecting blood flow through the liver. Increased pressure in the portal vein causes blood flow to the liver to slow down and blood vessels to swell. Swollen veins (varices) form around the stomach and ''esophagus'' and are at risk for bleeding.'  "
When should you call your doctor for liver disease?,"'Often, the onset of a liver disease is gradual and there is no specific symptom that brings the affected individual to seek medical care. ''Fatigue'', weakness and ''weight loss'' that cannot be explained should prompt a visit for medical evaluation. Jaundice or yellow skin is never normal and should prompt an evaluation by a health care professional. Persistent ''fever'', vomiting, and ''abdominal pain'' should also prompt medical evaluation as soon as possible.''Acetaminophen or ''Tylenol'' overdose, whether accidental or intentional, can cause acute liver failure. Emergent evaluation and treatment is required. Antidotes to protect the liver can be provided, but are effective only when used within a few hours. Without this intervention, acetaminophen overdose can lead to liver failure. Symptoms only occur after potential liver damage has occurred.' "
Liver disease caused by alcohol and cirrhosis,"'The liver can be damaged in a variety of ways. Cells can become inflamed, for example, ''hepatitis''. Bile flow can be obstructed, for example, ''cholestasis''.''Cholesterol or ''triglycerides'' can accumulate, for example, ''steatosis''. Blood flow to the liver may be compromised. Liver tissue can be damaged by chemicals and ''minerals'', or infiltrated by abnormal cells, like ''cancer'' cells.''Alcohol abuse'' and liver disease: ''Alcohol abuse'' is the most common cause of liver disease in North America. ''Alcohol'' is directly toxic to liver cells and can cause liver inflammation, referred to as alcoholic ''hepatitis''. In chronic alcohol abuse, fat accumulation occurs in liver cells affecting their ability to function.''Cirrhosis of the liver (end-stagge liver disease): ''Cirrhosis is a late stage of liver disease. Scarring of the liver and loss of functioning liver cells cause the liver to fail. Significant amounts of liver cells need to be damaged before the hole organ fails to function.'  "
Drug-induced and supplement liver disease,"'Liver cells may become temporarily inflamed or permanently damaged by exposure to medications or ''drugs''. Some medications or drugs require an overdose to cause liver injury while others may cause the damage even when taken in the appropriately prescribed dosage.''Taking excess amounts of acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol) can cause liver failure. This is the reason that warning labels exist on many ''over-the-counter'' medications that contain acetaminophen and why prescription narcotic-acetaminophen combination medications (for example, ''Vicodin'', ''Lortab'', Norco, Tylenol #3) limit the numbers of tablets to be taken in a day. For patients with underlying liver disease or those who abuse alcohol, that daily limit is lower and acetaminophen may be contra-indicated in those individuals.''Statins'' ''are drugs commonly prescribed to control elevated blood levels of cholesterol. Even when taken in the appropriately prescribed dose, liver inflammation may occur. This inflammation can be detected by blood tests that measure ''liver enzymes''. Stopping the medication usually results in return of the liver function to normal.''Niacin'' is another medication used to control elevated blood levels of cholesterol, but liver inflammation with this medication is related to the dose taken. Similarly, patients with underlying liver disease may be at higher risk of developing liver disease due to medications such as niacin. Recent studies have found that niacin may not be as effective as previously thought in controlling ''high cholesterol''. Patients who take niacin may want to see their health care professional to determine if other treatment options may be appropriate.''Other ''medications'' may cause liver inflammation, most of which will resolve when the medication is stopped. These include antibiotics such as ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Macrodantin'', ''Furadantin'', ''Macrobid''), ''amoxicillin and clavulanic acid'' (''Augmentin'', Augmentin XR), ''tetracycline'' (Sumycin), and ''isoniazid'' (INH, Nydrazid, Laniazid). ''Methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), a drug used to treat autoimmune disorders and ''cancers'', has a variety of side effects including liver inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis. ''Disulfiram'' (''Antabuse'') is used to treat alcoholics and can cause liver inflammation.''Some ''herbal remedies'' and excessive amounts of ''vitamins'' can cause hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver failure. Examples include ''vitamin A'', ''kava'' kava, ''ma-huang'', and ''comfrey''. Many mushrooms are poisonous to the liver and eating unidentified mushrooms gathered in the wild can be lethal.' "
Hepatitis and NASH liver disease,"'Infectious hepatitis''The term ""hepatitis"" means inflammation, and liver cells can become inflamed because of infection.''Hepatitis A'' is a viral infection that is spread primarily through the fecal-oral route when small amounts of infected fecal matter are inadvertently ingested. Hepatitis A causes an acute inflammation of the liver which generally resolves spontaneously. The ''hepatitis A vaccine'' can prevent this infection. Thorough hand washing, especially when preparing food is the best way to prevent the spread of hepatitis A. This is especially important for workers who work in the food and restaurant industries.''Hepatitis B'' is spread by exposure to body fluids (needles from drug abusers, contaminated blood, and sexual contact) and can cause an acute infection, but can also progress to cause chronic inflammation (chronic hepatitis) that can lead to cirrhosis and ''liver cancer''. The ''hepatitis B vaccine'' can prevent this infection.''Hepatitis C'' causes chronic hepatitis. An infected individual may not recall any acute illness. ''Hepatitis C'' is spread by exposure to body fluids (needles from drug abusers, contaminated blood, and some forms of sexual contact). Chronic ''hepatitis C'' may lead to cirrhosis and liver ''cancer''. At present, there is no ''vaccine'' against this virus. There is a recommendation to test all people born between 1945 and 1965 for Hepatitis C antibody to identify people who do not know that they have contracted the disease. Newer medications are now available to treat and potentially cure Hepatitis C.''Hepatitis D is a virus that requires concomitant infection with ''hepatitis B'' to survive, and is spread via body fluid exposure (needles from drug abusers, contaminated blood, and sexual contact).''Hepatitis E'' is a virus that is spread via exposure to contaminated food and water.''Nonalcoholic ''fatty liver'' disease ''(NASH ''nonalcoholic steatohepatitis'') describes the accumulation of fat within the liver that can cause inflammation of the liver and a gradual decrease in liver function.''Hemochromatosis'' ''Hemachromatosis (''iron overload'') is a metabolic disorder that leads to abnormally elevated iron stores in the body. The excess iron may accumulate in the tissues of the liver, pancreas, and heart, and can lead to inflammation, cirrhosis, liver ''cancer'', and liver failure. Hemachromatosis is an ''inherited disease''.'""Wilson's disease ""'is another ''inherited'"" disease that affects the body's ability to metabolize copper. Wilson's disease may lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.""""Gilbert's disease. """"In Gilbert's disease, there is an abnormality in bilirubin metabolism in the liver. It is a common disease that affects up to 7% of the North American population. There are no symptoms and it is usually diagnosed incidentally when an elevated bilirubin level is found on routine blood tests. Gilbert's disease is a benign condition and requires no treatment."" "
Cancer and other causes of liver disease,"'Cancers. ''Primary cancers of the liver arise from liver structures and cells. Two examples include hepatocellular ''carcinoma'' and ''cholangiocarcinoma''.''Metastatic cancer (secondary ''cancer of the liver'') begins in another organ and spreads to the liver, usually through the blood stream. Common cancers that spread to the liver begin in the lung, breast, ''large intestine'', stomach, and pancreas. ''Leukemia'"" and Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'' may also involve the liver.''Blood flow abnormalities. ''Budd Chiari syndrome is a disease in which ''blood clots'' form in the hepatic vein and prevent blood from leaving the liver. This can increase pressure within the blood vessels of the liver, especially the portal vein. This pressure can cause liver cells to die and lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Causes of Budd Chiari syndrome include ''polycythemia'' (abnormally elevated red blood cell count), ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''sickle cell disease'', and ''pregnancy''.''Congestive heart failure'', where poor ''heart function'' causes fluid and blood to back up in the large veins of the body can cause liver swelling and inflamma''tion.''Gallstones''. Normally, bile flows from the liver into the gallbladder and ultimately into the intestine to help with the digestion of food. If bile flow is obstructed, it can cause inflammation within the liver. Most commonly, gallstones can cause an obstruction of the ducts that drains bile from the liver.''Abnormalities'' of the opening of the bile duct into the small intestine (sphincter of Oddi) can lead to abnormalities of bile flow. The sphincter of Oddi acts as a ""valve"" that allows bile to flow from the common bile duct into the intestine.''Primary biliary cholangitis (''PBC'', formerly referred to as ''primary biliary cirrhosis'') and ''primary sclerosing cholangitis'' can lead to progressive scarring of the bile ducts, causing them to become narrow, which results in reduced bile flow through the liver. Eventually, damage and scarring of the liver architecture occurs, resulting in liver failure.''Since the liver is responsible for the functions that affect so many other organs in the body, liver disease and failure may cause complications. Examples include:''Hepatic encephalopathy'':'"" Increased ammonia levels due to the liver's inability to process and metabolize proteins in the ""'diet'' can cause ''confusion'', lethargy, and ''coma''.''Abnormal bleeding:'' The liver is responsible for manufacturing blood clotting factors. Decreased ''liver function'' can cause increased risk of bleeding in the body.''Protein synthesis or manufacture: ''proteins made in the liver are the building blocks for body function. Lack of protein affects many bodily functions.''Portal hypertension'':'' Because the liver has such a great blood supply, damage to the liver tissue can increase pressure within the blood vessels in the liver and adversely affect blood flow to other organs. This can cause spleen swelling, and the development of varices or swollen veins in the gastrointestinal tract, from the ''esophagus'' (esophageal varices) and stomach to the anus (these are different than the swollen veins of ''hemorrhoids'').' "
What are the risk factors for liver disease?,"'Some liver diseases are potentially preventable and are associated with lifestyle choices. Alcohol-related ''liver disease'' is due to excessive consumption and is the most common preventable cause of liver disease.''Hepatitis B'' ''is a viral infection most often spread through the exchange of bodily fluids (for example, unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing unsterilized drug injecting equipment, using non-sterilized equipment for tattoos or body piercing).''Hereditary liver disease'"" can be passed genetically from generation to generation. Examples include Wilson's disease (copper metabolism abnormalities) and ""'hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'').''Chemical exposure'' may damage the liver by irritating the liver cells resulting in inflammation (''hepatitis''), reducing bile flow through the liver (''cholestasis'') and accumulation of ''triglycerides'' (''steatosis''). Chemicals such as ''anabolic steroids'', vinyl chloride, and carbon tetrachloride can cause liver ''cancers''.''Acetaminophen (''Tylenol'') ''overdose is a common cause of liver failure. It is important to review the dosing guidelines for all ''over-the-counter'' medications and to ask for guidance from your health care professional or pharmacist as to how much of any medication may be taken safely. While over-the-counter medications are relatively safe, they may cause complications directly or as an interaction with a prescription medication.''Medications'' may irritate the liver blood vessels causing narrowing or the formation of ''blood clots'' (thrombosis). ''Birth control pills'' may cause hepatic vein thrombosis, especially in ''smokers''.' "
"What exams, tests, and procedures diagnose the cause of liver disease?","""The precise diagnosis of liver disease involves a history and physical examination performed by a health care professional. Understanding the symptoms and the patient's risk factors for liver disease will help guide any diagnostic tests that may be considered.""'Sometimes history is difficult, especially in patients who abuse alcohol. These patients tend to minimize their consumption, and it is often family members who are able to provide the correct information.''Liver disease can have physical findings that affect almost all body systems including the heart, ''lungs'', abdomen, skin, brain and cognitive function, and other parts of the nervous system. The physical examination often requires evaluation of the entire body. Blood tests are helpful in assessing liver inflammation and function. Specific liver function blood tests include AST and ALT ( ransaminase chemicals released with liver cell inflammation), GGT and ''alkaline phosphatase'' (chemicals released by cells lining the bile ducts), ''bilirubin'', and protein and albumin levels. Other blood tests may be considered, including:' Complete blood count (CBC). Patients with end stage liver disease may have bone marrow suppression and low red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. As a result, patients with cirrhosis may have bleeding. INR blood clotting function may be impaired due to poor protein production and is a sensitive measure of liver function. Lipase to check for pancreas inflammation. Electrolytes, BUN and creatinine to assess kidney function; and ammonia blood level assessment is helpful in patients with mental confusion to determine whether liver failure is a potential cause. CT scan (computerized axial tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and Ultrasound (sound wave imaging, which is especially helpful in assessing the gallbladder and bile ducts. Liver biopsy may be considered to confirm a specific diagnosis of liver disease. Under local anesthetic, a long thin needle is inserted through the chest wall into the liver, where a small sample of liver tissue is obtained for examination under a microscope."
What is the treatment for liver disease? Will you need surgery?,"'Each liver disease will have its own specific treatment regimen. For example, ''hepatitis A'"" requires supportive care to maintain hydration while the body's immune system fights and resolves the infection. Patients with ""'gallstones'' may require surgery to remove the gallbladder. Other diseases may need long-term medical care to control and minimize the consequences of their disease.''In people with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, medications may be required to control the amount of protein absorbed in the ''diet''. The liver affected by cirrhosis may not be able to metabolize the waste products, resulting in elevated blood ammonia levels and hepatic ''encephalopathy'' (lethargy, confusion, ''coma''). Low-sodium ''diet'' and water pills (diuretics) may be required to minimize water retention.''In those people with large amounts of ''ascites'' fluid (fluid accumulated in the abdominal ''cavity''), the excess fluid may have to be occasionally removed with a needle and syringe (paracentesis). Using local anesthetic, a needle is inserted through the abdominal wall and the fluid is withdrawn. The ascites fluid can spontaneously become infected, and paracentesis also may be used as a diagnostic test looking for infection.''Surgery may be required to treat ''portal hypertension'' and minimize the risk of bleeding. Liver transplantation is the final option for patients whose livers have failed.'  "
What are the complications of liver disease?,"'Except for gallstone disease and some viral infections such as ''hepatitis A'', C, and ''infectious mononucleosis'', most liver diseases are managed and not cured. Liver disease can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Associated complications may include increased risk of bleeding and infection, malnutrition and ''weight loss'', and decreased cognitive function. Some liver diseases are associated with an increased risk of developing ''liver cancer''.'  "
Can liver disease be prevented?," Alcohol abuse is the most common cause of liver disease in North America. Consuming alcohol in moderation may help minimize the risk of alcohol-related liver disease. The risk of contracting Hepatitis B and C can be decreased by minimizing the risk of exposure to another person's bodily fluids. Vaccination is available for Hepatitis A and B. Screening for Hepatitis C is recommended in some populations. Fatty liver disease is a preventable illness with the promotion of a healthy lifestyle including a well-balanced diet, weight control, avoiding excess alcohol consumption, and routine exercise program. These lifestyle modifications do not guarantee success in disease prevention, as some people will develop fatty liver disease even with maximized lifestyle practices."
What are the basic functions of the liver?,"'The ''liver'' is located in the right upper portion of the abdominal ''cavity'' just beneath the rib cage. The liver has many functions that are vital to life. Briefly, some of the important functions of the human liver are:' Detoxification of blood Production of important clotting factors, albumin, and many other important proteins Metabolizing (processing) medications and nutrients Processing of waste products of hemoglobin and other cells Storing of vitamins, fat, cholesterol, and bile Production of glucose (gluconeogenesis or glucose synthesis/release during starvation)"
What are common liver blood function tests?,"'Liver blood tests are some of the most commonly performed blood tests. These tests can be used to assess liver functions or liver injury. An initial step in detecting liver damage is a simple blood test to determine the level of certain liver enzymes (proteins) in the blood. Under normal circumstances, these enzymes mostly reside within the cells of the liver. But when the liver is injured for any reason, these enzymes are spilled into the blood stream. Enzymes are proteins that are present throughout the body, each with a unique function. Enzymes help to speed up (catalyze) routine and vital chemical reactions in the body.''Among the most sensitive and widely used liver enzymes are the aminotransferases. They include aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT). These enzymes are normally predominantly contained within liver cells and to a lesser degree in the muscle cells. If the liver is injured or damaged, the liver cells spill these enzymes into the blood, raising the AST and ALT enzyme blood levels and signaling ''liver disease''.''Other blood tests pertaining to the liver are measurements of some of the other enzymes found the liver. In addition to AST and ALT, ''alkaline phosphatase'"", 5' nucleotidase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are a few of the other enzymes located in the liver. The focus of this article is mainly on the most common liver enzymes, AST and ALT.""  "
"What are the aminotransferases enzymes (ALT, AST)?","'The aminotransferases enzymes catalyze chemical reactions in which an amino group from one amino acid (amino acids are building blocks of proteins) is transferred from a donor molecule to a recipient molecule, hence, the names ""aminotransferases.""''Medical terms can sometimes be confusing, as is the case with these enzymes because they have interchangeable names that commonly appear in both medical and non-medical articles. For example:''To put matters briefly, AST = SGOT and ALT = SGPT; they are enzymes produced by the liver, and other types of cells).' Another name for aminotransferase is transaminase. The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is also known as serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)."
"Normally, where are AST and ALT (aminotransferase enzymes)?","'AST (SGOT) is normally found in a variety of tissues including liver, ''heart'', muscle, kidney, and the brain. It is released into the serum when any one of these tissues is damaged. For example, AST level in serum is elevated in ''heart attacks'' or with muscle injury. It is therefore, not a highly specific indicator of liver injury as its elevation can occur as a result of other injured tissues.''ALT (SGPT) is, by contrast, normally found largely in the liver. This is not to say that it is exclusively located in the liver, but that is where it is most concentrated. It is released into the bloodstream as the result of liver injury. Thus, it serves as a fairly specific indicator of liver status.' "
What are normal levels of AST and ALT?,"""However, the ranges of AST and ALT numbers may differ slightly depending on the technique and protocols used by different laboratories worldwide. However, normal reference ranges are routinely provided by each laboratory and printed with each patient's individual report.""   The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is about 5 to 40 units per liter of serum (the liquid part of the blood). The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is about 7 to 56 units per liter of serum."
What do high (elevated) liver tests (AST and ALT) mean?,"'AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. However, it must be emphasized that higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes should not be automatically equated with ''liver disease''. They may mean liver problems or they may not. For example, elevations of these enzymes can occur with muscle damage. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT results depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual, and so it is best done by physicians experienced in evaluating liver disease and muscle disease.''Moreover, the precise levels of these liver enzyme tests do not correlate well with the extent of liver problems or the prognosis (outlook). Thus, the exact levels of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future prognosis for ''liver function''. For example, individuals with acute ''viral hepatitis'' A may develop very high AST and ALT levels (sometimes in the thousands of units/liter range), but most people with acute viral ''hepatitis A'' recover fully without residual liver disease. Conversely, people with chronic ''hepatitis C'' infection typically have only a little elevation in their AST and ALT levels while having substantial liver injury and even advanced scarring of the liver (''cirrhosis'') from ongoing minor inflammation of the liver.' "
Do AST and ALT test results indicate liver function?,"'It is important to clarify that ALT and AST levels do not reflect the function of the liver, even though in the medical community and in medical publications they commonly, and incorrectly, are referred to as liver function tests. Even in conditions when AST and ALT are very elevated, the liver still may function properly. Consequently, if you have ""elevated liver enzymes"" or a high or abnormal liver test, you need to ask your physician exactly what all of the tests indicate.' "
What blood tests are done to detect liver function?,"'The blood tests that truly reflect liver function are the following; normal values (ranges) listed are for adult men - women and children have similar but slightly different ranges of normal test values'   Coagulation panel (prothrombin time or PT, and international normalized ratio or INR): These tests measure blood's ability for normal clotting and prevention of bleeding and bruising. This is the function of certain proteins called clotting factors that normally are produced in the liver. Normal values are about 9.5 to 13.8 seconds. Albumin level (hypoalbuminemia): Albumin is a very common protein found in the blood with a variety of functions. It also is produced only in the liver, and if its levels are lower than normal it can be suggestive of chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. Of note, many conditions other than liver disease also may cause low albumin levels. Normal values are about 3.5 to 5 g/dL. Bilirubin: This molecule is a byproduct of the routine destruction of red blood cells occurring in the liver. It is normally released as bile in the feces. Elevation of the bilirubin can suggest liver dysfunction. However, other conditions with increased destruction of red blood cells also can cause elevated bilirubin levels despite normal liver function. Normal values are about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL."
What blood tests are done to detect liver function? (Continued),"'Note that many hospitals and doctor\'s offices list a liver function panel as part of a lab workup. These panels vary and may consist of AST, ALT and some or all of the tests listed above. In addition, the normal panel values may vary somewhat, especially between adult men, women and children so viewing the ""normal"" ranges of test values is always recommended, and a thorough discussion with the physician is necessary. In addition, some clinicians recommend other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. ''There are other tests such as serum ammonia and serum lactate levels in their panels. There are home liver tests for blood enzyme levels and liver function however, individuals who use these tests should first discuss their use and results with their health care professional.' Platelet count: Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) has many causes, one of which can be advanced liver disease. Normal platelet counts are about 150,000 to 400,000 per (µL). Glucose: Glucose level is maintained in the body by a variety of mechanisms. The liver can release glucose in the blood for nourishment of other cells in case of starvation with insufficient oral intake of glucose. This process, called gluconeogenesis, is another major function of the liver. In advanced liver disease, this function of the liver can be compromised leading to unusually low glucose levels in the absence of adequate oral intake. Conversely, a large number of people with liver cirrhosis become glucose intolerant and develop diabetes. GGT (Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase): This enzyme is thought to indicate possible liver damage; the higher the abnormal level, the more likely there is liver damage. Normal levels of GGT are about 9 to 48 U/L. ALP (alkaline phosphatase): The liver synthesizes the highest amounts of this enzyme so high levels in the blood may suggest liver injury among other causes. Normal levels of ALP are about 45 to 115 U/L. LD or LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase): This enzyme may be elevated in many types of diseases, including liver disease. Normal levels are about 122 to 222U/L."
What are some common reasons for abnormal liver tests?,"'Abnormal liver tests may be detected in the blood in a variety of liver conditions.' Mild to moderate elevations of the liver enzymes are common. They are often unexpectedly encountered on routine blood screening tests in otherwise healthy individuals. The AST and ALT readings in such cases are usually between twice the upper limits of normal and several hundred units/liter. One of the most common causes of mild to moderate elevations of these liver tests is a condition referred to as fatty liver (steatohepatitis or hepatic steatosis). In the United States, the most frequent cause of fatty liver is alcohol abuse. Other causes of fatty liver include diabetes mellitus and obesity. Fatty liver tests are composed of several tests including blood tests, CT and/or MRI tests and in some individuals, a liver biopsy. Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C are other causes of chronic mild to moderate liver enzyme elevation. In these conditions, ALT and AST may be only slightly high and the degree of abnormality in liver function tests can indicate the degree if injury. Chronic and acute alcohol use also can commonly cause abnormal liver blood tests. In alcoholic hepatitis, the range of liver tests can vary greatly. In chronic alcohol liver disease or alcoholic cirrhosis, slight elevation of ALT and AST may be observed, whereas in acute alcoholic hepatitis, high liver enzyme numbers are often seen. Many medications can be responsible for mild to moderate increase in the liver enzyme tests (see below)."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT) levels?,"'A variety of medications can cause abnormal liver enzymes levels in some individuals.''Examples of some of the common medications with potential liver toxicity include:''Pain'' relief medications ''such as:''Anti-''seizure'' medications'' such as:''Antibiotics ''such as:' aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Naprelan, Anaprox, Aleve), diclofenac (Voltaren, Cataflam, Voltaren-XR), and phenylbutazone (Butazolidine) phenytoin (Dilantin), valproic acid (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equertro), and phenobarbital tetracyclines, (for example, tetracycline [Achromycin]) sulfonamides, isoniazid (INH) (Nydrazid, Laniazid) sulfamethoxazole (Gantanol), trimethoprim (Trimpex; Proloprim, Primsol) nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin; Furadantin; Macrobid), fluconazole (Diflucan ) and some other anti-fungals, etc."
What medications can cause increased liver enzyme tests (AST and ALT)? (continued),"'Cholesterol lowering ''drugs'' ''such as ''statins'':''Cardiovascular drugs ''such as:''Other drugs'""With drug-induced liver enzyme abnormalities, the enzymes usually normalize weeks to months after stopping the medications. Typically, the physician will want to monitor the patient's liver enzymes over time to confirm that the values are normalizing."" lovastatin (Mevacor, Altocor), pravastatin (Pravachol), atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and niacin amiodarone (Cordarone), hydralazine (Apresoline) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), etc. Antidepressant drugs of the tricyclic type"
What conditions can cause very high AST or ALT levels?,"'AST and ALT serum levels in some liver conditions can range anywhere from ten times the upper limits of normal to thousands of units/liter. The highest levels of AST and ALT are found with disorders that cause rapid death of numerous liver cells (extensive hepatic necrosis). Although this degree of liver enzymes elevation is not common, it can occur in such conditions as:''Also, very high AST and ALT levels can be a result of severe muscle diseases.' Acute viral hepatitis A or B Profound liver damage inflicted by toxins as from an overdose of acetaminophen (brand-name Tylenol) or mushroom poisoning Prolonged collapse of the circulatory system (shock) when the liver is deprived of fresh blood providing oxygen and nutrients"
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood and function tests?,"'Less common causes of abnormal liver enzymes in the United States include ''hemochromatosis'' (''iron overload'""), Wilson's disease, alpha-1-""'antitrypsin'' deficiency, ''celiac disease'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', and autoimmune hepatitis. Though not as common as ''hepatitis C'', ''hepatitis B'' can cause chronic liver disease with persistently abnormal liver enzymes.' Hemochromatosis is a genetic (inherited) disorder in which there is excessive absorption of dietary iron leading to accumulation of iron in the liver with resultant inflammation and scarring of the liver. If undiagnosed or untreated, hemochromatosis can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder with excessive accumulation of copper in diverse tissues including the liver and the brain. Excess copper in the liver can lead to chronic liver inflammation, while copper in the brain can cause psychiatric and motor disturbances. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder in which the lack of a glycoprotein (carbohydrate-protein complex) called alpha-1-antitrypsin lead to chronic lung disease (emphysema) and chronic liver disease. Autoimmune hepatitis results from liver injury brought about by the body's own antibodies and defense systems attacking the liver."
What are some of the less common causes of elevated liver blood tests? (continued)," Celiac disease (celiac sprue) is a disease of the small intestine where a person has an allergy to gluten and develops gas, bloating, diarrhea, and in advanced cases malnutrition. Patients' with celiac disease can also develop mildly abnormal ALT and AST levels. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are diseases with chronic inflammation of the intestines (collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel diseases). In these individuals inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) or bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) also can occur, causing abnormal liver tests. Viral infections other than common hepatitis viruses (A, B, C) can sometimes cause elevation of liver enzymes as they can result in generalized body infection and liver inflammation. Non-viral infections of the liver are rare, but they can cause liver damage. Bacterial and amebic (parasitic) hepatic (liver) abscesses typically present as focal infection and inflammation of the liver as opposed to viral hepatitis where generalized liver inflammation occurs. Liver enzyme elevation is usually seen in the setting of these infections. Rarely, abnormal liver enzymes can be a sign of liver cancer. Cancer arising from liver cells is called hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoma. Cancers spreading to the liver from other organs (such as colon, pancreas, stomach, and others) are called metastatic malignancies (to the liver). Liver hemangiomas (masses of abnormal and atypical blood vessels within the liver) are the most common tumors in the liver. However, hepatic hemangiomas are benign and in general do not cause elevation of liver tests. Another rare condition that causes elevation of liver tests is called the Budd-Chiari Syndrome. In this condition, obstruction of blood flow in the liver by a blood clot can damage the liver by limiting blood flow leading to injury of liver cells. As a result of this insult, liver enzymes may rise indicating hepatic inflammation. Glycogen storage disorders are genetic conditions seen in pediatric population (detected at birth in severe types or later in childhood in less severe types). They impair the ability of the liver to store and metabolize glycogen, a complex sugar necessary for production of nutrients and energy in the body. Glycogen storage disorders cause varying degrees of liver enzyme abnormalities."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels?,"""Evaluation of healthy individuals with abnormal liver enzymes needs to be individualized. A doctor may ask for the patient's blood test data from old records for comparison. If no old records are available, the doctor may repeat blood tests in weeks to months to see whether these abnormalities persist.""'In the meantime, along with a physical examination, by performing thorough medical history the doctor will search for potential infectious and non-infectious causes and risk factors for liver disease such as:''A complete list of routine medications including ''over-the-counter'' medications will be reviewed.''Signs and symptoms of liver disease may or may not be present in individuals with mild increase in liver enzymes. Signs of liver damage can include ''jaundice'', ''easy bruising'', ''ascites'' (distention of abdomen as result of retained fluid), ''enlarged spleen'' (''splenomegaly''), and ''confusion''. Symptoms of liver disease are non-specific and numerous. Some of the more common liver disease symptoms may include ''fatigue'', ''itching'', yellow skin, poor appetite, and abdominal discomfort.''The pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities can sometimes provide useful clues as to the cause of the liver condition. For example, in a majority of people with alcoholic liver disease, liver enzyme levels are not as high as the levels reached in acute viral hepatitis. In alcoholic liver disease, frequently AST tends to be higher (usually under 300 units/liter) than ALT (usually under 100 units/ liter).' Medications Alcohol use Sexual exposures History of blood transfusions History of injectable drug use Occupational exposure to blood products Family history of liver disease (for the possibility of inherited diseases such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency)."
How are healthy people evaluated for mild to moderate rises in AST/ALT levels? (continued),"""If alcohol or medication is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme tests, stopping alcohol or the culprit medication (under a health care professional's supervision only) should bring the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in weeks to months. If obesity is suspected as the cause of ""'fatty liver disease'', weight reduction of about 5% to 10% should also bring the AST and ALT liver blood tests to normal or near normal levels in some individuals.''If abnormal liver enzymes persist despite abstinence from alcohol, weight reduction, and stopping certain suspected drugs, other tests can be performed to help diagnose other possible treatable liver diseases. The blood can be tested for the presence of ''hepatitis B'"" and C viruses and their related antibodies. Blood levels of iron, iron saturation, and ferritin (another measurement of the amount of iron stored in the body) are usually elevated in individuals with hemochromatosis. Blood levels of a substance called ceruloplasmin are usually decreased in people with Wilson's disease. Blood levels of certain antibodies (anti-nuclear antibody or ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibody) are elevated in individuals with autoimmune hepatitis.""'Liver ''ultrasound'' and ''CT scan'' of the abdomen are sometimes used to exclude tumors in the liver or other conditions such as ''gallstones'' or tumors obstructing the ducts that drain the liver. These tests also can provide important visual information about the liver such as size, contour, scarring, and anatomically important data. A CT liver scan is very useful to detect traumatic injuries to the liver.''Liver biopsy can occasionally assist in determining the cause of liver disease. In this procedure a needle is inserted through the skin over the right upper abdomen to obtain a thin strand of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. Liver biopsy is oftentimes performed after ultrasound study has located the liver. Not everybody with abnormal liver enzymes needs a liver biopsy. The doctor will usually recommend this procedure if:'""Liver biopsy is most useful in confirming a diagnosis of a potentially treatable condition including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency."" The information obtained from the liver biopsy will likely be helpful in planning treatment The doctor needs to know the extent and severity of liver inflammation/damage Effectiveness of a certain treatment requires close monitoring at the tissue level No obvious cause of elevated liver tests has been found despite thorough investigation"
How do health care professionals monitor a person's liver blood values?,"'What is usually most helpful is serial testing of AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) over time to determine whether the levels are increasing, remaining stable, or decreasing. For example, individuals undergoing treatment for chronic hepatitis C should be monitored with serial liver enzyme tests. Those responding to treatment will experience lowering of liver enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels. Those who develop relapse of hepatitis C after completion of treatment will usually develop abnormal liver enzyme levels again.' "
What other liver enzymes cause medical problems?,"'Aside from AST and ALT, there are other enzymes including alkaline phosphatase, 5\'-nucleotidase (""5 prime"" nucleotidase), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) that are often used to detect for liver disease.''LDH is not specific to the liver and can be elevated in many diseases with inflammation in other tissues.''Alkaline phosphatase is another liver enzyme that is frequently measured. This enzyme is usually found in the walls of the bile ducts (tube-like structures within the liver that connect liver cells together). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase may indicate an injury to the biliary cells. Common causes of biliary injury or biliary obstruction (''cholestasis'') are ''gallstones'"" and certain medications, although, some of the conditions listed previously can also raise the levels of this enzyme. Alkaline phosphate is also found in the bone and can be elevated in bone diseases. GGT and 5' nucleotidase levels can be elevated in biliary conditions (disease of the gallbladder and bile ducts) along with alkaline phosphatase."" "
What is the liver? What is its function?,"'The liver has multiple functions. It makes many of the chemicals required by the body to function normally, it breaks down and detoxifies substances in the body, and it also acts as a storage unit.''Hepatocytes (hepar=liver + cyte=cell) are responsible for making many of the proteins (protein synthesis) in the body that are required for many functions, including blood clotting factors, and albumin, required to maintain fluid within the circulation system. The liver is also responsible for manufacturing cholesterol and ''triglycerides''. Carbohydrates are also produced in the liver and the organ is responsible for turning glucose into glycogen that can be stored both in the liver and in the muscle cells. The liver also makes bile that helps with food ''digestion''.''The liver plays an important role in detoxifying the body by converting ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism in the body, into urea that is excreted in the urine by the kidneys. The liver also breaks down medications and drugs, including alcohol, and is responsible for breaking down ''insulin'' and other hormones in the body.''The liver is also stores ''vitamins'' and chemicals that the body requires as building blocks. These includes:''The liver is one of the vital organs of the body, responsible for hundreds of chemical actions that the body needs to survive. It is also a gland because it secretes chemicals that are used by other parts of the body. For these reasons the liver is both an organ and a gland; in fact, it is the largest internal organ in the body.' vitamin B12, folic acid, iron required to make red blood cells, vitamin A for vision, vitamin D for calcium absorption, and vitamin K to help the blood to clot properly."
What are the symptoms and signs of liver disease?,"'The liver is a large organ and a significant amount of liver tissue needs to be damaged before a person experiences symptoms of disease. Symptoms also may depend upon the type of liver disease.'   The inflammation of hepatitis may be associated with pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, nausea and vomiting. This may also be seen in people with gallstones. People may have jaundice (have a yellow-orange hue to their skin) because the liver cannot metabolize bilirubin (the normal breakdown product of old red blood cells). There may be a tendency to bleed excessively or bruise easily because the liver is unable to manufacture blood clotting factors in adequate amounts. Fatigue, weakness, weight loss, and shortness of breath because of muscle wasting; due to the inability of the liver to manufacture proteins. Because the liver is involved in the metabolism of sex hormones, gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue in men) and impotence may occur. In end-stage liver disease, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and leg swelling may occur because of inadequate production of albumin by the liver. There also may be difficulty in metabolizing ammonia causing its levels in the blood to rise, resulting in confusion due to encephalopathy (encephala=brain + pathy=dysfunction)."
What does the liver look like? Where is it located in the body?,"'The liver is divided into two lobes and has a rich blood supply obtained from two sources:\xa0''The biliary tree describes a system of tubes that collect bile, used to help digest food, and drains it into the gallbladder or the intestine. Intrahepatic ducts are located inside the liver (intra=inside + hepar=liver) while extrahepatic ducts are located outside the liver.' the portal vein delivers blood from the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, intestine, colon) and spleen, and the hepatic artery supplies blood from the heart."
"Liver disease causes (fatty liver, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and infections)","'Many diseases may affect the liver directly or as a consequence of an illness or disease that begins in another organ.''Hepatitis is an infection of the liver that causes liver inflammation.''Infections may affect the liver, including:'   Fatty liver disease, caused by accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides within the liver is not associated with alcohol abuse. Fatty liver disease is also referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Cirrhosis of the liver describes a condition of scarring in the liver that is not reversible and may lead to liver failure. Alcohol abuse causes cirrhosis of the liver and is the most common cause of liver disease in North America. Hepatitis A is often spread by poor sanitary habits including poor handwashing and may be transmitted by food handlers. It tends to be self-limited. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are spread by contact with infected body fluids. Hepatitis D is spread in conjunction with hepatitis B and needs the B virus for it to survive in the body and cause liver damage. Hepatitis E is a food or water borne infection. There are vaccinations available to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Epstein Barr virus that causes infectious mononucleosis Adenovirus Cytomegalovirus Toxoplasmosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever"
"Liver disease causes (medications, toxins, genetics, cancer, and others)","'Liver inflammation is a relatively common side effect of medications. Some commonly prescribed medications include the following:''Genetic disorders can affect the liver, examples include the following:''Abnormalities of bile flow from the liver may lead to liver inflammation, for example:''Decrease in blood flow draining out of the liver may cause the liver to become congested and inflamed, two examples include:'   acetaminophen over the counter (Tylenol, Panadol) but also in prescription pain medications (hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Lortab, Vicodin, Norco) Statins (medications used to control elevated blood cholesterol levels) Antibiotics (amoxiciilin-clavulinic acid [Augmentin, Augmentin XR], nitrofurantoin [Macrodantin, Furadantin, Macrobid], tetracycline, isoniazid) methotrexate (Trexall, Rheumatrex) disulfiram (Antabusel) Herbal remedies, for example, kava kava, mahuang, comfrey Poisonous mushrooms may damage the liver and cause liver failure. Alcohol in large doses can be toxic for the liver and damages the liver over time. Aflatoxins produced by certain fungi are toxic to the liver Industrial chemicals may be toxins that affect the liver, such as arsenic and carbon tetrachloride Hemochromatosis with abnormal iron storage Wilson's Disease with abnormal copper storage Gilbert's Disease with abnormal bilirubin metabolism Primary liver cancers arise directly from cells within the liver. Metastatic liver disease describes cancer that arises from another organ and invades the liver Gallstones (the most common disease) Primary biliary cirrhosis Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a condition in which the heart is not strong enough to pump all of the blood it receives, and that blood can back up into the liver. Budd Chiari syndrome is a disease in which blood clots form in the hepatic veins, preventing blood from leaving the liver."
What are liver function blood tests?,"'The liver is located in the abdomen but the health care professional will want to examine the whole body to look for the consequences of liver disease.' The abdomen may be palpated to feel for an enlarged liver. As it grows, the liver edge may be felt below the right rib margin. An inflamed liver in acute hepatitis may be tender but a liver that is cirrhotic, small and shrunken, may not be able to be felt. If liver disease is a consideration, the health care professional also may feel for an enlarged spleen and assess whether excess fluid is present in the abdomen (ascites), perhaps indicating the presence of portal hypertension. The skin, including the sclera of the eyes, may be assessed for color looking for jaundice. Spider nevi, or angiomata, are a collection of blood vessels under the skin and may be normal, but in the proper setting may indicate liver disease. If the person is confused (hepatic encephalopathy), the doctor may attempt to illicit asterixis, or flap on the physical examination. These people may not be able to keep their wrists cocked when their arms are held outstretched but instead see their wrists rhythmically flapping. Blood tests may be ordered to help make the diagnosis. Liver enzymes levels may reveal liver inflammation. However, in patients with end-stage liver disease, the liver can burn itself out and the enzymes may be normal even in the face of severe disease. Other blood tests that may be appropriate include a complete blood cell count (CBC), hepatitis virus screen, and blood clotting tests (a sensitive way to measure function since the liver is responsible for manufacturing the proteins involved in the blood clotting mechanism). On occasion, ultrasound may be helpful in assessing the anatomy of the liver and this may lead to other tests including CT scan to further assess the anatomy and structure of the liver and surrounding tissues."
What is a liver biopsy? Is it painful?,"'Most often, diseases of the liver can be diagnosed by history, physical examination, and blood tests. On occasion, should the diagnosis be unclear or to assess the degree of damage to the liver, a ''liver biopsy'' may be necessary.''Using a very thin needle, a ''gastroenterologist'' or hepatologist (two types of liver specialists) or an interventional radiologist will insert a very fine needle through the skin and into the liver, to retrieve a small bit of tissue. This can then be examined under the microscope by a pathologist to help make the diagnosis. This procedure is done under sterile conditions to prevent infection, and a local anesthetic is injected into the skin to decrease the potential for pain.''If there is concern about only one area of the liver, instead of a disease that would affect the whole organ, an ultrasound may be used to help guide the needle into the proper position.'  "
Can liver disease be prevented?," Moderate alcohol consumption to decrease the risk of the most common cause of liver disease in North America. The risk of contracting hepatitis B and hepatitis C can be decreased by minimizing exposure to body fluids. As mentioned previously, vaccinations are available for hepatitis A and B. Maintain a healthy weight and eat a balanced diet to decrease the risk of developing fatty liver disease."
Which types of doctors treat liver disease?," Diseases of the liver may be treated by primary care or internal medicine specialists. Gastroenterologists are specialists that focus on the digestive organs and liver. A hepatologist is a specialist focused exclusively on the liver. Depending upon the exact type of liver disease, other specialists may be involved in the care of patients with liver disease, including infectious disease specialists, surgeons, oncologists, critical care specialists, hematologists, and emergency medicine specialists."
What is liver resection and why is it done?,'Liver'' resection is the surgical removal of a portion of the liver. This operation is usually done to remove various types of liver tumors that are located in the resected portion of the liver. The goal of liver resection is to completely remove the ''tumor'' and the appropriate surrounding liver tissue without leaving any tumor behind.' 
Which patients with liver cancer undergo liver resection?,"'In patients with ''liver cancer'' (Hepatocellular ''Cancer'', HCC), liver resection is limited to patients with one or two small (5 cm or less) tumors confined to the liver with no invasion of the blood vessels. As a result of these strict guidelines, in practice, very few patients with HCC can undergo liver resection. The biggest concern about resection is that following the operation, the patient can develop liver failure. The liver failure can occur if the remaining portion of the liver is inadequate (for example, because of associated ''cirrhosis'') to provide the necessary support for life.'  "
What is the goal of liver resection?,"'The goal of liver resection is to completely remove the tumor and the appropriate surrounding liver tissue without leaving any tumor behind. This option is limited to patients with one or two small (3 cm or less) tumors and excellent ''liver function'', ideally without associated ''cirrhosis''. As a result of these strict guidelines, in practice, very few patients with liver ''cancer'' can undergo liver resection. The biggest concern about resection is that following the operation, the patient can develop liver failure.' "
Can a portion of the remaining normal liver grow back?,"'When a portion of a normal liver is removed, the remaining liver can grow back (regenerate) to the original size within several weeks. A cirrhotic liver, however, cannot grow back. Therefore, before resection is performed for HCC, the non-tumor portion of the liver should be biopsied to determine whether there is associated cirrhosis.' "
What are the results (survival and recurrence) of liver resection?,"'For HCC patients whose tumors are successfully resected, the five-year survival is about 10% to 60%, depending on the tumor size and type. This means that 10% to 60 % of patients who actually undergo liver resection for liver ''cancer'' are expected to live five years. Many of these patients, however, will have a recurrence of liver cancer elsewhere in the liver. Moreover, it should be noted that the survival rate of untreated patients with similar sized tumors and similar liver function is probably comparable. Some studies from Europe and Japan have shown that survival rates with ''alcohol'' injection or ''radiofrequency ablation'' procedures are comparable to the survival rates of those patients who underwent resection. But again, the reader should be cautioned that there are no head-to-head comparisons of these procedures versus resection.' "
"What is the liver, and what is its function.","'The ''liver'"" is the body's largest internal organ, weighing about 3 pounds in adults. It is located below the ""'diaphragm'' on the right side of the abdomen.''The liver performs many complex functions in the body, including:' Produces most proteins needed by the body. Metabolizes, or breaks down, nutrients from food to produce energy, when needed. Prevents shortages of nutrients by storing certain vitamins, minerals and sugar. Produces bile, a compound needed to digest fat and to absorb vitamins A, D, E and K. Produces most of the substances that regulate blood clotting. Helps your body fight infection by removing bacteria from the blood. Removes potentially toxic byproducts of certain medications."
When is a liver transplant needed?,"'Liver transplantation is considered when the liver no longer functions adequately (liver failure). Liver failure can occur suddenly (acute liver failure) as a result of infection or complications from certain medications or it can be the end result of a long-term problem. The following conditions may result in liver failure:' Chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis (a condition where the immune system inappropriately attacks and destroys the bile ducts causing liver failure). Sclerosing cholangitis (scarring and narrowing of the bile ducts inside and outside of the liver causing the backup of bile in the liver which can lead to liver failure). Biliary atresia (malformation of the bile ducts). Alcoholism Wilson's disease (a rare inherited disease with abnormal deposition of copper throughout the body, including the liver, causing it to fail). Hemochromatosis (a common inherited disease where the body is overwhelmed with iron). Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (an abnormal accumulation of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein in the liver, resulting in cirrhosis). Liver cancer"
How are candidates for liver transplant determined?,"'Evaluations by specialists from a variety of fields are needed to determine if a liver transplant is appropriate. The evaluation includes a review of your medical history and a variety of tests. Many healthcare facilities offer an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate and to select candidates for liver transplantation. This interdisciplinary healthcare team may include the following professionals:' Liver specialist (hepatologist). Transplant surgeons Transplant coordinator, usually a registered nurse who specializes in the care of liver-transplant patients (this person will be your primary contact with the transplant team). Social worker to discuss your support network of family and friends, employment history, and financial needs. Psychiatrist to help you deal with issues, such as anxiety and depression, which may accompany the liver transplantation. Anesthesiologist to discuss potential anesthesia risks. Chemical dependency specialist to aid those with history of alcohol or drug abuse. Financial counselor to act as a liaison between a patient and his or her insurance companies."
Which tests are required before getting a liver transplant?,"'You will need to bring all of your previous doctor records, ''X-rays'', ''liver biopsy'' slides and a record of medications to your pre-evaluation for a liver transplant. To complement and to update previous tests, some or all of the following diagnostic studies are generally performed during your evaluation.''If specific problems are identified, additional tests may be ordered.' Computed tomography, which uses X-rays and a computer to generate pictures of the liver, showing its size and shape. Doppler ultrasound to determine if the blood vessels to and from your liver are open. Echocardiogram to help evaluate your heart. Pulmonary function studies to determine your lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Blood tests to determine blood type, clotting ability, and biochemical status of blood and to gauge liver function. AIDS testing and hepatitis screening are also included."
How does the waiting list work?,"'If you become an active liver transplant candidate, your name will be placed on a waiting list. Patients are listed according to blood type, body size, and medical condition (how ill they are). Each patient is given a priority score based on three simple blood tests (''creatinine'', ''bilirubin'', and INR). The score is known as the MELD (model of end stage ''liver disease'') score in adults and PELD (pediatric end stage ''liver disease'') in children.''Patients with the highest scores are transplanted first. As they become more ill, their scores will increase and therefore their priority for transplant increases, allowing for the sickest patients to be transplanted first. A small group of patients who are critically ill from acute liver disease have the highest priority on the waiting list.''It is impossible to predict how long a patient will wait for a liver to become available. Your transplant coordinator is always available to discuss where you are on the waiting list.' "
Where does a liver for a transplant come from?,"'There are two types of liver transplant options: living donor transplant and deceased donor transplant.''Living donor liver transplants are an option for some patients with end-stage liver disease. This involves removing a segment of liver from a ''healthy living'' donor and implanting it into a recipient. Both the donor and recipient liver segments will grow to normal size in a few weeks to months.''The donor, who may be a blood relative, spouse, or friend, will have extensive medical and psychological evaluations to ensure the lowest possible risk. Blood type and body size are critical factors in determining who is an appropriate donor.''Recipients for the living donor transplant must be active on the transplant waiting list. Their health must also be stable enough to undergo transplantation with excellent chances of success.''In deceased donor liver transplant, the donor may be a victim of an accident or ''head injury'"". The donor's heart is still beating, but the brain has stopped functioning. Such a person is considered legally dead, because his or her brain has permanently and irreversibly stopped working. At this point, the donor is usually in an intensive-care unit.""""The identity of a deceased donor and circumstances surrounding the person's death are kept confidential.""'Screening for Liver Transplant Donors''Hospitals will evaluate all potential liver transplant donors for evidence of liver disease, alcohol or ''drug abuse'', ''cancer'', or infection. Donors will also be tested for hepatitis, ''AIDS'', and other infections. If this screening does not reveal problems with the liver, donors and recipients are matched according to blood type and body size. Age, race, and sex are not considered.''The transplant team will discuss your transplantation options with you at the time of your pre-transplant evaluation, or you can contact the transplant team for more information.' "
What happens when they find a liver transplant match?,"'When a liver has been identified for you, a transplant coordinator will contact you by telephone or by pager. Make sure that you do not eat or drink anything once you have been called to the hospital. The transplant coordinator will notify you of any additional instructions. When you arrive at the hospital, additional blood tests, an ''electrocardiogram'', and a ''chest X-ray'' will generally be taken before the operation. You also may meet with the anesthesiologist and a surgical resident. If the donor liver is found to be acceptable you will proceed with the transplant. If not, you will be sent home to continue waiting.' "
What happens during the liver transplant operation?,"'Liver transplants usually take from six hours to 12 hours. During the operation, surgeons will remove your liver and will replace it with the donor liver. Because a transplant operation is a major procedure, surgeons will need to place several tubes in your body. These tubes are necessary to help your body carry out certain functions during the operation and for a few days afterward.' A tube will be placed through your mouth into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe during the liver transplant operation and for the first day or two following the operation. The tube is attached to a ventilator that will expand your lungs mechanically. A nasogastric (N/G) tube will be inserted through your nose into your stomach. The N/G tube will drain secretions from your stomach and it will remain in place for a few days until your bowel function returns to normal. A tube called a catheter will be placed in your bladder to drain urine. This will be removed a few days after the operation. Three tubes may be placed in your abdomen to drain blood and fluid from around the liver. These will remain in place for about one week. In some cases, the surgeon will place a special tube, called a T-tube, in your bile duct. The T-tube will drain bile into a small pouch outside of your body so it can be measured several times daily. Only certain transplant patients receive a T-tube, which remains in place for 
four to five months. The tube causes no discomfort and does not interfere with daily activities."
What Complications Are Associated With Liver Transplantation?,"'Two of the most common complications following liver transplant are rejection and infection.''Your immune system works to destroy foreign substances that invade your body. The immune system, however, cannot distinguish between your transplanted liver and unwanted invaders, such as ''viruses'' and bacteria. Therefore, your immune system may attempt to attack and destroy your new liver. This is called a rejection episode. About 25% of all liver-transplant patients have some degree of organ rejection prior to discharge. Anti-rejection medications are given to ward off the immune attack. More than 80% of transplanted livers are still functioning at the end of the first year.''Because anti-rejection ''drugs'' that suppress your immune system are needed to prevent the liver from being rejected, you are at increased risk for infections. This problem diminishes as time passes. Not all patients have problems with infections, and most infections can be treated successfully as they occur.' "
What are antirejection medications?,"'After the liver transplant, you will receive medications called immunosuppressants. These medications slow or suppress your immune system to prevent it from rejecting your new liver. They may include ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''Cellcept'' (''mycophenolate mofetil''), ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', Kedral, ''Medrol'', Orasone, Prelone, Sterapred DS), ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral''), ''Prograf'' (a brand of ''tacrolimus'', also known as FK506), and ''Rapamune'' (''sirolimus''). You must take these drugs exactly as prescribed for the rest of your life.' "
When Will I Be Able to Go Home After a Liver Transplant?,"'The average hospital stay after liver transplant is 10 to 14 days. Some patients may be discharged in less time, while others may be in the hospital much longer, depending on complications that may arise. You need to be prepared for both possibilities.''To provide a smooth transition from hospital to home, the ''nursing'' staff and your transplant coordinator will begin to prepare you for discharge shortly after you are transferred from the intensive-care unit to the regular nursing floor. You will be given a discharge manual, which reviews much of what you will need to know before you go home.''You will learn how to take your new medications and how to monitor your own ''blood pressure'' and pulse. As you perform these functions regularly, you will become an important participant in your own healthcare. Before your discharge, you will also learn the signs of rejection and infection and will know when it is important to call your doctor.''Readmission after discharge is common, especially within the first year after transplantation. The admission is usually for treatment of a rejection episode or infection.' "
What follow-up is necessary after a liver transplant?,"'Your first return appointment after a liver transplant will generally be scheduled about one week after discharge and regularly scheduled intervals after that. During these visits, you will see the transplant surgeon, and/or transplant hepatologist and the transplant coordinator. If needed, a social worker or a member of the psychiatric team may also be available.''All patients return to their transplant hospital approximately five months after the transplant. If a T-tube was inserted during the operation, it will be removed by the transplant surgeon at this time.''All patients are scheduled to return to the hospital at their one-year transplant anniversary date and annually thereafter.''Your primary care doctor should be notified when you receive your transplant and when you are discharged. Though most problems related to the transplant will need to be taken care of at the transplant hospital, your primary care doctor will remain an important part of your medical care.' "

What Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'"" with medication. But they aren't effective for about 30% of patients. In some cases, brain surgery may be an option.""'Epilepsy'' surgery is an operation on the brain to control ''seizures'"" and improve the person's quality of life. There are two main types of ""'epilepsy'' surgery:''Surgery is considered only if the area of the brain where the seizures start, called the ''seizure'' focus, can be clearly identified, and if the area to be removed is not responsible for any critical functions, such as language, sensation and movement. Extensive evaluation and testing are necessary to determine if surgery is appropriate.' Surgery to remove the area of the brain producing seizures. Surgery to interrupt the nerve pathways through which seizure impulses spread within the brain."
Who Is a Candidate for Epilepsy Surgery?,"""Surgery may be an option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are disabling and/or are not controlled by medication, or when the side effects of medication are severe and greatly affect the person's quality of life. Patients with other serious medical problems, such as ""'cancer'' or ''heart disease'', usually are not considered for epilepsy surgery.' "
What Surgical Options Are Available?,"'Different surgical procedures are available to treat epilepsy. The type of surgery used depends on the type of seizures and the area of the brain where the seizures start. The surgical options include:' Lobe resection: The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is located within the temporal lobe, is the most common type of epilepsy in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away, to remove the seizure focus. The anterior (front) and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are the areas most often involved. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy: This is surgery to remove isolated brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect such as a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that are responsible for seizure activity. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. 
 Corpus callosotomy: The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain. A corpus callosotomy is an operation in which all or part of this structure is cut, disabling communication between the hemispheres and preventing the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. This procedure, sometimes called split-brain surgery, is for patients with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and potentially serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy: This is a variation of a hemispherectomy, a radical procedure in which one entire hemisphere, or one half of the brain, is removed. With a functional hemispherectomy, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only a limited area of brain tissue is removed. This surgery generally is limited to children younger than 13 years old who have one hemisphere that is not functioning normally. Multiple subpial transection (MST): This procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact."
How Effective Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The effectiveness varies, depending on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. For others, the frequency of seizures is significantly reduced. In some cases, surgery may not be successful and a second surgery (re-operation) may be recommended. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more after surgery. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
What Are the Risks of Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The risks of epilepsy surgery include:' Risks associated with surgery: These include infection and bleeding, as well as the risk of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. Risk of neurological deficits: Surgery can worsen existing problems or create new problems with the way the brain functions. Neurological deficits include loss of functions such as vision, speech, memory or movement. Risk of surgery failure: Even with careful pre-surgical evaluation, surgery may not eliminate or reduce seizures. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure."
Re-operations,"'In some cases, isolated seizures may occur immediately following surgery. This does not necessarily mean the operation was not successful. Occasionally, a second operation, or re-operation, is needed to remove brain tissue that is later found to be a source of seizure activity.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is locked-in syndrome?,"'Locked-in syndrome is a rare situation in which a person is wakeful and aware but has quadriplegia and ''paralysis'' of the lower cranial nerves that does not allow the person to show facial expressions or make muscular movements such as moving limbs, swallowing, speaking, or ''breathing''. The affected person cannot communicate except by eye movements (blinking, and some patients may possess vertical eye movements). The patients, however, have the ability to see and hear and have normal intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Total locked-in syndrome occurs when the eyes are also paralyzed. Locked-in syndrome has also been termed cerebromedullospinal disconnection, de-efferented state, pseudocoma, and ventral pontine syndrome.' "
What causes locked-in syndrome?,"'Locked-in syndrome usually results from a brainstem hemorrhage or infarct resulting in quadriplegia and disruption of the lower cranial nerves. Other potential causes that can affect this part of the brainstem can include trauma, tumors, infection, loss of myelin (protective insulation of nerves), ''polymyositis'' (inflammation of the nerves), and other disorders such as ''ALS'' (''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'') or medication overdose.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of locked-in syndrome?,"'The signs and symptoms of locked-in syndrome are as follows:'   Quadriplegia and paralysis that is global except for vertical eye movements and blinking A coma-like condition (pseudocoma) where the patient only can respond or communicate with others by eye movements Unresponsiveness to painful stimuli (inability to withdraw an extremity from painful stimuli) No horizontal eye movements Cannot consciously chew food, swallow, breathe, speak, or move voluntary muscles Must rely on caregivers for most basic functions (body movements and hygiene, for example) Fully alert and aware of the environment Ability to see, hear, and have normal sleep-wake cycles Ability to think and reason normally"
How is locked-in syndrome diagnosed?,"'Locked-in syndrome may be difficult to diagnose in some patients initially because some patients may be comatose for a while and then develop locked-in syndrome; some patients with a new onset ''stroke'"" may resemble individuals with locked-in syndrome. The diagnosis can be missed if eye movement (vertical and blinking) is not assessed in seemingly unresponsive patients. Evidence for locked-in syndrome can be seen with MRI imaging of the specific brain area that shows damage. In addition, PET and SPECT brain scans can further assess the patient's abnormality. About half of patients with locked-in syndrome are discovered (diagnosed) by family members that realize the patient is aware and able to respond (communicate), usually with their eye movements. Other tests such as EEGs show normal ""'sleep''-wake patterns.' "
What is the treatment for locked-in syndrome?,"'There is no specific treatment for locked-in syndrome. Supportive care is the main treatment for locked-in syndrome. Supportive care includes the following:''Infrequently, treatment of the underlying cause such as shrinking a ''tumor'"" or rapidly treating a medical overdose may improve the patient's condition."" Breathing support Good nutrition Preventing complications of immobilization such as lung infections, urinary tract infections, and blood clot formation Preventing pressure ulcers Physical therapy to prevent contractures Speech therapy to help in developing communication via eye blinks and/or eye vertical movements Possibly, computer terminal control linked to the patient's eye movements"
Is recovery from locked-in syndrome possible?,"'Depending upon the cause (for example, transient blood loss to the brainstem), rarely, a person may recover, although complete recovery is highly unusual. The majority of patients with this syndrome do not recover although they may learn to communicate using eye movements.' "
What statistics are associated with locked-in syndrome?,"""About half of all patients with locked-in syndrome are initially found to be aware and able to communicate with others by family members who visit the patient regularly and communicate to the patient's physicians that they suspect the patient is conscious and aware of their surroundings. The other half of patients are diagnosed by their physicians. Although locked-in syndrome can affect anyone at any age, it is most often seen in adults that are at higher risk for brain strokes and bleeding problems. The number of those affected by locked-in syndrome is unknown, because it is rare and often either misdiagnosed or not recognized."" "
What is the prognosis with locked-in syndrome?,"'The prognosis of patients with locked-in syndrome varies from fair to poor. Those patients that are diagnosed early and get supportive care that includes development of ways to communicate with other people usually do better than those diagnosed at a later time (sometimes months to years later). Patients that learn to communicate may have a survival rate of 80% after 10 years.''The majority of patients with locked-in syndrome do not recover functionality; most will be entirely dependent upon caregivers for most of their basic functions (feeding, cleaning, changing positions in bed, for example). Rarely, the patient may recover some basic functionality.' "
Can locked-in syndrome be prevented?,"'Prevention'' of trauma that leads to locked-in syndrome is possible, but difficult to predict. Avoiding lifestyles that lead to ''coronary artery disease'' which, in turn, can result in strokes may prevent locked-in syndrome in some patients; but because this syndrome is rare, there are little or no data to support this speculation.'

What is locked-in syndrome?,"'Locked-in syndrome is a rare situation in which a person is wakeful and aware but has quadriplegia and ''paralysis'' of the lower cranial nerves that does not allow the person to show facial expressions or make muscular movements such as moving limbs, swallowing, speaking, or ''breathing''. The affected person cannot communicate except by eye movements (blinking, and some patients may possess vertical eye movements). The patients, however, have the ability to see and hear and have normal intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Total locked-in syndrome occurs when the eyes are also paralyzed. Locked-in syndrome has also been termed cerebromedullospinal disconnection, de-efferented state, pseudocoma, and ventral pontine syndrome.' "
What causes locked-in syndrome?,"'Locked-in syndrome usually results from a brainstem hemorrhage or infarct resulting in quadriplegia and disruption of the lower cranial nerves. Other potential causes that can affect this part of the brainstem can include trauma, tumors, infection, loss of myelin (protective insulation of nerves), ''polymyositis'' (inflammation of the nerves), and other disorders such as ''ALS'' (''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'') or medication overdose.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of locked-in syndrome?,"'The signs and symptoms of locked-in syndrome are as follows:'   Quadriplegia and paralysis that is global except for vertical eye movements and blinking A coma-like condition (pseudocoma) where the patient only can respond or communicate with others by eye movements Unresponsiveness to painful stimuli (inability to withdraw an extremity from painful stimuli) No horizontal eye movements Cannot consciously chew food, swallow, breathe, speak, or move voluntary muscles Must rely on caregivers for most basic functions (body movements and hygiene, for example) Fully alert and aware of the environment Ability to see, hear, and have normal sleep-wake cycles Ability to think and reason normally"
How is locked-in syndrome diagnosed?,"'Locked-in syndrome may be difficult to diagnose in some patients initially because some patients may be comatose for a while and then develop locked-in syndrome; some patients with a new onset ''stroke'"" may resemble individuals with locked-in syndrome. The diagnosis can be missed if eye movement (vertical and blinking) is not assessed in seemingly unresponsive patients. Evidence for locked-in syndrome can be seen with MRI imaging of the specific brain area that shows damage. In addition, PET and SPECT brain scans can further assess the patient's abnormality. About half of patients with locked-in syndrome are discovered (diagnosed) by family members that realize the patient is aware and able to respond (communicate), usually with their eye movements. Other tests such as EEGs show normal ""'sleep''-wake patterns.' "
What is the treatment for locked-in syndrome?,"'There is no specific treatment for locked-in syndrome. Supportive care is the main treatment for locked-in syndrome. Supportive care includes the following:''Infrequently, treatment of the underlying cause such as shrinking a ''tumor'"" or rapidly treating a medical overdose may improve the patient's condition."" Breathing support Good nutrition Preventing complications of immobilization such as lung infections, urinary tract infections, and blood clot formation Preventing pressure ulcers Physical therapy to prevent contractures Speech therapy to help in developing communication via eye blinks and/or eye vertical movements Possibly, computer terminal control linked to the patient's eye movements"
Is recovery from locked-in syndrome possible?,"'Depending upon the cause (for example, transient blood loss to the brainstem), rarely, a person may recover, although complete recovery is highly unusual. The majority of patients with this syndrome do not recover although they may learn to communicate using eye movements.' "
What statistics are associated with locked-in syndrome?,"""About half of all patients with locked-in syndrome are initially found to be aware and able to communicate with others by family members who visit the patient regularly and communicate to the patient's physicians that they suspect the patient is conscious and aware of their surroundings. The other half of patients are diagnosed by their physicians. Although locked-in syndrome can affect anyone at any age, it is most often seen in adults that are at higher risk for brain strokes and bleeding problems. The number of those affected by locked-in syndrome is unknown, because it is rare and often either misdiagnosed or not recognized."" "
What is the prognosis with locked-in syndrome?,"'The prognosis of patients with locked-in syndrome varies from fair to poor. Those patients that are diagnosed early and get supportive care that includes development of ways to communicate with other people usually do better than those diagnosed at a later time (sometimes months to years later). Patients that learn to communicate may have a survival rate of 80% after 10 years.''The majority of patients with locked-in syndrome do not recover functionality; most will be entirely dependent upon caregivers for most of their basic functions (feeding, cleaning, changing positions in bed, for example). Rarely, the patient may recover some basic functionality.' "
Can locked-in syndrome be prevented?,"'Prevention'' of trauma that leads to locked-in syndrome is possible, but difficult to predict. Avoiding lifestyles that lead to ''coronary artery disease'' which, in turn, can result in strokes may prevent locked-in syndrome in some patients; but because this syndrome is rare, there are little or no data to support this speculation.'

What is tetanus?,"'Tetanus is an acute, often-fatal disease of the nervous system that is caused by nerve toxins produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium tetani''. This bacterium is found throughout the world in the soil and in animal and human ''intestines''. The bacterium can also lay dormant in its spore form for years before becoming activated and developing into a regularly reproducing bacterium.'  "
Where do tetanus bacteria grow in the body?,"'Contaminated wounds are sites where tetanus bacteria multiply. Deep wounds or those with dead tissue are particularly prone to tetanus infection.''Puncture wounds'', such as those caused by nails, splinters, or ''insect bites'', are favorite locations of entry for the bacteria. The bacteria can also be introduced through ''burns'', any break in the skin, and injection-drug sites. Tetanus can also be a hazard to both the mother and ''newborn'' child (by means of the uterus after delivery and through the umbilical cord stump).''The potent toxin that is produced when the tetanus bacteria multiply is the major cause of harm from tetanus.' "
How does the tetanus toxin cause damage to the body?,"'The tetanus toxin affects the interaction between the nerve and the muscle that it stimulates, specifically at the neuromuscular junction. The tetanus toxin amplifies the chemical signal from the nerve to the muscle, which causes the muscles to tighten up in a continuous (""tetanic"" or ""tonic"") contraction or spasm. This results in either localized or generalized ''muscle spasms''. Tetanus toxin can affect neonates to cause muscle spasms, inability to nurse, and ''seizures''. This typically occurs within the first two weeks after birth and can be associated with poor sanitation methods in caring for the umbilical cord stump of the neonate. Of note, because of tetanus vaccination programs, first introduced in the late 1940s, tetanus infection rates have dropped substantially. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, there have only been three cases of ''neonatal'' tetanus reported in the U.S. since 2000. In each of these cases, the mothers were incompletely immunized. Unfortunately, throughout the world, tetanus is still common. In 2014, there were over 2,000 cases of neonatal tetanus and over 9,000 cases of non-neonatal tetanus. In comparison, there were 114,000 overall cases reported in 1980.' "
What is the incubation period for tetanus?,"""The incubation period between exposure to the bacteria in a contaminated wound and development of the initial symptoms of tetanus ranges from two days to two months, but it's commonly within 14 days of injury."" "
What is the course of tetanus? What are tetanus symptoms and signs?,"'During a one- to seven-day period, progressive muscle spasms caused by the tetanus toxin in the immediate wound area may progress to involve the entire body in a set of continuous muscle contractions. Restlessness, ''headache'', and irritability are common.''The tetanus neurotoxin causes the muscles to tighten up into a continuous (""tetanic"" or ""tonic"") contraction or spasm. The jaw is ""locked"" by muscle spasms, giving the name ""lockjaw"" (also called ""trismus""). Muscles throughout the body are affected, including the vital muscles necessary for normal ''breathing''. When the breathing muscles lose their power, breathing becomes difficult or impossible and death can occur without life-support measures (mechanical ventilation). Even with breathing support, infections of the airways within the ''lungs'' can lead to death.'  "
Is tetanus contagious?,"'Tetanus is not ''contagious''. You cannot ""catch"" tetanus from another infected individual. That means one person cannot be infected by another individual by coming in contact with secretions or other exposures. The bacterial spores must enter a wound to develop into an infection.' "
What is the treatment for tetanus?,"'General measures to treat the sources of the bacterial infection with antibiotics and drainage are carried out in the hospital while the patient is monitored for any signs of compromised breathing muscles. Treatment is directed toward stopping toxin production, neutralizing its effects, and controlling muscle spasms. Sedation is often given for ''muscle spasm'', which can lead to life-threatening breathing difficulty.''In more severe cases, breathing assistance with an artificial respirator machine may be needed.''The toxin already circulating in the body is neutralized with antitoxin ''drugs''. The tetanus toxin causes no permanent damage to the nervous system after the patient recovers.''After recovery, patients still require active immunization because having the tetanus disease does not provide natural immunization against a repeat episode.'  "
"How is tetanus diagnosed, and what is the prognosis of tetanus?","'The diagnosis of tetanus is made clinically, based on a patient\'s history of exposure such as stepping on a rusty nail in the backyard, and by the symptoms present, such as ""lockjaw,"" ''difficulty swallowing'', ''fever'', and generalized muscle spasms.''Once diagnosed and treated, the prognosis is generally good if the patient receives appropriate care early in the illness. The toxin does no permanent damage, and patients who receive appropriate supportive care generally recover. Sometimes symptoms develop rapidly, and some people live in remote areas where they are not able to receive appropriate care and are at a higher risk of death from tetanus.' "
Is it possible to prevent tetanus?,"'Active immunization (""tetanus ''vaccine''"") plays an essential role in preventing tetanus. Preventative measures to protect the skin from being penetrated by the tetanus bacteria are also important. For instance, precautions should be taken to avoid stepping on nails by wearing shoes. If a penetrating wound should occur, it should be thoroughly cleansed with soap and water and medical attention should be sought. Finally, passive immunization can be administered in selected cases (with specialized immunoglobulin).' "
What is the schedule for active immunization (tetanus shots)?,"'All'' children should be immunized against tetanus by receiving a series of five DTaP vaccinations, which generally are started at 2 months of age and completed at approximately 5 years of age. Booster vaccination is recommended at 11 years of age with Tdap.''Follow-up booster vaccination is recommended every 10 years thereafter. While a 10-year period of protection exists after the basic childhood series is completed, should a potentially contaminated wound occur, an ""early"" booster may be given in selected cases and the 10-year ""clock"" resets.'  "
What are the side effects of tetanus immunization?,"'Side effects of tetanus immunization occur in approximately 25% of vaccine recipients. The most frequent side effects are usually quite mild (and familiar) and include soreness, swelling, and/or redness at the site of the injection. More significant reactions are extraordinarily rare. The incidence of this particular reaction increases with decreasing interval between boosters.' "
What is passive immunization (by way of specialized immunoglobulin)?,"'In individuals who exhibit the early symptoms of tetanus or in those whose immunization status is unknown or significantly out of date, the tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is given into the muscle surrounding the wound with the remainder of the dose given into the buttocks.' "
What is Loeys-Dietz syndrome?,"'Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a recently-described connective tissue disorder with features similar to those of ''Marfan syndrome'', and the vascular type of ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome''. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is primarily characterized by aortic aneurysms (weakened outpouchings of the ''aorta'', the main artery in the body) in children. In Loeys-Dietz syndrome, the aortic aneurysms are prone to rupture at a smaller size than other aneurysms, putting children with Loeys-Dietz at great risk for dying if the ''aneurysm'' is not identified and treated early. ''The syndrome is named for pediatric geneticist Harry Dietz, director of the ''William S. Smilow Center for Marfan Syndrome Research at Johns Hopkins University'' and his colleague, Bart Loeys, who characterized the genetic and physical markers of the syndrome together with Dr. Dietz. '  "
What are the signs and symptoms of Loeys-Dietz syndrome?,"'Aortic aneurysms and abnormal organization of blood vessels (widespread tortuosity of the arteries in locations other than the aorta) are the hallmarks of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, but many affected children have characteristic physical and facial features that may be the first abnormality to be recognized. Recently, LDS has been subdivided into two types, LDS type I (LDSI) and type II (LDSII), signaling the presence or the absence of cranio-facial involvement, respectively. ''The craniofacial characteristics of Loeys-Dietz syndrome include early fusion of the skull bones (known as craniosynostosis), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and ''cleft palate'' or split uvula. In some individuals with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, other physical abnormalities have been noted, including defects at birth in the ''heart'' and brain, ''osteoporosis'' (weak bones), skin changes (such as translucent skin and/or ''easy bruising''), and defects of the spine or chest. It is important to note that the severity of the visible physical characteristics varies widely among affected individuals, but the danger of rupture of aneurysms remains the same no matter how severe or mild the physical characteristics are. ''In many cases pediatricians may be able to recognize the characteristic facial features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and on this basis suggest further evaluation for the presence of aortic aneurysms and vascular irregularities. Other people with the syndrome are recognized when they seek medical assistance for other reasons, such as ''heart murmurs'' or a family history of Marfan syndrome or another condition that may cause aortic aneurysms.'  "
Is Loeys-Dietz syndrome inherited?,"'Loeys-Dietz syndrome is inherited, meaning that it is a genetic syndrome that tends to run in families. The mutated abnormal gene that causes Loeys-Dietz syndrome is dominant, and only one parent needs pass the gene to a child in order for the syndrome to develop. (This is in contrast to recessive syndromes in which each parent must pass the gene to a child in order for the syndrome to develop.) A report published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' in August, 2006, reported that 52 affected families (with a total of 90 affected individuals) had been identified. ' "
What causes Loeys-Dietz syndrome?,"'The cause of Loeys-Dietz syndrome has been determined recently. TGF-beta is a signaling molecule produced in the body that influences the growth, movement, and activity of cells as well as the death of cells by changing the way many genes within the cells are expressed. TGF-beta brings about the changes within cells by binding to receptors on the surfaces of the cells. . Loeys-Dietz syndrome is known to be a result of mutations in the TGF-beta-receptor I (TGFBR1) or II (TGFBR2) genes. The genetic mutations in Loeys-Dietz causes a change in the receptor that prevents TGF-beta from working on the cells. A test is available that can detect the genetic mutation associated with the syndrome; however, the test is not available in most laboratories.  ' "
How is Loeys-Dietz syndrome diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of aortic aneurysms, including those seen in the Loeys-Dietz syndrome, usually is made by injecting a dye that is visible by X-ray, ''computerized tomography'' (CT), or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') into the blood vessels. ''X-rays'' or scans by CT or MRI then are done that show the arteries and aneurysms (because the aneurysms are filled with dye-containing blood). Although aortic aneurysms are the hallmark of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome and the characteristic facial features may suggest the diagnosis, the definitive diagnosis of Loeys-Dietz Syndrome can only be established by the genetic test (described above). ' "
How is Loeys-Dietz syndrome treated?,"'The only treatment for Loeys-Dietz syndrome to prolong life expectancy is surgical repair of the ''aortic aneurysm''. Surgical repair of the aneurysms is generally successful. Since the aneurysms tend to rupture early, early and accurate diagnosis is critical to ensure that affected individuals receive prompt surgical treatment. The genetic test can be of value in identifying which individuals with aortic aneurysms have Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and therefore, should have immediate surgery. In contrast to Loeys-Dietz syndrome, in other inherited syndromes associated with aortic aneurysms, surgery carries a poorer prognosis, and the aneurysms can be managed with medications for a longer period of time before surgery becomes necessary. Studies are ongoing to determine whether drug treatment of the Loeys-Dietz syndrome also may be of value. ''At the time of diagnosis, imaging studies of the aorta are recommended and should be repeated after 6 months to determine if aortic enlargement is occurring. If the diameter of the aorta is not enlarging, yearly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the of the circulation from the barin to the pelvis are recommended, since affected persons commonly develop aneurysms that are treatable surgically.' "
What is LEEP?,"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), uses a low-voltage electrical current to remove abnormal tissues of the cervix. It has an advantage, therefore, over the destructive techniques (CO2 laser and cryocautery) in that an intact tissue sample for analysis can be obtained. LEEP also is popular because it is inexpensive, simple, and typically has few risks or side effects. LEEP is also known as large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ).''This procedure is used most often for treating moderate dysplasia (abnormal changes of the cells lining the cervix or precancers) that have been identified by ''colposcopy'' and/or ''cervical biopsy''. In certain situations, severe dysplasia and noninvasive ''cancer'' that are localized and can be removed may also be treated by LEEP.'  "
How is a LEEP done?,"'The patient lies on an examining table with the ''feet'' elevated in stirrups (the position used to obtain a ''Pap smear''). A speculum  (as used for the ''Pap test'') is inserted to open the vaginal walls. Sometimes a special solution, either vinegar (acetic acid) or ''iodine'', is applied to the cervix prior to the procedure, which makes the abnormal areas of tissue more recognizable).''The area is numbed using a local anesthetic (cervical block). Oral or intravenous medications to control ''pain'' may also be given. A low-voltage electrical current is delivered via a thin wire that is passed through tissues to remove the abnormal areas of the cervix. A chemical is applied afterwards to prevent bleeding. ''Mild ''pain'' and cramping that can be relieved by oral medications may occur for the first few hours following the procedure. ''Vaginal discharge'' and ''spotting'' commonly occur after this procedure for up to a few weeks. Sexual intercourse and tampons use should be avoided for several weeks to allow better healing. ''Douching'' should also be avoided.'  "
How effective is LEEP?,"'LEEP has been shown to be comparable to ''cryotherapy'', ''cold'' knife conization (surgical removal of the abnormal area), laser ablation (destruction of the abnormal tissue), and laser conization for the removal of abnormal or ''precancerous'' tissues of the cervix. Studies have shown that a majority of these methods result in a cure (removal of all the affected tissue).''Further treatment is not typically necessary if all of the abnormal area has been removed, although the precancerous changes may develop again (recur) at a later time. Regular follow-up Pap tests are required following LEEP to evaluate for possible recurrence of the cellular abnormalities.' "
What are complications of LEEP?,"'Complications occur in about a small percentage of women undergoing LEEP, including narrowing (stenosis) of the opening of the cervix, greater than expected amounts of bleeding, or infection of the cervix or uterus.'  "
What is grief?,"'Grief is the normal internal feeling one experiences in reaction to a loss, while bereavement is the state of experiencing that loss. Although people often suffer emotional ''pain'"" in response to loss of anything that is very important to them (for example, a job, a friendship or other relationship, one's sense of safety, a home), grief usually refers to the loss of a loved one through death. Grief is quite common, in that three out of four women outlive their spouse, with the average age of becoming a widow being 59 years. More than half of women in the United States are widowed by the time they reach age 65. Every year in the United States, 4% of children under the age of 15 experience the loss of a parent through death.""""Although not a formal medical diagnosis, prolonged grief, formerly called complicated grief, refers to a reaction to loss that lasts more than one year. It is characterized by the grief reaction intensifying to affect the sufferer's close relationships, disrupting his or her beliefs, and it tends to result in the bereaved experiencing ongoing longing for their deceased loved one. About 15% of bereaved individuals will suffer from complicated grief, and one-third of people already getting mental-health services have been found to suffer from this extended grief reaction.""'Anticipatory grief is defined as the feelings loved ones have in reaction to knowing that someone they care about is terminally ill. It occurs before the death of the afflicted loved one and can be an important part of the grieving process since this allows time for loved ones to say goodbye to the terminally ill individual, begin to settle affairs, and plan for the funeral or other rituals on behalf of the person who is dying.' "
What is mourning?,"""As opposed to grief, which refers to how someone may feel the loss of a loved one, mourning is the outward expression of that loss. Mourning usually involves culturally determined rituals that help mourners make sense of the end of their loved one's life and give structure to what can feel like a very confusing time. Therefore, while the internal ""'pain'' of grief is a more universal phenomenon, how people mourn is influenced by their personal, familial, cultural, religious, and societal beliefs and customs. Everything from how families prepare themselves and their loved ones for death, and understand and react to the passing to the practices for preserving memories of the deceased, their funeral or memorial, burial, cremation, or other ways of handling the remains of the deceased is influenced by internal and external factors.''The length of time for a formal mourning period and sometimes the amount of bereavement leave people are allowed to take from work is determined by a combination of personal, familial, cultural, religious, and societal factors. Mourning customs also affect how bereaved individuals may feel comfortable seeking support from others as well as the appropriate ways for their friends and family to express sympathy during this time. For example, cultures may differ greatly in how much or how little the aggrieved individual may talk about their loss with friends, family members, and coworkers and may determine whether or not participating in a bereavement support group or ''psychotherapy'' is acceptable.' "
What are the effects of losing a loved one?,"'The potential negative effects of a grief reaction can be significant. For example, research shows that about 40% of bereaved people will suffer from some form of ''anxiety disorder'' in the first year after the death of a loved one, and there can be up to a 70% increase in death risk of the surviving spouse within the first six months after the death of his or her partner. For these reasons, questionnaires that assess how much ''stress'' a person is experiencing usually place the loss of a loved one at the top of the list of the most serious stresses to endure.''When considering the death of a loved one, the effects of losing a pet should not be minimized. Pets are often considered another member of the family, and therefore their loss is grieved as well. Making the decision to euthanize (painlessly put to death) the family pet once a family works with their veterinarian to determine that the pet is suffering as a result of their age, specific illness, and/or general declining health can add ''stress'' to the bereavement process by leaving family members feeling guilty initially, but if done properly, can help families understand that they spared their beloved pet unnecessary suffering.'""In addition to grief as an initial reaction to loss, the process can be aggravated by events that remind the bereaved individuals of their loved one or the circumstances surrounding their loss. Such events are often referred to as grief triggers. Father's Day or the beginning of the school year may cause the parent who has lost a child (or a child who has lost a parent) to feel distraught. A shared song, television show, or activity can cause anguish by reminding the widower of the wife he lost or the child of the grandparent who is no longer living. Watching another child play with a pet may reduce a child whose pet has died to tears."" "
What are the causes and risk factors of prolonged grief?,"'The risk factors for experiencing more serious symptoms of grief for a longer period of time can be related to the physical and emotional health of the survivor before the loss, the relationship between the bereaved and their loved one, as well as to the nature of the death. For example, it is not uncommon for surviving loved ones who had a contentious or strained relationship, or otherwise unresolved issues with the deceased to suffer severe feelings of sorrow. Parents who have lost their child are at a significantly higher risk of divorce compared to couples who have not. They are also at increased risk for a decline in emotional health, including being psychiatrically hospitalized following the loss. This is a particular risk for mothers who have lost a child.''Bereaved individuals who have experienced an unexpected or violent death of a loved one may be at greater risk for suffering from mental disorders like major ''depression'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), or complicated grief. According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5''), the accepted diagnostic reference for ''mental health'' afflictions, major ''depression'' is a psychiatric disorder characterized by sadness and/or irritability that lasts at least two weeks in a row and is accompanied by a number of other symptoms, like problems with ''sleep'', appetite, weight, concentration, or energy level and may also lead to the sufferer experiencing unjustified guilt, losing interest in activities he or she used to enjoy, or thoughts of wanting to kill themselves or someone else.''PTSD refers to a condition that involves the sufferers enduring an experience that significantly threatened their sense of safety or well-being (for example, the ''suicide'' or homicide of a loved one), then re-experiencing the event through intrusive memories, physical or emotional reactions, ''nightmares'' or flashbacks (feeling as if the ''trauma'' is happening again at times when the sufferer is awake); developing a hypersensitivity to events that are normal (for example, being quite irritable, getting startled very easily, having trouble sleeping, or difficulty trusting others); avoiding things that remind the person of the traumatic event (for example, people, places, or things that the sufferer may associate with the death of their loved one) and developing or worsening negative ''moods'' or ways of thinking after the traumatic event (for example, trouble recalling an important aspect of the trauma, persistent negative beliefs, blaming oneself or others for the trauma, feeling detached from others, or persistent trouble experiencing positive emotions).''Being able to care for a dying loved one tends to promote the healing process for those who are left behind. That care can either be provided at home, in the hospital, or in ''hospice'' care. Hospice is a program or facility that provides special care for people whose health has declined to the point that they are near the end of their life. Such programs or facilities also provide special care for their families.' "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and stages of grief?","'Perhaps the most well-known model for understanding grief was developed by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, MD, in her 1969 book titled ''On Death and Dying''. The five stages of the grief cycle that she outlined are'""These stages also apply to the stages of dying, the grief associated with one's own death. She described the stage of denial as the bereaved having difficulty believing what has happened, the anger phase as the survivors questioning the fairness of the loss, the bargaining stage as wishing to make a deal with fate to gain more time with the one who was or will be lost, the depression stage as the period when the bereaved individuals get\xa0in touch with how very sad they are about losing their loved one, and acceptance as feeling some resolution to their grief and more ability to go on with their own life.""""Kübler-Ross apparently felt these phases can be applied to any significant personal loss (for example, of a job, relationship, one's own health, anticipating one's own death), as well as the death of a loved one. It also seems that she believed these stages don't all have to occur, can take place in different order, and can reoccur many times as part of an individual's specific grief process. Other grief experts describe seven stages of grieving, specifically""'The shock or disbelief stage is understood as the numbness often associated with initially receiving the news of the death of a loved one. The guilt stage of grief refers to feelings of regret about difficult aspects of the relationship with the deceased.''In addition to the emotional pain already discussed, symptoms of grief can be physical, social, cultural, or religious in nature. Physical symptoms can range from mild ''sleep'' or appetite problems to ''heart attack''. Social symptoms of bereavement include isolation from other loved ones and difficulty functioning at home, school, and/or at work.''For children and adolescents, reactions to the death of a parent or other loved one tend to be consistent with their reaction to any severe stress. Such reactions usually reflect the particular developmental stage of the child or adolescent. For example, since infants up to about 2 years of age cannot yet talk, their reaction to the loss of a loved one tends to involve crying and being more irritable or clingy. They further show physical symptoms of sleep or appetite problems, changes in activity level, and being more watchful of (vigilant toward) their surroundings.''Since preschoolers from 3 to 5 years of age begin to be able to remember the one who died but have not yet developed the ability to understand the permanence of death, they may believe they somehow magically caused the death and can make the person come back. In addition to showing signs of grief that are similar to those of infants, they may have more difficulty separating from caregivers.''Early school-aged children, from 6 to 8 years of age, more likely understand that death is permanent compared to younger children, often feel guilt about the death of the loved one, become preoccupied with memories about the departed, and try to master the loss they have suffered by talking about it frequently. While symptoms of grief in school-aged children from 9 to 11 years of age are quite similar to those of early school-aged children, this older group is more vulnerable to a decrease in self-esteem because they feel different from their peers if they have experienced the loss of a loved one. They are also more prone to defend against their feelings of sorrow by becoming engrossed in school, social, and/or extracurricular activities.''In keeping with their budding need for independence, young adolescents 12 to 14 years of age may experience mixed feelings about the deceased individual and exhibit a wide range of emotions. They may avoid talking about the loss. Older ''teens'' usually experience grief similarly to adults, enduring sadness, ''anxiety'', and anger. They tend to deny their feelings of loss to parents but discuss them in detail with peers. For children, adolescents, and adults, as with any major stress, grief may cause a person to regress emotionally, in that they go back to former, often less mature ways of thinking, behaving, and coping.''Symptoms of complicated grief include intense emotion and longings for the deceased, severely intrusive thoughts about the lost loved one, extreme feelings of isolation and emptiness, avoiding doing things that bring back memories of the departed, new or worsened ''sleeping problems'', and having no interest in activities that the sufferer used to enjoy. Teens tend to react to the loss of a loved one that died through ''suicide'' similarly to the ways in which adults experience complicated grief, but it is noteworthy that their lack of life experience to draw strength from and high level of involvement with their peers may make teens more vulnerable to contemplating suicide themselves when a loved one commits suicide. Mental health professionals often refer to this type of vulnerability as contagion.''Regardless of age, individuals who lose a loved one from suicide are more at risk for becoming preoccupied with the reason for the suicide while wanting to deny or hide the cause of death, wondering if they could have prevented it, feeling blamed for the problems that preceded the suicide, feeling rejected by their loved one, and stigmatized by others.' denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. shock or disbelief, denial, bargaining, guilt, anger, depression, acceptance/hope."
How do health care professionals assess grief?,"'Although practitioners sometimes use paper and pencil survey tests to determine if a person is suffering from grief, the assessment is usually made by the health care professional asking questions to assess what symptoms an individual is experiencing, then considering whether he or she is suffering from normal grief, complicated grief, or some other issue. Those questions tend to explore whether there are emotional, physical, and/or social symptoms of grief, and if so, how severe and how long the symptoms have been present. The practitioner may also try to determine what stages of the grief process the person has experienced and what stage currently dominates his or her feelings at the time of the assessment.' "
How can people cope with grief?,"'There remains some controversy about how to best help people survive the loss of a loved one. While many forms of support are available and do help certain individuals, little scientific research has shown clear benefits for any particular approach for grief reactions in general. That is thought to be because each approach to support is so different that it is hard to scientifically compare one to another, intervention procedures are not consistently reported in publications, and the ways these interventions have been studied are flawed. Although there has been some concern that grief counseling for uncomplicated grief sufferers works against bereavement recovery, there is research to the contrary. One approach to treating grief is the dual process model, which endorses the bereavement process as being the dynamic struggle between the pain of the death of the loved one (loss-oriented) and recovery (restoration-oriented). This model of treatment recommends that bereaved individuals alternate between directly working on their loss (confrontation) and taking a break from (avoidance) that process when appropriate. For couples who are grieving the occurrence of a ''miscarriage'', brief professional counseling has been found to be helpful.'""Quite valuable tips for journaling as an effective way of managing bereavement rather than just stirring up painful feelings are provided by the Center for Journal Therapy. While encouraging those who choose to write a journal to apply no strict rules to the process, some of the ideas encouraged include limiting the time journaling to 15 minutes per day or less to decrease the likelihood of worsening grief, writing how one imagines his or her life will be a year from the date of the loss, and clearly identifying feelings to allow for easier tracking of the individual's grieving process.""'To help children and adolescents cope emotionally with the death of a friend or family member, it is important to ensure they receive consistent caretaking and frequent interaction with supportive adults. For children of school age and older, appropriate participation in school, social, and extracurricular activities is necessary to a successful resolution of grief. For adolescents, maintaining positive relationships with peers becomes important in helping teens figure out how to deal with grief. Depending on the adolescent, they even may find interactions with peers and family more helpful than formal sources of support like their school counselor. All children and teens can benefit from being reassured that they did not cause their loved one to die, and such reassurance can go a long way toward lessening the developmentally appropriate tendency children and adolescents have for blaming themselves and any angry feelings they may have harbored against their lost loved one for the death.'""Effective coping tips for grieving are nearly as different and numerous as there are bereaved individuals. The bereaved individual's caring for him/herself through continuing nutritious and regular eating habits, getting extra rest, and communicating with surviving friends and family members are some ways for grief sufferers to ease the grief process. The use of supportive structure can also go a long way to helping aggrieved individuals come to terms with their loss. Anything from reciting comforting prayers or affirmations, to returning to established meal and bedtimes, as well as returning to work or school routines can help grieving individuals regain a sense of normalcy in their lives. As death involves the loss of an imperfect relationship involving imperfect individuals, forgiveness of the faults of the lost loved one and of the inherently imperfect relationship between the bereaved and the deceased can go a long way toward healing for the bereaved. While the painful aspects of dealing with death are clear, bereavement sometimes also leads to enhanced personal development.""  "
What are the legal issues associated with dying and death?,"'To appreciate the legal aspects of death and dying, it may help to understand death and the process of dying. In order to declare (pronounce) a person as having died, a physician performs a physical examination to assess that the person shows signs of death, such as the absence of ''breathing'' and heartbeat, and the individual does not respond in any way to pain. The doctor then completes a death certificate, which indicates the name, date of birth, and date of death, as well as the location of death and its immediate cause, like stopped breathing (''respiration'') or ''heart'' (cardiac) functioning and the medical condition that is thought to have resulted in the cause of death (for example, infection, ''cancer'', ''diabetes'', bleeding from being shot).'""Consulting with a legal expert, such as an attorney, is advisable when either planning for or managing the legal matters associated with a death. Some of the major legal issues involved with dying include the person's right to have informed consent to receive or refuse treatment, advance directives, establishing a living will, and making funeral arrangements, if desired. Informed consent, which is required by law for every patient or patient's guardian to give, is the responsibility of treating practitioners to provide that opportunity to patients. It involves the doctor or other health professional explaining to the patient and/or patient's legal guardian the options for treatment of whatever condition from which the individual suffers, the possible benefits as well as risks for each treatment, and why the health professional may be recommending one treatment over another. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the professional to let their patient know that they have the right to choose whatever treatment they want or to choose to refuse treatment. Particularly when discussing chronic or terminal illness, conditions over which there is little control over the ultimate outcome of care provided, having the individuals and their family feel as much control over their treatment options as possible is of great importance.""'Advance directives are those decisions individuals would like to express to their family and treating professionals prior to potentially becoming no longer able to communicate their wishes prior to death. Examples of advance directives include what, if any, forms of life support the individuals would like to receive to maintain their life, as well as what ""heroic"" or aggressive interventions, if any, they would like made immediately should their heart or breathing stop. Getting food and liquids through a tube, having their breathing or heart rate performed by a machine, and opting for palliative care (care that will address pain and otherwise make them comfortable rather than try to cure them) are choices individuals often consider\xa0in terms of what they want done or not done to maintain their life. In the event that individuals express\xa0a desire to have no heroic or aggressive medical interventions made should their heartbeat or breathing stop, a do not resuscitate order (DNR) is indicated in their medical chart. Opting for such an order is by no means a request to stop all medical treatment. In other words, managing any condition other than actual loss of life (for example, infections, ''anemia'') will continue. Another important example of an advanced directive is whether or not the dying individual would like to be considered as a possible organ donor.'""In order to have their medical and financial wishes carried out, it is important for individuals to name a health proxy, someone trusted to make decisions that are in keeping with the individual's in the event that those wishes are unknown and the person can no longer express his or her wishes. In order to formally appoint a health proxy, an attorney must write a durable ""'power of attorney'"", the legal document appointing the health proxy. In addition to having that document signed, witnessed and notarized, a copy of it must be placed in the individual's medical chart.""""Similar to the medical power of attorney, a durable power of attorney of finances can be helpful to establish who would be in charge of the person's finances if she or he were living but unable to be in charge of their own financial matters.""'Last but not least, if the individual has any strong preferences regarding a funeral or whether his or her remains are buried or cremated, making those wishes known in writing can prevent placing the burden of those decisions on surviving family members, who may struggle with agreeing on these issues, particularly as they grieve the loss of their loved one. As painful as it is to watch a loved one die and as difficult as it may be to talk about their death with them before it happens, many are the families who suffer even more than need be because steps are not taken to address these important legal issues.'

"
What is ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)?,"'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare group of neurological diseases that mainly involve the nerve cells (neurons) responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. Voluntary muscles produce movements like chewing, ''walking'', ''breathing'' and talking. The disease is progressive, meaning the symptoms get worse over time. Currently, there is no cure for ALS and no effective treatment to halt, or reverse, the progression of the disease.''ALS belongs to a wider group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases, which are caused by gradual deterioration (degeneration) and death of motor neurons. Motor neurons are nerve cells that extend from the brain to the spinal cord and to muscles throughout the body. These motor neurons initiate and provide vital communication links between the brain and the voluntary muscles.''Messages from motor neurons in the brain (called upper motor neurons) are transmitted to motor neurons in the spinal cord and to motor nuclei of brain (called lower motor neurons) and from the spinal cord and motor nuclei of brain to a particular muscle or muscles.''In ALS, both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die, and stop sending messages to the muscles. Unable to function, the muscles gradually weaken, start to twitch (called fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). Eventually, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements.''Early symptoms of ALS usually include muscle weakness or stiffness. Gradually all muscles under voluntary control are affected, and individuals lose their strength and the ability to speak, eat, move, and even breathe.''Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from when the symptoms first appear. However, about 10 percent of people with ALS survive for 10 or more years.'  "
What are the early symptoms of ALS?,"'The onset of ALS can be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked but gradually these symptoms develop into more obvious weakness or atrophy that may cause a physician to suspect ALS. Some of the early symptoms include:''When symptoms begin in the arms or legs, it is referred to as “limb onset” ALS. Other individuals first notice speech or ''swallowing problems'', termed “bulbar onset” ALS.'   fasciculations (muscle twitches) in the arm, leg, shoulder, or tongue muscle cramps tight and stiff muscles (spasticity) muscle weakness affecting an arm, a leg, neck or diaphragm. slurred and nasal speech difficulty chewing or swallowing. For many individuals the first sign of ALS may appear in the hand or arm as they experience difficulty with simple tasks such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock. In other cases, symptoms initially affect one of the legs, and people experience awkwardness when walking or running or they notice that they are tripping or stumbling more often."
What are the later symptoms of ALS?,"'Regardless of where the symptoms first appear, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals may develop problems with moving, swallowing (''dysphagia''), speaking or forming words (''dysarthria''), and breathing (dyspnea).''Although the sequence of emerging symptoms and the rate of disease progression vary from person to person, eventually individuals will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms.''Individuals with ALS usually have ''difficulty swallowing'' and chewing food, which makes it hard to eat normally and increases the risk of choking. They also ''burn'' calories at a faster rate than most people without ALS. Due to these factors, people with ALS tend to ''lose weight'' rapidly and can become malnourished.''Because people with ALS usually retain their ability to perform higher mental processes such as reasoning, remembering, understanding, and problem solving, they are aware of their progressive loss of function and may become anxious and ''depressed''.''A small percentage of individuals may experience problems with language or decision-making, and there is growing evidence that some may even develop a form of ''dementia'' over time.''Individuals with ALS will have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. They eventually lose the ability to breathe on their own and must depend on a ventilator. Affected individuals also face an increased risk of ''pneumonia'' during later stages of the disease. Besides ''muscle cramps'' that may cause discomfort, some individuals with ALS may develop painful neuropathy (nerve disease or damage).' "
How common is ALS? Who gets the disease?,"'In 2016 the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' estimated that between 14,000 - 15,000 Americans have ALS. ALS is a common neuromuscular disease worldwide. It affects people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.''There are several potential risk factors for ALS including:''The majority of ALS cases (90 percent or more) are considered sporadic. This means the disease seems to occur at random with no clearly associated risk factors and no family history of the disease. Although family members of people with sporadic ALS are at an increased risk for the disease, the overall risk is very low and most will not develop ALS.''About 5 to 10 percent of all ALS cases are familial, which means that an individual inherits the disease from his or her parents. The familial form of ALS usually only requires one parent to carry the gene responsible for the disease. Mutations in more than a dozen genes have been found to cause familial ALS. About 25 to 40 percent of all familial cases (and a small percentage of sporadic cases) are caused by a defect in a gene known as “chromosome 9 open reading frame 72,” or C9ORF72. Interestingly, the same mutation can be associated with atrophy of frontal-temporal lobes of the brain causing frontal-temporal lobe ''dementia''. Some individuals carrying this mutation may show signs of both motor neuron and ''dementia'' symptoms (ALS-FTD). Another 12 to 20 percent of familial cases result from mutations in the gene that provides instructions for the production of the enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).' Age. Although the disease can strike at any age, symptoms most commonly develop between the ages of 55 and 75. Gender. Men are slightly more likely than women to develop ALS. However, as age the difference between men and women disappears. Race and ethnicity. Most likely to develop the disease are Caucasians and non-Hispanics. Some studies suggest that military veterans are about 1.5 to 2 times more likely to develop ALS. Although the reason for this is unclear, possible risk factors for veterans include exposure to lead, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. ALS is recognized as a service-connected disease by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs."
What causes ALS? Is it inherited?,"'The cause of ALS is not known, and scientists do not yet know why ALS strikes some people and not others. However, evidence from scientific studies suggests that both genetics and environment play a role in the development of ALS.''An important step toward determining ALS risk factors was made in 1993 when scientists supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) discovered that mutations in the SOD1 gene were associated with some cases of familial ALS. Although it is still not clear how mutations in the SOD1 gene lead to motor neuron degeneration, there is increasing evidence that the gene playing a role in producing mutant SOD1 protein can become toxic.''Since then, more than a dozen additional genetic mutations have been identified, many through NINDS-supported research, and each of these gene discoveries is providing new insights into possible mechanisms of ALS.''The discovery of certain genetic mutations involved in ALS suggests that changes in the processing of RNA molecules may lead to ALS-related motor neuron degeneration. RNA molecules are one of the major macromolecules in the cell involved in directing the synthesis of specific proteins as well as gene regulation and activity.''Other gene mutations indicate defects in the natural process in which malfunctioning proteins are broken down and used to build new ones, known as protein recycling. Still others point to possible defects in the structure and shape of motor neurons, as well as increased susceptibility to environmental toxins. Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that a number of cellular defects can lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS.''In 2011 another important discovery was made when scientists found that a defect in the C9ORF72 gene is not only present in a significant subset of individuals with ALS but also in some people with a type of ''frontotemporal dementia'' (FTD). This observation provides evidence for genetic ties between these two neurodegenerative disorders. Most researchers now believe ALS and some forms of FTD are related disorders.''In searching for the cause of ALS, researchers are also studying the impact of environmental factors. Researchers are investigating a number of possible causes such as exposure to toxic or infectious agents, ''viruses'', physical ''trauma'', ''diet'', and behavioral and occupational factors.''For example, researchers have suggested that exposure to toxins during warfare, or strenuous physical activity, are possible reasons for why some veterans and athletes may be at increased risk of developing ALS.''Although there has been no consistent association between any environmental factor and the risk of developing ALS, future research may show that some factors are involved in the development or progression of the disease.' "
Is there a test for ALS?,"'No one test can provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS. ALS is primarily diagnosed based on detailed history of the symptoms and signs observed by a physician during physical examination along with a series of tests to rule out other mimicking diseases. However, the presence of upper and lower motor neuron symptoms strongly suggests the presence of the disease.''Physicians will review an individual’s full medical history and conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, and spasticity are getting progressively worse.''ALS symptoms in the early stages of the disease can be similar to those of a wide variety of other, more treatable diseases or disorders. Appropriate tests can exclude the possibility of other conditions.''Electromyography (''EMG''), a special recording technique that detects electrical activity of muscle fibers, can help diagnose ALS. Another common test is a nerve conduction study (NCS), which measures electrical activity of the nerves and muscles by assessing the nerve’s ability to send a signal along the nerve or to the muscle. Specific abnormalities in the NCS and EMG may suggest, for example, that the individual has a form of ''peripheral neuropathy'' (damage to peripheral nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS.''A physician may also order a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') test, a noninvasive procedure that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and spinal cord. Standard MRI scans are generally normal in people with ALS. However, they can reveal other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord ''tumor'', a ''herniated disk'' in the neck that compresses the spinal cord, syringomyelia (a ''cyst'' in the spinal cord), or cervical spondylosis (abnormal wear affecting the spine in the neck).''Based on the person’s symptoms, test results, and findings from the examination, a physician may order tests on blood and urine samples to eliminate the possibility of other diseases.''Infectious diseases such as ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), human T-cell ''leukemia'' virus (HTLV), ''polio'', and ''West Nile virus'' can, in some cases, cause ALS-like symptoms. Neurological disorders such as ''multiple sclerosis'', ''post-polio syndrome'', multifocal motor neuropathy, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy’s disease) also can mimic certain features of the disease and should be considered by physicians attempting to make a diagnosis. Fasciculations and muscle ''cramps'' also occur in benign conditions.''Because of the prognosis carried by this diagnosis and the variety of diseases or disorders that can resemble ALS in the early stages of the disease, individuals may wish to obtain a second neurological opinion.' "
What is the treatment for the symtptoms of ALS? Is there cure?,"'No cure has yet been found for ALS. However, there are treatments available that can help control symptoms, prevent unnecessary complications, and make living with the disease easier.''Supportive care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; social workers; respiratory therapists and clinical psychologists; and home care and ''hospice'' nurses. These teams can design an individualized treatment plan and provide special equipment aimed at keeping people as mobile, comfortable, and independent as possible.''The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the ''drugs'' riluzole (Rilutek) and edaravone (Radicava) to treat ALS. Riluzole is believed to reduce damage to motor neurons by decreasing levels of glutamate, which transports messages between nerve cells and motor neurons. Clinical trials in people with ALS showed that riluzole prolongs survival by a few months, particularly in the bulbar form of the disease, but does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons. Edaravone has been shown to slow the decline in clinical assessment of daily functioning in persons with ALS.''Physicians can also prescribe medications to help manage symptoms of ALS, including muscle cramps, stiffness, excess saliva and ''phlegm'', and the pseudobulbar affect (involuntary or uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays). Drugs also are available to help individuals with ''pain'', ''depression'', ''sleep'' disturbances, and ''constipation''. Pharmacists can give advice on the proper use of medications and monitor a person’s prescriptions to avoid risks of ''drug interactions''.''Physical therapy and special equipment can enhance an individual’s independence and safety throughout the course of ALS. Gentle, low-impact ''aerobic exercise'' such as walking, ''swimming'', and stationary bicycling can strengthen unaffected muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and help people fight ''fatigue'' and ''depression''. Range of motion and stretching exercises can help prevent painful spasticity and shortening (contracture) of muscles.''Physical therapists can recommend exercises that provide these benefits without overworking muscles. Occupational therapists can suggest devices such as ramps, ''braces'', walkers, and wheelchairs that help individuals conserve energy and remain mobile.''People with ALS who have difficulty speaking may benefit from working with a speech therapist, who can teach adaptive strategies to speak louder and more clearly. As ALS progresses, speech therapists can help people maintain the ability to communicate. They can recommend aids such as computer-based speech synthesizers that use eye-tracking technology and can help people develop ways for responding to yes-or-no questions with their eyes or by other nonverbal means.''Some people with ALS may choose to use voice banking while they are still able to speak as a process of storing their own voice for future use in computer-based speech synthesizers. These methods and devices help people communicate when they can no longer speak or produce vocal sounds.''Nutritional support is an important part of the care of people with ALS. It has been shown that individuals with ALS will get weaker if they lose weight. Nutritionists can teach individuals and caregivers how to plan and prepare small meals throughout the day that provide enough calories, ''fiber'', and fluid and how to avoid foods that are difficult to swallow. People may begin using suction devices to remove excess fluids or saliva and prevent choking. When individuals can no longer get enough nourishment from eating, doctors may advise inserting a feeding tube into the stomach. The use of a feeding tube also reduces the risk of choking and ''pneumonia'' that can result from inhaling liquids into the ''lungs''.''As the muscles responsible for breathing start to weaken, people may experience ''shortness of breath'' during physical activity and difficulty breathing at night or when lying down. Doctors may test an individual’s breathing to determine when to recommend a treatment called noninvasive ventilation (NIV). NIV refers to breathing support that is usually delivered through a mask over the nose and/or mouth. Initially, NIV may only be necessary at night. When muscles are no longer able to maintain normal oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, NIV may be used full-time. NIV improves the quality of life and prolongs survival for many people with ALS.''Because the muscles that control breathing become weak, individuals with ALS may also have trouble generating a strong ''cough''. There are several techniques to help people increase forceful ''coughing'', including mechanical ''cough'' assist devices and breath stacking. In breath stacking, a person takes a series of small breaths without exhaling until the lungs are full, briefly holds the breath, and then expels the air with a cough.''As the disease progresses and muscles weaken further, individuals may consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators) in which a machine inflates and deflates the lungs. Doctors may place a ''breathing tube'' through the mouth or may surgically create a hole at the front of the neck and insert a tube leading to the windpipe (''tracheostomy''). The tube is connected to a respirator.''Individuals with ALS and their families often consider several factors when deciding whether and when to use ventilation support. These devices differ in their effect on a person’s quality of life and in cost. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. People may choose to be fully informed about these considerations and the long-term effects of life without movement before they make decisions about ventilation support.'  "
Are there new treatment options for ALS? What research is being done to find a cure?,"'The mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world.''The goals of NINDS research on ALS are to understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the development and progression of the disease, investigate the influence of genetics and other potential risk factors, identify biomarkers, and develop new and more effective treatments.''Scientists are seeking to understand the mechanisms that selectively trigger motor neurons to degenerate in ALS, and to find effective approaches to halt the processes leading to cell death. Using both animal models and cell culture systems, scientists are trying to determine how and why ALS-causing gene mutations lead to the destruction of neurons. These animal models include fruit flies, zebrafish, and rodents.''Initially, genetically modified animal models focused on mutations in the SOD1 gene but more recently, models have been developed for defects in the C9ORF72, TARDP, FUS, PFN1, TUBA4A, and UBQLN2 genes. Research in these models suggests that, depending on the gene mutation, motor neuron death is caused by a variety of cellular defects, including in the processing of RNA molecules and recycling of proteins, and structural impairments of motor neurons. Increasing evidence also suggests that various types of glial support cells and inflammation cells of the nervous system may play an important role in the disease.''In addition to animal models, scientists are also using innovative ''stem cells'' models to study ALS. Scientists have developed ways to take skin or blood cells from individuals with ALS and turn them into stem cells, which are capable of becoming any cell type in the body, including motor neurons and other cell types that may be involved in the disease. NINDS is supporting research on the development of stem cell lines for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS.''Overall, the work in familial ALS is already leading to a greater understanding of the more common sporadic form of the disease. Because familial ALS and sporadic ALS show many of the same signs and symptoms, some researchers believe that some familial ALS genes may also be involved in sporadic ALS.''Clinical research studies supported by NINDS are looking into how ALS symptoms change over time in people with C9ORF72 mutations. Other NINDS-supported research studies are working to identify additional genes that may cause or put a person at risk for either familial or sporadic ALS.''Additionally, researchers are looking at the potential role of epigenetics in the development of ALS. Epigenetic changes can switch genes on and off, and thus can profoundly affect the human condition in both health and disease. These changes can occur in response to multiple factors, including external or environmental conditions and events. Although this research is still at a very exploratory stage, scientists hope that understanding epigenetics can offer new information about how ALS develops.''Biomarkers are biological measures that help to identify the presence or rate of progression of a disease or the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention. Since ALS is difficult to diagnose, biomarkers could potentially help clinicians diagnose ALS earlier and faster.''Additionally, biomarkers are needed to help predict and accurately measure disease progression and enhance clinical studies aimed at developing more effective treatments. Biomarkers can be molecules derived from a bodily fluid (such as those in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid), an image of the brain or spinal cord, or a measure of the ability of a nerve or muscle to process electrical signals. The NINDS is supporting research on the development biomarkers for ALS.''Potential therapies for ALS are being investigated in a range of disease models. This work involves tests of drug-like compounds, gene therapy approaches, antibodies, and cell-based therapies. For example, NINDS-supported scientists are currently investigating whether lowering levels of the SOD1 enzyme in the brain and spinal cord of individuals with SOD1 gene mutations would slow the rate of disease progression.''Other NINDS scientists are studying the use of glial-restricted progenitor cells (which have the ability to develop into other support cells) to slow disease progression and improve respiratory function. Additionally, a number of exploratory treatments are being tested in people with ALS. Investigators are optimistic that these and other basic, translational, and clinical research studies will eventually lead to new and more effective treatments for ALS.''More information about ALS research supported by NINDS and other NIH Institutes and Centers can be found using NIH RePORTER (projectreporter.nih.gov), a searchable database of current and past research projects supported by NIH and other federal agencies. RePORTER also includes links to publications and resources from these projects.' "
What is the ALS National Registry? Where can I find clinical trials on ALS?,"'The National ALS Registry is a program to collect, manage, and analyze data about people with ALS in the United States. Developed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), this registry establishes information about the number of ALS cases, collects demographic, occupational and environmental exposure data from people with ALS to learn about potential risk factors for the disease, and notifies participants about research opportunities. The Registry includes data from national databases as well as de-identified information provided by individuals with ALS. All information is kept confidential. People with ALS can add their information to the Registry by visiting www.cdc.gov/als.''Many neurological disorders do not have effective treatment options. Clinical trials offer hope for many people and an opportunity to help researchers find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease. For information about finding and participating in a clinical trial, visit NIH Clinical ''Research Trials'' and You at www.nih.gov/health/clinicaltrials. Use the search terms “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis” or “ALS AND (your state)” to locate trials in your area.''The NINDS supports the NIH NeuroBioBank (www.neurobiobank.nih.gov), a collaborative effort involving several brain banks across the U.S. that supply investigators with tissue from people with neurological and other disorders. Tissue from individuals with ALS is needed to enable scientists to study this disorder more intensely. The goal is to increase the availability of, and access to, high quality specimens for research to understand the neurological basis of the disease. Prospective donors can begin the enrollment process by visiting www.neurobiobank.nih.gov/pages/donor.' "
What is the anatomy of the low back?,"'To understand various causes of ''low back pain'', it is important to appreciate the normal design (anatomy) of the tissues of this area of the body. Important structures of the low back that can be related to symptoms in this region include the bony lumbar spine (vertebrae, singular = vertebra), discs between the vertebrae, ligaments around the spine and discs, spinal cord and nerves, muscles of the low back, internal organs of the pelvis and abdomen, and the skin covering the lumbar area.''The bony lumbar spine is designed so that vertebrae ""stacked"" together can provide a movable support structure while also protecting the spinal cord from injury. The spinal cord is composed of nervous tissue that extends down the spinal column from the brain. Each vertebra has a spinous process, a bony prominence behind the spinal cord, which shields the cord\'s nervous tissue from impact ''trauma''. Vertebrae also have a strong bony ""body"" (vertebral body) in front of the spinal cord to provide a platform suitable for weight bearing of all tissues above the buttocks. The ''lumbar vertebrae'' stack immediately atop the ''sacrum'' bone that is situated in between the buttocks. On each side, the sacrum meets the iliac bone of the pelvis to form the sacroiliac joints of the buttocks.' "
What is the anatomy of the low back? (Continued),"'The discs are pads that serve as ""cushions"" between the individual vertebral bodies. They help to minimize the impact of ''stress'' forces on the spinal column. Each disc is designed like a jelly donut with a central, softer component (nucleus pulposus) and a surrounding, firm outer ring (annulus fibrosus). The central portion of the disc is capable of rupturing (herniating as in a ''herniated disc'') through the outer ring, causing irritation of adjacent nervous tissue and ''sciatica'' as described below. Ligaments are strong fibrous soft tissues that firmly attach bones to bones. Ligaments attach each of the vertebrae to each other and surround each of the discs.''The nerves that provide sensation and stimulate the muscles of the low back as well as the lower extremities (the thighs, legs, ''feet'', and toes) all exit the lumbar spinal column through bony portals, each of which is called a ""foramen.""''Many muscle groups that are responsible for flexing, extending, and rotating the waist, as well as moving the lower extremities, attach to the lumbar spine through tendon insertions.''The ''aorta'' and blood vessels that transport blood to and from the lower extremities pass in front of the lumbar spine in the abdomen and pelvis. Surrounding these blood vessels are ''lymph nodes'' (lymph glands) and tissues of the involuntary nervous system that are important in maintaining bladder and bowel control.''The uterus and ovaries are important pelvic structures in front of the pelvic area of women. The ''prostate gland'' is a significant pelvic structure in men. The kidneys are on either side of the back of the lower abdomen, in front of the lumbar spine.''The skin over the lumbar area is supplied by nerves that come from nerve roots that exit from the lumbar spine.' "
What is the function of the low back?,"'The low back, or lumbar area, serves a number of important functions for the ''human body''. These functions include structural support, movement, and protection of certain body tissues.''When we stand, the lower back is functioning to support the weight of the upper body. When we bend, extend, or rotate at the waist, the lower back is involved in the movement. Therefore, injury to the structures important for weight bearing, such as the bony spine, muscles, tendons, and ligaments, often can be detected when the body is standing erect or used in various movements.''Protecting the soft tissues of the nervous system and spinal cord as well as nearby organs of the pelvis and abdomen is a critical function the lumbar spine and adjacent muscles of the low back.' "
What are common causes of lower back pain?,"'Common causes of low ''back pain'' (lumbar backache) include lumbar strain, nerve irritation, ''lumbar radiculopathy'', bony encroachment, and conditions of the bone and joints. Each of these is reviewed below.''Lumbar strain (acute, chronic)'': A lumbar strain is a stretch injury to the ligaments, tendons, and/or muscles of the low back. The stretching incident results in microscopic tears of varying degrees in these tissues. Lumbar strain is considered one of the most common causes of low ''back pain''. The injury can occur because of overuse, improper use, or trauma. Soft-tissue injury is commonly classified as ""acute"" if it has been present for days to weeks. If the strain lasts longer than three months, it is referred to as ""chronic."" Lumbar strain most often occurs in people in their 40s, but it can happen at any age. The condition is characterized by localized discomfort in the low back area with onset after an event that mechanically stressed the lumbar tissues. The severity of the injury ranges from mild to severe, depending on the degree of strain and resulting spasm of the muscles of the low back. The diagnosis of lumbar strain is based on the history of injury, the location of the ''pain'', and exclusion of nervous system injury. Usually, X-ray testing is only helpful to exclude bone abnormalities.''The treatment of lumbar strain consists of resting the back (to avoid reinjury), medications to relieve pain and ''muscle spasm'', local heat applications, ''massage'', and eventual (after the acute episode resolves) reconditioning exercises to strengthen the low back and abdominal muscles. Initial treatment at home might include heat application, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), and avoiding reinjury and heavy lifting. Prescription medications that are sometimes used for acute low back pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''ketorolac'' (''Toradol'') by injection or by mouth, muscle relaxants, such as ''carisoprodol'' (''Soma''), ''cyclobenzaprine'' (''Flexeril''), ''methocarbamol'' (Robaxin), and ''metaxalone'' (''Skelaxin''), as well as analgesics, such as ''tramadol'' (''Ultram'').''Long periods of inactivity in bed are no longer recommended, as this treatment may actually slow recovery. Spinal manipulation for periods of up to one month has been found to be helpful in some patients who do not have signs of nerve irritation. Future injury is avoided by using back-protection techniques during activities and support devices as needed at home or work.'  "
Nerve irritation and lumbar radiculopathy causes of lower back pain,"'Nerve irritation'': The nerves of the lumbar spine can be irritated by mechanical pressure (impingement) by bone or other tissues, or from disease, anywhere along their ''paths -- from'' their roots at the spinal cord to the skin surface. These conditions include lumbar disc disease (''radiculopathy''), bony encroachment, and inflammation of the nerves caused by a viral infection (''shingles''). See descriptions of these conditions below.''Lumbar radiculopathy'': Lumbar radiculopathy is nerve irritation that is caused by damage to the discs between the vertebrae. Damage to the disc occurs because of degeneration (""wear and tear"") of the outer ring of the disc, traumatic injury, or both. As a result, the central softer portion of the disc can rupture (herniate) through the outer ring of the disc and abut the spinal cord or its nerves as they exit the bony spinal column. This rupture is what causes the commonly recognized ""''sciatica''"" pain of a ''herniated disc'' that shoots from the low back and buttock down the leg. Sciatica can be preceded by a history of localized low-back aching or it can follow a ""popping"" sensation and be accompanied by numbness and tingling. The back pain commonly increases with movements at the waist and can increase with ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''. In more severe instances, sciatica can be accompanied by ''incontinence'' of the bladder and/or bowels. The sciatica of lumbar radiculopathy typically affects only one side of the body, such as the left side or right side, and not both. Lumbar radiculopathy is suspected based on the above symptoms. Increased radiating back pain when the lower extremity is lifted supports the diagnosis. Nerve testing (''EMG''/''electromyogram'' and NCV/nerve conduction velocity) of the lower extremities can be used to detect nerve irritation. The actual ''disc herniation'' can be detected with imaging tests, such as CAT or ''MRI'' scanning. Treatment of lumbar radiculopathy ranges from medical management to surgery. Medical management includes patient education, medications to relieve pain and ''muscle spasms'', ''cortisone injection'' around the spinal cord (epidural injection), physical therapy (heat, massage by a therapist, ''ultrasound'', exercises, electrical stimulation), and rest (not strict bed rest but avoiding reinjury). With unrelenting pain, severe impairment of function, or incontinence (which can indicate spinal cord irritation), surgery may be necessary. The operation performed depends on the overall status of the spine and the age and health of the patient. Procedures include removal of the herniated disc with laminotomy (a small hole in the bone of the lumbar spine surrounding the spinal cord), laminectomy (removal of the bony wall), by needle technique (percutaneous discectomy), disc-dissolving procedures (chemonucleolysis), and others.' "
Bony encroachment causes of lower back pain,"'Bony encroachment'': Any condition that results in movement or growth of the vertebrae of the lumbar spine can limit the space (encroachment) for the adjacent spinal cord and nerves. Causes of bony encroachment of the spinal nerves include foraminal narrowing (narrowing of the portal through which the ''spinal nerve'' passes from the spinal column, out of the spinal canal to the body, commonly as a result of ''arthritis''), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slippage of one vertebra relative to another), and spinal stenosis (compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or other soft tissues in the spinal canal). Spinal-''nerve compression'' in these conditions can lead to sciatica pain that radiates down the lower extremities. Spinal stenosis can cause lower-extremity pains that worsen with ''walking'' and are relieved by resting (mimicking the pains of poor circulation). Treatment of these afflictions varies, depending on their severity, and ranges from rest and exercises to epidural cortisone injections and surgical decompression by removing the bone that is compressing the nervous tissue.' "
Conditions of bone and joint causes of lower back pain,"'Bone and joint conditions'': Bone and joint conditions that lead to low back pain include those existing from birth (congenital), those that result from wear and tear (degenerative) or injury, and those that are due to inflammation of the joints (arthritis).''Congenital bone conditions'': Congenital causes (existing from birth) of low back pain include ''scoliosis'' and ''spina bifida''. Scoliosis is a sideways (lateral) curvature of the spine that can be caused when one lower extremity is shorter than the other (functional scoliosis) or because of an abnormal architecture of the spine (''structural scoliosis''). Children who are significantly affected by structural scoliosis may require treatment with bracing and/or surgery to the spine. Adults infrequently are treated surgically but often benefit by support bracing. Spina bifida is a birth defect in the bony vertebral arch over the spinal canal, often with absence of the spinous process. This birth defect most commonly affects the lowest lumbar vertebra and the top of the sacrum. Occasionally, there are abnormal tufts of hair on the skin of the involved area. Spina bifida can be a minor bony abnormality without symptoms. However, the condition can also be accompanied by serious nervous abnormalities of the lower extremities.''Degenerative bone and joint conditions'"": As we age, the water and protein content of the body's cartilage changes. This change results in weaker, thinner, and more fragile cartilage. Because both the discs and the joints that stack the vertebrae (facet joints) are partly composed of cartilage, these areas are subject to wear and tear over time (degenerative changes). Degeneration of the disc is called spondylosis. Spondylosis can be noted on ""'X-rays'' of the spine as a narrowing of the normal ""disc space"" between the vertebrae. It is the deterioration of the disc tissue that predisposes the disc to herniation and localized lumbar pain (""''lumbago''"") in older patients. ''Degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') of the facet joints is also a cause of localized lumbar pain that can be detected with plain X-ray testing. These causes of degenerative back pain are usually treated conservatively with intermittent heat, rest, rehabilitative exercises, and medications to relieve pain, muscle spasm, and inflammation.''Injury to the bones and joints'': ''Fractures'' (breakage of bone) of the lumbar spine and sacrum bone most commonly affect elderly people with ''osteoporosis'', especially those who have taken long-term cortisone medication. For these individuals, occasionally even minimal stresses on the spine (such as bending to tie shoes) can lead to bone ''fracture''. In this setting, the vertebra can collapse (vertebral compression fracture). The fracture causes an immediate onset of severe localized pain that can radiate around the waist in a band-like fashion and is made intensely worse with body motions. This pain generally does not radiate down the lower extremities. Vertebral fractures in younger patients occur only after severe trauma, such as from motor-vehicle accidents or a convulsive ''seizure''.''In both younger and older patients, vertebral fractures take weeks to heal with rest and pain relievers. Compression fractures of vertebrae associated with ''osteoporosis'' can also be treated with a procedure called vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, which can help to reduce pain. In this procedure, a balloon is inflated in the compressed vertebra, often returning some of its lost height. Subsequently, a ""cement"" (methymethacrylate) is injected into the balloon and remains to retain the structure and height of the body of the vertebra. Pain is relieved as the height of the collapsed vertebra is restored.''Arthritis'': The spondyloarthropathies are inflammatory types of arthritis that can affect the lower back and sacroiliac joints. Examples of spondyloarthropathies include ''reactive arthritis'"" (Reiter's disease), ""'ankylosing spondylitis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', and the arthritis of ''inflammatory bowel disease''. Each of these diseases can lead to low back pain and ''stiffness'', which is typically worse in the morning. These conditions usually begin in the second and third decades of life. They are treated with medications directed toward decreasing the inflammation. Newer biologic medications have been greatly successful in both quieting the disease and stopping its progression.' "
What are other causes of lower back pain?,"'Other causes of low back pain include kidney problems, ''pregnancy'', ovary problems, and tumors.''Kidney infections, stones, and traumatic bleeding of the kidney (''hematoma'') are frequently associated with low back pain. Diagnosis can involve urine analysis, sound-wave tests (ultrasound), or other imaging studies of the abdomen.'""Pregnancy commonly leads to low back pain by mechanically stressing the lumbar spine (changing the normal lumbar curvature) and by the positioning of the baby inside of the abdomen. Additionally, the effects of the female hormone estrogen and the ligament-loosening hormone relaxin may contribute to loosening of the ligaments and structures of the back. Pelvic-tilt exercises and stretches are often recommended for relieving this pain. Women are also recommended to maintain physical conditioning during pregnancy according to their doctors' advice. Natural ""'labor'' can also cause low back pain.''Ovarian cysts'', ''uterine fibroids'', and ''endometriosis'' may also cause low back pain. Precise diagnosis can require gynecologic examination and testing.''Low back pain can be caused by tumors, either benign or ''malignant'', that originate in the bone of the spine or pelvis and spinal cord (primary tumors) and those which originate elsewhere and spread to these areas (metastatic tumors). Symptoms range from localized pain to radiating severe pain and loss of nerve and muscle function (even ''incontinence of urine'' and ''stool'') depending on whether or not the tumors affect the nervous tissue. Tumors of these areas are detected using imaging tests, such as plain X-rays, nuclear bone scanning, and CAT and MRI scanning.' "
What are uncommon causes of low back pain?,"'Uncommon causes of low back pain include '""Paget's disease of bone""', bleeding or infection in the pelvis, infection of the cartilage and/or bone of the spine, ''aneurysm'' of the aorta, and ''shingles''.'""Paget's disease of the bone is a condition of unknown cause in which the bone formation is out of synchrony with normal bone remodeling. This condition results in abnormally weakened bone and deformity and can cause localized bone pain, though it often causes no symptoms. Paget's disease is more common in people over the age of 50. Heredity (genetic background) and certain unusual virus infections have been suggested as causes. Thickening of involved bony areas of the lumbar spine can cause the radiating lower extremity pain of sciatica.""""Paget's disease can be diagnosed on plain X-rays. However, a bone biopsy is occasionally necessary to ensure the accuracy of the diagnosis. Bone scanning is helpful to determine the extent of the disease, which can involve more than one bone area. A blood test, ""'alkaline phosphatase'', is useful for diagnosis andmonitoring response to therapy. Treatment options include ''aspirin'', other anti-inflammatory medicines, pain medications, and medications that slow therate of bone turnover, such as ''calcitonin'' (Calcimar, Miacalcin), ''etidronate'' (''Didronel''), ''alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), ''risedronate'' (''Actonel''), and pamidronate (''Aredia'').''Bleeding in the pelvis is rare without significant trauma and is usually seen in patients who are taking blood-thinning medications, such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''). In these patients, a rapid-onset sciatica pain can be a sign of bleeding in the back of the pelvis and abdomen that is compressing the spinal nerves as they exit to the lower extremities. Infection of the pelvis is infrequent but can be a complication of conditions such as ''diverticulosis'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' with infection of the Fallopian tubes or uterus, and even ''appendicitis''. Pelvic infection is a serious complication of these conditions and is often associated with ''fever'', lowering of ''blood pressure'', and a life-threatening state.'  "
What are uncommon causes of low back pain? (Continued),"'Infection of the discs (septic discitis) and bone (''osteomyelitis'') is extremely rare. These conditions lead to localized pain associated with ''fever''. The bacteria found when these tissues are tested with laboratory cultures include '' ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'' (''TB'' bacteria). ''TB'"" infection in the spine is called Pott's disease. These are each very serious conditions requiring long courses of antibiotics. The sacroiliac joints rarely become infected with bacteria. ""'Brucellosis'"" is a bacterial infection that can involve the sacroiliac joints and is usually transmitted in raw goat's milk.""'In the elderly, ''atherosclerosis'' can cause weakening of the wall of the large arterial blood vessel (aorta) in the abdomen. This weakening can lead to a bulging (''aneurysm'') of the aorta wall. While most aneurysms cause no symptoms, some cause a pulsating low back pain. Aneurysms of certain size, especially when enlarging over time, can require surgical repair with a grafting procedure to repair the abnormal portion of the artery.''Shingles'' (''herpes zoster'') is an acute infection of the nerves that supply sensation to the skin, generally at one or several spinal levels and on one side of the body (right or left). Patients with ''shingles'' usually have had ''chickenpox'' earlier in life. The ''herpes'' virus that causes ''chickenpox'' is believed to exist in a dormant state within the spinal nerve roots long after the chickenpox resolves. In people with shingles, this virus reactivates to cause infection along the sensory nerve, leading to ''nerve pain'' and usually an outbreak of shingles (tiny ''blisters'' on the same side of the body and at the same nerve level). The back pain in patients with shingles of the lumbar area can precede the skin ''rash'' by days. Successive crops of tiny blisters can appear for several days and clear with crusty inflammation in one to two weeks. Patients occasionally are left with a more chronic nerve pain (''postherpetic neuralgia''). Treatment can involve symptomatic relief with lotions, such as calamine, or medications, such as ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), for the infection and ''pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'') or ''lidocaine'' (''Lidoderm'') patches for the pain.' "
What are risk factors for low back pain?,"'Risk factors for low back pain include athletic activity, heavy lifting, throwing, moving luggage, traumatic injury, ''kidney infection'', pregnancy, ''osteoporosis'', and ''aging''.' "
What are other symptoms and signs sometimes associated with low back pain?,"'Low back pain can cause a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the precise cause of the back pain as reviewed above. Symptoms that can be associated with low back pain include numbness and/or tingling of the lower extremities, incontinence of urine or ''stool'', inability to walk without worsening pain, lower extremity ''weakness'', atrophy (decreased in size) of the lower extremity muscles, ''rash'', fever, ''chills'', ''weight loss'', ''abdominal pains'', burning on urination, ''dizziness'', ''joint pain'', and ''fatigue''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose low back pain?,"'The diagnosis of low back pain involves a review of the history of the illness and underlying medical conditions as well as a physical examination. It is essential that a complete story of the back pain be reviewed including injury history, aggravating and alleviating conditions, associated pain symptoms (fever, numbness, tingling, incontinence, etc.), as well as the duration and progression of symptoms. Aside from routine abdomen and extremity evaluations, rectal and pelvic examinations may eventually be required as well. Further tests for diagnosis of low back pain can be required including blood and urine tests, plain film X-ray tests, CAT scanning, MRI scanning, bone scanning, and tests of the nerves such as electromyograms (EMG) and nerve conduction velocities (NCV).' "
What are treatment options for low back pain?,"'So, how is low back pain treated? As described above, the treatment very much depends on the precise cause of the back pain. Moreover, each patient must be individually evaluated and managed in the context of the underlying background health status and activity level.''As has been highlighted by research presented at the national meeting of the American College of ''Rheumatology'"", a very important aspect of the individual evaluation is the patient's own understanding and perception of their particular situation. British researchers found that those who believed that their symptoms had serious consequences on their lives and that they had, or treatments had, little control over their symptoms were more likely to have a poor outcome. This research points out to physicians the importance of addressing the concerns and perceptions that patients have about their condition during the initial evaluations.""'Finally, it should be noted that the conditions listed above are intended for general review. There are many other possible causes of back pain, including upper back pain, that have not been discussed.'  "
Are there home remedies or other treatments for low back pain?,"'Self-care remedies for pain relief include ''cold'' pack and heat applications, topical analgesic balms, avoiding reinjury, eliminating heavy lifting, and taking ''over-the-counter'' pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (''Aleve''), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).'  "
What is the prognosis for low back pain?,"'The outlook for low back pain absolutely depends on its precise cause. For example, acute strain injuries generally heal entirely with minimal treatment. On the other hand, bony abnormalities that are irritating the spinal cord can require significant surgical repair and the outlook depends on the surgical result. Long-term optimal results often involve ''exercise'' rehabilitation programs that can involve physical therapists.' "
Is it possible to prevent low back pain?,"'Avoiding injury to the low back is a method of preventing low back pain. Additionally, conditioning ''exercise'' programs designed to strengthen the lumbar area and adjacent tissues can help to minimize risk of injury to the low back. Specific programs to relieve and prevent back pain can be designed with the help of physical therapists and other treating health care professionals.'  "
Which health care specialties treat low back pain?,"'Physician specialties that evaluate and treat low back pain range from generalists to subspecialists. These specialties include ''emergency medicine'' physicians, general medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, gynecology, spine surgeons (orthopaedics and neurosurgery), rheumatology, ''pain management'', and physiatry. Other health care providers for low back pain include physical therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, psychologists, and acupuncturists.' "
What do blood pressure numbers mean (chart with ranges)?,"'Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It constitutes one of the critically important signs of life or vital signs, which include ''heart'' rate, ''breathing'', and temperature. Blood pressure is generated by the heart pumping blood into the arteries modified by the response of the arteries to the flow of blood.'""An individual's blood pressure is expressed as ""'systolic/diastolic'' blood pressure, for example, 120/80.''Blood pressure always is higher when the heart is pumping (squeezing) than when it is relaxing.''The range of systolic blood pressure for most healthy adults falls between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal diastolic blood pressure ranges between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Current guidelines define normal blood pressure range as lower than 120/80. Blood pressures over 130/80 are considered high. ''High blood pressure'' increases the risk of damaging the arteries, which leads to the development of:''Low blood pressure (''hypotension'') is pressure so low it causes symptoms or signs due to the low flow of blood through the arteries and veins. When the flow of blood is too low to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney, the organs do not function normally and may be temporarily or permanently damaged.''Unlike ''high blood pressure'', low blood pressure is defined primarily by signs and symptoms of low blood flow and not by a specific blood pressure number. Some individuals routinely may have blood pressure numbers of 90/50 with no symptoms and therefore do not have low blood pressure. However, others who normally have higher blood pressures may develop symptoms of low blood pressure if their blood pressure drops to 100/60.''During ''pregnancy'', blood pressure tends to decrease. Normal blood pressure during pregnancy may be lower than 100/60. Your OB/GYN or ''Midwife'' should monitor your bood pressure if you are ''pregnant''.'   The systolic blood pressure (the top number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart contracts and pumps blood into them. The diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart relaxes following its contraction. Heart disease Kidney disease Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) Eye damage Stroke"
How does blood pressure work? ,"'During relaxation of the heart (diastole), the ''left ventricle'' of the heart fills with blood returning from the ''lungs''. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps blood into the arteries (systole). The blood pressure in the arteries during contraction of the ventricle (systolic pressure) is higher because blood is being actively ejected into the arteries. It is lower during relaxation of the ventricle (diastolic pressure) when no blood is being ejected into the arteries. The pulse we feel when we place our fingers over an artery is caused by the contraction of the left ventricle and the ejection of blood.''Blood pressure is determined by two factors: 1) The amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart into the arteries, and 2) the resistance to the flow of blood caused by the walls of the arterioles (smaller arteries).''Generally, blood pressure tends to be higher if more blood is pumped into the arteries or if the arterioles are narrow and/or stiff. Narrow and/or stiff arterioles, by resisting the flow of blood, increase blood pressure. Arterioles may become narrower when the muscles surrounding them contract. Arterioles may become stiff and narrow when older patients develop atherosclerosis.''Blood pressure tends to be lower if less blood is being pumped into the arteries or if the arterioles are larger and more flexible and, therefore, have less resistance to the flow of blood.''The body has mechanisms to alter or maintain blood pressure and blood flow. There are sensors that detect blood pressure in the walls of the arteries and send signals to the heart, the arterioles, the veins, and the kidneys that cause them to make changes that lower or increase blood pressure.''Several ways in which blood pressure can be adjusted ''by adjusting the amount of blood pumped by the heart into the arteries (cardiac output), the amount of blood contained in the veins, the arteriolar resistance, and the volume of blood.''For example, low blood volume due to bleeding (such as a bleeding ulcer in the stomach or from a severe laceration from an injury) can cause low blood pressure. The body quickly responds to the low blood volume and pressure by the following adjustments, which all increase blood pressure:'""The heart rate increases and the forcefulness of the heart's contractions increase, pumping more blood through the heart."" The heart can speed up and contract more frequently and it can eject more blood with each contraction (more forcefully). Both of these responses increase the flow of blood into the arteries and increase blood pressure. The veins can expand and narrow. When veins expand, more blood can be stored in the veins and less blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries. As a result, the heart pumps less blood, and blood pressure is lower. On the other hand, when veins narrow, less blood is stored in the veins, more blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries, and blood pressure is higher. The arterioles can expand and narrow. Expanded arterioles create less resistance to the flow of blood and decrease blood pressure, while narrowed arterioles create more resistance and raise blood pressure. The kidney can respond to changes in blood pressure by increasing or decreasing the amount of urine that is produced. Urine is primarily water that is removed from the blood. When the kidney makes more urine, the amount (volume) of blood that fills the arteries and veins decreases, and this lowers blood pressure. If the kidneys make less urine, the amount of blood that fills the arteries and veins increases and this increases blood pressure. Compared with the other mechanisms for adjusting blood pressure, changes in the production of urine affect blood pressure slowly over hours and days. (The other mechanisms are effective in seconds.) Veins narrow to return more blood to the heart for pumping. Blood flow to the kidneys decreases to reduce the formation of urine and thereby increases the volume of blood in the arteries and veins. Arterioles narrow to increase resistance to blood flow. These adaptive responses will keep the blood pressure in the normal range unless blood loss becomes so severe that the responses are overwhelmed."
What are the benefits of low blood pressure?,"'People who have lower blood pressures have a''Athletes, people who ''exercise'' regularly, people who maintain ideal body weight, and nonsmokers tend to have lower blood pressures.''Low blood pressure is desirable as long as it is not low enough to cause symptoms and damage to the organs in the body.' lower risk of stroke, kidney disease, and heart disease."
What are the signs and symptoms of low blood pressure?,"'When blood pressure is not sufficient to deliver enough blood to the organs of the body, the organs do not work properly and can be temporarily or permanently damaged. Symptoms of low blood pressure caused by conditions or diseases depend upon the specific cause of the low blood pressure. For example, if insufficient blood flows to the brain, brain cells do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, and a person can feel lightheaded, dizzy, or even faint.''The most common symptoms of low blood pressure include:''Symptoms of low blood pressure due to conditions or diseases include:'   Lightheadedness Dizziness Fainting (syncope) Orthostatic hypotension symptoms: Going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position often brings out symptoms of low blood pressure. This occurs because standing causes blood to ""settle"" in the veins of the lower body, and this can lower the blood pressure. If the blood pressure is already low, standing can make the low pressure worse, to the point of causing symptoms. The development of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing caused by low blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. Normal individuals are able to compensate rapidly for the low pressure created by standing with the responses discussed previously and do not develop orthostatic hypotension. Heart disease: Chest pain (a symptom of angina) or even a heart attack may occur when there is insufficient blood pressure to deliver blood to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart's muscle). Kidney disease: When insufficient blood is delivered to the kidneys, the kidneys fail to eliminate wastes from the body, for example, urea (BUN and creatinine), and increases in their levels in the blood occur. Shock is a life-threatening condition where persistently low blood pressure causes organs such as kidney, liver, heart, lung, and brain to fail rapidly."
What causes low blood pressure?,'Conditions that reduce the volume of blood or that reduce cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart) and medications are frequent reasons for low blood pressure.' 
"Dehydration, bleeding, and inflammation","   Dehydration is common among patients with prolonged nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive exercise, which shunts blood away from the organs to the muscles. Large amounts of water are lost when vomiting and with diarrhea, especially if the person does not drink adequate amounts of fluid to replace the depleted water.Other causes of dehydration include exercise, sweating, fever, and heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Individuals with mild dehydration may experience only thirst and dry mouth. Moderate to severe dehydration may cause orthostatic hypotension (manifested by lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing). Prolonged and severe dehydration can lead to shock, kidney failure, confusion, acidosis (too much acid in the blood), coma, and even death. Moderate or severe bleeding can quickly deplete an individual's body of blood, leading to low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension. Bleeding can result from trauma, surgical complications, or from gastrointestinal abnormalities such as ulcers, tumors, or diverticulosis. Occasionally, the bleeding may be so severe and rapid (for example, bleeding from a ruptured aortic aneurysm) that it causes shock and death rapidly. Severe inflammation of organs inside the body such as acute pancreatitis can cause low blood pressure. In acute pancreatitis, fluid leaves the blood vessels to enter the inflamed tissues around the pancreas as well as the abdominal cavity, concentrating blood and reducing its volume."
Heart disease,"'Several common reasons for bradycardia include: 1) sick sinus syndrome, 2) ''heart block'', and 3) drug toxicity. Many of these conditions occur in the elderly.''An abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia)'' also can cause low blood pressure. The most common example of tachycardia causing low blood pressure is ''atrial fibrillation'' (''Afib''). ''Atrial fibrillation'' is a disorder of the heart characterized by rapid and irregular electrical discharges from the muscle of the heart causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The rapidly contracting ventricles do not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before each contraction, and the amount of blood that is pumped decreases in spite of the faster heart rate. Other abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia also can produce low blood pressure, and sometimes life-threatening shock.' Weakened heart muscle can cause the heart to fail and reduce the amount of blood it pumps. One common cause of weakened heart muscle is the death of a large portion of the heart's muscle due to a single, large heart attack or repeated smaller heart attacks. Other examples of conditions that can weaken the ability of the heart to pump blood include medications toxic to the heart, infections of the muscle of the heart by viruses (myocarditis), and diseases of the heart's valves such as aortic stenosis that reduce the flow of blood from the heart and into the arteries. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). Pericarditis can cause fluid to accumulate within the pericardium and compress the heart, restricting the ability of the heart to expand, fill, and pump blood. Pulmonary embolism is a condition in which a blood clot in a vein (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) breaks off and travels to the heart and eventually the lung. A large blood clot can block the flow of blood into the left ventricle from the lungs and severely diminish the blood returning to the heart for pumping. Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening emergency. A slow heart rate (bradycardia) can decrease the amount of blood pumped by the heart. The resting heart rate for a healthy adult is between 60 and 100 beats/minute. Bradycardia (resting heart rates slower than 60 beats/minute) does not always cause low blood pressure. In fact, some highly trained athletes can have resting heart rates in the 40s and 50s (beats per minute) without any symptoms. The slow heart rates are offset by more forceful contractions of the heart that pump more blood than in non-athletes. However, in many patients bradycardia can lead to low blood pressure, lightheadedness, dizziness, and even fainting. Sick sinus syndrome: Sick sinus syndrome occurs when the diseased electrical system of the heart cannot generate electrical signals fast enough to maintain a normal heart rate. Heart block: Heart block occurs when the specialized tissues that transmit electrical current in the heart are damaged by heart attacks, degeneration from atherosclerosis, and medications. Heart block prevents some or all of the electrical signals from reaching parts of the heart, and this prevents the heart from contracting as well as it otherwise would. Drug toxicity: Drugs such as digoxin (Lanoxin) or beta blockers for high blood pressure can slow the transmission of electricity in the heart chemically and can cause bradycardia and hypotension (see section ""Medications that cause low blood pressure"")."
Medications,"'Medications that cause low blood pressure' Medications such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and digoxin (Lanoxin) can slow the rate at which the heart contracts. Some elderly people are extremely sensitive to these medications since they are more likely to have diseased hearts and electrical conduction tissues. In some individuals, the heart rate can become dangerously slow even with small doses of these medications. Medications used in treating high blood pressure (such as angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers) can excessively lower blood pressure and result in symptomatic low blood pressure especially among the elderly. Water pills (diuretics) such as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL) and furosemide (Lasix) can decrease blood volume by causing excessive urination. Medications used for treating depression, such as amitriptyline (Elavil); Parkinson's disease, such as levodopa-carbidopa (Sinemet); and erectile dysfunction (impotence), such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) when used in combination with nitroglycerin, can cause low blood pressure. Alcohol and narcotics also can cause low blood pressure."
Other causes of low blood pressure," Vasovagal reaction is a common condition in which a healthy person temporarily develops low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and sometimes fainting. A vasovagal reaction typically is brought on by emotions of fear or pain such as having blood drawn, starting an intravenous infusion, or by gastrointestinal upset. Vasovagal reactions are caused by activity of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system, especially the vagus nerve, which releases hormones that slow the heart and widen the blood vessels. The vagus nerve also controls digestive tract function and senses activity in the digestive system. Thus, some people can have a vasovagal reaction from straining at a bowel movement or vomiting. Postural (orthostatic) hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when an individual stands up from a sitting, squatting, or supine (lying) position. When a person stands up, gravity causes blood to settle in the veins in the legs so that less blood returns to the heart for pumping, and, as a result, the blood pressure drops. The body normally responds automatically to the drop in blood pressure by increasing the rate and narrowing the veins to return more blood to the heart. In patients with postural hypotension, this compensating reflex fails to occur, resulting low blood pressure and its symptoms. Postural hypotension can occur in persons of all ages but is much more common among the elderly, especially in those on medications for high blood pressure and/or diuretics. Other causes of postural hypotension include dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, prolonged bed rest, diabetes, and certain rare neurological syndromes (for example, Shy-Drager syndrome) that damage the autonomic nerves. Another form of postural hypotension occurs typically in young healthy individuals. After prolonged standing, the individual's heart rate and blood pressure drop, causing dizziness, nausea, and often fainting. In these individuals, the autonomic nervous system wrongly responds to prolonged standing by directing the heart to slow down and the veins to dilate thereby removing blood from circulating in the arteries. Micturition syncope is a temporary drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness brought about by urinating. This condition typically occurs in elderly patients and may be due to the release of hormones that lower blood pressure. Adrenal insufficiency, for example, due to Addison's disease, can cause low blood pressure. Addison's disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands (small glands next to the kidneys) are destroyed. The destroyed adrenal glands can no longer produce sufficient adrenal hormones (specifically cortisol) necessary to maintain normal bodily functions. Cortisol has many functions, one of which is to maintain blood pressure and the function of the heart. Addison's disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and, sometimes, darkening of the skin. Septicemia is a severe infection in which bacteria (or other infectious organisms such as fungi) enter the blood. The infection typically originates in the lungs (as pneumonia), bladder, or in the abdomen due to diverticulitis or gallstones. The bacteria then enter the blood where they release toxins and cause life-threatening and profound low blood pressure (septic shock), often with damage to several organs. Anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock) is a potentially fatal allergic reaction to medications such as penicillin, intravenous iodine used in some X-ray studies, foods such as peanuts, or bee stings (insect stings). In addition to a severe drop in blood pressure, individuals may also experience hives and wheezing due to constriction of the airways, and a swollen throat, which causes difficulty breathing. The shock is caused by enlargement of blood-containing blood vessels and escape of water from the blood into the tissues."
What procedures and tests diagnose low blood pressure?,"'In some people, particularly relatively healthy ones, symptoms of weakness, dizziness, and fainting raise the suspicion of low blood pressure. In others, an event often associated with low blood pressure, for example a heart attack, has occurred to cause the symptoms.''Measuring blood pressure in both the lying (supine) and standing positions usually is the first step in diagnosing low blood pressure. In patients with symptomatic low blood pressure, there often is a marked drop in blood pressure upon standing, and patients may even develop orthostatic symptoms. The heart rate often increases. The goal is to identify the cause of the low blood pressure. Sometimes the causes are readily apparent (such as loss of blood due to trauma, or sudden shock after receiving X-ray dyes containing iodine). At other times, the cause may be identified by testing:' CBC (complete blood count) may reveal anemia from blood loss or elevated white blood cells due to infection. Blood electrolyte measurements may show dehydration and mineral depletion, renal failure (kidney failure), or acidosis (excess acid in the blood). Cortisol levels can be measured to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease. Blood and urine cultures can be performed to diagnose septicemia and bladder infections, respectively. Radiology studies, such as chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasounds, and computerized tomography (CT or CAT) scans may detect pneumonia, heart failure, gallstones, pancreatitis, and diverticulitis. Electrocardiograms (EKG) can detect abnormally slow or rapid heartbeats, pericarditis, and heart muscle damage from either previous heart attacks or a reduced supply of blood to the heart muscle that has not yet caused a heart attack. Holter monitor recordings are used to diagnose intermittent episodes of abnormal heart rhythms. If abnormal rhythms occur intermittently, a standard EKG performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not show the abnormal rhythm. A Holter monitor is a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours that often is used diagnose intermittent episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia (aslow or fast heart rate). Patient-activated event recorder: If the episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia are infrequent, a 24-hour Holter recording may not capture these sporadic episodes. In this situation, a patient can wear a patient-activated event recorder for up to 4 weeks. The patient presses a button to start the recording when he or she senses the onset of an abnormal heart rhythm or symptoms possibly caused by low blood pressure. The doctor then analyzes the recordings later to identify the abnormal episodes. Echocardiograms are examinations of the structures and motion of the heart using ultrasound. Echocardiograms can detect pericardial fluid due to pericarditis, the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks, diseases of the heart valves, and rare tumors of the heart. Ultrasound examinations of the leg veins and CT scans of the chest can detect deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Tilt-table tests are used to evaluate patients suspected of having postural hypotension or syncope due to abnormal function of the autonomic nerves. During a tilt-table test, the patient lies on an examination table with an intravenous infusion administered while the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. The table then is tilted upright for 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored every few minutes. The purpose of the test is to try to reproduce postural hypotension. Sometimes a doctor may administer epinephrine (Adrenalin, Isuprel) intravenously to induce postural hypotension."
What is the treatment for low blood pressure?,"'Low blood pressure readings in healthy people without symptoms or organ damage need no treatment. A doctor should evalute all patients with symptoms that are possibly due to low blood pressure. Patients who have had a major drop in blood pressure from their usual levels even without the development of symptoms also should be evaluated. The doctor needs to identify the cause of the low blood pressure; remedies will depend on the cause. For example, if a medication is causing the low blood pressure, the dose of medication may have to be reduced or the medication stopped. ''Do not adjust medication dose on your own, and do not stop taking any medication without first consulting your doctor.''Do not take any herbs without first consulting your doctor.''*Note: Increasing salt intake can lead to heart failure in patients with existing heart disease and should not be undertaken without consulting a doctor.'   Dehydration is treated with fluids and minerals (electrolytes). Mild dehydration without nausea and vomiting can be treated with oral fluids and electrolytes. Moderate to severe dehydration usually is treated in a hospital or emergency room with intravenous fluids and electrolytes. Blood loss can be treated by treating the cause of the bleeding, and with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Continuous and severe bleeding needs to be treated immediately. Septic shock is a medical emergency and is treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Blood pressure medications or diuretics are adjusted, changed, or stopped by the doctor if they are causing low blood pressure symptoms. Bradycardia may be due to a medication. The doctor may reduce, change, or stop the medication. Bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome or heart block is treated with an implantable pacemaker. Tachycardia is treated depending on the nature of the tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation can be treated with oral medications, electrical cardioversion, or a catheterization procedure called pulmonary vein isolation. Ventricular tachycardia can be controlled with medications or with an implantable defibrillator. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is treated with blood thinners, initially with types of heparin. Later, oral warfarin (Coumadin) or other oral medications are substituted for heparin. Pericardial fluid from pericarditis can be removed by a procedure called pericardiocentesis. Postural hypotension can be treated with changes in diet such asincreasing water and salt intake,* increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels),using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins, andin some patients, the use of a medication called midodrine (ProAmatine). increasing water and salt intake, * increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels), using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins, and in some patients, the use of a medication called midodrine (ProAmatine). The problem with midodrine is that while it increases blood pressure in the upright position, the supine blood pressure may become too high, thus increasing the risk of strokes. Mayo Clinic researchers found that a medication used to treat muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis called pyridostigmine (Mestinon) increases upright blood pressure but not supine blood pressure. Pyridostigmine, an anticholinesterase medication, works on the autonomic nervous system, especially when a person is standing up. Side effects include minor abdominal cramping or increased frequency of bowel movements. Postprandial hypotension refers to low blood pressure occurring after meals. Ibuprofen (Motrin) or indomethacin (Indocin) may be beneficial. Vasovagal syncope can be treated with several types of drugs such as beta blockers, for example:Propanolol (Inderal, Inderal LA)SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such asfluoxetine (Prozac),escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro),paroxetine (Paxil),sertraline (Zoloft),citalopram (Celexa), andfluvoxamine (Luvox). Propanolol (Inderal, Inderal LA) SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such asfluoxetine (Prozac),escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro),paroxetine (Paxil),sertraline (Zoloft),citalopram (Celexa), andfluvoxamine (Luvox). fluoxetine (Prozac), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). fludrocortisone (Florinef) (a drug that prevents dehydration by causing the kidney(s) to retain water) also may be used. A pacemaker can also be helpful when a patient fails drug therapy. Natural remedies have not been proven. Some herbs reported to raise blood pressure includeginger,rosemary,aniseed,cinnamon, andpepper. ginger, rosemary, aniseed, cinnamon, and pepper."
What are the causes of low blood pressure?,"'These are\xa0the following medical reasons that may lead to ''low blood pressure'':' Blood loss: Losing a lot of blood, such as from a major injury or internal bleeding, reduces the amount of blood in your body, leading to a severe drop in blood pressure. Septicemia (Infection): A recognized cause of low blood pressure is shock arising from severe infection and resulting from the infection entering the bloodstream. Severe dehydration from vomiting, diarrhea, or fever may lower blood pressure. Heart conditions such as heart attacks or abnormal heartbeats may render the heart incapable of supplying more constant blood flow and may cause low blood pressure. Hormonal imbalance: An imbalance in its production of hormones can cause a drop in blood pressure. Thyroid conditions and low blood sugars are often cited as causes of low blood pressure. Adrenal gland imbalance can also cause low blood pressure. Chronic kidney disease: Patients suffering from kidney failure are known to have episodes of low blood pressure, especially during dialysis or when they stand or sit up suddenly. This may be due to damage to the nerves that control the blood pressure. Anaphylaxis: A severe reaction to an allergen can also cause symptoms of low blood pressure by causing the heart to beat irregularly and impeding the flow of blood. Pregnancy: Fluctuations in blood pressure during pregnancies are seen as the body adapts itself to host the baby, and there are changes in the hormonal levels. Medication side effects: Some medicines for heart conditions, hypertension, or depression can cause dilation of blood vessels resulting in a sudden drop in blood pressure. More often, the lowered pressure is a mild side effect of the medication and not much cause for concern, for example, blood pressure medicines, medicines for erectile dysfunctions, and drugs for many mental health disorders. Heat exhaustion or heat stroke: It is one of the common causes of dehydration and low blood pressure."
Is low blood pressure dangerous?,"'Symptoms of low blood pressure include:' To have low blood pressure for a short duration is not always a concern as the body will try to bring it to normal. However, severe hypotension can cause a lack of blood flow to the brain, heart, and kidneys causing further complications. Low blood supply to the brain may cause dizziness, blackouts, or loss of consciousness and may even be life-threatening in severe cases.  Low blood pressure or hypotension is a condition where the systolic and diastolic pressure falls below 90 and 60 (mm Hg), respectively. Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. Systolic pressure is the pressure exerted on the arteries by a column of blood. Diastolic pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. Usually, low blood pressure is a sign or symptom of underlying medical condition or aging-related conditions. It is necessary to pay attention to signs and symptoms of low blood pressure in its initial stages. Lightheadedness or dizziness Nausea/vomiting Tiredness or weakness Cold sweaty skin Palpitations Shallow and rapid breathing Confusion or mental fog Loss of consciousness Weak pulse Fever (infective cause of low blood pressure) Pale skin Convulsions (in reduced blood supply to brain)"
How low blood pressure is usually treated?,"'Low blood pressure can be treated and does not require much medication unless accompanied by other conditions. Often, lifestyle and ''diet'' modifications may become necessary. Common recommendations include:''In cases of more severe or recurrent symptoms of low blood pressure, doctors may prescribe drugs to stabilize the system. These may include:' Increase intake of water  Increase sodium in diet (to be done with medical advice only) Treat the underlying causes Lifestyle modifications: Regular exercises keeping the body fit increase the pumping capacity of the heart and reduce the symptoms of low blood pressure. Reducing alcohol intake also helps. If certain medication causes low blood pressure, doctors may recommend a substitute or even stopping its consumption. Compression stockings to prevent pooling of blood at the limbs are suggested.  Fludrocortisone: It is a steroid that is prescribed when the body is unable to produce enough by itself and is often prescribed in conjunction with other steroids such as hydrocortisone. It reduces inflammation in the body and causes the body to retain more sodium. It may cause some water retention, but this is not a cause for concern because it is necessary to build blood pressure.  Midodrine: It is a vasopressor that constricts small blood vessels to increase blood pressure. The dosage is gradually increased over time to prevent side effects."
What are FODMAPs?,"'FODMAPs are short chain carbohydrates and ''sugar'' alcohols that are poorly digested by the body. They ferment in the ''large intestine'' (bowel) during ''digestion'', drawing in water and producing carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane ''gas'' that causes the intestine to expand. This causes GI symptoms such as bloating and ''pain'' that are common in disorders like ''IBS''.''FODMAPs are in some foods naturally or as additives. They include fructose (in fruits and vegetables), fructans (like fructose, found in some vegetables and grains), lactose (dairy), galactans (legumes), and polyols (''artificial sweeteners'').''These foods are not necessarily unhealthy products. Some of them contain fructans, inulin, and galactooligosaccharides (GOS), which are healthy prebiotics that help stimulate the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Many of them are otherwise good for you, but in certain people, eating or drinking them causes gastrointestinal symptoms.' "

What is neutropenia?,"""Neutropenia is a condition in which the number of neutrophils in the bloodstream is decreased. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes or PMNs. Neutropenia reduces the body's ability to fight off ""'bacterial infections''.''White blood cells are also known as leukocytes. There are five major types of circulating white blood cells:''Some white blood cells, called granulocytes, are filled with microscopic granules that are little sacs containing enzymes (compounds that digest microorganisms). Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are all granulocytes and are part of the innate immune system with somewhat nonspecific, broad-based activity. They do not respond exclusively to specific antigens, as do the lymphocytes (B-cells and T-cells).'""Neutrophils contain enzymes that help the cell kill and digest microorganisms it has engulfed by a process known as phagocytosis. The mature neutrophil has a segmented nucleus (it is often called a 'seg' or 'poly'), while the immature neutrophil has a band-shape nucleus (it is called a band). Neutrophils are made in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream. The neutrophil has a life-span of about three days.""   basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells, monocytes, and neutrophils."
What are the signs and symptoms of neutropenia?,"'Signs and symptoms suggestive of neutropenia include:''Pneumonia'' is an infection of the ''lungs'' that can occur in people with neutropenia.' low-grade fever, skin abscesses, mouth sores, swollen gums, and symptoms suggestive of infections of the skin, perirectal area, mouth, or other areas of the body."
What causes neutropenia?,"'Neutropenia can be present (though it is relatively uncommon) in normal healthy individuals, notably in some persons of African or Arabic descent and Yemenite Jews. Neutropenia may arise as a result of decreased production of neutrophils, destruction of neutrophils after they are produced, or pooling of neutrophils (accumulation of the neutrophils out of the circulation).''Neutropenia may arise as a result of numerous medical conditions:' Infections (more commonly viral infections, but also bacterial or parasitic infections). Examples include: HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); Medications that may damage the bone marrow or neutrophils, including cancer chemotherapy; Vitamin deficiencies (megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency); Diseases of the bone marrow such as leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, myelofibrosis; Radiation therapy; Congenital (inborn) disorders of bone marrow function or of neutrophil production, for example, Kostmann syndrome; Autoimmune destruction of neutrophils (either as a primary condition or associated with another disease such as Felty's syndrome) or from drugs stimulating the immune system to attack the cells Hypersplenism, which refers to the increased sequestration or destruction of blood cells by the spleen"
What are normal neutropenia levels and ranges?,"'The white blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range for the WBC varies slightly among laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per microliter or cubic millimeter (cmm). The WBC can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 x 10''9 ''to 10.8 x 10''9'' cells per liter. The percentage of the different types of white blood cells in the WBC is called the WBC differential.''The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is determined by the product of the white blood cell count (WBC) and the fraction of neutrophils among the white blood cells as determined by the WBC differential analysis. For example, if the WBC is 10,000 per microliter and 70% are neutrophils, the ANC would be 7,000 per microliter.''An ANC of less than 1500 per microliter (1500/microL) is the generally accepted definition of neutropenia. Neutropenia is sometimes further classified as:''Some medical terms may be used synonymously with neutropenia, even though their precise definitions are different.'   mild if the ANC ranges from 1000-1500/microL, moderate with an ANC of 500-1000/microL, and severe if the ANC is below 500/microL. Leukopenia refers to a reduced number of white blood cells in general, while granulocytopenia refers to a decreased number of all the granulocyte-type blood cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils). Since neutrophils normally far outnumber the other types of granulocytes, this term is sometimes used to refer to neutropenia. Finally, agranulocytosis literally refers to a complete absence of all granulocytes, but this term is sometimes used to refer to severe neutropenia."
Does neutropenia put a person at risk for bacterial infections?,"'Neutropenia results in an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. The degree of risk depends upon the cause and severity of the neutropenia, the underlying medical condition of the patient, and the presence or absence of bone marrow reserves for the production of neutrophils.''The most common types of infection seen in neutropenic patients (patients with low white blood cell counts) are caused by bacteria normally found on the skin (such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'') or from the gastrointestinal and urinary tract. ''Fungal infections'' are also more frequent in patients with neutropenia. The infections may be limited to certain areas of the body (commonly the oral ''cavity'', genital area, and skin) or may spread via the bloodstream to the lungs and other organs in severe, prolonged neutropenia.' "
How is neutropenia diagnosed?,"'Neutropenia is diagnosed by a blood cell count performed on a sample of blood removed from a vein. To determine the specific cause of neutropenia in a given situation, other tests may be required. Sometimes a ''bone marrow biopsy'' may be required to diagnose the specific cause of neutropenia.'  "
What is the treatment for neutropenia?,"'Treatment of neutropenia is based upon the underlying cause, severity, and the presence of associated infections or symptoms as well as the overall health status of the patient. Obviously, treatment must also be directed toward any underlying disease process. Treatments that directly address neutropenia may include (note that all of these treatments may not be appropriate in a given setting):''Preventive measures may also be implemented in neutropenic patients to limit risk of infections. These measures might include strict attention to hand washing, use of private rooms, or in some cases, use of gloves, gowns, and/or face masks by caregivers.'   antibiotic and/or antifungal medications to help fight infections; administration of white blood cells growth factors (such as recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim (Neupogen); sargramostim (Leukine); a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or pegfilgrastim (Neulasta), a long-acting form of filgrastim) in some cases of severe neutropenia; granulocyte transfusions; and corcorticosteroid therapy or intravenous immune globulin for some cases of immune-mediated neutropenia."
What is potassium? What is low potassium? Why do we need it?,"'Potassium enters the body through ''diet'' and is one of the primary ''electrolytes'"" (crucial chemicals for cell function), and is concentrated within the cells of the body. Only 2% of the body's total potassium is available in the serum or bloodstream. Small changes in the serum levels of potassium can affect body function. One of the more important functions of potassium is to maintain the electrical activity of the cells in the body. Cells with high electrical activity (for example, nerves and muscles, including the ""'heart'') are particularly affected when potassium levels fall.'""Normal serum potassium levels range from 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in the blood. Normal daily intake of potassium is 70-100 mEq (270 to 390 mg/dl) and requires the kidneys to remove that same amount each day. If more is removed, the body's total potassium store will be decreased, and the result is hypokalemia (hypo=low + kal=potassium +emia= in the blood) occurs."" "
Which foods are rich in potassium?,"'Potassium enters the body through dietary intake. Examples of potassium rich foods include:' Fresh fruits: bananas, cantaloupe, oranges, strawberries, kiwi, avocados, apricots Fresh vegetables: greens, mushrooms, peas, beets, tomatoes Meats: beef, fish, turkey, Juices: Orange, prune, apricot, grapefruit"
What are the symptoms and signs of low potassium?,"'Potassium affects the way neuromuscular cells discharge energy (depolarize) and then regenerate (repolarize) that energy to be able to fire again. When potassium levels are low, the cells cannot repolarize and are unable to fire repeatedly, and muscles and nerves may not function normally. The effects of low potassium include may cause the following symptoms:'   muscle weakness, muscle aches, muscle cramps, and heart palpitations (irregular heartbeats)."
What are the causes (reasons) of low potassium?,"'Hypokalemia is not commonly caused by poor dietary intake.''The most common reason that potassium levels fall is due to the loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the kidney.''Potassium loss from the GI tract may be caused by:''Causes of potassium loss from the kidney:''Low potassium levels may result from side effects of some medications:' Vomiting Diarrhea Ileostomy: In some patients who have had bowel surgery and have an ileostomy, the stool output can contain significant amounts of potassium. Villous adenoma (a type of colon polyp that can cause the colon to leak potassium) Laxative use Diuretic medications (water pills) like hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or furosemide (Lasix) Elevated corticosteroid levels, either from medication like prednisone or from an illness like Cushing's Syndrome Elevated levels of aldosterone, a hormone that can increase with renal artery stenosis or adrenal tumors Renal tubular acidosis Low body magnesium levels Aminoglycosides like gentamicin (Garamycin) or tobramycin (Nebcin) Amphotericin B Prednisone"
What tests diagnose low potassium?,"'Potassium levels in the blood may be easily measured by routine blood tests.''Low potassium is often a potential complication of medication. For example, patients with ''high blood pressure'' who are being treated with diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide (''Hydrodiuril'') or furosemide (Lasix) often have their potassium levels monitored.''Patients who become ill with ''vomiting'' and ''diarrhea'', might develop ''dehydration'' and weakness. Part of the patient evaluation may include having their ''electrolyte'' levels tested in order to determine whether body potassium losses may need to be replaced.''There can be ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'') changes associated with low potassium, and sometimes the diagnosis of low potassium is made incidentally by finding the characteristic ""U"" waves on the EKG tracing. In severe cases, hypokalemia can lead to dangerous disturbances in heart rhythm (dysrhythmia).'  "
What is the treatment for low potassium? Is it dangerous?,"""Serum potassium levels above 3.0 mEq/liter are not considered dangerous or of great concern; they can be treated with potassium replacement by mouth. Depending on the patient's medical condition, other medical problems, and the patient's symptoms, serum levels lower than 3.0 mEq/liter may require intravenous replacement. Decisions are patient-specific and depend upon the diagnosis, the circumstances of the illness, and the patient's ability to tolerate fluid and medication by mouth.""'Over the short-term, with self-limited illnesses like ''gastroenteritis'' with vomiting and ''diarrhea'', the body is able to regulate and restore potassium levels on its own. However, if the hypokalemia is severe, or the losses of potassium are predicted to be ongoing, potassium replacement or supplementation may be required.''In those patients taking diuretics, often a small amount of oral potassium may be prescribed since the loss will continue as long as the medication is prescribed. Oral ''supplements'' may be in pill or liquid form, and the dosages are measured in mEq (milliequivalents). Common doses are 10-20mEq per day. Alternatively, consumption of foods high in potassium may be the first option in replacing potassium. Bananas, apricots, oranges, and tomatoes are high in potassium content. Since potassium is excreted in the kidney, blood tests that monitor kidney function may be ordered to predict and prevent potassium levels from rising too high.''When potassium needs to be given intravenously, it must be given slowly. Potassium is irritating to the vein and is usually administered at a maximal rate of 10 mEq per hour. Moreover, infusing potassium too quickly can cause heart irritation and promote potentially dangerous rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia.''Rarely, a special situation will occur when all the potassium in the body shifts from the serum into the cells of the body. This drops the serum potassium levels to 1.0 mEq/liter or lower. This causes immediate muscle weakness to the point that the patient cannot move and becomes paralyzed. Arms and legs are most affected. Rarely, ''breathing'' and swallowing muscles can be involved.''Periodic ''paralysis'' may be hereditary (genetic) and may be precipitated by excessive ''exercise'', a high carbohydrate or high salt meal, or may occur without apparent cause.''Treatment by potassium replacement intravenously is effective, and recovery occurs within 24 hours.'  "
Can low potassium be prevented?,"'Usually, the body is able to maintain potassium levels within the normal range as long as there is adequate potassium in the ''diet''. When the body loses potassium due to a short-term illness, it is able to compensate for the loss. If your potassium loss is continues, it is important for the you and your doctor to anticipate the loss, and consider routine potassium replacement.'  "
What is the  definition of low testosterone (low-T)?,"'The low limit of testosterone levels in men is about 300 nanograms per deciliter and the upper normal limit is approximately 1000-1200 ng/dl. A low level needs to be investigated further to distinguish it from normal ''aging''.'   Testosterone is a hormone required for male development and sexual function and is produced primarily in the testicles. Testosterone is responsible for building muscle and bone mass, sperm production, and sex drive. Testosterone influences male pattern fat distribution, bone density, and red blood cell production. In the normal developing male, testosterone peaks during early adulthood. Once you reach age 30, testosterone levels slowly decline by approximately 1% a year. This is a normal part of aging."
What is low testosterone (low-T)?," Low testosterone (low-T) is underproduction or lack of production of testosterone in men and women. Causes of low-T include chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, infections, obesity, or other hormonal conditions. Symptoms of low-T include:Change in sleep patternsReduced sex drive (low libido)Sexual dysfunctionInfertilityEmotional changesDecreased strengthWeight gain Change in sleep patterns Reduced sex drive (low libido) Sexual dysfunction Infertility Emotional changes Decreased strength Weight gain Low-T testing includes linking symptoms with testosterone blood levels. Treatment options for low-T include different forms of testosterone replacement therapy."
What causes low testosterone (low-T)?,"'Some of the conditions that can lead to a low level are:'   Obesity Diabetes (type 2) Chronic medical conditions (especially liver or kidney disease) Hormonal disorders Infections Medications (narcotics, chemotherapy)"
What are low testosterone (low-T) symptoms and signs?,"'It is important to distinguish between a normal decline of testosterone levels and hypogonadism.''Signs and symptoms of ''low testosterone'' include:''Although testosterone therapy helps with hypogonadism, whether it helps in the reversal or slowing of normal effects of ''aging'' and lower testosterone levels is unclear. Several published research articles have conflicting results and more research is needed to make a final determination about the use of testosterone for healthy ''aging'' males.'

   Change in sleep patterns: insomnia or sleep disturbances Physical changes: increased body fat and reduced muscle bulk Sexual changes: reduced sexual desires, sexual dysfunction, or infertility Emotional changes: decreased motivations, depression Worsening of sleep apnea Worsening of congestive heart failure"
How do you know if you have low testosterone (low-T)?,"'The diagnosis of low-T is based on correlating a low blood level (300 ng/dl or below) with symptoms.''Most of the symptoms are very apparent (see previously), but some need to be further investigated (such as low ''bone density'').' "
What are the treatment options for low testosterone (low-T)?,"'Treatment of ''low testosterone'' in hypogonadism is a fully accepted therapy. Treatment in older men is more controversial. Discuss your testosterone levels, symptoms, and side effects of treatment with your doctor to establish whether you should receive therapy and what form of therapy.''There are several ways that testosterone therapy can be administered:''Why no pills? Testosterone is available as a pill but some experts believe long-term oral delivery of testosterone can have negative effects on the ''liver'"". These other delivery methods bypass the liver (as they don't involve a pill being absorbed through the stomach/intestine) and go directly into the blood stream.""   Transdermal (skin patch): Usually applied once a day (for example, Androderm). Tends to be clean and easy to apply. There is an available mouth patch that sticks to the upper gums and is applied twice daily. Gels: Applied directly to the skin and then absorbed through the skin (for example, AndroGel, and Axiron). Dosing is more difficult although these gels are available in single applications packages or premeasured pumps. Injections: Testosterone can be delivered by direct injection. Pellets: Pellets can be implanted into the soft tissue and release the testosterone."

Should I take testosterone?,"'The definite verdict on testosterone therapy is still out. Testosterone therapy is accepted as a treatment for hypogonadism, a clearly defined medical condition.''In older adults who have markedly decreased testosterone levels without significant symptoms or who have modestly decreased levels with significant symptoms, testosterone therapy should be considered after a discussion with your doctor about side effects and possible positive effects of therapy.''There is no clear proof that testosterone therapy is helpful in reversing any aspects of natural aging in males.' "
What is a glycemic index?,"'Glycemic index'' (GI) is a numeric value assigned to foods based on how slowly or quickly they can increase your blood glucose levels. It is a rating system for carbohydrate-containing foods. Foods having a low GI are the ones that tend to release glucose slowly and steadily. By contrast, foods that fall high on the GI scale release glucose rapidly.''Foods with a low GI help to facilitate ''weight loss'' and promote satiety. People who have or are at a risk of ''diabetes'' should eat foods with a low GI. This is because they tend to have low amounts of ''insulin'' (''type 1 diabetes'') or a high degree of resistance to insulin (''type 2 diabetes''). Insulin is the hormone that keeps the blood glucose levels under check. In its absence, blood sugars may increase when a person eats high-glycemic foods. Low-glycemic foods release ''sugar'' gradually and thus will prevent an abrupt increase in blood ''sugar''.''High-glycemic foods help with energy recovery after ''exercise''. High-glycemic foods also aid recovery from ''low blood glucose'' levels (''hypoglycemia'').''GI is assigned with reference to pure glucose that is arbitrarily given a GI of 100. Thus, if a food has a GI of 30, it means it will boost blood glucose by only 30% compared with pure glucose.' "
What value constitutes a low glycemic index?,"'Low glycemic index\xa0(GI) refers to a GI value of 55 or less. Low-GI foods include most fruits and vegetables, whole or minimally processed grains, beans, pasta, low-fat dairy products and nuts.''Foods with a GI of 56 to 69 come under the category of moderate-GI foods. They include potatoes, white rice, ''corn'', couscous and breakfast cereals such as Mini-Wheats and Cream of Wheat.''High GI\xa0means a GI of 70 or more. Foods with high GI include white bread, cakes, doughnuts, cookies, rice cakes, most crackers, bagels, croissants and most packaged breakfast cereals.' "
Which are the low-glycemic foods?,"'Some of the common low-glycemic foods are as follows''Most vegetables''Certain fruits''Whole or minimally processed grains''Dairy and dairy-substitute products''Miscellaneous' Green peas Onions Lettuce Cabbage Leafy greens such as spinach, collards, kale, and beet Green beans Tomatoes Cucumbers Bok choy Artichokes Brussels sprouts Broccoli Cauliflower Celery Eggplant Peppers including bell peppers and jalapeno Zucchini  Crookneck squash Snow peas Mushrooms Apples Pears Plum Avocado Olives Dried apricots Unripe banana Peaches Strawberries Oranges Cherries Coconut Grapefruit Cranberries Blueberries Barley Whole wheat  Oat bran and rice bran cereals Whole-grain pasta Whole-grain pumpernickel bread Sourdough bread Wheat tortilla Plain yogurt Cheese Cottage cheese Milk  Soy milk and yogurt Nuts and nut butters  Seeds such as pumpkin, chia, sunflower and flax seeds Poultry such as chicken and turkey Eggs and egg whites Fish and shellfish Meat such as beef and pork Oils such as extra virgin olive oil and canola oil Fats such as lard, shortening and butter Mayonnaise"
What is cholesterol?,"   Cholesterol is a chemical compound that is naturally produced by the body and is structurally a combination of fat (lipid) and steroid. Cholesterol is a building block for cell membranes and for hormones, for example, estrogen and testosterone. The liver produces about 80% of the body's cholesterol, while the rest comes from our diet. The main sources of dietary cholesterol are meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. Organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in cholesterol content, while foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. After a meal, dietary cholesterol is absorbed from the intestine and stored in the liver. The liver is able to regulate cholesterol levels in the bloodstream and can secrete cholesterol if the body needs it."
"What are ""normal"" cholesterol blood levels?","'There are no established ""normal"" blood levels for total and LDL cholesterol. In most other blood tests in medicine, normal ranges can be set by taking measurements from large number of healthy subjects. The normal range of LDL cholesterol among ""healthy"" adults (adults with no known coronary ''heart disease'') in the United States may be too high. The atherosclerosis process may be quietly progressing in many healthy children and adults with average LDL cholesterol blood levels, putting them at risk of developing coronary ''heart disease'' in the future.' "
What are HDL cholesterol (good) vs. LDL cholesterol (bad)? What do they do?," LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) is called ""bad"" cholesterol because elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. LDL lipoprotein deposits cholesterol along the inside of artery walls, causing the formation of a hard, thick substance called cholesterol plaque. Over time, cholesterol plaque causes thickening of the artery walls and narrowing of the lumen of the arteries, a process called atherosclerosis, which decreases blood flow through the narrowed plaque-filled vessel. Narrowing of blood vessels in the heart may lead to angina (a type of chest pain) or heart attack. Narrowing of blood vessels in the brain may cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Narrowing of the arteries throughout the body (peripheral artery disease) can lead to signs and symptoms of pain, including in the intestine (mesenteric ischemia) and in the legs with walking (claudication). HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein) is called the ""good cholesterol"" because HDL cholesterol particles prevent atherosclerosis by extracting cholesterol from the artery walls and disposing of them through the liver. High levels of LDL cholesterol and low levels of HDL cholesterol (high LDL/HDL ratios) are risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attacks Low levels of LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol (low LDL/HDL ratios) are desirable and protect against heart disease and stroke. Very low and very high HDL cholesterol levels can run in families. Families with low HDL cholesterol levels have a higher incidence of heart attacks than the general population, while families with high HDL cholesterol levels tend to live longer with a lower frequency of heart attacks. LDL cholesterol, lifestyle factors, and other conditions influence HDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels tend to be lower in persons who smoke cigarettes or have type 2 diabetes and in those who are overweight or inactive. HDL cholesterol is higher in people who are lean, exercise regularly, and do not smoke cigarettes. Estrogen increases a person's HDL cholesterol, which explains why women generally have higher HDL levels than men do. The combination of low levels of total and LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol is favorable. Total cholesterol is the sum of LDL (low-density) cholesterol, HDL (high-density) cholesterol, VLDL (very low-density) cholesterol, and IDL (intermediate density) cholesterol. The liver manufactures and secretes LDL cholesterol into the blood. It also removes LDL cholesterol from the blood by active LDL receptors on the surface of its cells. A decrease in the number of liver cell LDL receptors is associated with high LDL cholesterol blood levels. Both heredity and diet have a significant influence on a person's LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (an inherited form of very high cholesterol in the blood) is a disorder in which patients have a diminished number or nonexistent LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells. People with this disorder also tend to develop atherosclerosis and heart attacks during early adulthood. Diets that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol raise the levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. Fats are classified as saturated or unsaturated (according to their chemical structure). Saturated fats are derived primarily from meat and dairy products and can raise blood cholesterol levels. Some vegetable oils made from coconut, palm, and cocoa are high in saturated fats."
What are the cholesterol guidelines to prevent heart attack and stroke,"'The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have guidelines to help health-care professionals counsel patients on how to decrease the risk of suffering a heart attack or ''stroke''. Since it takes years for cholesterol plaque to narrow arteries enough to cause blood flow problems, there is opportunity to intervene early to stop the progression of this narrowing.''In addition to controlling cholesterol, the guidelines ''stress'' lifelong control of ''high blood pressure'' and ''diabetes'', and the new guidelines ''stress'':''The previous goal of maintaining ""normal"" cholesterol levels has been replaced by an approach that suggests more people may benefit from cholesterol-lowering statin medications, and not just those with ''high cholesterol'' levels. These four groups include patients:'""The goal for statin therapy is to decrease the LDL blood levels. In patients' prescribed high intensity statin therapy, the goal is to lower LDL levels by 50%. For those who have medium intensity statin therapy, the goal is a LDL reduction of 30% to 50%."" Weight control Diet Exercise Mandatory smoking cessation With known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) With LDL cholesterol levels (the ""bad"" cholesterol) higher than 190 mg/dL With diabetes and without ASCVD, aged 40-75 whose LDL cholesterol is between 70-189 mg/dL Without diabetes or ASCVD with a 10-year risk of developing heart disease that is greater than 7.5%. An online calculator from the American Heart Association may be used to help predict this risk"
What are LDL/HDL and total/HDL ranges and ratios?,"'The'' total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio (total chol/HDL) ''is a number helpful in estimating the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The number is obtained by dividing total cholesterol by HDL cholesterol. (High ratios indicate a higher risk of ''heart attacks'', whereas low ratios indicate a lower risk).''High total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol increases the ratio and is undesirable. Conversely, high HDL cholesterol and low total cholesterol lowers the ratio and is desirable. Ideally, one should strive for ratios of 2 or 3 (less than 4).' "
How can levels of HDL cholesterol be increased?," The first step in increasing HDL cholesterol levels (and decreasing LDL/HDL ratios) is by implementing and maintaining therapeutic life style changes. Regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess weight (fat), and smoking cessation will increase HDL cholesterol levels. Regular alcohol consumption in moderation (such as one drink a day) will also raise HDL cholesterol. Because of other adverse health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, alcohol is not recommended as a standard treatment for low HDL cholesterol."
"How can high LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol levels be lowered?","'“It must be emphasized that lifestyle modification (i.e., adhering to a heart healthy ''diet'', regular ''exercise'' habits, avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance of a healthy weight) remains a critical component of health promotion and ASCVD risk reduction, both prior to and in concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapies.”''- 2013 ''ACC''/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults''Newer medications, PCSK9 protein antibodies, Alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) are potentially useful in treating certain patients where diet and ''statins'' have failed to adequately lower LDL level.'   Therapeutic lifestyle changes to lower LDL cholesterol can help lower and maintain levels naturally. This may involve:Excess weight lossGetting regular exerciseEating a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol Excess weight loss Getting regular exercise Eating a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol Medications to lower cholesterol: Medications are prescribed when lifestyle changes cannot reduce the LDL cholesterol to desired levels. The most effective and widely used medications to lower LDL cholesterol are called statins. Research has shown that only these statin drugs have a proven benefit to decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. Other medications prescribed to lower cholesterol profiles include fibrates such as gemfibrozil (Lopid), resins such as cholestyramine (Questran), and ezetimibe (Zetia)."
14 Foods that help lower cholesterol levels,"'A healthy diet that minimizes cholesterol intake is a good first step in using food to decrease cholesterol levels in the blood. Extra lean meats, skim milk, and vegetable-based ""butter-like"" substitutes may help decrease LDL levels in the bloodstream.''In addition to diet, exercise, and ''weight loss'', there are foods that may help in lowering and rebalancing the cholesterol -- increasing HDL (the good) and decreasing LDL (the bad).''Increasing soluble ''fiber'' in the diet helps decrease both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Sources include:''Nuts are healthy. Nuts that may be helpful in ''lowering cholesterol'' levels include:''However, nuts are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. Avoid nuts covered with salt or ''sugar''.' Oatmeal Oat bran Avariety of vegetables and fruits, for example, apples, pears, and prunes The goal for consumption of dietary fiber is 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber a day (a cup of oatmeal has 4 grams of fiber and an apple contains 3 grams). Olive oil acts as an antioxidant to decrease LDL levels and does not affect levels of good HDL cholesterol. Foods fortified with plant sterols and stanols decrease cholesterol absorption in the intestine. They can be found in cereal, margarines, and yogurts. Read labels to discover which foods are fortified with these beneficial plant compounds. Sterols and stanols may also be found as a dietary supplement. Soy and foods containing soy products may help decrease LDL levels. Almonds Hazelnuts Peanuts Pecans Pine nuts Pistachios Walnuts Certain fish contain omega-3 fatty acids that lower cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association recommends at least 2 to 3 servings per week in the diet. Fatty fish that are helpful include salmon, halibut, mackerel, trout, herring, and sardines. It's best to grill or bake fish and to avoid frying."
"What medications lower cholesterol, lipids, and triglycerides?","'Lipid-altering medications are used to lower blood levels of undesirable ''lipids'' such as LDL cholesterol and ''triglycerides'' and increase blood levels of desirable ''lipids'' such as HDL cholesterol. Several classes of medications are available in the United States, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, and medications that decrease intestinal cholesterol absorption (''bile acid sequestrants'' and cholesterol absorption inhibitors). Some of these medications are primarily useful in lowering LDL cholesterol, others in lowering ''triglycerides'', and some in elevating HDL cholesterol. Medications also can be combined to more aggressively lower LDL, as well as lower LDL and increase HDL at the same time.''Newer medications, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) have been approved to help lower LDL levels in certain pateints where diet and other statin medications have not worked adequately.''Note: Dosing guidelines change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guideline concerning the potential dangers of taking the 80 mg dose of ''simvastatin'' (''Zocor'').'  "
Is lowering LDL cholesterol enough?,"'The reduction of LDL cholesterol is only part of the battle against atherosclerosis. Individuals who have normal or only mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels can still develop atherosclerosis and heart attacks even in the absence of other risk factors such as ''cigarette smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes''.' "
Does lowering LDL cholesterol prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'The benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol are:''The same measures that decrease narrowing in coronary arteries also may benefit the large arteries in the neck and brain (carotid and cerebral arteries) as well as the femoral arteries that supply blood to the legs and the arteries that supply blood to the intestine.' Reduces or stops the formation of new cholesterol plaques on the artery walls Reduces existing cholesterol plaques on the artery walls and widening the arteries Prevents the rupture of cholesterol plaques, which initiates blood clot formation and blocks blood vessels causing heart attack or stroke Decreases the risk of heart attacks Decreases the risk of strokes Decreases the risk of peripheral artery disease"
What are triglycerides and VLDL?,"'Triglyceride is a fatty substance that is composed of three fatty acids. Like cholesterol, triglyceride in the blood comes either from the diet or the liver. In addition, like cholesterol, triglyceride cannot dissolve and circulate in the blood without combining with a lipoprotein.''The liver removes triglyceride from the blood and it synthesizes and packages triglyceride into VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) particles and releases them back into the blood circulation.' "
What causes elevated triglyceride levels?,"'High triglyceride blood levels (hypertriglyceridemia) may be genetic or they may be acquired. Examples of ''inherited'' hypertriglyceridemia disorders include mixed hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.''Hypertriglyceridemia can often be caused by nongenetic factors such as ''obesity'', excessive alcohol intake, ''diabetes mellitus'', ''kidney disease'', and estrogen-containing medications such as ''birth control pills''.' "
Do high triglyceride levels cause atherosclerosis?,"'Whether elevated ''triglyceride levels'' in the blood lead to atherosclerosis and heart attacks is controversial. While abnormally high ''triglyceride levels'' may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis, it is difficult to conclusively prove that elevated triglyceride by itself can cause atherosclerosis. Elevated ''triglyceride levels'' are often associated with other conditions that increase the risk of atherosclerosis including ''obesity''; low levels of HDL cholesterol; ''insulin resistance''; poorly-controlled ''diabetes''; and small, dense LDL cholesterol particles.' "
How can elevated blood triglyceride levels be treated?,"'Diet is the first step in treating hypertriglyceridemia. A low-fat diet, regular ''aerobic exercise'', loss of excess weight, reduction of alcohol consumption, and stopping ''cigarette smoking'' may be enough to control ''triglyceride levels'' in the blood. In patients with diabetes, meticulous control of elevated blood glucose is also important. This can be monitored by measuring the hemoblobin A1c levels in the blood.''When medications are necessary, ''fibrates'' (such as ''gemfibrozil'' [''Lopid'']), nicotinic acid, and statin medications can be used. Lopid not only decreases triglyceride levels but also increases HDL cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol particle size. Nicotinic acid lowers triglyceride levels and increases HDL cholesterol levels and the size of LDL cholesterol particles.''Statins are effective for decreasing triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels and, to a lesser extent, elevating HDL cholesterol levels.'  "
What is a barium enema series?,"'A lower GI series, also known as a barium enema, barium enema procedure, barium enema X-ray or double-contrast barium enema, is an X-ray test in which a white liquid, called barium, is infused through a catheter (tube) inserted through the anus and into the rectum until it fills the large bowel (colon). X-ray films of the colon then are taken so that the outline of the colon can be seen.    The barium enema and double contrast barium enema are used to define normal and abnormal anatomy of the colon and rectum. Colon and rectal abnormalities that can be detected include ''diverticulosis'', polyps, dilation of the colon, ''Hirschsprung disease'' in infants, and colon ''cancers''.'  "
What are the risks of a lower barium enema?,"'Distention of the colon is uncomfortable, but only a few patients find it very painful. Any X-ray test procedure involves some risk of radiation exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques which have been developed and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils. All radiology technologists are certified by national certifying boards.  ''Women who are or may be pregnant should notify the doctor requesting the procedure and the radiology staff, as there is a potential risk of harm to the fetus with any radiation exposure.  Complications of barium enema examination are rare.  The tip of the enema catheter or distention of the colon can penetrate the wall of the colon and give rise to a localized infection (''abscess'') or ''peritonitis'' (generalized infection of the abdominal ''cavity'').  This usually occurs only when excessive pressure is used to infuse the barium or there is already a diseased colon that is weakened.'  "
"How does the patient prepare for a lower barium enema, and how is it performed?","'Any internal or external materials that make an X-ray image less clear can interfere with the accuracy of a barium enema. Therefore, before undergoing a barium enema (lower GI), it is important to eliminate as much fecal material from the colon and rectum as is possible. Prior to the examination, a clear ''liquid diet'' and cleansing enemas often are used to empty the colon. Further medications that help evacuate the bowel are usually used. This is called a bowel prep. External materials such as extra clothing, metallic devices, or jewelry are removed prior to the test. A radiologist (a doctor specializing in the use and interpretation of ''X-rays'') and a radiology technologist work perform the procedure on the patient.'   A barium enema involves filling the colon and rectum with a white liquid material (barium) through a catheter (tube) inserted into the rectum through the anus. It is normal during the procedure to feel some fullness or mild discomfort in the abdomen. Subsequently, an X-ray machine is placed in front of the patient with X-ray film behind. Images of the colon then are obtained by exposing the abdomen to the radiation. The contrast in density between the barium-filled colon and other structures of the abdomen are apparent on the X-ray film and give an excellent outline of the colon. The radiologist also will use a fluoroscope, an X-ray device on which the barium can be seen in motion flowing into the colon. Further static images of the colon then are obtained on plain X-ray film or digital computerized image. The barium then may be drained so that only a small amount of barium remains sticking to the lining of the colon, and air is infused into the colon to distend it. Further X-rays then are taken which give more detail of colon's lining than the X-rays of the barium-filled colon. This latter procedure is called a double contrast barium enema since both air and barium are used to provide the images. Polyps and small cancers are more readily found using this technique (called an air contrast barium enema). A barium enema can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour depending on the problem being studied and the particular anatomy of the patient's colon."
How does the patient obtain the results of a lower barium enema series?,"'After the X-ray films are developed by the radiology technologist, they are transmitted to the radiologist, who interprets the body structures visualized on the X-ray film. An interpretation and report of the barium enema is forwarded to the doctor who requested the test usually within one to two days. The doctor then can review the results of the report with the patient. The actual films of the examination also can be sent to the health care practitioner if necessary.' "
What is a lumbar puncture (LP)?,"'A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the spinal canal to collect and examine the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebral spinal fluid). It is termed a ""lumbar puncture"" because the needle is placed in the lumbar portion of the back and used to puncture through tissues to enter the spinal canal.''Other names for a lumbar puncture (an LP) include spinal tap, spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis.' "
Why is a lumbar puncture done?,"'An LP is most commonly performed to obtain a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Examination of the fluid can be crucial in diagnosing diseases such as meningitis, neurologic diseases, or effects of systemic disease on the brain and spinal fluid. An LP can also be done to treat diseases, and as a way of administering antibiotics, ''cancer'' ''drugs'', or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, normal-pressure ''hydrocephalus'' and ''benign intracranial hypertension'', for example).''Sometimes a lumbar puncture is performed in patients with ''migraines'' to assure that no other underlying pathology exists.'  "
How is the LP procedure performed?,"'Patients typically lie on their side for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up and leaning slightly forward.''After local anesthesia is injected into the lumbar area of the back, a long needle is inserted in between the bones of the spine (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is most commonly placed between the third and fourth ''lumbar vertebrae''.)''Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing.' "
What is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?,"'The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This ""water bath"" acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury.''The normal CSF appears clear and contains various substances, such as protein and ''sugar'' (glucose), and few if any cells. The spinal fluid also has a normal pressure when first removed.' "
What is normal CSF?,"'Normal values for spinal fluid examination are as follows:''These normal values can be altered by injury or disease of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues. The values are routinely evaluated during examination of the spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture. Additionally, spinal fluid is tested for infection in the microbiology laboratory.''A health care professional will usually review and interpret the test results with the patient. These results often will need to be evaluated in relation to other blood and radiologic test results.' Protein (15-60 mg/dl) Glucose (50-80 mg/dl) Cell count (0-5 mononuclear cells) Initial pressure (70-180 mm)"
What diseases are diagnosed by examination of the CSF?,"'Spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose many important diseases such as bleeding around the brain; increased pressure from ''hydrocephalus''; inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues (''encephalitis'', meningitis); tumors of the brain or spinal cord, etc. Sometimes spinal fluid can indicate diseases of the immune system, such as ''multiple sclerosis''.' "
"What are possible risks, complications, or side effects of a lumbar puncture?","'When spinal fluid is removed during an LP, the risks include ''headache''\xa0from a persistent spinal fluid leak, brain herniation, bleeding, and infection. Each of these complications are uncommon with the exception of ''headache'', which can appear from hours to up to a day after a lumbar puncture. Up to 25% of patients will get ''headaches'' after the procedure. ''Headaches'' occur less frequently when the patient remains lying flat several hours after the procedure.'  "
What are the benefits of a lumbar puncture?,"'The benefits of the LP depend upon the exact situation for which it is performed, but a lumbar puncture can provide lifesaving information.' "
What is lichen sclerosus?,"'Lichen sclerosus is a long-term problem that usually affects the skin of the genital and anal areas. The disease can also appear on the upper body, breasts, and upper arms.''The disease does not cause ''skin cancer'' but may increase your risk for ''cancer'' if your skin is scarred. You should see your doctor every six to 12 months in order to follow and treat skin changes.' "
"Who gets 
it?",'Lichen sclerosus appears:' Most often in women (usually after menopause). Less often in men. Rarely in children.
What are the symptoms?,"'You may have no symptoms if you have a mild form of the disease. If you do have signs, they can include:'   Small white spots on the skin (early in the disease). Spots that grow into bigger patches. The skin over these patches become thin and crinkled. Skin that tears and bruises. Skin that becomes scarred. Itching, which is very common. Pain. Bleeding. Blisters."
What causes it?,"""You can't give lichen sclerosus to someone else. No one knows what exactly causes the disease. Some possible causes include:"" An overactive immune system. Hormone problems. Inheriting the risk for getting the disease from your parents. An injury that damaged or scarred the skin."
Is there a test for it?,"'Usually a doctor will take a small piece of skin and look at it under a microscope to diagnose lichen sclerosus. In more severe cases, doctors can just look at you to diagnose the disease based upon how it has affected your skin.'  "
How is it treated?,"'Patches on the arms or upper body usually go away after time without treatment. The disease may also go away after ''puberty''.'""Patches of the genital skin should be treated, even if they aren't painful or ""'itchy''. These patches can ''scar'', causing problems with urination or sex. There is also a very small chance that ''skin cancer'' may develop in the patches. You should see your doctor every six to 12 months in order to follow and treat any skin changes.''Possible treatments for the disease include:''You should talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you.'   Ointments and creams, which can help with itching and to keep the disease from coming back. Surgery to remove the genital patches in men."
Who treats it?,'Lichen sclerosus is treated by:'   Dermatologists (doctors who treat the skin). Gynecologists (doctors who treat the female reproductive system). Urologists (doctors who treat the urinary or urogenital tract). Primary health care providers.

Introduction to LTK Laser eye Surgery,"'Laser thermokeratoplasty, or LTK ''laser eye surgery'', is a new procedure used to treat ''farsightedness'' and ''astigmatism''.''During LTK laser eye surgery, a laser beam uses heat to shrink and reshape the ''cornea''. Vision problems from ''farsightedness'' or ''astigmatism'' are corrected in a matter of seconds, without any cutting or removal of tissue.''Although highly effective in the short-term, the results of LTK laser eye surgery are not permanent. Your vision gradually regresses, mostly during the first three months following LTK laser eye surgery. To compensate, the doctor will intentionally overcorrect, so you end up with your desired vision.' "
What are the advantages of LTK laser eye surgery?,'The advantages of LTK laser eye surgery include:' Little risk of infection or vision loss since the laser is the only thing that touches the eye during LTK laser eye surgery. LTK laser eye surgery s very fast. Little discomfort results from LTK laser eye surgery and patients are often able to resume normal activities the following day.
What Are the Disadvantages of LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,'The disadvantages of LTK laser eye surgery include:' LTK laser eye surgery is not permanent. Patients experience temporary nearsightedness following the procedure since over-correction of vision is required to account for regression. Some patients may even need to wear glasses for a few weeks following LTK laser eye surgery. It is common for people who have had the LTK laser eye surgery to lose about half of the corrective effects within two years of the surgery.
What Are the Potential Side Effects of LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Other than nearsightedness, you may also feel as if you have a foreign object in your eye. But this sensation should go away after the first day with the help of eye drops given to you by your doctor. You may also experience ''sensitivity to light'' the first day or so following LTK laser eye surgery, but ''pain'' or other discomfort is rarely associated with this procedure.' "
Who's a Candidate for LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Due to its non-permanent effects, LTK laser eye surgery is only performed in people over the age of 40 who are mildly farsighted. Other than age, the qualifications for this surgery are the same as the  qualifications for any refractive surgery.' "
How Should I Prepare for LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'Before your LTK laser eye surgery you will meet with a coordinator who will discuss what you should expect during and after the surgery. During this session your medical history will be evaluated and your eyes will be tested. Likely tests include measuring corneal thickness, refraction, and pupil dilation. Once you have gone through your evaluation, you will meet the surgeon, who will answer any further questions you may have. Afterwards, you can schedule an appointment for the procedure.''If you wear rigid ''gas'' permeable ''contact lenses'"", you should not wear them for three weeks before your surgery. Other types of contact lenses shouldn't be worn for at least three days prior to surgery. Be sure to bring your ""'eyeglasses'' to the surgeon so your prescription can be reviewed.''On the day of your surgery, eat a light meal before going to the doctor and take all of your prescribed medications. Do not wear eye ''makeup'"" or have any bulky accessories in your hair that will interfere with positioning your head under the laser. If you do not feel well that morning, call the doctor's office to determine whether the procedure needs to be postponed."" "
What Happens During the LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'LTK laser eye surgery is done under a local anesthesia. During LTK laser eye surgery, a laser beam uses heat to shrink and reshape the cornea. Vision is corrected in a matter of seconds, without any cutting or removal of tissue.' "
What Should I Expect After LTK Laser Eye Surgery?,"'After LTK laser eye surgery, most doctors will schedule follow-up appointments for the next day as well as for one week, one month, and 3-6 months after LTK laser eye surgery. To prevent infection or any irritation that may occur, you will be given antibiotic drops as well as anti-inflammatory drops to take for one week after LTK laser eye surgery.''As previously mentioned, for the first week after LTK laser eye surgery it is common to experience nearsightedness, however as the regression slows your distance vision will improve considerably. From the end of the first week to 3 months following LTK laser eye surgery, you should expect some fluctuations of vision.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.    ' "
What is the anatomy of the low back?,"'To understand various causes of ''low back pain'', it is important to appreciate the normal design (anatomy) of the tissues of this area of the body. Important structures of the low back that can be related to symptoms in this region include the bony lumbar spine (vertebrae, singular = vertebra), discs between the vertebrae, ligaments around the spine and discs, spinal cord and nerves, muscles of the low back, internal organs of the pelvis and abdomen, and the skin covering the lumbar area.''The bony lumbar spine is designed so that vertebrae ""stacked"" together can provide a movable support structure while also protecting the spinal cord from injury. The spinal cord is composed of nervous tissue that extends down the spinal column from the brain. Each vertebra has a spinous process, a bony prominence behind the spinal cord, which shields the cord\'s nervous tissue from impact ''trauma''. Vertebrae also have a strong bony ""body"" (vertebral body) in front of the spinal cord to provide a platform suitable for weight bearing of all tissues above the buttocks. The ''lumbar vertebrae'' stack immediately atop the ''sacrum'' bone that is situated in between the buttocks. On each side, the sacrum meets the iliac bone of the pelvis to form the sacroiliac joints of the buttocks.' "
What is the anatomy of the low back? (Continued),"'The discs are pads that serve as ""cushions"" between the individual vertebral bodies. They help to minimize the impact of ''stress'' forces on the spinal column. Each disc is designed like a jelly donut with a central, softer component (nucleus pulposus) and a surrounding, firm outer ring (annulus fibrosus). The central portion of the disc is capable of rupturing (herniating as in a ''herniated disc'') through the outer ring, causing irritation of adjacent nervous tissue and ''sciatica'' as described below. Ligaments are strong fibrous soft tissues that firmly attach bones to bones. Ligaments attach each of the vertebrae to each other and surround each of the discs.''The nerves that provide sensation and stimulate the muscles of the low back as well as the lower extremities (the thighs, legs, ''feet'', and toes) all exit the lumbar spinal column through bony portals, each of which is called a ""foramen.""''Many muscle groups that are responsible for flexing, extending, and rotating the waist, as well as moving the lower extremities, attach to the lumbar spine through tendon insertions.''The ''aorta'' and blood vessels that transport blood to and from the lower extremities pass in front of the lumbar spine in the abdomen and pelvis. Surrounding these blood vessels are ''lymph nodes'' (lymph glands) and tissues of the involuntary nervous system that are important in maintaining bladder and bowel control.''The uterus and ovaries are important pelvic structures in front of the pelvic area of women. The ''prostate gland'' is a significant pelvic structure in men. The kidneys are on either side of the back of the lower abdomen, in front of the lumbar spine.''The skin over the lumbar area is supplied by nerves that come from nerve roots that exit from the lumbar spine.' "
What is the function of the low back?,"'The low back, or lumbar area, serves a number of important functions for the ''human body''. These functions include structural support, movement, and protection of certain body tissues.''When we stand, the lower back is functioning to support the weight of the upper body. When we bend, extend, or rotate at the waist, the lower back is involved in the movement. Therefore, injury to the structures important for weight bearing, such as the bony spine, muscles, tendons, and ligaments, often can be detected when the body is standing erect or used in various movements.''Protecting the soft tissues of the nervous system and spinal cord as well as nearby organs of the pelvis and abdomen is a critical function the lumbar spine and adjacent muscles of the low back.' "
What are common causes of lower back pain?,"'Common causes of low ''back pain'' (lumbar backache) include lumbar strain, nerve irritation, ''lumbar radiculopathy'', bony encroachment, and conditions of the bone and joints. Each of these is reviewed below.''Lumbar strain (acute, chronic)'': A lumbar strain is a stretch injury to the ligaments, tendons, and/or muscles of the low back. The stretching incident results in microscopic tears of varying degrees in these tissues. Lumbar strain is considered one of the most common causes of low ''back pain''. The injury can occur because of overuse, improper use, or trauma. Soft-tissue injury is commonly classified as ""acute"" if it has been present for days to weeks. If the strain lasts longer than three months, it is referred to as ""chronic."" Lumbar strain most often occurs in people in their 40s, but it can happen at any age. The condition is characterized by localized discomfort in the low back area with onset after an event that mechanically stressed the lumbar tissues. The severity of the injury ranges from mild to severe, depending on the degree of strain and resulting spasm of the muscles of the low back. The diagnosis of lumbar strain is based on the history of injury, the location of the ''pain'', and exclusion of nervous system injury. Usually, X-ray testing is only helpful to exclude bone abnormalities.''The treatment of lumbar strain consists of resting the back (to avoid reinjury), medications to relieve pain and ''muscle spasm'', local heat applications, ''massage'', and eventual (after the acute episode resolves) reconditioning exercises to strengthen the low back and abdominal muscles. Initial treatment at home might include heat application, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), and avoiding reinjury and heavy lifting. Prescription medications that are sometimes used for acute low back pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''ketorolac'' (''Toradol'') by injection or by mouth, muscle relaxants, such as ''carisoprodol'' (''Soma''), ''cyclobenzaprine'' (''Flexeril''), ''methocarbamol'' (Robaxin), and ''metaxalone'' (''Skelaxin''), as well as analgesics, such as ''tramadol'' (''Ultram'').''Long periods of inactivity in bed are no longer recommended, as this treatment may actually slow recovery. Spinal manipulation for periods of up to one month has been found to be helpful in some patients who do not have signs of nerve irritation. Future injury is avoided by using back-protection techniques during activities and support devices as needed at home or work.'  "
Nerve irritation and lumbar radiculopathy causes of lower back pain,"'Nerve irritation'': The nerves of the lumbar spine can be irritated by mechanical pressure (impingement) by bone or other tissues, or from disease, anywhere along their ''paths -- from'' their roots at the spinal cord to the skin surface. These conditions include lumbar disc disease (''radiculopathy''), bony encroachment, and inflammation of the nerves caused by a viral infection (''shingles''). See descriptions of these conditions below.''Lumbar radiculopathy'': Lumbar radiculopathy is nerve irritation that is caused by damage to the discs between the vertebrae. Damage to the disc occurs because of degeneration (""wear and tear"") of the outer ring of the disc, traumatic injury, or both. As a result, the central softer portion of the disc can rupture (herniate) through the outer ring of the disc and abut the spinal cord or its nerves as they exit the bony spinal column. This rupture is what causes the commonly recognized ""''sciatica''"" pain of a ''herniated disc'' that shoots from the low back and buttock down the leg. Sciatica can be preceded by a history of localized low-back aching or it can follow a ""popping"" sensation and be accompanied by numbness and tingling. The back pain commonly increases with movements at the waist and can increase with ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''. In more severe instances, sciatica can be accompanied by ''incontinence'' of the bladder and/or bowels. The sciatica of lumbar radiculopathy typically affects only one side of the body, such as the left side or right side, and not both. Lumbar radiculopathy is suspected based on the above symptoms. Increased radiating back pain when the lower extremity is lifted supports the diagnosis. Nerve testing (''EMG''/''electromyogram'' and NCV/nerve conduction velocity) of the lower extremities can be used to detect nerve irritation. The actual ''disc herniation'' can be detected with imaging tests, such as CAT or ''MRI'' scanning. Treatment of lumbar radiculopathy ranges from medical management to surgery. Medical management includes patient education, medications to relieve pain and ''muscle spasms'', ''cortisone injection'' around the spinal cord (epidural injection), physical therapy (heat, massage by a therapist, ''ultrasound'', exercises, electrical stimulation), and rest (not strict bed rest but avoiding reinjury). With unrelenting pain, severe impairment of function, or incontinence (which can indicate spinal cord irritation), surgery may be necessary. The operation performed depends on the overall status of the spine and the age and health of the patient. Procedures include removal of the herniated disc with laminotomy (a small hole in the bone of the lumbar spine surrounding the spinal cord), laminectomy (removal of the bony wall), by needle technique (percutaneous discectomy), disc-dissolving procedures (chemonucleolysis), and others.' "
Bony encroachment causes of lower back pain,"'Bony encroachment'': Any condition that results in movement or growth of the vertebrae of the lumbar spine can limit the space (encroachment) for the adjacent spinal cord and nerves. Causes of bony encroachment of the spinal nerves include foraminal narrowing (narrowing of the portal through which the ''spinal nerve'' passes from the spinal column, out of the spinal canal to the body, commonly as a result of ''arthritis''), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slippage of one vertebra relative to another), and spinal stenosis (compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or other soft tissues in the spinal canal). Spinal-''nerve compression'' in these conditions can lead to sciatica pain that radiates down the lower extremities. Spinal stenosis can cause lower-extremity pains that worsen with ''walking'' and are relieved by resting (mimicking the pains of poor circulation). Treatment of these afflictions varies, depending on their severity, and ranges from rest and exercises to epidural cortisone injections and surgical decompression by removing the bone that is compressing the nervous tissue.' "
Conditions of bone and joint causes of lower back pain,"'Bone and joint conditions'': Bone and joint conditions that lead to low back pain include those existing from birth (congenital), those that result from wear and tear (degenerative) or injury, and those that are due to inflammation of the joints (arthritis).''Congenital bone conditions'': Congenital causes (existing from birth) of low back pain include ''scoliosis'' and ''spina bifida''. Scoliosis is a sideways (lateral) curvature of the spine that can be caused when one lower extremity is shorter than the other (functional scoliosis) or because of an abnormal architecture of the spine (''structural scoliosis''). Children who are significantly affected by structural scoliosis may require treatment with bracing and/or surgery to the spine. Adults infrequently are treated surgically but often benefit by support bracing. Spina bifida is a birth defect in the bony vertebral arch over the spinal canal, often with absence of the spinous process. This birth defect most commonly affects the lowest lumbar vertebra and the top of the sacrum. Occasionally, there are abnormal tufts of hair on the skin of the involved area. Spina bifida can be a minor bony abnormality without symptoms. However, the condition can also be accompanied by serious nervous abnormalities of the lower extremities.''Degenerative bone and joint conditions'"": As we age, the water and protein content of the body's cartilage changes. This change results in weaker, thinner, and more fragile cartilage. Because both the discs and the joints that stack the vertebrae (facet joints) are partly composed of cartilage, these areas are subject to wear and tear over time (degenerative changes). Degeneration of the disc is called spondylosis. Spondylosis can be noted on ""'X-rays'' of the spine as a narrowing of the normal ""disc space"" between the vertebrae. It is the deterioration of the disc tissue that predisposes the disc to herniation and localized lumbar pain (""''lumbago''"") in older patients. ''Degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') of the facet joints is also a cause of localized lumbar pain that can be detected with plain X-ray testing. These causes of degenerative back pain are usually treated conservatively with intermittent heat, rest, rehabilitative exercises, and medications to relieve pain, muscle spasm, and inflammation.''Injury to the bones and joints'': ''Fractures'' (breakage of bone) of the lumbar spine and sacrum bone most commonly affect elderly people with ''osteoporosis'', especially those who have taken long-term cortisone medication. For these individuals, occasionally even minimal stresses on the spine (such as bending to tie shoes) can lead to bone ''fracture''. In this setting, the vertebra can collapse (vertebral compression fracture). The fracture causes an immediate onset of severe localized pain that can radiate around the waist in a band-like fashion and is made intensely worse with body motions. This pain generally does not radiate down the lower extremities. Vertebral fractures in younger patients occur only after severe trauma, such as from motor-vehicle accidents or a convulsive ''seizure''.''In both younger and older patients, vertebral fractures take weeks to heal with rest and pain relievers. Compression fractures of vertebrae associated with ''osteoporosis'' can also be treated with a procedure called vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty, which can help to reduce pain. In this procedure, a balloon is inflated in the compressed vertebra, often returning some of its lost height. Subsequently, a ""cement"" (methymethacrylate) is injected into the balloon and remains to retain the structure and height of the body of the vertebra. Pain is relieved as the height of the collapsed vertebra is restored.''Arthritis'': The spondyloarthropathies are inflammatory types of arthritis that can affect the lower back and sacroiliac joints. Examples of spondyloarthropathies include ''reactive arthritis'"" (Reiter's disease), ""'ankylosing spondylitis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', and the arthritis of ''inflammatory bowel disease''. Each of these diseases can lead to low back pain and ''stiffness'', which is typically worse in the morning. These conditions usually begin in the second and third decades of life. They are treated with medications directed toward decreasing the inflammation. Newer biologic medications have been greatly successful in both quieting the disease and stopping its progression.' "
What are other causes of lower back pain?,"'Other causes of low back pain include kidney problems, ''pregnancy'', ovary problems, and tumors.''Kidney infections, stones, and traumatic bleeding of the kidney (''hematoma'') are frequently associated with low back pain. Diagnosis can involve urine analysis, sound-wave tests (ultrasound), or other imaging studies of the abdomen.'""Pregnancy commonly leads to low back pain by mechanically stressing the lumbar spine (changing the normal lumbar curvature) and by the positioning of the baby inside of the abdomen. Additionally, the effects of the female hormone estrogen and the ligament-loosening hormone relaxin may contribute to loosening of the ligaments and structures of the back. Pelvic-tilt exercises and stretches are often recommended for relieving this pain. Women are also recommended to maintain physical conditioning during pregnancy according to their doctors' advice. Natural ""'labor'' can also cause low back pain.''Ovarian cysts'', ''uterine fibroids'', and ''endometriosis'' may also cause low back pain. Precise diagnosis can require gynecologic examination and testing.''Low back pain can be caused by tumors, either benign or ''malignant'', that originate in the bone of the spine or pelvis and spinal cord (primary tumors) and those which originate elsewhere and spread to these areas (metastatic tumors). Symptoms range from localized pain to radiating severe pain and loss of nerve and muscle function (even ''incontinence of urine'' and ''stool'') depending on whether or not the tumors affect the nervous tissue. Tumors of these areas are detected using imaging tests, such as plain X-rays, nuclear bone scanning, and CAT and MRI scanning.' "
What are uncommon causes of low back pain?,"'Uncommon causes of low back pain include '""Paget's disease of bone""', bleeding or infection in the pelvis, infection of the cartilage and/or bone of the spine, ''aneurysm'' of the aorta, and ''shingles''.'""Paget's disease of the bone is a condition of unknown cause in which the bone formation is out of synchrony with normal bone remodeling. This condition results in abnormally weakened bone and deformity and can cause localized bone pain, though it often causes no symptoms. Paget's disease is more common in people over the age of 50. Heredity (genetic background) and certain unusual virus infections have been suggested as causes. Thickening of involved bony areas of the lumbar spine can cause the radiating lower extremity pain of sciatica.""""Paget's disease can be diagnosed on plain X-rays. However, a bone biopsy is occasionally necessary to ensure the accuracy of the diagnosis. Bone scanning is helpful to determine the extent of the disease, which can involve more than one bone area. A blood test, ""'alkaline phosphatase'', is useful for diagnosis andmonitoring response to therapy. Treatment options include ''aspirin'', other anti-inflammatory medicines, pain medications, and medications that slow therate of bone turnover, such as ''calcitonin'' (Calcimar, Miacalcin), ''etidronate'' (''Didronel''), ''alendronate'' (''Fosamax''), ''risedronate'' (''Actonel''), and pamidronate (''Aredia'').''Bleeding in the pelvis is rare without significant trauma and is usually seen in patients who are taking blood-thinning medications, such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''). In these patients, a rapid-onset sciatica pain can be a sign of bleeding in the back of the pelvis and abdomen that is compressing the spinal nerves as they exit to the lower extremities. Infection of the pelvis is infrequent but can be a complication of conditions such as ''diverticulosis'"", Crohn's disease, ""'ulcerative colitis'', ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' with infection of the Fallopian tubes or uterus, and even ''appendicitis''. Pelvic infection is a serious complication of these conditions and is often associated with ''fever'', lowering of ''blood pressure'', and a life-threatening state.'  "
What are uncommon causes of low back pain? (Continued),"'Infection of the discs (septic discitis) and bone (''osteomyelitis'') is extremely rare. These conditions lead to localized pain associated with ''fever''. The bacteria found when these tissues are tested with laboratory cultures include '' ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'' (''TB'' bacteria). ''TB'"" infection in the spine is called Pott's disease. These are each very serious conditions requiring long courses of antibiotics. The sacroiliac joints rarely become infected with bacteria. ""'Brucellosis'"" is a bacterial infection that can involve the sacroiliac joints and is usually transmitted in raw goat's milk.""'In the elderly, ''atherosclerosis'' can cause weakening of the wall of the large arterial blood vessel (aorta) in the abdomen. This weakening can lead to a bulging (''aneurysm'') of the aorta wall. While most aneurysms cause no symptoms, some cause a pulsating low back pain. Aneurysms of certain size, especially when enlarging over time, can require surgical repair with a grafting procedure to repair the abnormal portion of the artery.''Shingles'' (''herpes zoster'') is an acute infection of the nerves that supply sensation to the skin, generally at one or several spinal levels and on one side of the body (right or left). Patients with ''shingles'' usually have had ''chickenpox'' earlier in life. The ''herpes'' virus that causes ''chickenpox'' is believed to exist in a dormant state within the spinal nerve roots long after the chickenpox resolves. In people with shingles, this virus reactivates to cause infection along the sensory nerve, leading to ''nerve pain'' and usually an outbreak of shingles (tiny ''blisters'' on the same side of the body and at the same nerve level). The back pain in patients with shingles of the lumbar area can precede the skin ''rash'' by days. Successive crops of tiny blisters can appear for several days and clear with crusty inflammation in one to two weeks. Patients occasionally are left with a more chronic nerve pain (''postherpetic neuralgia''). Treatment can involve symptomatic relief with lotions, such as calamine, or medications, such as ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), for the infection and ''pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'') or ''lidocaine'' (''Lidoderm'') patches for the pain.' "
What are risk factors for low back pain?,"'Risk factors for low back pain include athletic activity, heavy lifting, throwing, moving luggage, traumatic injury, ''kidney infection'', pregnancy, ''osteoporosis'', and ''aging''.' "
What are other symptoms and signs sometimes associated with low back pain?,"'Low back pain can cause a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the precise cause of the back pain as reviewed above. Symptoms that can be associated with low back pain include numbness and/or tingling of the lower extremities, incontinence of urine or ''stool'', inability to walk without worsening pain, lower extremity ''weakness'', atrophy (decreased in size) of the lower extremity muscles, ''rash'', fever, ''chills'', ''weight loss'', ''abdominal pains'', burning on urination, ''dizziness'', ''joint pain'', and ''fatigue''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose low back pain?,"'The diagnosis of low back pain involves a review of the history of the illness and underlying medical conditions as well as a physical examination. It is essential that a complete story of the back pain be reviewed including injury history, aggravating and alleviating conditions, associated pain symptoms (fever, numbness, tingling, incontinence, etc.), as well as the duration and progression of symptoms. Aside from routine abdomen and extremity evaluations, rectal and pelvic examinations may eventually be required as well. Further tests for diagnosis of low back pain can be required including blood and urine tests, plain film X-ray tests, CAT scanning, MRI scanning, bone scanning, and tests of the nerves such as electromyograms (EMG) and nerve conduction velocities (NCV).' "
What are treatment options for low back pain?,"'So, how is low back pain treated? As described above, the treatment very much depends on the precise cause of the back pain. Moreover, each patient must be individually evaluated and managed in the context of the underlying background health status and activity level.''As has been highlighted by research presented at the national meeting of the American College of ''Rheumatology'"", a very important aspect of the individual evaluation is the patient's own understanding and perception of their particular situation. British researchers found that those who believed that their symptoms had serious consequences on their lives and that they had, or treatments had, little control over their symptoms were more likely to have a poor outcome. This research points out to physicians the importance of addressing the concerns and perceptions that patients have about their condition during the initial evaluations.""'Finally, it should be noted that the conditions listed above are intended for general review. There are many other possible causes of back pain, including upper back pain, that have not been discussed.'  "
Are there home remedies or other treatments for low back pain?,"'Self-care remedies for pain relief include ''cold'' pack and heat applications, topical analgesic balms, avoiding reinjury, eliminating heavy lifting, and taking ''over-the-counter'' pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (''Aleve''), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).'  "
What is the prognosis for low back pain?,"'The outlook for low back pain absolutely depends on its precise cause. For example, acute strain injuries generally heal entirely with minimal treatment. On the other hand, bony abnormalities that are irritating the spinal cord can require significant surgical repair and the outlook depends on the surgical result. Long-term optimal results often involve ''exercise'' rehabilitation programs that can involve physical therapists.' "
Is it possible to prevent low back pain?,"'Avoiding injury to the low back is a method of preventing low back pain. Additionally, conditioning ''exercise'' programs designed to strengthen the lumbar area and adjacent tissues can help to minimize risk of injury to the low back. Specific programs to relieve and prevent back pain can be designed with the help of physical therapists and other treating health care professionals.'  "
Which health care specialties treat low back pain?,"'Physician specialties that evaluate and treat low back pain range from generalists to subspecialists. These specialties include ''emergency medicine'' physicians, general medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, gynecology, spine surgeons (orthopaedics and neurosurgery), rheumatology, ''pain management'', and physiatry. Other health care providers for low back pain include physical therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, psychologists, and acupuncturists.' "
What is lumbar lordosis? Is It painful?,"'Lumbar lordosis is the inward curve of the lumbar spine in the lower back. A small degree of lordosis (inward curvature) is normal. The spine in the neck also has lordosis (cervical lordosis).\xa0''Normal lumbar (lower spine) lordosis is not painful but if the posture of the person appears to be swayback (abnormal inward curve), they may experience ''back pain''.\xa0''\xa0' "
What are the symptoms and signs of lumbar lordosis?,"'Symptoms and signs of lumbar lordosis (lordotic spine) may include:''Some people may develop nerve problems (numbness/tingling of lower extremities, poor bladder control, ''weakness'', electric ''shock''-like pains).''\xa0'  Appearance of being swayback or abnormal posture with arched lower spine Buttocks appearing more pronounced Having a large gap or arch between the lower back and a flat surface when lying on your back Discomfort and/or back pain Difficulty in moving certain directions"
"What are the common causes of lumbar lordosis in children, adults, and while pregnant?","'Lumbar lordosis in ''pregnancy'' is due, according to some researchers, to the spine adjusting itself to the center of gravity as the pregnancy ''weight gain'' causes abdominal enlargement. It may shift again after the woman delivers the baby.' Discitis Obesity Kyphosis Osteoporosis Spondylolisthesis  Bad posture Previous spine surgery Pelvis or hip injury Congenital Genetics Dwarfism Other spine disorders"
What procedures and tests diagnose lumbar lordosis?,"'Procedures and tests to diagnose lumbar lordosis are the history and physical exam are used to diagnose lordosis. \xa0Other studies, such as ''X-rays'' and/or CT of the spine can also aid in the diagnosis.' "
What treatments or surgery are used for lumbar lordosis?,"'Mild forms of lordosis may require little or no treatments. Children can sometimes outgrow the problem. These treatments may help to fix, correct and/or reverse to cause straightening of lumbar lordosis.'  Pain medication  Daily exercise or physical therapy Weight loss Use of a brace Supplements like vitamin D Surgery"
"Can lumbar lordosis be reversed or ""cured""? What is the prognosis?","'The prognosis for lumbar lordosis depends on how mild to severe are the symptoms and the underlying cause. Mild lordosis in children, for example, may be cured over time without treatment while severe lordosis may require surgery. However; proper treatments may lead to symptom reduction, or in some people a ""cure"" or a reversal of lordosis back to normal or near normal.' "
Can you prevent lumbar lordosis?,"'Lumbar lordosis may be prevented in some people by preventing certain causes such as obesity, poor posture and ''trauma''. Other causes such as congenital or genetic lordosis are not preventable.\xa0' "
What is a lumbar puncture (LP)?,"'A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the spinal canal to collect and examine the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebral spinal fluid). It is termed a ""lumbar puncture"" because the needle is placed in the lumbar portion of the back and used to puncture through tissues to enter the spinal canal.''Other names for a lumbar puncture (an LP) include spinal tap, spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis.' "
Why is a lumbar puncture done?,"'An LP is most commonly performed to obtain a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Examination of the fluid can be crucial in diagnosing diseases such as meningitis, neurologic diseases, or effects of systemic disease on the brain and spinal fluid. An LP can also be done to treat diseases, and as a way of administering antibiotics, ''cancer'' ''drugs'', or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, normal-pressure ''hydrocephalus'' and ''benign intracranial hypertension'', for example).''Sometimes a lumbar puncture is performed in patients with ''migraines'' to assure that no other underlying pathology exists.'  "
How is the LP procedure performed?,"'Patients typically lie on their side for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up and leaning slightly forward.''After local anesthesia is injected into the lumbar area of the back, a long needle is inserted in between the bones of the spine (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is most commonly placed between the third and fourth ''lumbar vertebrae''.)''Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing.' "
What is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?,"'The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This ""water bath"" acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury.''The normal CSF appears clear and contains various substances, such as protein and ''sugar'' (glucose), and few if any cells. The spinal fluid also has a normal pressure when first removed.' "
What is normal CSF?,"'Normal values for spinal fluid examination are as follows:''These normal values can be altered by injury or disease of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues. The values are routinely evaluated during examination of the spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture. Additionally, spinal fluid is tested for infection in the microbiology laboratory.''A health care professional will usually review and interpret the test results with the patient. These results often will need to be evaluated in relation to other blood and radiologic test results.' Protein (15-60 mg/dl) Glucose (50-80 mg/dl) Cell count (0-5 mononuclear cells) Initial pressure (70-180 mm)"
What diseases are diagnosed by examination of the CSF?,"'Spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose many important diseases such as bleeding around the brain; increased pressure from ''hydrocephalus''; inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues (''encephalitis'', meningitis); tumors of the brain or spinal cord, etc. Sometimes spinal fluid can indicate diseases of the immune system, such as ''multiple sclerosis''.' "
"What are possible risks, complications, or side effects of a lumbar puncture?","'When spinal fluid is removed during an LP, the risks include ''headache''\xa0from a persistent spinal fluid leak, brain herniation, bleeding, and infection. Each of these complications are uncommon with the exception of ''headache'', which can appear from hours to up to a day after a lumbar puncture. Up to 25% of patients will get ''headaches'' after the procedure. ''Headaches'' occur less frequently when the patient remains lying flat several hours after the procedure.'  "
What are the benefits of a lumbar puncture?,"'The benefits of the LP depend upon the exact situation for which it is performed, but a lumbar puncture can provide lifesaving information.' "
Introduction to lumbar spinal fusion,"'The lumbar spine is the lower portion of the spine found at the center of the curve of the low back, below the rib cage. This area can be a common source of pain. ''Low back pain'' is the second most common reason for visits to the family physician, behind the ''common cold''. As people become older, various changes occur in the lumbar spine that can cause pain. In most cases these changes are due to normal ''degenerative arthritis'' (wear of cartilage over time). The physician must also rule out other more serious conditions including ''tumor'', infection, ''scoliosis'' (curvature of the spine), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slippage of one spinal bone on another), or ''fracture''.''Fortunately, most patients with ''low back pain'' will have improvement in their symptoms regardless of treatment within six weeks. During that time the physician has various treatment options including medications, physical therapy, or injections that can help ease the symptoms. Some of those patients that do not improve after six to 12 weeks may be candidates for surgery. The spine surgeon has different types of surgical options available based on the specific cause of pain. ' "
What is lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Lumbar spinal fusion is an operation that causes the vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back to grow together. The goal of the lumbar fusion is to have the two vertebrae fuse (grow solidly together) so that there is no longer any motion between them. Removing the intervertebral disc (cushion between the bones) or ''bone spurs'' can reduce some of the pressure on the nerves, helping to reduce pain. Additionally, by fusing the two vertebrae together, this may stop the formation of bone spurs at that location, further reducing pain and potential nerve injury. ''There are many different specific techniques to try to fuse the vertebrae together. The surgery can be performed either through an incision in the back, the abdomen, or a combination of both. In many cases metal screws and rods are placed from the back into the bones to hold them in position while the fusion occurs. During an interbody fusion, the surgeon removes the intervertebral disc and places either a bone graft or a metal or ''plastic'' cage, or a combination of these in its place. The decision on what type of fusion is best for each patient is based on their specific complaints and the cause of symptoms. Spinal fusion can be very effective in the properly selected patient.'  "
What is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is similar to traditional lumbar spinal fusion, but it uses smaller incisions and causes less damage to the surrounding tissues during surgery.''As with traditional lumbar spinal fusion, there are many specific techniques available to try to fuse the vertebrae together using minimally invasive techniques. This can be done through the abdomen, from the back, from the side, or with any combination of these.''Minimally invasive lumbar fusion through the abdomen uses four small incisions, approximately ½ inch in length. A ''fiber'' optic viewing camera is used, similar to other minimally invasive procedures including laparoscopic gallbladder or ''appendix'' removal.''Fusion with screws and rods can be performed through the back using several 1-2 inch incisions. In these cases a series of increasingly larger dilators (hollow tubes with solid inserts) are inserted through the incisions to help spread the muscles apart. Once the muscles have been moved away, the screws and rods can be placed through the dilator tubes. In some cases an operating microscope is used to help the surgeon see more clearly.'""One of the most recent advances in minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is the ability to perform fusion surgery through the patient's side. There are several techniques that allow the surgeon to make a small incision, approximately 2 inches in the patient's side, directly over the planned fusion site. The muscles are then carefully moved aside, and a series of increasing larger dilators are inserted down to the lumbar spine. Specialized instruments can then be used through the dilator tube to remove the intervertebral disc and place a bone graft or metal or plastic spacer in its place. This technique is typically combined with a procedure from the back to place rods and screws for additional support."" "
What are the advantages of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The major advantage of all of these minimally invasive techniques is that there is less damage caused to the surrounding tissues. Unfortunately, in traditional spinal surgery it is necessary to cut through muscles and move them out of the way in order to reach the spine. This can cause a large amount of pain following surgery, and it can lengthen the recovery time. Instead of cutting and moving muscles, the minimally invasive techniques can more gently spread through the muscles to allow access to the spine. This is much less painful for the patient, and it does not require as long of a recovery period for the muscle to heal.''Another benefit of less muscle damage is less blood loss and thus a reduced need for blood transfusions using the minimally invasive techniques. There is often less need for narcotic pain medications following this form of surgery, and a shorter hospital stay.' "
What is the disadvantage of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'As with any new technique, one of the major disadvantages is the additional time needed to perform the procedure. While a surgeon may be very comfortable with the traditional surgical fusion techniques, it will take time to be able to achieve the same outcome using these new methods. Surgeons with more experience can now perform lumbar spinal fusion in equal or even less time than with the traditional techniques.''Not all surgeons perform these techniques, so it may not be available from your current surgeon or in your area. Because this is a relatively new technique, many insurance companies consider this to be an investigational surgery and do not provide insurance coverage for it, so a patient should check with the insurer prior to surgery regarding coverage.'  "
How effective is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The results for the minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion through the abdomen have not been as good as the traditional open anterior (from the front of the spine) fusion techniques. The success of the fusion has been less reliable, the operative times are longer and there are increased risks of injury to the nerves using the minimally invasive techniques. Because of this, many surgeons have stopped using this technique.''The results of the minimally invasive procedures through the back have been much more promising. Experienced surgeons are able to perform lumbar spinal fusion through the back quicker, with similar fusion rates, less blood loss, and quicker recovery times than using traditional techniques. '""The newer minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion techniques though the patient's side are still being refined. The initial techniques had some increased risk of damage to nerves, but more recent changes have made these even safer and more effective. The results so far are very promising for this technique, but there have been a limited number of studies. Additionally, since this was only recently developed, there are fewer surgeons performing this technique."" "
Am I a candidate for minimally lumbar invasive spinal fusion?,"'First, you and your doctor need to determine if you are a candidate for spinal fusion. Remember, the majority of patients with ''low back pain'' recover within six weeks regardless of treatment. If you have had prolonged symptoms you should see your physician. If it is decided you may need surgery you will be referred to a spinal surgeon for further evaluation. If a fusion is thought to be potentially beneficial for you, the option of minimally invasive techniques can then be discussed with your surgeon.' "
"What is the lumbar spine, and what is lumbar spinal stenosis?","'The lumbar spine is made up of five vertebral bodies in the lower back. Nerves coming off the spinal cord travel though the spinal canal and exit the canal through small openings on the sides of the vertebrae called foramina (singular = foramen). These nerves transmit sensations from the buttocks and lower extremities through the spinal cord to the brain and transmit motor signals from the brain to the lower extremities to produce movement of the legs, toes, and joints of the lower extremities.''Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition whereby either the spinal canal (central stenosis) or one or more of the vertebral foramina (foraminal stenosis) becomes narrowed. If the narrowing is substantial, it causes compression of the spinal cord or spinal nerves, which causes the painful symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, including ''low back pain'', ''buttock pain'', and ''leg pain'' and numbness that is made worse with ''walking'' and relieved by resting.'  "
What causes lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'The most common cause of lumbar spinal stenosis is degenerative ''arthritis'' and ''degenerative disc disease''. As with other joints in the body, arthritis commonly occurs in the spine as part of the normal ''aging'' process and as a result of ''osteoarthritis''. This can lead to loss of the cartilage between the bones at the joints, formation of ''bone spurs'' (''osteophytes''), loss of the normal height of the discs between the vertebrae of the spine (degenerative disc disease, also known as spondylosis), and overgrowth (hypertrophy) of the ligamentous structures. Further degeneration of the lumbar discs can lead to slippage of one vertebra on another, a process referred to as ''spondylolisthesis''. Each of these processes can reduce the normal space available for the nerves in the spinal canal and result in direct pressure on nerve tissues to cause the symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis.''Lumbar spinal stenosis can also be caused by other conditions that decrease the space of the spinal canal or vertebral foramen. These can include''These causes, however, are much less common than degenerative arthritis.' tumor of the local structures or metastatic tumors (tumors that originated in another part of the body and spread to this location), infection, various metabolic bone disorders that cause bone growth, such as Paget's disease of bone."
What are risk factors for lumbar spinal stenosis?,'The major risk factor for lumbar spinal stenosis is ''aging'' because it is associated with degeneration of the spine. Another less common risk factor is ''osteoporosis'' as it can lead to compression ''fracture'' of the ''lumbar vertebrae'' that results in lumbar spinal stenosis.' 
What are lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms?,"'Lumbar spinal stenosis can cause''In most situations, the symptoms improve when the patient is sitting or leaning forward. Typically, painful sensations shoot down the legs with continued walking and diminish with resting. These leg sensations sometimes mimic ''sciatica''. This particular activity-related symptom is sometimes referred to as pseudoclaudication (or neurogenic ''claudication'') because it mimics the true claudication of poor circulation from the narrowed blood vessels of ''peripheral vascular disease''. Standing and bending backward can make the symptoms worse. This is because bending forward increases the space in the spinal canal and vertebral foramina, while bending backward decreases this space. It is therefore more comfortable for patients to sit or lean forward. Patients are frequently unable to walk for long distances and often state that their symptoms are improved when bending forward while walking with the support of a walker or shopping cart.''The symptoms commonly worsen with time. This is because degenerative arthritis is a progressive disease that gradually becomes more severe with time. If left untreated, the compression on the nerves from lumbar spinal stenosis can lead to increasing weakness and loss of function of the legs. It can also lead to loss of bowel and bladder control and loss of sexual function.'""A doctor can help determine if one's symptoms are from lumbar spinal stenosis or a different condition. Many other disorders can cause similar symptoms that mimic lumbar spinal stenosis including""   low back pain, weakness, numbness, pain, loss of sensation in the legs and feet. diabetic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, vascular claudication."
How do health care professionals diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'The medical evaluation begins with a complete medical history and physical examination to get clues to the diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. During the medical history, the patient will be asked questions regarding symptoms, including how long they have been present, what makes them better or worse, what prior treatment the patient has had, and what other medical conditions they have. These questions can also help the doctor distinguish lumbar spinal stenosis from other disorders that may produce similar symptoms.''The physical examination often consists of testing the range of motion in the back and feeling for areas of tenderness in the back. The legs may be examined for range of motion, strength, sensation, reflexes, and pulses. The hips and knees may also be examined because problems with these joints can often causes symptoms similar to those of lumbar spinal stenosis.''After the examination, the physician may order imaging studies to detect anatomic signs of lumbar spinal stenosis. This often begins with plain ''X-rays'"" of the spine. The doctors may also order an X-ray of the patient's pelvis and hips, depending on findings from the physical examination. The X-rays can show the doctor various signs associated with spinal stenosis, including loss of the normal intervertebral disc height, the presence of bone spurs (osteophytes), and spinal instability (abnormal motion between the vertebrae). The ultimate diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis is made by an ""'MRI'' scan (magnetic resonance imagining scan) or ''CT scan'' (CAT scan or computerized axial tomography). These are more advanced tests that are used to visualize the nerves in the lower back and detect if they are being compressed from lumbar spinal stenosis.''Sometimes, special nerve tests, including ''electromyogram'' (''EMG'') or nerve conduction studies, may be ordered. These tests can identify damage to or irritation of the nerves caused by long-term compression from lumbar spinal stenosis. These tests can also help determine exactly which nerves are involved.' "
What is the treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'In most situations, the treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis begins with conservative (nonoperative) treatments. This can include medications to reduce inflammation, even short courses of oral cortisone medication, and pain medications. There are also several medications directed specifically at ''nerve pain'' that are helpful in lumbar spinal stenosis, including ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'') and ''pregabalin'' (''Lyrica''). Physical therapy can help for many. Cortisone (steroid) injections in the lumbar spine, referred to as epidural injections, can also reduce the symptoms by decreasing inflammation and swelling around the nerve tissue. These are sometimes repeated up to three times per year.''Surgery may be indicated for those who do not improve with the above treatments or if there is severe or progressive weakness or loss of bowel or bladder function (''cauda equina syndrome''). Depending on the examination findings and imaging studies, there are various surgical procedures available to treat lumbar spinal stenosis, ranging from laminectomy to fusion procedures.''The main goal of surgery is to remove the structures that are compressing the nerves in the spinal canal or vertebral foramen. This is referred to as lumbar decompression surgery (laminectomy, laminotomy, foraminotomy). In some patients, this can be performed alone, but in other patients, it must be combined with lumbar fusion. If too much of the compressive structures need to be removed to free the nerve, the vertebrae may become unstable (spinal instability). This leaves the vertebrae with abnormal motion. If this occurs, a ''spinal fusion'' can be performed to attach the vertebrae together and eliminate the motion at that level. Sometimes this requires metallic hardware to be installed in the vertebrae to adequately support and fix the involved bone.''Surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis can be very successful in most patients in relieving the leg symptoms of ambulatory pain, ''sciatica'', and numbness. However, depending on the severity of the ''nerve compression'' and the length of time the nerve have been compressed, there may be some permanent damage that is not relieved with surgery. The success for ''back pain'' relief is less reliable with surgery than the relief of leg symptoms.''More recently, surgical procedures that are somewhat less invasive than traditional lumbar decompression have become available. Interspinous devices that have been used in certain patients for this purpose include X-Stop and Coflex devices.'  "
Is it possible to prevent lumbar spinal stenosis?,"'Unfortunately, the degenerative changes responsible for lumbar spinal stenosis can occur as part of the normal aging process. There is little that can be done to prevent lumbar spinal stenosis. For some patients, exercises and/or physical therapy can prevent aggravation of symptoms.' "
What is the prognosis for lumbar spinal stenosis?,"""The outlook for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis varies and depends on the severity and duration of symptoms at the time of initiation of treatment. Ultimately, the outlook depends on an individual's response to treatment. The response to treatment is also dependent on the severity and cause of the lumbar spinal stenosis as well as the underlying medical condition of the patient."" "
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
Facts you should know about the anatomy of the lungs,"   The lungs exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood. The tracheobronchial tree is the passage way from the mouth to the interior of the lung. Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli deep in the lungs. Breathing air in (inhalation) requires muscular effort. Air is warmed, humidified, and cleaned by the nose and lungs."
What are the lungs?,'The lungs are a pair of organs in the chest that are primarily responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood.' 
What are the symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning?," The cells in the body constantly need a new supply of oxygen to produce energy. With lack of oxygen, cellular function is impaired and damage or cell death may occur. As energy is utilized, waste products are created, one of which is the gas carbon dioxide. Eliminating carbon dioxide from the body is just as important as breathing in oxygen from the air. If carbon dioxide builds up in the blood it will lead to headaches, drowsiness, coma, and eventually even death."
What is the structure of the respiratory system?,"'Air enters the body via the nose (preferably) or the mouth. The air enters the main windpipe, called the trachea, and continues en route to each lung via either the right or left bronchus (plural=bronchi). The lungs are separated into sections called lobes, two on the left and three on the right. The air passages continue to divide into ever smaller tubes, which finally connect with tiny air sacs called alveoli. This gradually branching array of tubes is referred to as the tracheobronchial ""tree"" because of the remarkable similarity to the branching pattern of a tree.''The other half of the respiratory system involves blood circulation. Venous blood from the body is returned to the right side of the ''heart'' and then pumped out via the pulmonary artery. This artery splits in two for the left and right lungs and then continues to branch much like the tracheobronchial tree. These vessels branch into a fine network of very tiny tubes called capillaries. The capillaries are situated adjacent to the alveoli and are so small that only one red blood cell at a time can pass through their openings. It is during this passage that gases are exchanged between the blood and the air in the nearby alveoli. After passing the alveoli, capillaries then join together to begin forming the pulmonary veins, which carry the blood back to the left side of the heart.' "
What are the differences between inhalation and exhalation?,"'Respiration is divided into two components, inhalation and exhalation.''Inhalation is active'', because it requires muscle contraction. The major muscle of respiration is a sheet-like dome shaped muscle called the ''diaphragm'' that is located below the lungs. The diaphragm separates the chest and abdominal ''cavities''. As the diaphragm contracts, it flattens out, moving toward the abdominal ''cavity''. This action causes an increase in the size of the chest ''cavity'', thus creating a vacuum. Air is then sucked in through the mouth or nose. When physical activity increases dramatically, or with some lung conditions, other muscles like those of the neck and those between the ribs also assist in the increase in size of the chest cavity. These muscles are referred to as accessory muscles of respiration.''Exhalation is passive'' because it does not require muscle contraction. During this phase, the expanded lung acts like a stretched rubber band and simply contracts to its resting position. This contraction forces air out of the lungs and through the mouth.' "
What is the process of the respiratory system?," As energy is utilized by cells, one of the waste products is the gas carbon dioxide. Oxygen-enriched red blood cells release oxygen to the cells of the body and then pick up the waste carbon dioxide. This oxygen- deprived, dark blue blood is then delivered to the blood vessels of the lungs. Carbon dioxide is released by the red cells, easily passes through the capillary wall into the space in the air sac of the adjacent alveoli, and is then eliminated with each breath out of the mouth (exhalation). Oxygen present in the air sac easily passes into the capillaries and into the red blood cells. The capillary network carrying this oxygen-rich, bright red blood flows to larger vessels and eventually empties into the left side of the heart where it is pumped to all the tissues of the body. Thus, the cycle or circle of blood is complete; hence, the name circulation."
What are other important events during the breathing cycle?," Outside air needs to be heated and moistened to match the body's temperature and humidity. As air passes down the tracheobronchial tree, it is warmed and water is added. Contaminants must also be removed. Nose hairs and tiny microscopic hairs called cilia, along with sticky mucus produced by the lining membrane help cleanse the air of impurities. Cilia beat in a synchronized fashion brushing any collected dirt and mucus up toward the mouth. The accumulated material is then coughed out or swallowed. By the time the air reaches the alveoli, it is virtually sterile."
Facts you should know about lung cancer," Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the U.S. and worldwide. Cigarette smoking is the principal risk factor for development of lung cancer. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) also can cause lung cancer in non-smokers. The two types of lung cancer, which grow and spread differently, are small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Medical professionals also refer to them as small-cell lung carcinoma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. The stage of lung cancer refers to the extent to which the cancer has spread in the body. Treatment of lung cancer can involve a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy as well as newer experimental methods. The general prognosis of lung cancer is poor because doctors tend not to find the disease until it is at an advanced stage. Five-year survival is around 61% for early stage lung cancer patients that have a tumor localized to the lungs, but only around 6% in those with advanced, inoperable lung cancer. Smoking cessation is the most important measure that can prevent the development of lung cancer."
What is lung cancer?,"""Cancer of the lung, like all cancers, results from an abnormality in the body's basic unit of life, the cell. Normally, the body maintains a system of checks and balances on cell growth so that cells divide to produce new cells only when new cells are needed. Disruption of this system of checks and balances on cell growth results in an uncontrolled division and proliferation of cells that eventually forms a mass known as a tumor.""'Tumors can be benign or ''malignant''; when we speak of ""cancer,"" we are referring to malignant tumors. Medical professionals can usually remove benign tumors, and these tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, often grow aggressively locally where they start, but tumor cells also can enter into the bloodstream or lymphatic system and then spread to other sites in the body. This process of spread is termed ''metastasis''; the areas of tumor growth at these distant sites are called ''metastases''. Since lung cancer tends to spread or ''metastasize'' very early after it forms, it is a very life-threatening cancer and one of the most difficult cancers to treat. While lung cancer can spread to any organ in the body, certain locations -- particularly the adrenal glands, ''liver'', brain, and bones -- are the most common sites for lung cancer metastasis.''The lung also is a very common site for metastasis from malignant tumors in other parts of the body. The same types of cells as the original (primary) tumor make up tumor metastases. For example, if ''prostate cancer'' spreads via the bloodstream to the lungs, it is metastatic ''prostate cancer'' in the lung and is not lung cancer.''The principal function of the lungs is to exchange gases between the air we breathe and the blood. Through the lung, carbon dioxide is removed from the bloodstream and oxygen enters the bloodstream. The right lung has three lobes, while the left lung has two lobes and a small structure called the lingula that is the equivalent of the middle lobe on the right. The major airways entering the lungs are the bronchi, which arise from the trachea, which is outside the lungs. The bronchi branch into progressively smaller airways called ''bronchioles'' that end in tiny sacs known as alveoli where ''gas'' exchange occurs. A thin layer of tissue called the pleura covers the lungs and chest wall.''Lung cancers can arise in any part of the lung, but 90%-95% of cancers of the lung arise from the epithelial cells, the cells lining the larger and smaller airways (bronchi and bronchioles); for this reason, lung cancers are sometimes called bronchogenic cancers or bronchogenic carcinomas. (Carcinoma is another term for cancer.) Cancers also can arise from the pleura (called mesotheliomas) or rarely from supporting tissues within the lungs, for example, the blood vessels.'  "
How common is lung cancer?,"'Lung cancer is the most common cause of death due to cancer in both men and women throughout the world. Statistics from the American Cancer Society estimated that in 2019 there will be about 228,000 new cases of lung cancer in the U.S. occurred and over 142,000 deaths were due to the disease. According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, approximately 6.5% of men and women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer of the lung at some point in their lifetime based on data from 2011-2013.''Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of the elderly; almost 70% of people diagnosed with lung cancer are over 65 years of age, while less than 3% of lung cancers occur in people under 45 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is 70 years.''Lung cancer was not common prior to the 1930s but increased dramatically over the following decades as ''tobacco smoking'' increased. In many developing countries, the incidence of lung cancer is beginning to fall following public education about the dangers of ''cigarette smoking'' and the introduction of effective ''smoking''-cessation programs. Nevertheless, lung cancer remains among the most common types of cancers in both men and women worldwide. In the U.S., lung cancer has surpassed ''breast cancer'' as the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women.' "
What are the causes and risk factors for lung cancer?,"'The incidence of lung cancer is strongly correlated with ''cigarette smoking'', with about 90% of lung cancers arising because of tobacco use. The risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked and the time over which ''smoking'' has occurred; doctors refer to this risk in terms of pack-years of ''smoking'' history (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years smoked). For example, a person who has smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years has a 20 pack-year smoking history. While the risk of lung cancer increases with even a 10-pack-year smoking history, those with 30-pack-year histories or more are considered to have the greatest risk for the development of lung cancer. Among those who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes per day, one in seven will die of lung cancer.''Pipe and ''cigar'' smoking also can cause lung cancer, although the risk is not as high as with ''cigarette'' smoking. Thus, while someone who smokes one pack of cigarettes per day has a risk for the development of lung cancer that is 25 times higher than a nonsmoker, pipe and cigar smokers have a risk of lung cancer that is about five times that of a nonsmoker.''Tobacco smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, many of which have been shown to be cancer-causing or carcinogenic. The two primary carcinogens in tobacco smoke are chemicals known as nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The risk of developing lung cancer decreases each year following smoking cessation as normal cells grow and replace damaged cells in the lung. In former smokers, the risk of developing lung cancer begins to approach that of a nonsmoker about 15 years after cessation of smoking.''In recent years, vaping (or ""e-cigs"") has gained popularity as an alternative to cigarette smoking. Experts agree that vaping is harmful to the lungs, but there is not enough history to know definitively if vaping can cause lung cancer. Like cigarette smoking, vaping does introduce chemicals deep into the lung tissue, which in theory can pose a cancer risk.''Although ''marijuana'' has not been definitively linked to lung cancer, marijuana smoke also contains levels of chemicals and tar that are similar to those found in tobacco smoke. This causes concerns about a potential risk for cancer and lung disease.''Passive smoking or the ''inhalation'' of tobacco smoke by non-smokers who share living or working quarters with smokers, also is an established risk factor for the development of lung cancer. Research has shown that nonsmokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung cancer when compared with nonsmokers who do not reside with a smoker. The risk appears to increase with the degree of exposure (number of years exposed and number of cigarettes smoked by the household partner) to ''secondhand smoke''. Over 7,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U.S. that are attributable to passive smoking.' "
What causes lung cancer? (Part 2),"'Asbestos'' fibers are silicate fibers that can persist for a lifetime in lung tissue following exposure to asbestos. The workplace was a common source of exposure to asbestos fibers, as asbestos was widely used in the past as both thermal and acoustic insulation. Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries, including the U.S. Both lung cancer and ''mesothelioma'' (cancer of the pleura of the lung as well as of the lining of the abdominal ''cavity'' called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in workers exposed to asbestos; asbestos workers who do not smoke have a fivefold greater risk of developing lung cancer than nonsmokers, but asbestos workers who smoke have a risk that is 50- to 90-fold greater than nonsmokers.''Radon'' gas is a natural radioactive gas that is a natural decay product of uranium that emits a type of ionizing ''radiation''. Radon gas is a known cause of lung cancer, with an estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon gas, or about 21,000 lung-cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S., making radon the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. after smoking. As with asbestos exposure, concomitant smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure. Radon gas can travel up through soil and enter homes through gaps in the foundation, pipes, drains, or other openings. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that one out of every 15 homes in the U.S. contains dangerous levels of radon gas. Though radon gas is invisible and odorless, simple test kits can detect it.' "
What causes lung cancer? (Part 3),"'While the majority of lung cancers are associated with tobacco smoking, the fact that not all smokers eventually develop lung cancer suggests that other factors, such as individual genetic susceptibility, may play a role in the causation of lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that lung cancer is more likely to occur in both smoking and nonsmoking relatives of those who have had lung cancer than in the general population. It is unclear how much of this risk is due to shared environmental factors (like a smoking household) and how much is related to genetic risk. People who inherit certain genes, like genes that interfere with DNA repair, may be at greater risk for several types of cancer. Tests to identify people at increased genetic risk of lung cancer are not yet available for routine use.''The presence of certain diseases of the lung, notably ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''), is associated with an increased risk (four- to sixfold the risk of a nonsmoker) for the development of lung cancer even after the effects of concomitant cigarette smoking are excluded. ''Pulmonary fibrosis'' (scarring of the lung) appears to increase the risk about sevenfold, and this risk is not related to smoking.''Survivors of lung cancer have a greater risk of developing a second lung cancer than the general population has of developing a first lung cancer. Survivors of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs, see below) have an additive risk of 1%-2% per year for developing a second lung cancer. In survivors of small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs, see below), the risk for development of second lung cancers approaches 6% per year.''Air pollution from vehicles, industry, and power plants can raise the likelihood of developing lung cancer in exposed individuals. Up to 1%-2% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to ''breathing'' polluted air, and experts believe that prolonged exposure to highly polluted air can carry a risk for the development of lung cancer similar to that of passive smoking.''Exhaust from diesel engines contains gases and soot (particulate matter). Many occupations, such as truck drivers, tollbooth workers, forklift and other heavy machinery operators, railroad and dock workers, miners, garage workers and mechanics, and some farm workers are frequently exposed to diesel exhaust. Studies of workers exposed to diesel exhaust have shown a small but significant increase in the risk of developing lung cancer.' "
What are the types of lung cancer?,"'Health care professionals broadly classify lung cancers, also known as bronchogenic carcinomas because they arise from the bronchi within the lungs, into two types: small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). This classification depends upon the microscopic appearance of the tumor cells themselves, specifically the size of the cells. These two types of cancers grow and spread in different ways and may have different treatment options, so a distinction between these two types is important.''SCLC comprise about 20% of lung cancers and are the most aggressive and rapidly growing of all lung cancers. SCLC is related to cigarette smoking, with only 1% of these tumors occurring in nonsmokers. SCLC metastasize rapidly to many sites within the body and are most often discovered after they have spread extensively. Referring to a specific cell appearance often seen when examining samples of SCLC under the microscope, these cancers are sometimes called oat cell carcinomas.''NSCLC are the most common lung cancers, accounting for about 80% of all lung cancers. NSCLC can be divided into several main types that are named based upon the type of cells found in the tumor:''Other types of cancers'' can arise in the lung; these types are much less common than NSCLC and SCLC and together comprise only 5%-10% of lung cancers:''As discussed previously, metastatic cancers from other primary tumors in the body often appear in the lung. Tumors from anywhere in the body may spread to the lungs either through the bloodstream, through the lymphatic system, or directly from nearby organs. Metastatic tumors are most often multiple, scattered throughout the lung, and concentrated in the peripheral rather than central areas of the lung.' Adenocarcinomas are the most commonly seen type of NSCLC in the U.S. and comprise up to 50% of NSCLC. While adenocarcinomas are associated with smoking like other lung cancers, physicians see this type in nonsmokers who develop lung cancer, as well. Most adenocarcinomas arise in the outer, or peripheral, areas of the lungs. Squamous cell carcinomas were formerly more common than adenocarcinomas; at present, they account for about 30% of NSCLC. Also known as epidermoid carcinomas, squamous cell cancers arise most frequently in the central chest area in the bronchi. Large cell carcinomas, sometimes referred to as undifferentiated carcinomas, are the least common type of NSCLC. Mixtures of different types of NSCLC also are seen. Bronchial carcinoids account for up to 5% of lung cancers. Physicians sometimes refer to these tumors as lung neuroendocrine tumors. They are generally small (3 cm-4 cm or less) when diagnosed and occur most commonly in people under 40 years of age. Unrelated to cigarette smoking, carcinoid tumors can metastasize, and a small proportion of these tumors secrete hormone-like substances that may cause specific symptoms related to the hormone produced. Carcinoids generally grow and spread more slowly than bronchogenic cancers, and medical professionals detect many early enough to be amenable to surgical resection. Cancers of supporting lung tissue such as smooth muscle, blood vessels, or cells involved in the immune response can rarely occur in the lung."
What are lung cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of lung cancer'' are varied depending upon where and how widespread the tumor is. Warning signs of lung cancer are not always present or easy to identify. Lung cancer may not cause ''pain'' or other symptoms in some cases. A person with lung cancer may have the following kinds of symptoms:''One should consult a health care professional if he or she develops the symptoms associated with lung cancer, in particular, if they have'   No symptoms: In up to 25% of people who get lung cancer, the cancer is first discovered on a routine chest X-ray or CT scan as a solitary small mass sometimes called a coin lesion, since on a two-dimensional X-ray or CT scan, the round tumor looks like a coin. These patients with small, single masses often report no symptoms at the time of the cancer discovery. Symptoms related to the cancer: The growth of the cancer and invasion of lung tissues and surrounding tissue may interfere with breathing, leading to symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and coughing up blood (hemoptysis). If the cancer has invaded nerves, for example, it may cause shoulder pain that travels down the outside of the arm (called Pancoast syndrome) or paralysis of the vocal cords leading to hoarseness. Invasion of the esophagus may lead to difficulty swallowing (dysphagia). If there is an obstruction of a large airway, collapse of a portion of the lung may occur and cause infections (abscesses, pneumonia) in the obstructed area. Symptoms related to metastasis: Lung cancer that has spread to the bones may produce excruciating pain at the sites of bone involvement. Cancer that has spread to the brain may cause a number of neurologic symptoms that may include blurred vision, headaches, seizures, or symptoms of stroke such as weakness or loss of sensation in parts of the body. Paraneoplastic symptoms: Symptoms that result from production of hormone-like substances by the tumor cells frequently accompany lung cancers. These paraneoplastic syndromes occur most commonly with SCLC but may occur with any tumor type. A common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with SCLC is the production of a hormone called adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by the cancer cells, leading to oversecretion of the hormone cortisol by the adrenal glands (Cushing's syndrome). The most frequent paraneoplastic syndrome seen with NSCLC is the production of a substance similar to parathyroid hormone, resulting in elevated levels of calcium in the bloodstream. Nonspecific symptoms: Nonspecific symptoms seen with many cancers, including lung cancers, include weight loss, weakness, and fatigue. Psychological symptoms such as depression and mood changes also are common. a new persistent cough or worsening of an existing chronic cough, blood in the sputum, persistent bronchitis or repeated respiratory infections, chest pain, unexplained weight loss and/or fatigue, and breathing difficulties such as shortness of breath or wheezing."
What specialists treat lung cancer?,"'The treatment of lung cancer requires a team approach. Surgical oncologists are surgeons specialized in the removal of cancers. Thoracic surgeons or general surgeons may also surgically treat lung cancers. Medical and radiation oncologists are specialists in the treatment of cancers with medications and radiation therapy, respectively. Other specialists who may be involved in the care of people with lung cancer include pain and palliative care specialists, as well as pulmonary specialists (medical pulmonologists).' "
How do health care professionals diagnose lung cancer?,"'Doctors use a wide range of diagnostic procedures and tests to diagnose lung cancer. These include the following:' The history and physical examination may reveal the presence of symptoms or signs that are suspicious for lung cancer. In addition to asking about symptoms and risk factors for cancer development such as smoking, doctors may detect signs of breathing difficulties, airway obstruction, or infections in the lungs. Cyanosis, a bluish color of the skin and the mucous membranes due to insufficient oxygen in the blood, suggests compromised function due to chronic disease of the lung. Likewise, changes in the tissue of the nail beds, known as clubbing, also may indicate chronic lung disease. The chest X-ray is the most common first diagnostic step when any new symptoms of lung cancer are present. The chest X-ray procedure often involves a view from the back to the front of the chest as well as a view from the side. Like any X-ray procedure, chest X-rays expose the patient briefly to a small amount of radiation. Chest X-rays may reveal suspicious areas in the lungs but are unable to determine if these areas are cancerous. In particular, medical professionals may identify calcified nodules in the lungs or benign tumors called hamartomas on a chest X-ray, and these mimic lung cancer. CT (computerized tomography) scans may be performed on the chest, abdomen, and/or brain to examine for both metastatic and lung tumors. CT scans are X-ray procedures that combine multiple images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views of the body. A large donut-shaped X-ray machine takes images at different angles around the body. One advantage of CT scans is that they are more sensitive than standard chest X-rays in the detection of lung nodules, that is, they will demonstrate more nodules. Sometimes medical professionals give intravenous contrast material prior to the scan to help delineate the organs and their positions. The most common side effect is an adverse reaction to intravenous contrast material given prior to the procedure. This may result in itching, a rash, or hives that generally disappear rather quickly. Severe anaphylactic reactions (life-threatening allergic reactions with breathing difficulties) to the contrast material are rare. CT scans of the abdomen may identify metastatic cancer in the liver or adrenal glands, and a physician may order CT scans of the head to reveal the presence and extent of metastatic cancer in the brain. The USPSTF and ACS recommend a technique called a low-dose helical CT scan (or spiral CT scan) annually in current and former smokers between ages 55 and 80 with at least a 30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking who have smoked cigarettes within the past 15 years. The lung cancer screening technique appears to increase the likelihood of detection of smaller, earlier, and curable lung cancers. Three years of low-dose CT scanning in this group reduced the risk of lung cancer death by 20%. Use of models and rules for analyzing the results of these tests are decreasing the need for biopsy to evaluate detected nodules when the likelihood is high the nodule is not cancerous. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be appropriate when precise detail about a tumor's location is required. The MRI technique uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures. As with CT scanning, the patient is placed on a moveable bed that is inserted into the MRI scanner. There are no known side effects of MRI scanning, and there is no exposure to radiation. The image and resolution produced by MRI is quite detailed and can detect tiny changes of structures within the body. People with heart pacemakers, metal implants, artificial heart valves, and other surgically implanted structures cannot be scanned with an MRI because of the risk that the magnet may move the metal parts of these structures. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a specialized imaging technique that uses short-lived radioactive drugs to produce three-dimensional colored images of those drugs in the tissues within the body. While CT scans and MRI scans look at anatomical structures, PET scans measure metabolic activity and the function of tissues. PET scans can determine whether a tumor tissue is actively growing and can aid in determining the type of cells within a particular tumor. In PET scanning, the patient receives a short half-lived radioactive drug, receiving approximately the amount of radiation exposure as two chest X-rays. The drug accumulates in certain tissues more than others, depending on the drug that is injected. The drug discharges particles known as positrons from whatever tissues take them up. As the positrons encounter electrons within the body, a reaction producing gamma rays occurs. A scanner records these gamma rays and maps the area where the radioactive drug has accumulated. For example, combining glucose (a common energy source in the body) with a radioactive substance will show where glucose is rapidly being used, for example, in a growing tumor. PET scanning may also be integrated with CT scanning in a technique known as PET-CT scanning. Integrated PET-CT has been shown to improve the accuracy of staging (see below) over PET scanning alone."
How do health care professionals diagnose lung cancer? (Continued)," Bone scans are used to create images of bones on a computer screen or on film. Doctors may order a bone scan to determine whether a lung cancer has metastasized to the bones. In a bone scan, a small amount of radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream and collects in the bones, especially in abnormal areas such as those involved by metastatic tumors. The radioactive material is detected by a scanner, and the image of the bones is recorded on a special film for permanent viewing. Sputum cytology: The diagnosis of lung cancer always requires confirmation of malignant cells by a pathologist, even when symptoms and X-ray studies are suspicious for lung cancer. The simplest method to establish the diagnosis is the examination of sputum under a microscope. If a tumor is centrally located and has invaded the airways, this procedure, known as a sputum cytology examination, may allow visualization of tumor cells for diagnosis. This is the most risk-free and inexpensive tissue diagnostic procedure, but its value is limited since tumor cells will not always be present in sputum even if a cancer is present. Also, noncancerous cells may occasionally undergo changes in reaction to inflammation or injury that makes them look like cancer cells. Bronchoscopy: Examination of the airways by bronchoscopy (visualizing the airways through a thin, fiberoptic probe inserted through the nose or mouth) may reveal areas of tumor that can be sampled (biopsied) for diagnosis by a pathologist. A tumor in the central areas of the lung or arising from the larger airways is accessible to sampling using this technique. Bronchoscopy may be performed in a same-day outpatient bronchoscopy suite, an operating room, or on a hospital ward. The procedure can be uncomfortable, and it requires sedation or anesthesia. While bronchoscopy is relatively safe, it must be carried out by a lung specialist (pulmonologist or surgeon) experienced in the procedure. When a tumor is visualized and adequately sampled, an accurate cancer diagnosis usually is possible. Some patients may cough up dark-brown blood for one to two days after the procedure. More serious but rare complications include a greater amount of bleeding, decreased levels of oxygen in the blood, and heart arrhythmias as well as complications from sedative medications and anesthesia. Needle biopsy: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) through the skin, most commonly performed with radiological imaging for guidance, may be useful in retrieving cells for diagnosis from tumor nodules in the lungs. Needle biopsies are particularly useful when the lung tumor is peripherally located in the lung and not accessible to sampling by bronchoscopy. Medical professionals administer a small amount of local anesthetic prior to insertion of a thin needle through the chest wall into the abnormal area in the lung. Cells are suctioned into the syringe and are examined under the microscope for tumor cells. This procedure is generally accurate when the tissue from the affected area is adequately sampled, but in some cases, adjacent or uninvolved areas of the lung may be mistakenly sampled. A small risk (3%-5%) of an air leak from the lungs (called a pneumothorax, which can easily be treated) accompanies the procedure. Thoracentesis: Sometimes lung cancers involve the lining tissue of the lungs (pleura) and lead to an accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall (called a pleural effusion). Aspiration of a sample of this fluid with a thin needle (thoracentesis) may reveal the cancer cells and establish the diagnosis. As with the needle biopsy, a small risk of a pneumothorax is associated with this procedure. Major surgical procedures: If none of the aforementioned methods yields a diagnosis, employ surgical methods to obtain tumor tissue for diagnosis. These can include mediastinoscopy (examining the chest cavity between the lungs through a surgically inserted probe with biopsy of tumor masses or lymph nodes that may contain metastases) or thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest wall for removal or biopsy of a tumor). With a thoracotomy, completely removal of a lung cancer is rare, and both mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy carry the risks of major surgical procedures (complications such as bleeding, infection, and risks from anesthesia and medications). Physicians perform these procedures in an operating room, and the patient must be hospitalized. Blood tests: While routine blood tests alone cannot diagnose lung cancer, they may reveal biochemical or metabolic abnormalities in the body that accompany cancer. For example, elevated levels of calcium or of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase may accompany cancer that is metastatic to the bones. Likewise, elevated levels of certain enzymes normally present within liver cells, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT), signal liver damage, possibly through the presence of tumor metastatic to the liver. One current focus of research in the area of lung cancer is the development of a blood test to aid in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Molecular testing: For advanced NSCLCs, health care professionals carry out molecular genetic testing to look for genetic mutations in the tumor. Mutations that are responsible for tumor growth are driver mutations. For example, testing may be done to look for mutations or abnormalities in the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes. Other genes that may mutate include MAPK and PIK3. Specific therapies are available that may be administered to patients whose tumors have these alterations in their genes."
How do health care professionals determine lung cancer staging?,"""The stage of a cancer is a measure of the extent to which a cancer has spread in the body. Staging involves evaluation of a cancer's size and its penetration into surrounding tissue as well as the presence or absence of metastases in the lymph nodes or other organs. Staging is important for determining the treatment of a particular cancer, since lung cancer therapies are geared toward specific stages. Staging of a cancer also is critical in estimating the prognosis of a given patient, with higher-stage cancers generally having a worse prognosis than lower-stage cancers.""'Doctors may use several tests to accurately stage a lung cancer, including laboratory (blood chemistry) tests, X-rays, CT scans, bone scans, MRI scans, and PET scans. Abnormal blood chemistry tests may signal the presence of metastases in bone or liver, and radiological procedures can document the size of a cancer as well as its spread.''Doctors assign a stage to NSCLC from I to IV in order of severity:''Most doctors use a two-tiered system to determine treatment for SCLC:'   In stage I, the cancer is confined to the lung. In stages II and III, the cancer is confined to the chest (with larger and more invasive tumors classified as stage III). Stage IV cancer has spread from the chest to other parts of the body. Limited-stage (LS) SCLC refers to cancer that is confined to its area of origin in the chest. In extensive-stage (ES) SCLC, the cancer has spread beyond the chest to other parts of the body."
What is the treatment for lung cancer?,"'Treatment for lung cancer primarily involves surgical removal of the cancer, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, as well as combinations of these treatments. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy treatments are becoming more common, as well. The decision about which treatments will be appropriate for a given individual must take into account the location and extent of the tumor, as well as the overall health status of the patient.''As with other cancers, doctors may prescribe therapy intended to be curative (removal or eradication of a cancer) or palliative (measures that are unable to cure a cancer but can reduce pain and suffering). Doctors may prescribe more than one type of therapy. In such cases, the therapy that is added to enhance the effects of the primary therapy is referred to as adjuvant therapy. An example of adjuvant therapy is chemotherapy or radiotherapy administered after surgical removal of a tumor in an attempt to kill any tumor cells that remain following surgery.''Surgery'': Doctors generally perform surgical removal of the tumor for limited-stage (stage I or sometimes stage II) NSCLC and is the treatment of choice for cancer that has not spread beyond the lung. About 10%-35% of lung cancers can be removed surgically, but removal does not always result in a cure, since the tumors may already have spread and can recur later. Among people who have an isolated, slow-growing lung cancer removed, 25%-40% are still alive five years after diagnosis. It is important to note that although a tumor may be anatomically suitable for resection, surgery may not be possible if the person has other serious conditions (such as severe heart or lung disease) that would limit their ability to survive an operation. Surgeons perform surgery less often with SCLC than with NSCLC because these tumors are less likely to be localized to one area that can be removed.''The surgical procedure chosen depends upon the size and location of the tumor. Surgeons must open the chest wall and may perform a wedge resection of the lung (removal of a portion of one lobe), a lobectomy (removal of one lobe), or a pneumonectomy (removal of an entire lung). Sometimes lymph nodes in the region of the lungs also are removed (lymphadenectomy). Surgery for lung cancer is a major surgical procedure that requires general anesthesia, hospitalization, and follow-up care for weeks to months. The risks of surgery include complications due to bleeding, infection, and complications of general anesthesia.'  "
What is the treatment for lung cancer? (Part 2),"'Radiation'': Radiation therapy treats both NSCLC and SCLC. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays or other types of radiation to kill dividing cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be given as curative therapy, palliative therapy (using lower doses of radiation than with curative therapy), or as adjuvant therapy in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. Medical professionals deliver the radiation either externally, by using a machine that directs radiation toward the cancer, or internally through placement of radioactive substances in sealed containers within the area of the body where the tumor is localized. ''Brachytherapy'' is a term that describes the use of a small pellet of radioactive material placed directly into the cancer or into the airway next to the cancer.''Radiation therapy can be given if a person refuses surgery, if a tumor has spread to areas such as the lymph nodes or trachea making surgical removal impossible, or if a person has other conditions that make them too ill to undergo major surgery. Radiation therapy generally only shrinks a tumor or limits its growth when given as a sole therapy, yet in 10%-15% of people it leads to long-term remission and palliation of the cancer. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy can further prolong survival when chemotherapy is administered. A person who has severe lung disease in addition to a lung cancer may not be able to receive radiotherapy to the lung since the radiation can further decrease function of the lungs. A type of external radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery is sometimes used to treat single brain metastases. In this procedure, multiple beams of radiation coming from different directions are focused on the tumor over a few minutes to hours while the head is held in place by a rigid frame. This reduces the dose of radiation that is received by noncancerous tissues.''For external radiation therapy, a process called simulation is necessary prior to treatment. Using CT scans, computers, and precise measurements, simulation maps out the exact location where the radiation will be delivered, called the treatment field or port. The external radiation treatment itself generally is done four or five days a week for several weeks.''SCLC often spreads to the brain. Sometimes people with SCLC that is responding well to treatment are treated with radiation therapy to the head to treat very early spread to the brain (called micrometastasis) that is not yet detectable with CT or MRI scans and has not yet produced symptoms. This is known as prophylactic brain radiation. Brain radiation therapy can cause ''short-term memory'' problems, ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', and other side effects.''Radiation therapy does not carry the risks of major surgery, but it can have unpleasant side effects, including fatigue and ''lack of energy''. A reduced white blood cell count (rendering a person more susceptible to infection) and low blood platelet levels (making blood clotting more difficult and resulting in excessive bleeding) also can occur with radiation therapy. If the digestive organs are in the field exposed to radiation, patients may experience ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', or ''diarrhea''. Radiation therapy can irritate the skin in the area that is treated, but this irritation generally improves with time after treatment has ended.' "
What is the treatment for lung cancer? (Part 3),"'Chemotherapy'': Both NSCLC and SCLC may be treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy refers to the administration of drugs that stop the growth of cancer cells by killing them or preventing them from dividing. Chemotherapy may be given alone, as an adjuvant to surgical therapy, or in combination with radiotherapy. While a number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been developed, the class of drugs known as the platinum-based drugs have been the most effective in treatment of lung cancers.''Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for most SCLC, since these tumors are generally widespread in the body when they are diagnosed. Only half of people who have SCLC survive for four months without chemotherapy. With chemotherapy, their survival time is increased up to four- to fivefold. Chemotherapy alone is not particularly effective in treating NSCLC, but when NSCLC has metastasized, it can prolong survival in many cases.''Chemotherapy may be given as pills, as an intravenous infusion, or as a combination of the two. Chemotherapy treatments usually are given in an outpatient setting. A combination of drugs is given in a series of treatments, called cycles, over a period of weeks to months, with breaks in between cycles. Unfortunately, the drugs used in chemotherapy also kill normally dividing cells in the body, resulting in unpleasant side effects. Damage to blood cells can result in increased susceptibility to infections and difficulties with blood clotting (bleeding or ''bruising'' easily). Other side effects include fatigue, ''weight loss'', ''hair loss'', nausea, ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''mouth sores''. The side effects of chemotherapy vary according to the dosage and combination of drugs used and may also vary from individual to individual. Medications have been developed that can treat or prevent many of the side effects of chemotherapy. The side effects generally disappear during the recovery phase of the treatment or after its completion.''Targeted therapy'': Molecularly targeted therapy involves the administration of drugs that have been identified to work in subsets of patients whose tumors have specific genetic changes (driver mutations) that promote tumor growth.''EGFR-targeted therapies'': The drugs ''erlotinib'' (''Tarceva''), afatinib (Gilotrif), and ''gefitinib'' (Iressa) are examples of so-called targeted drugs that more specifically target cancer cells, resulting in less damage to normal cells than general chemotherapeutic agents. Erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib target a protein called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is important in promoting the division of cells. The gene encoding this protein is mutated in many cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, creating a mutation that encourages tumor growth. Mutations in the EGFR gene are more common in cancers in women and in people who have never smoked. Drugs that target the EGFR receptor sometimes stop working after a time, which is known as resistance to the drug. Resistance often occurs because the cancer has developed a new mutation in the same gene, and a common example of this is the so-called EGFR T790M mutation. Some newer EGFR-targeted drugs also work against cells with the T790M mutation, including osimertinib (Tagrisso). Necitumumab (Portrazza) is another drug that targets EGFR. It can be used along with chemotherapy as the first treatment in people with advanced NSCLC of the squamous cell type.''Other targeted ''therapies'': Other targeted drugs are available that target other driver mutations. Examples of these other targeted therapies include the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs crizotinib (Xalkori), alectinib (Alecensa), brigatinib (Alunbrig), lorlatinib (Lobrena),\xa0and ceritinib (Zykadia) that are used in patients whose tumors have an abnormality of the ALK gene as the driver mutation. Some of these drugs may also be helpful for people whose cancers have an abnormality of the gene known as ROS1.'""The gene known as BRAF can also be abnormal in lung cancers causing the production of BRAF protein that promotes the cancer's growth. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) is a type of drug known as a BRAF inhibitor and attacks the BRAF protein directly. Trametinib (Mekinist) is known as a MEK inhibitor because it attacks MEK proteins, which are related to BRAF proteins. These may be used for patients with tumors that have abnormal BRAF genes.""'Other attempts at targeted therapy include drugs known as antiangiogenesis drugs, which block the development of new blood vessels within a cancer. Without adequate blood vessels to supply oxygen-carrying blood, the cancer cells will die. The antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab (''Avastin'') has also been found to prolong survival in advanced lung cancer when it is added to the standard chemotherapy regimen. Bevacizumab is given intravenously every two to three weeks. However, since this drug may cause bleeding, it is not appropriate for use in lung cancer patients who are ''coughing'' up blood, if the lung cancer has spread to the brain, or in people who are receiving anticoagulation therapy (""blood thinner"" medications). Bevacizumab also is not used in cases of squamous cell cancer because it leads to bleeding from this type of lung cancer. Ramucirumab (Cyramza) is another angiogenesis inhibitor that can be used to treat advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.''Immunotherapy'': Immunotherapy may be an effective option for some patients with advanced lung cancers. Immunotherapy drugs work by strengthening the activity of the immune system against tumor cells. The immunotherapy drugs nivolumab (Opdivo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are checkpoint inhibitors that target checkpoints or areas that control the immune response and promote the immune response. These two drugs target the PD-1 protein, which strengthens the immune response against the cancers. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq) and durvalumab (Imfinzi) are examples of drugs that target PD-L1, a protein related to PD-1 that is found on some tumor cells and immune cells.''Radiofrequency ablation'' (RFA): Radiofrequency ablation is sometimes used for small tumors located near the outside of the lungs as an alternative to surgery, particularly in cases of early stage lung cancer. In this type of treatment, a needle is inserted through the skin into the cancer, usually under guidance by CT scanning. Radiofrequency (electrical) energy is then transmitted to the tip of the needle where it produces heat in the tissues, killing the cancerous tissue and closing small blood vessels that supply the cancer. Studies have shown that this treatment can prolong survival similarly to surgery when used to treat early stages of lung cancer but without the risks of major surgery and the prolonged recovery time associated with major surgical procedures.''Experimental therapies'': Since no therapy is currently available that is absolutely effective in treating lung cancer, patients may be offered a number of new therapies that are still in the experimental stage, meaning that doctors do not yet have enough information to decide whether these therapies should become accepted forms of treatment for lung cancer. New drugs or new combinations of drugs are tested in so-called ''clinical trials'', which are studies that evaluate the effectiveness of new medications in comparison with those treatments already in widespread use. Newer types of immunotherapy are being studied that involve the use of ''vaccine'""-related therapies that attempt to utilize the body's immune system to directly fight cancer cells. Lung cancer treatment ""'vaccines'' are being studied in clinical trials.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy of lung cancer?,"'The prognosis of lung cancer refers to the chance for cure or prolongation of life (survival) and is dependent upon where the cancer is located, the size of the cancer, the presence of symptoms, the type of lung cancer, and the overall health status of the patient.''SCLC has the most aggressive growth of all lung cancers, with a median survival time of only two to four months after diagnosis when untreated. (That is, by two to four months, half of all patients have died.) However, SCLC is also the type of lung cancer most responsive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Because SCLC spreads rapidly and is usually disseminated at the time of diagnosis, methods such as surgical removal or localized radiation therapy are less effective in treating this type of lung cancer. When chemotherapy is used alone or in combination with other methods, survival time can be prolonged four- to fivefold; however, of all patients with SCLC, only 5%-10% are still alive five years after diagnosis. Most of those who survive have limited-stage SCLC before treatment.''In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most important prognostic factor is the stage (extent of spread) of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. Results of standard treatment are generally poor in all but the smallest of cancers that can be surgically removed. However, in stage I cancers that can be completely removed surgically, five-year survival approaches 75%. Radiation therapy can produce a cure in a small minority of patients with NSCLC and leads to relief of symptoms in most patients. In advanced-stage disease, chemotherapy offers modest improvements in survival although rates of overall survival are poor.''The overall prognosis for lung cancer is poor when compared with some other cancers. Survival rates for lung cancer are generally lower than those for most cancers, with an overall five-year survival rate for lung cancer of about 17% compared to 65% for ''colon cancer'', 91% for ''breast cancer'', 81% for ''bladder cancer'', and over 99% for prostate cancer.' "
Is it possible to prevent lung cancer?,"'Cessation of smoking and eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke is the most important measure that can prevent lung cancer. Many products, such as ''nicotine'' gum, nicotine sprays, or nicotine inhalers, may be helpful to people trying to ''quit smoking''. Minimizing exposure to passive smoking also is an effective preventive measure. Using a home radon test kit can identify and allow correction of increased radon levels in the home. Methods that allow early detection of cancers, such as the low-dose CT scan, also may be of value in the identification of small cancers that can be cured by surgical resection and prevented from becoming widespread, incurable metastatic cancer.' "
What are lung segmentectomy and limited pulmonary resection?,"'A lung segmentectomy'' is a procedure to remove the diseased lung without removing excess normal lung.''Certain diseases, such as ''lung cancer'', ''may require removal of the part of the ''lungs'' to limit the spread of ''cancer'' in the body. The surgery that removes a lung or part of the lungs is called a pulmonary resection. In some forms of pulmonary resection, most of the lung tissue is salvaged and only a wedge or segment (lung segmentectomy) of the lungs is removed. Such a surgery is called a limited pulmonary resection.''The lungs are divided into segments based upon certain anatomical criteria such as different blood supply. In a segmentectomy, these anatomic criteria are considered for resection in a lung segment. In a wedge resection, however, a non-anatomic lung resection is done to remove a wedge of the lung.\xa0''Removing a small diseased portion'' of the lungs is effective because it preserves most of the functional lungs. However, it is only possible when the disease is confined to a small part of the lungs. Because the technique is technically demanding, some surgeons may prefer to wedge out the lung lesion (wedge resection) using a stapler. The recurrence rate of ''cancer'' after a wedge resection, however, is higher than that after a segmentectomy.''Although a lung segmentectomy has been popular for the resection of infected lesions and non-cancerous masses, some experts have also recommended it for very early ''lung cancer''.''The choice for patients with lung ''cancer'' is usually a lobectomy (surgical removal of a lobe of the lung), but in some patients with diseased lungs having a minimal lung reserve, a lung segmentectomy is a good option. Limited pulmonary resection and segmentectomy are also used to treat various lung infections and ''birth defects'' (congenital lung malformations).''Both segmentectomy and lesser lung resection'' can be performed via open surgery (thoracotomy) or a small incision surgery (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or VATS) that yields better outcomes, less ''pain'', and shorter recovery than the traditional techniques.' "
In which cases are lung segmentectomy and limited pulmonary resection done?,'Lung segmentectomy and limited pulmonary resection are performed in the following cases:' Bronchiectasis (abnormal widening of the airways causing an increased risk of infections) Early-stage lung cancer (usually in patients who have significantly reduced heart and lung functions) Lung nodules Tuberculosis Suppurative lesions (lesions filled with and producing pus)
What are the major complications of lung segmentectomy and limited pulmonary resection?,"'Three major complications that can occur during the surgery are massive bleeding due to an injury to the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that supplies the lungs) or its branches, abnormal heart rhythm, and ''pneumothorax'' in the contralateral lung (the presence of air or ''gas'' in the ''cavity'' between the contralateral lung and chest wall, causing the collapse of the lung).''The most common complications of lung segmentectomy and limited pulmonary resection include the following:' Air leakage: Most leaks seal within a few days, but large leaks may persist for weeks Bleeding Residual airspace can occur when a large amount of lung is resected Infection of the pleural space (the space between the lung and its covering or pleura) can occur when residual airspace persists; in some cases, the patient may require another surgery to close off the residual space and eliminate the infection. Respiratory failure is not a direct complication of surgery; patients who have borderline lung function are more likely to develop respiratory distress in the postoperative period. Cardiac complications may include heart attack (myocardial infarction) and arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm)"
Facts you should know about the anatomy of the lungs,"   The lungs exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood. The tracheobronchial tree is the passage way from the mouth to the interior of the lung. Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli deep in the lungs. Breathing air in (inhalation) requires muscular effort. Air is warmed, humidified, and cleaned by the nose and lungs."
What are the lungs?,'The lungs are a pair of organs in the chest that are primarily responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood.' 
What are the symptoms of carbon dioxide poisoning?," The cells in the body constantly need a new supply of oxygen to produce energy. With lack of oxygen, cellular function is impaired and damage or cell death may occur. As energy is utilized, waste products are created, one of which is the gas carbon dioxide. Eliminating carbon dioxide from the body is just as important as breathing in oxygen from the air. If carbon dioxide builds up in the blood it will lead to headaches, drowsiness, coma, and eventually even death."
What is the structure of the respiratory system?,"'Air enters the body via the nose (preferably) or the mouth. The air enters the main windpipe, called the trachea, and continues en route to each lung via either the right or left bronchus (plural=bronchi). The lungs are separated into sections called lobes, two on the left and three on the right. The air passages continue to divide into ever smaller tubes, which finally connect with tiny air sacs called alveoli. This gradually branching array of tubes is referred to as the tracheobronchial ""tree"" because of the remarkable similarity to the branching pattern of a tree.''The other half of the respiratory system involves blood circulation. Venous blood from the body is returned to the right side of the ''heart'' and then pumped out via the pulmonary artery. This artery splits in two for the left and right lungs and then continues to branch much like the tracheobronchial tree. These vessels branch into a fine network of very tiny tubes called capillaries. The capillaries are situated adjacent to the alveoli and are so small that only one red blood cell at a time can pass through their openings. It is during this passage that gases are exchanged between the blood and the air in the nearby alveoli. After passing the alveoli, capillaries then join together to begin forming the pulmonary veins, which carry the blood back to the left side of the heart.' "
What are the differences between inhalation and exhalation?,"'Respiration is divided into two components, inhalation and exhalation.''Inhalation is active'', because it requires muscle contraction. The major muscle of respiration is a sheet-like dome shaped muscle called the ''diaphragm'' that is located below the lungs. The diaphragm separates the chest and abdominal ''cavities''. As the diaphragm contracts, it flattens out, moving toward the abdominal ''cavity''. This action causes an increase in the size of the chest ''cavity'', thus creating a vacuum. Air is then sucked in through the mouth or nose. When physical activity increases dramatically, or with some lung conditions, other muscles like those of the neck and those between the ribs also assist in the increase in size of the chest cavity. These muscles are referred to as accessory muscles of respiration.''Exhalation is passive'' because it does not require muscle contraction. During this phase, the expanded lung acts like a stretched rubber band and simply contracts to its resting position. This contraction forces air out of the lungs and through the mouth.' "
What is the process of the respiratory system?," As energy is utilized by cells, one of the waste products is the gas carbon dioxide. Oxygen-enriched red blood cells release oxygen to the cells of the body and then pick up the waste carbon dioxide. This oxygen- deprived, dark blue blood is then delivered to the blood vessels of the lungs. Carbon dioxide is released by the red cells, easily passes through the capillary wall into the space in the air sac of the adjacent alveoli, and is then eliminated with each breath out of the mouth (exhalation). Oxygen present in the air sac easily passes into the capillaries and into the red blood cells. The capillary network carrying this oxygen-rich, bright red blood flows to larger vessels and eventually empties into the left side of the heart where it is pumped to all the tissues of the body. Thus, the cycle or circle of blood is complete; hence, the name circulation."
What are other important events during the breathing cycle?," Outside air needs to be heated and moistened to match the body's temperature and humidity. As air passes down the tracheobronchial tree, it is warmed and water is added. Contaminants must also be removed. Nose hairs and tiny microscopic hairs called cilia, along with sticky mucus produced by the lining membrane help cleanse the air of impurities. Cilia beat in a synchronized fashion brushing any collected dirt and mucus up toward the mouth. The accumulated material is then coughed out or swallowed. By the time the air reaches the alveoli, it is virtually sterile."
What is pleural effusion?,"'''A ''pleural effusion'' is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space, an area between the layers of tissue that line the ''lungs'' and the chest wall. It may also be referred to as effusion or pulmonary effusion. The type of fluid that forms a ''pleural effusion'' may be categorized as either ''transudate'' or ''exudate''.' Transudate is usually composed of ultrafiltrates of plasma due to an imbalance in vascular hydrostatic and oncotic forces in the chest (heart failure, cirrhosis). Exudate is typically produced by inflammatory conditions (lung infection, lung cancer). Exudative pleural effusions are usually more serious and difficult to treat."
What causes pleural effusion?,"'There are many causes of pleural effusions. The following is a list of some of the major causes:''The development of a pleural effusion occurs from fluid seeping into the pleural space, a thin area between the visceral and pleural membranes in the chest ''cavity'', which normally contains a small amount of fluid to facilitate smooth lung movement. Fluid under pressure, ''malignant'' cells, and infectious agents can occasionally enter the pleural ''cavity'' and cause it to expand with abnormal amounts of fluid and other compounds (see diagnosis section).'   Congestive heart failure Kidney failure Infection Malignancy Pulmonary embolism Hypoalbuminemia Cirrhosis Lung cancer Trauma"
What are the risk factors for pleural effusion?,"'Pleural effusions are caused by the underlying medical problems listed previously, therefore the presence of any of these medical problems are risk factors for the development of pleural effusions. It is important to note, however, that not all individuals with these medical problems will develop pleural effusions. ''Congestive heart failure'' is the most common cause of ''transudative ''pleural effusions, while infection (''pneumonia'') and malignancy are the most common causes of ''exudative ''pleural effusions.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of pleural effusion?,"'Common symptoms associated with pleural effusion may include the following:''Deep breathing typically increases the ''pain''. Symptoms of ''fever'', ''chills'', and ''loss of appetite'' often accompany pleural effusions caused by infectious agents.'   chest pain, difficulty breathing, painful breathing (pleurisy), and cough (either a dry cough or a productive cough)."
What procedures and tests diagnose pleural effusions?,"""The patient's history and physical exam may indicate a presumptive diagnose of pleural effusion. For example, a patient with a history of congestive ""'heart failure'' or ''cirrhosis'' with symptoms of ''cough'', difficulty breathing, and pleuritic ''chest pain'' may have a pleural effusion. Findings from the physical exam, such as dullness to percussion of the lung area (when tapping the area of the lung with a finger, the percussion or sound is dull -- if no fluid exists in the area the sound will be lighter), decreased vibration (decreased tactile fremitus), and asymmetrical chest expansion (the ''lungs'' do not inflate or deflate equally) may also be evidence of a pleural effusion. Other physical exam findings detected with a stethoscope may include reduced or inaudible breath sounds on the affected side, egophony (patient voices the letter ""e,"" but when listening [auscultation] it sounds like ""a""), and a friction rub (if there is fluid in the pleural area, the ''heart'' will rub against the inflamed or fluid-filled space).''Chest X-ray'' can detect pleural effusions, as they usually appear as whitish areas at the lung base, and they may occur on only one side (unilateral) or on both sides (bilateral). If a person lies on their side for a few minutes, most pleural effusions will move and layer out along that side of the chest cavity which is positioned downward (because of the effects of gravity). This movement of the pleural effusion can be seen on a ''chest X-ray'' taken with the person lying on their side (a lateral decubitus X-ray).''Other imaging tests, such as ''CT scan'', may be ordered to further identify the possible cause and the extent of the pleural effusion.''Diagnosing the cause(s) of a pleural effusion often begins with determining whether the fluid is transudate or exudate. This is important because the results of this fluid analysis may provide a diagnosis and determine the course of treatment. Thoracentesis (a procedure to remove the fluid from the pleural space) followed by laboratory analysis of the fluid can differentiate between transudate and exudate. The results from the fluid obtained from the thoracentesis are compared to certain blood tests (for example, LDH, glucose, protein, pH, ''cholesterol'' and others). Additional testing of the pleural fluid may also include a cell count, cytology, and cultures. Criteria are then used to differentiate exudate from transudate. Exudative effusions have the following characteristics:''Other health care professionals may use different criteria to determine the presence of exudate, such as the ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein levels > 0.5, LDH ratio > 0.6 and LDH ratio > 2/3 the upper limits of normal. Other pleural fluid analysis test results (cytology or amylase, for example) may also reveal the source of the effusion.' Pleural fluid LDH > 0.45 of the upper limits of normal blood values Pleural fluid protein level > 2.9g/dL Pleural fluid cholesterol level > 45mg/dL"
What is the treatment for pleural effusion?,"'Small transudative effusions may require no treatment, while larger ones and most exudative pleural effusions require treatment. The initial treatment of choice is drainage of the pleural fluid. This is done by thoracentesis (this procedure may be both diagnostic and therapeutic), where a chest tube is inserted into the effusion, and the effusion is drained out. This procedure needs monitoring, and in some instances, the tube may need to remain in the pleural space for a longer period of time for continued drainage. The need for repeated thoracentesis varies from patient to patient depending on the underlying cause, the amount of effusion fluid, the type of effusion (thick, thin, ''malignant'', or infectious, for example) and if there is recurrence of the pleural effusion.''Some pleural effusions (mainly exudative) may require surgery to break up adhesions, while others may require pleurodesis (pleural sclerosis), a procedure whereby different irritant substances or medications are inserted into the pleural space in order to fibrose and ''scar'' the visceral and pleural surfaces together. This procedure seals the pleural space so that pleural effusions have difficulty reaccumulating.''The use of medications for pleural effusions depends on the underlying cause. Antibiotics are used when there is an infectious cause, whereby diuretics such as ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') may be used to slowly help reduce the size of the pleural effusion.'  "
What are the complications of pleural effusion?,"'The potential complications associated with pleural effusion are:'   lung scarring, pneumothorax (collapse of the lung) as a complication of thoracentesis, empyema (a collection of pus within the pleural space), and sepsis (blood infection) sometimes leading to death."
Can you prevent a pleural effusion?," The development of pleural effusions may sometimes be prevented by the early treatment of the underlying causes listed above. However, in certain cases, the development of pleural effusions may not be preventable. Some pleural effusions may be prevented from reoccurring by having individuals undergo pleurodesis, a procedure that seals up the pleural space."
Facts you should know about lupus," Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. SLE is characterized by the production of unusual antibodies in the blood. The cause(s) of systemic lupus erythematosus is (are) unknown, however, heredity, viruses, ultraviolet light, and drugs all may play some role. Lupus symptoms and signs includebutterfly-shaped rash on the face,appetite loss,joint pain,hair loss,fever,fatigue,photosensitivity,Raynaud's phenomenon,pleuritis, andpericarditis. butterfly-shaped rash on the face, appetite loss, joint pain, hair loss, fever, fatigue, photosensitivity, Raynaud's phenomenon, pleuritis, and pericarditis. Up to 10% of people with lupus isolated to the skin will develop the systemic form of lupus (SLE). Eleven criteria help health care professionals to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus is directed toward decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity with anti-inflammatory medications for those with mild symptoms and corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy) for those with more severe lupus. People with systemic lupus erythematosus can prevent ""flares"" of disease by avoiding sun exposure, not abruptly discontinuing medications, and monitoring their condition with their doctor."
What is systemic lupus erythematosus? What are the different types of lupus?,"""Lupus is an autoimmune disease characterized by acute and chronic inflammation of various tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. The immune system is a complex system within the body that is designed to fight infectious agents, such as bacteria and other foreign microbes. One of the ways that the immune system fights infections is by producing antibodies that bind to the microbes. People with lupus produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body rather than foreign infectious agents. These antibodies are referred to as autoantibodies.""'Because the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can affect tissues anywhere in the body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas. Sometimes lupus can cause disease of the skin, ''heart'', ''lungs'', kidneys, joints, and/or nervous system. When only the skin is involved by ''rash'', the condition is called lupus ''dermatitis'' or cutaneous lupus erythematosus. A form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that can be isolated to the skin, without internal disease, is called discoid lupus erythematosus. When internal organs are involved, the condition is referred to as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).''Both discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus are more common in women than men (about eight times more common). The disease can affect all ages but most commonly begins from 20-45 years of age. Statistics demonstrate that lupus is somewhat more frequent in African Americans and people of Chinese and Japanese descent.' "
What are risk factors and causes of lupus? Is lupus hereditary? Is lupus contagious?,"'The precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. ''Inherited'' genes, viruses, ultraviolet light, and certain medications may all play some role.''Lupus is not caused by an infectious microorganism and is not ''contagious'' from one person to another.''Genetic factors increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and autoimmune ''thyroid disorders'' are more common among relatives of people with lupus than the general population. Moreover, it is possible to have more than one autoimmune disease in the same individual. Therefore, ""overlap"" syndromes of lupus and ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or lupus and ''scleroderma'', etc., can occur.''Some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. Sometimes, ''symptoms of lupus'' can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure.''It also is known that some women with systemic lupus erythematosus can experience worsening of their symptoms prior to their menstrual periods. This phenomenon, together with the female predominance of systemic lupus erythematosus, suggests that female hormones play an important role in the expression of SLE. This hormonal relationship is an active area of ongoing study by scientists.''Research has demonstrated evidence that a key enzyme\'s failure to dispose of dying cells may contribute the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. The enzyme, DNase1, normally eliminates what is called ""garbage DNA"" and other cellular debris by chopping them into tiny fragments for easier disposal. Researchers turned off the DNase1 gene in mice. The mice appeared healthy at birth, but after six to eight months, the majority of mice without DNase1 showed signs of systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, a genetic mutation in a gene that could disrupt the body\'s cellular waste disposal may be involved in the initiation of systemic lupus erythematosus.' "
What is drug-induced lupus?,"'Dozens of medications have been reported to trigger SLE. However, more than 90% of cases of ""drug-induced lupus"" occurs as a side effect of one of the following six drugs: ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline'') is used for ''high blood pressure''; ''quinidine'' (''Quinidine Gluconate'', ''Quinidine Sulfate'') and ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl; Procan-SR; Procanbid) are used for ''abnormal heart rhythms''; ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'') is used for ''epilepsy''; ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid) is used for ''tuberculosis''; and d-''penicillamine'' (used for ''rheumatoid arthritis'  "
What are lupus symptoms and signs?,"'People with SLE can develop different combinations of symptoms and organ involvement.''Common lupus complaints and symptoms and signs include''Complications of organ involvement can lead to further symptoms that depend on the organ affected and severity of the disease.''SLE-associated skin manifestations can sometimes lead to scarring. In discoid lupus, only the skin is typically involved. The skin rash in discoid lupus often is found on the face and ''scalp''. It usually is red and may have raised borders. Discoid lupus ''rashes'' are usually painless and do not ''itch'', but scarring can cause permanent ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Over time, 5%-10% of those with discoid lupus may develop SLE.''Over half of the people with SLE develop a characteristic red, flat facial rash over the ''bridge'' of their nose. Because of its shape, it is frequently referred to as the ""butterfly rash"" of SLE. The rash is painless and does not ''itch''. The facial rash, along with inflammation in other organs, can be precipitated or worsened by exposure to sunlight, a condition called photosensitivity. This photosensitivity can be accompanied by worsening of inflammation throughout the body, called a ""flare"" of the disease.''Typically, with treatment, this rash can heal without permanent scarring.''Most SLE patients will develop arthritis during the course of their illness. Arthritis from SLE commonly involves swelling, ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and even deformity of the small joints of the hands, wrists, and ''feet''. Sometimes, the arthritis of SLE can mimic that of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (another autoimmune disease).''More serious organ involvement with inflammation occurs in the brain, ''liver'', and kidneys. White blood cells can be decreased in SLE (referred to as leukopenia or leucopenia). Also, low blood-clotting factors called platelets (''thrombocytopenia'') can be caused by lupus. Leukopenia can increase the risk of infection, and ''thrombocytopenia'' can increase the risk of bleeding. Low red blood cell counts (hemolytic\xa0''anemia'') can occur.''Inflammation of muscles (''myositis'') can cause ''muscle pain'' and ''weakness''. This can lead to elevations of muscle enzyme levels in the blood.''Inflammation of blood vessels (''vasculitis'') that supply oxygen to tissues can cause isolated injury to a nerve, the skin, or an internal organ. The blood vessels are composed of arteries that pass oxygen-rich blood to the tissues of the body and veins that return oxygen-depleted blood from the tissues to the lungs. ''Vasculitis'' is characterized by inflammation with damage to the walls of various blood vessels. The damage blocks the circulation of blood through the vessels and can cause injury to the tissues that are supplied with oxygen by these vessels.''Inflammation of the lining of the lungs (pleuritis) with pain aggravated by deep ''breathing'' (''pleurisy'') and of the heart (pericarditis) can cause sharp ''chest pain''. The chest pain is aggravated by ''coughing'', deep breathing, and certain changes in body position. The heart muscle itself rarely can become inflamed (''carditis''). It has also been shown that young women with SLE have a significantly increased risk of ''heart attacks'' due to ''coronary artery disease''.''Kidney inflammation in SLE (lupus nephritis) can cause leakage of protein into the urine, fluid retention, ''high blood pressure'', and even ''kidney failure''. This can lead to further ''fatigue'' and swelling (''edema'') of the legs and feet. With ''kidney failure'', machines are needed to cleanse the blood of accumulated waste products in a process called ''dialysis''.''Involvement of the brain can cause personality changes, thought disorders (psychosis), ''seizures'', and even ''coma''. Lupus of the nervous system (neurologic lupus) can lead to damage to nerves cause numbness, tingling, and weakness of the involved body parts or extremities. Brain involvement is referred to as lupus cerebritis.''Many people with SLE experience ''hair loss'' (alopecia). Often, this occurs simultaneously with an increase in the activity of their disease. The hair loss can be patchy or diffuse and appear to be more like hair thinning.''Some people with SLE have '""Raynaud's"""" phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon causes the blood vessels of the hands and feet to spasm, especially upon exposure to cold. The blood supply to the fingers and/or toes then becomes compromised, causing blanching, whitish and/or bluish discoloration, and pain and numbness in the exposed fingers and toes.""'Other diseases and conditions that can accompany lupus include ''fibromyalgia'', coronary ''heart disease'', nonbacterial ''valvular heart disease'', ''pancreatitis'', ''esophagus'' disease with ''difficulty swallowing'' (''dysphagia''), ''swollen lymph nodes'' (''lymphadenopathy''), ''liver disease'' (lupoid ''hepatitis''), infections, and a tendency to spontaneous blood clotting and thrombosis.'   fatigue or feeling tired, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, joint pain, muscle aches, hair loss (alopecia), arthritis, ulcers of the mouth and nose, facial rash (""butterfly rash""), unusual sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), chest pain caused by inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lungs (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis), and poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure (Raynaud's phenomenon)."
How do health care professionals diagnose lupus?,"'Since SLE patients can have a wide variety of symptoms and different combinations of organ involvement, no single blood test establishes the diagnosis of systemic lupus. To help doctors improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of SLE, 11 criteria were established by the American Rheumatism Association. These 11 criteria are closely related to the symptoms discussed above. Some people suspected of having SLE may never develop enough criteria for a definite diagnosis. Other people accumulate enough criteria only after months or years of observation. When a person has four or more of these criteria, the diagnosis of SLE is strongly suggested. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of SLE may be made in some settings in people with only a few of these classical criteria, and treatment may sometimes be instituted at this stage. Of these people with minimal criteria, some may later develop other criteria, but many never do.''The following are 11 criteria used for diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus:''In addition to the 11 criteria, other tests can be helpful in evaluating people with SLE to determine the severity of organ involvement. These include routine testing of the blood to detect inflammation (for example, the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', or ESR, and the ''C-reactive protein'', or CRP), blood-chemistry testing, direct analysis of internal body fluids, and tissue biopsies. Abnormalities in body fluids (joint or cerebrospinal fluid) and tissue samples (kidney biopsy, ''skin biopsy'', and nerve biopsy) can further support the diagnosis of SLE. The appropriate testing procedures are selected for the patient individually by the doctor.' Malar rash (over the cheeks of the face) Discoid skin rash (patchy redness with hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation that can cause scarring) Photosensitivity (skin rash in reaction to sunlight [ultraviolet light] exposure) Mucous membrane ulcers (spontaneous sores or ulcers of the lining of the mouth, nose, or throat) Arthritis (two or more swollen, tender joints of the extremities) Pleuritis or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining tissue around the heart or lungs, usually associated with chest pain upon breathing or changes of body position) Kidney abnormalities (abnormal amounts of urine protein or clumps of cellular elements called casts detectable with a standard urinalysis)Note: Ultimately, in patients with kidney disease from systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus nephritis), a kidney biopsy may be necessary to both define the cause of the kidney disease as being lupus-related as well as to determine the stage of the kidney disease in order to optimally guide treatments. Kidney biopsies are often performed by fine-needle aspiration of the kidney under radiology guidance, but in certain circumstances, a kidney biopsy can be done during an open abdominal operation. Brain irritation (manifested by seizures [convulsions] and/or psychosis, referred to as ""lupus cerebritis"") Blood-count abnormalities: low white blood count (WBC) or red blood count (RBC), or platelet count on routine complete blood count testing; leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Each of these are detectable with standard complete blood count testing (CBC). Immunologic disorder (abnormal immune tests include anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) or anti-Sm [anti-Smith] antibodies, falsely positive blood test for syphilis, anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, or positive LE prep test) Antinuclear antibody (positive ANA antibody testing [antinuclear antibodies in the blood])"
What specialties of health care professionals treat lupus?,"'Lupus is treated by internal medicine subspecialists called ''rheumatologists'"". Depending on whether or not specific organs are targeted, other health specialists who can be involved in the care of patients with lupus include dermatologists, nephrologists, hematologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and neurologists. It's not uncommon that a team of such physicians is coordinated by the treating ""'rheumatologist'' together with the primary care doctor.' "
What is the treatment for lupus? Is there a cure for lupus?,"""There is no permanent cure for SLE. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and protect organs by decreasing inflammation and/or the level of autoimmune activity in the body. The precise treatment is decided on an individual basis. Many people with mild symptoms may need no treatment or only intermittent courses of anti-inflammatory medications. Those with more serious illness involving damage to internal organ(s) may require high doses of corticosteroids in combination with other medications that suppress the body's immune system.""'People with SLE need more rest during periods of active disease. Researchers have reported that poor ''sleep'' quality was a significant factor in developing fatigue in people with SLE. These reports emphasize the importance for people and physicians to address ''sleep'' quality and the effect of underlying ''depression'', lack of ''exercise'', and self-care coping strategies on overall health. During these periods, carefully prescribed ''exercise'' is still important to maintain muscle tone and range of motion in the joints.''To protect from sun sensitivity, sunscreens, sun avoidance, and ''sun protection'' clothing are used. Certain types of lupus rash can respond to topical cortisone medications.''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') are helpful in reducing inflammation and pain in muscles, joints, and other tissues. Examples of NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''). Since the individual response to NSAIDs varies, it is common for a doctor to try different NSAIDs to find the most effective one with the fewest side effects. The most common side effects are stomach upset, ''abdominal pain'', ulcers, and even ulcer bleeding. NSAIDs are usually taken with food to reduce side effects. Sometimes, medications that prevent ulcers while taking NSAIDs, such as ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''), are given simultaneously.''Corticosteroids are more potent than NSAIDs in reducing inflammation and restoring function when the disease is active. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful when internal organs are affected. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth, injected directly into the joints and other tissues, or administered intravenously. Unfortunately, corticosteroids have serious side effects when given in high doses over prolonged periods, and the doctor will try to monitor the activity of the disease in order to use the lowest doses that are safe. Side effects of corticosteroids include ''weight gain'', thinning of the bones and skin, infection, ''diabetes'', facial puffiness, ''cataracts'', and death (necrosis) of the tissues in large joints.''Hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil) is an antimalarial medication found to be particularly effective for SLE patients with fatigue, skin involvement, and joint disease. Consistently taking Plaquenil can prevent flare-ups of lupus. Side effects are uncommon but include ''diarrhea'', ''upset stomach'', and eye-pigment changes. Eye-pigment changes are rare but require monitoring by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) during treatment with Plaquenil. Researchers have found that Plaquenil significantly decreased the frequency of abnormal ''blood clots'' in people with systemic lupus. Moreover, the effect seemed independent of immune suppression, implying that Plaquenil can directly act to prevent the blood clots. This fascinating study highlights an important reason for people and doctors to consider Plaquenil for long-term use, especially for those SLE people who are at some risk for blood clots in veins and arteries, such as those with phospholipid antibodies (cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and false-positive ''venereal disease'' research laboratory test). This means not only that Plaquenil reduces the chance for re-flares of SLE, but it can also be beneficial in thinning the blood to prevent abnormal excessive blood clotting. Plaquenil is commonly used in combination with other treatments for lupus.''For resistant skin disease, other antimalarial drugs, such as ''chloroquine'' (''Aralen'') or quinacrine, are considered and can be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine. Alternative medications for skin disease include ''dapsone'' and retinoic acid (Retin-A). Retin-A is often effective for an uncommon wart-like form of lupus skin disease. For more severe skin disease, immunosuppressive medications are considered as described below.''Medications that suppress immunity (immunosuppressive medications) are also called cytotoxic drugs. They are sometimes referred to as chemotherapy because they are also used to treat ''cancer'', generally in much higher doses than those used to treat lupus. Immunosuppressive medications are used for treating people with more severe manifestations of SLE, such as damage to internal organ(s). Examples of immunosuppressive medications include ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune''), and the disease-modifying drug ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). All immunosuppressive medications can seriously depress blood-cell counts and increase risks of infection and bleeding. Immunosuppressive medications may not be taken during ''pregnancy'' or ''conception'' because of risk to the fetus. Other side effects are specific for each drug. For examples, methotrexate can cause liver toxicity, while cyclosporine can impair kidney function.''In recent years, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''CellCept'') has been used as an effective medication for lupus, particularly when it is associated with kidney disease. CellCept has been helpful in reversing active lupus kidney disease (lupus ''renal disease'') and in maintaining remission after it is established. Its lower side-effect profile has advantage over traditional immune-suppression medications.''In lupus patients with serious brain (lupus cerebritis) or kidney disease (lupus nephritis), plasmapheresis is sometimes used to remove antibodies and other immune substances from the blood to suppress immunity. Plasmapheresis is a process of removing blood and passing the blood through a filtering machine, then returning the blood to the body with its antibodies removed. Rarely, people with SLE can develop seriously low platelet levels, thereby increasing the risk of excessive and spontaneous bleeding. Since the spleen is believed to be the major site of platelet destruction, surgical removal of the spleen is sometimes performed to improve platelet levels. Other treatments have included plasmapheresis and the use of male hormones.''Plasmapheresis has also been used to remove certain harmful proteins (cryoglobulins) that can lead to vasculitis. End-stage kidney damage from SLE requires dialysis and/or a ''kidney transplant''.''Research is indicating benefits of ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') in treating lupus. Rituximab is an intravenously infused antibody that suppresses a particular white blood cell, the B cell, by decreasing their number in the circulation. B cells have been found to play a central role in lupus activity, and when they are suppressed, the disease tends toward remission. This may particularly helpful for people with kidney disease.''Another new B-cell-suppressing treatment is ''belimumab'' (''Benlysta''). Belimumab blocks the stimulation of the B cells (a B-lymphocyte stimulator or BLyS-specific inhibitor) and is approved for the treatment of adults with active autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus who are receiving standard therapy. It is important to note that the efficacy of belimumab has not been evaluated in patients with severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus. Belimumab has not been studied in combination with other biologic therapies or intravenous cyclophosphamide.'  "
Is there a lupus diet?,"'While there is no specific lupus ''diet'', scientists have found that low-dose ''diet'' supplementation with ''omega-3'' fish oils could help patients with lupus by decreasing inflammation and disease activity and possibly decreasing heart-disease risk. It is generally recommended that patients with lupus eat a balanced diet that includes plant-based foods and lean sources of protein.''DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) has been helpful in reducing fatigue, improving thinking difficulties, and improving quality of life in people with SLE. Recent research indicates that DHEA diet supplementation has been shown to improve or stabilize signs and symptoms of SLE. DHEA is commonly available in health-food stores, pharmacies, and many groceries.'  "
How can a lupus patient help prevent disease activity (flares)?,"'SLE is undoubtedly a potentially serious illness with involvement of numerous organ systems. However, it is important to recognize that most people with SLE lead full, active, and healthy lives. Periodic increases in disease activity (flares) can usually be managed by varying medications. Since ultraviolet light can precipitate and worsen flares, people with systemic lupus should avoid sun exposure. Sunscreens and clothing covering the extremities can be helpful. Abruptly stopping medications, especially corticosteroids, can also cause flares and should be avoided. People with SLE are at increased risk of infections as SLE-related complications, especially if they are taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. Therefore, any unexpected fever should be reported to medical professionals and evaluated.''The key to successful management of SLE is regular contact and communication with the doctor, allowing monitoring of symptoms, disease activities, and treatment of side effects.' "
How can systemic lupus erythematosus affect pregnancy or the newborn?,"'Lupus pregnancy deserves special review because it presents unique challenges. ''Pregnant'' women with SLE are considered high-risk ''pregnancies''. These pregnancies require interactive monitoring generally by a skilled rheumatologist together with an obstetrician expert in high-risk pregnancies. Women with SLE who are pregnant require close observation during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. This includes fetal monitoring by the obstetrician during later pregnancy. These women can have an increased risk of miscarriages (spontaneous abortions) and can have flares of SLE during pregnancy. The presence of phospholipid antibodies, such as cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, in the blood can identify people at risk for miscarriages. Cardiolipin antibodies are associated with a tendency toward blood clotting. Women with SLE who have cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant may need blood-thinning medications (aspirin with or without ''heparin'') during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages. Other reported treatments include the use of intravenous gamma globulin for selected people with histories of premature ''miscarriage'' and those with low blood-clotting elements (platelets) during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have had a previous blood-clotting event may benefit by continuation of blood-thinning medications throughout and after pregnancy for up to six to 12 weeks, at which time the risk of clotting associated with pregnancy seems to diminish. Plaquenil has now been found to be safe for use to treat SLE during pregnancy. Corticosteroids, such as ''prednisone'', are also safely used to treat certain manifestation of lupus during pregnancy.''Lupus antibodies can be transferred from the mother to the fetus and result in lupus illness in the ''newborn'' (""''neonatal'' lupus""). This includes the development of low red cell counts (hemolytic anemia) and/or white blood cell counts (leucopenia) and platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and skin rash. Problems can also develop in the electrical system of the baby\'s heart (congenital ''heart block''). Occasionally, a ''pacemaker'"" for the baby's heart is needed in this setting. Neonatal lupus and congenital heart block are more common in newborns of mothers with SLE who carry specific antibodies referred to as anti-Ro (or anti-SSA) and anti-La (or anti-SSB). (It is helpful for the newborn baby's doctor to be made aware if the mother is known to carry these antibodies, even prior to delivery. The risk of heart block is 2%; the risk of neonatal lupus is 5%.) Neonatal lupus usually clears after 6 months of age, as the mother's antibodies are slowly metabolized by the baby."" "
What is the prognosis of lupus? What does the future hold for people with systemic lupus?,"'Overall, the outlook for people living with systemic lupus is improving each decade with the development of more accurate monitoring tests and treatments.''The role of the immune system in causing diseases is becoming better understood through research. This knowledge will be applied to design safer and more effective treatment methods. For example, completely revising the immune system of people with extremely aggressive treatments that virtually temporarily wipe out the immune system is being evaluated. Current studies involve immune eradication with or without replacement of cells that can reestablish the immune system (stem-cell transplantation).''It should be noted that people with SLE are at a somewhat increased risk for developing ''cancer''. The ''cancer'' risk is most dramatic for blood ''cancers'', such as ''leukemia'' and ''lymphoma'', but is also increased for ''breast cancer''. This risk probably relates, in part, to the altered immune system that is characteristic of SLE.''Women with SLE appear to be at increased risk for ''heart disease'' (''coronary artery disease'') according to recent reports. Women with SLE should be evaluated and counseled to minimize risk factors for ''heart disease'', such as elevated blood ''cholesterol'', quitting ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''obesity''.''Landmark research has shown clearly that ''oral contraceptives'' do not increase the rate of flares of systemic lupus erythematosus. This important finding is opposite to what has been thought for years. Now we can reassure women with lupus that if they take birth-control pills, they are not increasing their risk for lupus flares. ''Note'': Women who are at increased risk of blood clotting, such as women with lupus who have phospholipid antibodies (including cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant), should avoid birth-control pills or any estrogen medications.''Individuals living with SLE can improve their long-term prognosis by learning about the many aspects of the illness as well as closely monitoring their own health with their doctors.'

Where can one get more information about systemic lupus erythematosus?,"'For more information about systemic lupus erythematosus, see the following sites:''The Arthritis Foundation (http://www.arthritis.org)''PO Box 19000''Atlanta, GA 30326''Lupus Foundation of Minnesota (http://www.lupusmn.org)' "
What is lupus?,'Lupus'' is a general term that refers to any of the various chronic inflammatory diseases that are marked by inflammation of the skin and are caused by autoimmunity. Classic ''lupus'' is also termed ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' (''SLE'') and typically initially appears as a ''rash'' accompanied by ''joint pain'' and ''fever''. There are many subclasses of ''lupus''.' 
Is lupus contagious?,"'Lupus'' is not ''contagious'"". Lupus cannot be transferred from one person to another by touching the skin lesions or by physical contact. The specific cause of lupus is not known, but many genetic predispositions (HLA types, regulatory genes) and gene-environment interactions (UV exposure, the immune system's response to microbes and/or ""'drugs'') have been identified that predispose individuals to develop this autoimmune disease.' "
How will someone know if he or she has lupus?,"'If a person has an onset of joint ''pain'', ''fever'', and a ''rash'', lupus is considered as a possible cause. If the person is ''pregnant'' or if there is a family history of lupus or any autoimmune disease, the diagnosis of SLE becomes more likely. However the American College of ''Rheumatology'' has developed criteria that can be helpful in diagnosing the systemic form of lupus (SLE). There are 11 diagnostic basic criteria. When an individual has at least four of these criterions, they are likely to have ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' (SLE). Briefly, the following is a list of the 11 criteria:''The diagnosis is usually made by a medical ''caregiver'' skilled in the diagnosis of lupus (such as rheumatologists or dermatologists).' Serositis (inflammation of the lining of the lungs or abdomen) Oral ulcers Arthritis (inflammation of many joints) Photosensitivity (rash after sun exposure) Blood disorders (low white, red, or platelet blood counts) Kidney problems (renal failure) Gastrointestinal problems (nausea, abdominal pain) Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) Immunologic abnormalities (DNA antibody, cardiolipin antibody, false positive VDRL) Neurologic disorder (seizures or psychosis) Cardiac problems (pericarditis, myocarditis) Facial cheek reddish rash (malar rash) Focal areas of hyper- and hypopigmentation and scarring (discoid rash)"
Can lupus spread?,"'Lupus does not spread from one individual to another. However, in an individual, the manifestations of the disease and their severity may increase in intensity and location over time.' "
Is there a cure for lupus?,"'There is no cure for lupus. Fortunately, there are many different drugs that can be used to reduce symptoms and control the disease. Treatments are individualized usually by the specialist, such as a ''rheumatologist'' for joint and internal organ problems, dermatologist for skin problems and/or other specialists depending upon what organ system is affected.' "
When should someone seek medical care for lupus?,"'If a person suspects that they may have risk factors and some symptoms (see criteria above) of SLE, the individual should seek medical care quickly. The earlier the person is diagnosed and begins treatment, the better the outcome for the patient. Early intervention that reduces lupus inflammation helps protect body organs.' "
What is Lyme disease? What causes Lyme disease?,"'A bacterium called a ""spirochete"" causes Lyme disease, a ''tick-borne disease''. In the United States, the actual name of the bacteria are ''Borrelia burgdorferi'' and ''Borrelia mayonii''. In Europe, the bacteria ''Borrelia afzelii'' and ''Borrelia garinii'' also cause Lyme disease. Certain ticks (''Ixodes scapularis'') frequently found on deer, particularly white-tailed deer, from various locations harbor the bacterium in their stomachs. Dr. Burgdorfer originally discovered the spiral-shaped bacterium in the gut of the ticks in the United States, hence the naming ''Borrelia burgdorferi''. ''Lyme borreliosis is spread by these infected ticks when they bite the skin, which permits the transmission of the ''Borrelia'' spirochete through the skin to infect the body. So Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease. Lyme disease is not ''contagious'' from an affected person to someone else. Lyme disease can cause abnormalities in the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system. Borreliosis, a tick-borne disease, is an infectious disease that is reportable to the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' in the United States.'  "
What is the history of Lyme disease?,"'Interestingly, the disease only became apparent in 1975 when mothers of a group of children who lived near each other in Lyme, Conn., made researchers aware that their children had all been diagnosed with ''joint pain'' from ''rheumatoid arthritis''. This unusual grouping of illness that appeared ""rheumatoid"" eventually led researchers to the identification of the bacterial cause of the children\'s condition, what was then named ""Lyme disease"" in 1982.''The only vector for Lyme disease in the U.S. is the black-legged tick, or deer tick, known as ''Ixodes scapularis''. These ticks are carriers of the Lyme disease spirochete in their stomachs; ''Ixodes'' ticks may also transmit ''Powassan'' virus. The ticks then are vectors that can transmit the bacterium to humans with a tick bite. The number of cases of the tick-borne illness in an area depends on the number of ticks present and how often the ticks are infected with the bacteria. In certain areas of New York, where Lyme disease is common, over half of the ticks are infected. Lyme disease has been reported most often in the northeastern United States, but it has been reported in all 50 states, as well as China, Europe, Japan, Australia, and parts of the former Soviet Union. In the United States, it is primarily contracted in the Northeast in the states from Maine to Maryland, in the Midwest in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and in the West in Oregon and Northern California. What those children actually had was Lyme ''arthritis''.' "
What are risk factors for developing Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease occurs most frequently in children 5-14 years of age and adults 40-50 years of age. The most substantial risk factor for Lyme disease is exposure to the ticks located in the high-risk areas of the country listed above, particularly in the New England states, as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin. Additional risk factors include recreational and occupational exposure to ticks and outdoor activities, including gardening, in woods, and fields in the high-risk areas. No transplacental transmission (congenital infection) of Lyme disease from the mother to the unborn child has ever been described. Again, Lyme disease is not contagious from one person to another.' "
What are Lyme disease symptoms and signs?,"'Lyme disease affects different areas of the body in varying degrees as it progresses. The site where the tick bites the skin is where the bacteria enter the body through the skin. Days to weeks later, as the bacteria spread in the skin away from the initial tick bite, the tick-borne infection causes an expanding reddish ''rash'' that is often associated with ""''flu-like''"" symptoms. Later, it can produce abnormalities in the joints, heart, and nervous system.''Lyme disease is medically described in three phases (stages) as: (1) early localized disease with ''skin inflammation'' and ''rash''; (2) early disseminated disease with heart and nervous system involvement, including palsies and meningitis; and (3) late disease featuring motor and sensory nerve damage and brain inflammation, as well as arthritis.''In the early phase of the illness, within days to weeks of the tick bite, the skin around the bite develops an expanding ring of unraised redness. There may be an outer ring of brighter redness with or without a central area of clearing, leading to a ""bull\'s-eye"" appearance. This classic initial rash is called ""''erythema migrans''"" (formerly called erythema chronicum migrans). Patients often can\'t recall the tick bite (the ticks can be as small as the periods in this paragraph). Also, they may not have the identifying rash to signal the doctor. The rash may or may not ''itch''. More than one in four patients never even develop a rash. The redness of the skin is often accompanied by generalized ''fatigue'', muscle and joint ''pain'' and ''stiffness'', ''swollen lymph nodes'' (""swollen glands""), ''headache'', and less often ''fever'', resembling symptoms of a viral infection.''The redness resolves, without treatment, in about a month. Weeks to months after the initial redness of the skin, the bacteria and their effects spread throughout the body. Subsequently, disease in the joints, heart, and nervous system can occur.''The later phases of Lyme borreliosis can affect the heart, causing inflammation of the heart muscle. This can result in ''abnormal heart rhythms'' and ''heart failure''. The nervous system signs can include facial muscle ''paralysis'"" (Bell's palsy), abnormal sensation due to disease of peripheral nerves (""'peripheral neuropathy''), meningitis, and ''confusion''. Arthritis, or inflammation in the joints, begins with swelling, stiffness, and ''pain''. Usually, only one or a few joints become affected, most commonly the knees. Lyme arthritis can look like many other types of inflammatory arthritis and can become chronic.''Researchers have also found that ''anxiety'' and ''depression'' occur with an increased rate in people with Lyme disease. This is another important aspect of the evaluation and management of this condition.'  "
What types of doctors treat Lyme disease?,"'Doctors who are involved in the treatment of Lyme disease include primary care physicians (including pediatricians, family medicine doctors, and internists), as well as specialists in infectious disease, ''rheumatology'', and neurology.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose Lyme disease?,"""In early Lyme disease, doctors can sometimes make a diagnosis simply by finding the classic red rash (described above), particularly in people who have recently been in regions in which Lyme disease is common. The doctor might review the patient's history and examine the patient in order to exclude diseases with similar findings in the joints, heart, and nervous system.""'Blood tests for antibodies to Lyme bacteria are generally not necessary or helpful in early stage disease, but it can help in diagnosis in later stages. (Antibodies are produced by the body to attack the bacteria and can be evidence of exposure to the bacteria. These antibodies can be detected using a laboratory method called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [''ELISA''].) Antibodies, however, can be false indicators of disease, since they can persist for years after the disease is cured. Moreover, false-positive tests in patients with nonspecific findings (those that are not specifically suggestive of Lyme disease) can lead to confusion. Currently, the confirmatory test that is most reliable is the Western Blot assay antibody test. More accurate tests are being developed. Both the ELISA test and the Western Blot tests are analyses of blood samples to test for Lyme disease.''Generally, Lyme blood testing is helpful in a patient who has symptoms compatible with Lyme disease, who has a history of a tick bite at least a month prior, or who has unexplained disorders of the heart, joints, or nervous system that are characteristic of Lyme disease.'  "
Is Lyme disease curable? What is the prognosis of Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. This is so true that some authors of Lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of Lyme disease to antibiotic therapy is a lack of Lyme disease to begin with! The type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. Early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin''), ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil''), or ''cefuroxime'' axetil (''Ceftin''). This antibiotic therapy generally result in a rapid cure of Lyme disease. Of note, doxycycline should not be used in ''pregnancy'' or in children under 8 years of age.'""Therefore, if a person finds a typical bull's-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. Later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous ""'drugs''; examples are ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and ''penicillin'' G. There are no home remedies to treat Lyme disease.''In those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrans rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection.''For relief of ''Lyme disease symptoms'', pain-relieving medicines might be added. ''Swollen joints'' can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (''arthrocentesis'""). An arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. It is usually performed in a doctor's office. Rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. It has been suggested by researchers that sometimes ""'joint inflammation'' can persist even after eradication of the Lyme bacteria. This complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. Oral medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Nuprin'') can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. There is no evidence that nonspecific ''fatigue'' that persists after treatment for Lyme disease is related to persistent infection. The risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation.''Of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent ''symptoms of Lyme disease'' led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. The study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. Specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on ''fatigue'', or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from Lyme disease than placebo.'  "
 What are complications of Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease can be complicated by permanent damage to joints, the heart, the brain, and the nervous system. There is recent research that demonstrates an increased risk for autoimmune forms of arthritis, including ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and peripheral spondyloarthropathy, as a result of chronic Lyme disease (or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome [PTLDS]), even after treatment.' "
Is it possible to prevent Lyme disease? Is there a Lyme disease vaccine?,"'Avoiding known tick-infested areas obviously can prevent transmission of Lyme disease. Because ticks transmit Lyme disease by attaching to the body, it is important to use tick-bite avoidance techniques when visiting endemic areas for ticks. Spraying insect repellant containing DEET onto exposed skin can help to keep ticks off of skin and clothes. Wearing long pants tucked into boots and long sleeves can protect the skin. Clothing, children, and pets should be examined for ticks. Ticks can be removed gently with tweezers and saved in a jar for later identification. Bathing the skin and ''scalp'' and washing clothing upon returning home might prevent the bite and transmission of the disease.''If a person is bitten by the classic deer tick (''Ixodes'') that has been attached for at least 36 hours, a single dose of doxycycline (200 mg) can be very helpful for prevention of Lyme disease. This therapy is not recommended if the tick is acquired in an area where these ticks are not commonly infested (infection rate less than 20%) with the bacterium (''Borrelia'') that causes Lyme disease. Also, doxycycline should not be used in pregnancy or in children under 8 years of age.''Vaccines'' for the prevention of Lyme disease were formerly on the market but have not been commercially available since 2002. Further studies of ''vaccines'' are needed. For now, ideal prevention focuses on the recommendations above.' "
Where can people find more information about Lyme disease?,"'For more information about Lyme disease, please visit the following site:''American Lyme Disease Foundation'' (http://www.aldf.com)''American Lyme Disease Foundation, Inc.''Mill Pond Offices''293 Route 100, Suite 204''Somers, New York 10589''800-876-LYME''Alternatively, you may contact the CDC:''U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)''404-332-4555' "
What is Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease'' (named after the town where it was discovered) is caused by the bacterium ''Borrelia burgdorferi'"" when the bite of an infected tick (black legged tick) transfers the bacterium to humans during the tick's blood meal. ""'Lyme disease'' typically cause ''fever'', ''headache'', ''fatigue'', and often shows a characteristic skin ''rash'"" that looks like a bull's-eye target (""'erythema migrans''). The disease can spread to the joints, heart, and the nervous system. Other mammals can be infected (for example, ''dogs'') by tick bites. However, direct human-to-human, animal-to-animal and transmission between humans and animals does not occur. Only if a tick bites an infected person or animal, becomes infected, and then bites another human or animal, can the disease be transferred.' "
Is Lyme disease contagious?,"'Lyme disease'' is not ''contagious'' from person to person and, to date, has not been reported to be transmitted sexually, by kissing, by blood transfusions, or infected animals (for example, pet dogs). ''Lyme disease'' is transmitted to humans by infected ''ticks'', usually through the bites of ticks that are immature and are termed ""nymphs."" The ticks (nymph stage) are tiny (less than 2 mm diameter) and take about 36-48 hours of attachment to the human before the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are transmitted.' "
How will I know if I have Lyme disease?,"'Usually, a reddish expanding ''rash'' (''erythema migrans'') begins about three to 30 days after an infected ''tick bite''. This rash occurs in about 70%-80% of individuals who become infected and spreads to about 12 inches in diameter and often forms a ""bull\'s-eye"" pattern on the skin. The rash may appear on other parts of the body also and may not form the ""bull\'s-eye"" pattern. Other symptoms and signs that may come and go and are considered later signs (after days to months) are as follows:''Some individuals are not sure they have been bitten by a tick; these individuals who develop any of the symptoms above can be tested to see if they have evidence of Lyme disease. The testing should be done by their physician and the results must be carefully interpreted since the immunoassay tests for Lyme disease may sometimes give equivocal results. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a two-tiered immunoassay (enzyme immunoassay or EIA plus a ""Western blot"") testing system for Lyme disease that is reasonably reliable.' Bell's palsy (facial paralysis on one side of the face) Additional rash formation Pain and swelling of the joints Shooting pains that may interfere with sleep Severe headaches and/or neck stiffness Heart palpitations Episodes of dizziness and/or shortness of breath Short-term memory problems Inflammation of the brain and/or spinal cord"
How is Lyme disease transmitted?,"'Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick and it is not spread from person to person. However, Lyme disease can spread in the community if large areas of tall grasses and brush that surround homes or other places where people congregate become areas where infected ticks reside and where people walk or congregate. Methods to reduce tall grasses and brushy areas where ticks like to live will help control spread of Lyme disease to other individuals. People can protect themselves from tick bites by utilizing repellent sprays and by covering their body with long pants and long-sleeve shirts to help prevent ticks from reaching exposed skin.' "
When will I know I am cured of Lyme disease? How long does Lyme disease last?,"'Patients treated with antibiotics (for example, ''doxycycline'' [''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'', Acticlate, Acticlate Cap, Doryx, Doxteric, Doxy], ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid''], ''cefuroxime'' [''Ceftin'', ''Zinacef'']) in the early stages (about one to 30 days after an infected tick bite) usually recover fairly quickly (days to weeks) with no neurological or cardiac problems. A few individuals may go on to develop post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (sometimes incorrectly termed ""chronic Lyme disease"") in which patients after an appropriate course of antibiotics still have lingering symptoms of ''fatigue'', ''pain'', joint, and muscle aches for up to about six months after antibiotics have been administered. The cause of the syndrome has not been identified, but some researchers think it may be due to a combination of immune responses and residual damage to cells. However, patients adequately treated with antibiotics no longer have the causative bacteria in their system during this syndrome, and this syndrome does not need to be treated with additional antibiotics.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about Lyme disease?,"'If you are unsure that you have been bitten by tick yet you develop a rash, especially if it begins to form a ""bull\'s-eye"" pattern, you should contact a physician. In addition, even if you know you have been infected with Lyme disease, you should contact your physician immediately for appropriate therapy. If you suspect that you have been misdiagnosed or undertreated for Lyme disease, contact your physician or an infectious-disease specialist. Also, if a ''pregnant'"" woman becomes infected, she can transfer the disease to her fetus. If you're pregnant and suspect you may have been exposed to Lyme disease by tick bites, contact your ob-gyn physician immediately."" "
What is a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'Lymph nodes'' are small, bean-shaped structures that contain cells from the immune system. They filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid and are connected to lymph vessels. Lymph nodes can also contain ''cancer'' cells that have spread from the site of the ''cancer'' into the lymphatic fluid. The sentinel lymph nodes are the first few lymph nodes (""lymph gland"") to receive lymphatic drainage from a ''tumor'', meaning that sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes to which ''cancer'' cells would spread. It stands sentinel over the tumor, so to speak. The biopsy is performed to determine if there are cancer cells in the node. If the sentinel ''lymph node'' does not contain cancer cells (a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy), then the cancer has not likely spread to lymph nodes or other organs via the lymphatic system.''Sentinel node biopsy is a common technique to assess the extent of spread of ''breast cancer'' and can spare the patient more extensive axillary lymph node surgery (see below). It is also frequently used in evaluating patients with ''melanoma''.' "
What is the lymphatic drainage?,"'Lymphatic system refers to a collection of vessels that, like the system of blood vessels, circulates fluid through the tissues in all parts of the body. The lymphatic drainage refers to the manner in which tissue fluid, or lymph, is drained from the body and returns to a central location -- in this case, a lymph node. The lymphatic fluid has a milky appearance.' "
"Why do a 
sentinel node biopsy?","'Sentinel node (""gland"") biopsy is performed to examine the tissue of the node to learn whether that node does or does not have tumor cells within it. The biopsy is performed to verify if there are cancer cells present in the lymph node. This procedure helps the surgeon accurately stage the tumor. Staging a tumor refers to determining the extent to which it has spread in the body. A negative biopsy can avoid the removal of a large number of lymph nodes which can lead to ''lymphedema''. Although ''lymphedema'' can be a complication of sentinel lymph node biopsies, it is much more common when multiple lymph nodes need to be removed.'  "
How does a tumor spread?,"'Tumors have only four ways of spreading:''Some tumors spread preferentially by the lymphatic system, meaning that the cancer cells tend to spread by this method.' by local invasion of adjacent tissue, by direct growth or extension into nearby tissues, through the blood stream, and through the lymphatic system."
How is it determined which is the sentinel node?,'Which lymph nodes are the sentinel nodes for a given tumor is determined by injecting around the tumor a tracer substance that will travel through the lymphatic system to the first draining (sentinel) nodes and identify them. The tracer substance may be blue dye that can be visually tracked or a radioactive substance that can be detected as with a hand-held Geiger counter or both.' 
What types of specialists perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed by surgeons. This procedure is most commonly performed to evaluate breast ''cancers'' and melanomas, so breast surgeons often perform this procedure.' "
What happens during a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'After the tracer substance is injected, the surgeon identifies the sentinel lymph node and surgically removes it through a small incision. This may be done in an outpatient surgery center or a hospital operating room. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often done at the same time as the removal of a ''primary tumor''.' "
"What does the 
sentinel lymph node biopsy show?","'Biopsy of the sentinel lymph node can reveal whether there are or are not lymphatic metastases, which are cancer cells that have spread from the original primary tumor into the lymphatic drainage system. The sentinel node can be rapidly evaluated while the patient is still in surgery utilizing the technique of frozen section analysis. The final report on the sentinel node awaits the final analysis by the pathologist on what is called formalin fixed tissue.''If the sentinel node contains tumor cells, removal of more nodes in the area may be warranted. This may be done during the same procedure if the first sample is evaluated while the patient is still in the operating room. If the sentinel node is normal, it is unnecessary to remove many additional lymph nodes, such as the axillary lymph nodes (called an axillary lymph node dissection or ALND) in a patient with ''breast cancer''.' "
What are the benefits of a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'The sentinel node biopsy allows the examination of one lymph node to first determine if a tumor has spread to the lymph nodes at all. If the sentinel node is negative for tumor cells, it is not necessary to surgically remove additional lymph nodes. The procedure helps certain patients avoid more extensive surgical procedures involving the removal of multiple lymph nodes, such as axillary lymph node dissection in patients with ''breast cancer''. It means that the patient will not have to experience the side effects of a more extensive lymph node removal procedure, such as lymphedema (swelling) of the arm in patients who have had axillary node dissection. It can be performed in patients undergoing a ''mastectomy'' or ''lumpectomy'' for breast cancer.' "
What are the side effects and complications of a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'The most common side effects are short-term ''bruising'', ''pain'', or swelling at the biopsy site. As with any surgery, bleeding and infection are possible complications. Another possible risk is a false-negative result, which means that tumor cells are present but not detected by the procedure. Studies with breast cancer patients have shown false-negative rates of around 10%.' "
"Is the use of the 
sentinel lymph node biopsy common?","'Yes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has, for example, become a standard technique for determining the nodal stage of the disease in some patients with ''malignant melanoma'' and with breast cancer. The use of sentinel node biopsy is still being investigated with other types of cancer such as ''colon cancer'', stomach cancers, and others.' "
What is the recovery time after a sentinel lymph node biopsy?,"'The recovery time varies, depending on whether or not the sentinel node biopsy is associated with removal of the primary tumor and the extent of surgery required. In any case, sentinel lymph node biopsy offers a quicker recovery time than a more extensive lymph node dissection.' "
What should I know about swollen lymph nodes (glands)?," Lymph nodes, also referred to as lymph glands, are important part of the immune system. Lymph nodes are located throughout the body but are visible and able to be felt (palpable) only when they are enlarged or swollen. Lymph nodes are regional, and each group of them corresponds to a particular region of the body and reflects abnormalities in that region. Common areas where swollen lymph nodes are more prominent and more readily noticeable are:Behind the earIn the neckThe groinUnder the chinIn the armpits Behind the ear In the neck The groin Under the chin In the armpits Doctors and other health care professionals check these areas for enlarged or swollen lymph nodes. A wide variety infections are the most common causes of swelling of the lymph nodes, for example, strep throat, ear infections, and mononucleosis. More serious medical problems such as HIV infection, lymphomas (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or other cancers, or lupus may cause swollen lymph glands. Rarely, a medication can cause the problem. Symptoms associated with lymph node swelling and related diseases can include pain in the area of the swelling, fever, and fatigue. Not all swollen lymph nodes are abnormal."
What are lymph nodes? What do they do?," Lymph nodes are an important part of the body's immune system and to help fight infections. Swollen lymph nodes usually caused by infection are referred to as lymphadenitis. Lymph nodes (sometimes called lymph glands) are small, soft, round, or oval structures found throughout the body and connected to each other in chain- Lymph is a watery fluid that circulates within the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are found near these vessels. Within the capsule, lymph nodes contain certain kinds of immune cells. These cells are mainly lymphocytes, which produce proteins that capture and fight viruses and other microbes, and macrophages, which destroy and remove the captured material."
Where are the lymph nodes located in the body (pictures)?,"'Lymph nodes are located throughout the body. Some are directly under the skin while others are deep inside the body. Even the most superficial (close to the skin) lymph nodes usually are not visible or palpable (felt by touching), unless they are swollen or enlarged. Lymph nodes are connected to each other by loosely bound lymphatic essels. Lymph nodes generally coalesce in different regions in the body where they are responsible for filtering the blood and performing their immunologic function for that particular area of the body. Fluid from the lymphatic vessels eventually feeds into the venous system (veins) in the body.' "
Are swollen lymph nodes painful?,"'In general, swollen lymph nodes caused by infections, inflammation, or cancers can be painful or tender. Some benign causes of swollen lymph nodes may not be painful.' "
Common locations of swollen lymph nodes,"'Lymph nodes in various parts of the body may become swollen for different reasons. People can often see swollen lymph nodes''Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw:'' Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw are the most common. They may represent an infection around that area, such as a tooth infection or ''abscess'', throat infection, viral illness, or ''upper respiratory infection''. Most of the causes of swollen lymph nodes in this area are benign (noncancerous) but sometimes swelling of these lymph nodes may also suggest a ''cancer'' in the head and neck area.''Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear and in the occipital area (base of the skull):'' Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear or in the base of the skull may correspond to an infection around the ''scalp'' or possibly an eye (''conjunctival'') infection. The most common cause of swollen scalp lymph nodes are ''skin conditions'' affecting the scalp, such as ''dandruff'' (''seborrheic dermatitis''); or an abscess, or soft tissue infection.''The lymph nodes in the underarm (armpit, axilla):'' The lymph nodes in the underarm are anatomically important in ''breast cancer''. They are often checked physically in patients undergoing investigation for ''breast cancer''. They also play an important role in staging (determining the extent) and predicting the outcome of ''breast cancer'' during removal of the ''cancer'' tissue from the breast. Many cancers including lymphoma and ''leukemia'' can cause enlargement of these lymph nodes. (Lymphomas are cancers that originate in the lymph nodes.) These lymph nodes can also become reactive and enlarge due to ''trauma'' to or an infection of the arm on the same side.''Enlarged lymph nodes'' above the collarbone:'' Enlarged lymph nodes above the collarbone (supraclavicular ''lymphadenopathy'') are always considered abnormal. These generally suggest a ''cancer'' of or an infection in the region close by. Examples include lung infection, ''lung cancer'', lymphoma in the chest ''cavity'', or breast cancer. Occasionally cancers that are more distant may seed these lymph nodes, such as genital cancers or ''colon cancer''. Some inflammatory causes of the swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone (clavicle) can include ''tuberculosis'' or ''sarcoidosis''.''Swollen lymph nodes in the groin:'' Swollen lymph nodes in the groin may be normal in young people but they could also result from some ''sexually transmitted diseases'', local infections, infections of a lower extremity (including the foot and toes), or genital cancers.' on the neck, behind the ear, at the base of the skull (occipital area), under the jaw, above the collar bone, under the arms, and around the groin."
How do you check for swollen lymph nodes?,"'Usually lymph nodes are not visible. Once they enlarge, they can become visible in certain areas of the body. Especially behind the ear, or in your neck or groin, you might notice them as enlarged ""''bumps''."" Enlarged lymph glands can also often be felt by slowly moving your hands around the swollen area. You can determine if they are tender or not.' "
What infections and viruses cause swollen lymph nodes?,"'There are many causes for swollen lymph nodes, sometimes referred to as ""swollen glands"" (lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis). In general, lymph nodes become swollen when they are active due to either a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, inflammation, or cancer.''Viral infections are the most common causes of swollen lymph nodes. The most common cause is viral upper respiratory infections such as the ''common cold''.''Viruses that can cause swollen lymph nodes include:'

"What bacteria, parasites, and fungi cause swollen lymph nodes?","'There are many different causes of swollen lymph glands or nodes, for example:''Bacteria''Parasites' Streptococcus Staphylococcus Cat scratch disease Tuberculosis Syphilis Chlamydia Other sexually transmitted diseases Toxoplasmosis Leishmaniasis Coccidiomycosis Histoplasmosis"
"Inflammatory diseases, cancers, and other conditions that cause swollen lymph nodes","'Inflammatory and immunologic causes of swollen lymph nodes include diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''lupus'' as well as sensitivity to some medications.''Many cancers can also cause swelling of lymph nodes. These cancers may originate from the lymph nodes or blood cells such as lymphomas and some types of ''leukemia''. They may also be cancers that spread from another organ in the body (metastatic cancers). For example, breast cancer may spread to the nearest lymph nodes in the underarm (axilla), or ''lung cancer'' may spread to the lymph nodes around the collarbone.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic ''lipid'' storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, ''sarcoidosis'', and many other conditions.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic lipid storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, sarcoidosis, and various other conditions.''Lymph node swelling is not always a sign of an underlying disease. Sometimes swollen lymph nodes can be normal. For example, small (less than 1 centimeter), flat lymph nodes under the jaw (submandibular lymph nodes) in healthy children and young adults or small (up to 2 centimeters), groin lymph nodes (inguinal lymph nodes) in young individuals may be normal.''In many instances, a definitive cause for swollen lymph nodes may not be determined even after performing through examination and testing.' "
Signs and symptoms of swollen lymph nodes,"'Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes vary widely. A person could be completely free of symptoms (asymptomatic) and swollen lymph nodes are may only be found when a doctor notes them during a general physical examination.''Sometimes, swollen lymph nodes can be extremely tender, painful, and disfiguring.''Other signs and symptoms related to an underlying disease that accompany the lymph node swelling may be more significant and clinically relevant than the lymph node swelling alone. Signs and symptoms of more serious medical conditions that may cause swollen lymph nodes may include:'   Fever Night sweats Weight loss Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Swelling of multiple lymph nodes or only an isolated one Localized red patches of the skin over the lymph nodes Hard lumps or masses felt under the skin in the area of the swollen lymph node Sore throat or runny nose Local infections (toothache, sore throat)"
When should I see the doctor for swollen lymph nodes?," If you notice swollen lymph nodes, see your primary care doctor for an evaluation and possible treatment. Depending on the reason for the swelling of the lymph nodes, you might need treatment by a hematologist/oncologist (if the swollen lymph nodes can't be explained or are due to an underlying cancer) or an infectious disease specialist (if they are due to a complicated infection). Sometimes you might be referred to a surgeon to biopsy or remove the lymph node. If swollen lymph nodes are associated with fevers, night sweats, or weight loss, and the person does not have any obvious infection, he or she may need a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. People who were appropriately treated for an infection but have persistent swollen lymph nodes should see their doctor. If a person has a known cancer, or was treated for one in the past and new lymph nodes in the general area of the cancer are noted, see a doctor."
How is the cause of swollen lymph nodes diagnosed?,"""Swollen lymph nodes closer to the surface of the body are generally diagnosed by a doctor's examination and feeling for areas known to have coalescence of lymph nodes, for example, swollen lymph nodes under the arms (axillary lymph nodes), swollen lymph nodes in the sides of the neck (cervical lymph nodes), or swollen lymph nodes in the groin (inguinal lymph nodes). These swollen lymph nodes can be seen and felt easily.""'Other times, deeper lymph nodes could be seen on imaging studies, such as ''CT scan'' (computed tomography), of different parts of the body.''Tonsils'' in the back of the throat are also lymph nodes, and they are the most visible ones in the body.''Diagnosing the cause of swollen lymph nodes may be challenging. The most important component of evaluating a swollen lymph node is a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination by a doctor. The doctor may ask about symptoms such as ''sore throat'', fever and ''chills'', ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'"", a complete list of medications, sexual activity, vaccination history, recent travels, and the patient's own and his/her family's previous history of cancers if any.""'A group of lymph nodes in a particular area of the body reacts to disturbances in that general region. If there is a specific infection in the region of the swollen lymph nodes, that may be the most likely cause of swelling. For instance, infections of the leg or some sexually transmitted diseases can cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin area.''Physicians usually examine the lymph nodes by feeling them and characterize them based upon what the lymph nodes feel like. They could be characterized, for example, as:''These characteristics can be useful in suggesting the cause of the lymph node swelling. For example, a hard, nontender, non-moveable lymph node may be more characteristic of a cancer spread to that node. On the other hand, a soft, tender, moveable lymph node could more likely represent an infection.''If the enlarged lymph nodes are suspected to be related to a cancer, then a biopsy of the lymph node may determine the cancer type. For example, a swollen lymph node around the collar bone (supraclavicular lymph node), may signify lung cancer in a person who may have other clinical clues suggestive of lung cancer.'

What are treatments and remedies for swollen lymph nodes?,"'There is no specific treatment for swollen lymph nodes. The underlying cause needs to be treated, which may result in the resolution of the swollen lymph node.' If an enlarged lymph node causes local discomfort, home remedies include a warm, wet compress to help with pain relief. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used to help reduce swelling and pain. Prescription corticosteroid medications such as Prednisone, Medrol or Decadron may also be used for swelling. Viral infections may be treated with antiviral medications. Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for cancer may consist of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Medications to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus may be prescribed."
How long does it take swollen lymph nodes to resolve (go away )?,"'The time it takes for a swollen lymph node to go away varies widely and depends on the underlying cause.' If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, they may resolve in a few weeks. However, it is common for lymph nodes to remain enlarged for time even after an infection has been treated. If swollen lymph nodes are a result of an autoimmune disorder, they may shrink in size during periods of remission and then enlarge again when the illness flares up. If swollen lymph nodes are due to cancers, it depends on the type and stage of the cancer and whether it has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body and the lymph nodes may remain enlarged for the duration of the treatment."
What are the complications of swollen lymph nodes?,"'There may be complications associated with enlarged lymph nodes. If the lymph node swelling is related to an infection that is not treated, then an abscess (a pus-containing ''cavity'') may result, which may require incisional drainage and antibiotics. The skin underlying the enlarged lymph node may also become infected.''In other cases, the lymph node may become very large and compress other nearby structures in the body. This could be a serious and debilitating problem that may require immediate medical or surgical attention. For example, the lymph node in the underarm (axilla) can compress the blood vessels and nerves supplying the arm. An enlarged lymph node inside the abdomen may compress the ''intestines'' and cause an obstruction of the intestines.'  "
What should I know about swollen lymph nodes (glands)?," Lymph nodes, also referred to as lymph glands, are important part of the immune system. Lymph nodes are located throughout the body but are visible and able to be felt (palpable) only when they are enlarged or swollen. Lymph nodes are regional, and each group of them corresponds to a particular region of the body and reflects abnormalities in that region. Common areas where swollen lymph nodes are more prominent and more readily noticeable are:Behind the earIn the neckThe groinUnder the chinIn the armpits Behind the ear In the neck The groin Under the chin In the armpits Doctors and other health care professionals check these areas for enlarged or swollen lymph nodes. A wide variety infections are the most common causes of swelling of the lymph nodes, for example, strep throat, ear infections, and mononucleosis. More serious medical problems such as HIV infection, lymphomas (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma) or other cancers, or lupus may cause swollen lymph glands. Rarely, a medication can cause the problem. Symptoms associated with lymph node swelling and related diseases can include pain in the area of the swelling, fever, and fatigue. Not all swollen lymph nodes are abnormal."
What are lymph nodes? What do they do?," Lymph nodes are an important part of the body's immune system and to help fight infections. Swollen lymph nodes usually caused by infection are referred to as lymphadenitis. Lymph nodes (sometimes called lymph glands) are small, soft, round, or oval structures found throughout the body and connected to each other in chain- Lymph is a watery fluid that circulates within the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are found near these vessels. Within the capsule, lymph nodes contain certain kinds of immune cells. These cells are mainly lymphocytes, which produce proteins that capture and fight viruses and other microbes, and macrophages, which destroy and remove the captured material."
Where are the lymph nodes located in the body (pictures)?,"'Lymph nodes are located throughout the body. Some are directly under the skin while others are deep inside the body. Even the most superficial (close to the skin) lymph nodes usually are not visible or palpable (felt by touching), unless they are swollen or enlarged. Lymph nodes are connected to each other by loosely bound lymphatic essels. Lymph nodes generally coalesce in different regions in the body where they are responsible for filtering the blood and performing their immunologic function for that particular area of the body. Fluid from the lymphatic vessels eventually feeds into the venous system (veins) in the body.' "
Are swollen lymph nodes painful?,"'In general, swollen lymph nodes caused by infections, inflammation, or cancers can be painful or tender. Some benign causes of swollen lymph nodes may not be painful.' "
Common locations of swollen lymph nodes,"'Lymph nodes in various parts of the body may become swollen for different reasons. People can often see swollen lymph nodes''Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw:'' Swollen lymph nodes on the side of the neck or under jaw are the most common. They may represent an infection around that area, such as a tooth infection or ''abscess'', throat infection, viral illness, or ''upper respiratory infection''. Most of the causes of swollen lymph nodes in this area are benign (noncancerous) but sometimes swelling of these lymph nodes may also suggest a ''cancer'' in the head and neck area.''Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear and in the occipital area (base of the skull):'' Swollen lymph nodes behind the ear or in the base of the skull may correspond to an infection around the ''scalp'' or possibly an eye (''conjunctival'') infection. The most common cause of swollen scalp lymph nodes are ''skin conditions'' affecting the scalp, such as ''dandruff'' (''seborrheic dermatitis''); or an abscess, or soft tissue infection.''The lymph nodes in the underarm (armpit, axilla):'' The lymph nodes in the underarm are anatomically important in ''breast cancer''. They are often checked physically in patients undergoing investigation for ''breast cancer''. They also play an important role in staging (determining the extent) and predicting the outcome of ''breast cancer'' during removal of the ''cancer'' tissue from the breast. Many cancers including lymphoma and ''leukemia'' can cause enlargement of these lymph nodes. (Lymphomas are cancers that originate in the lymph nodes.) These lymph nodes can also become reactive and enlarge due to ''trauma'' to or an infection of the arm on the same side.''Enlarged lymph nodes'' above the collarbone:'' Enlarged lymph nodes above the collarbone (supraclavicular ''lymphadenopathy'') are always considered abnormal. These generally suggest a ''cancer'' of or an infection in the region close by. Examples include lung infection, ''lung cancer'', lymphoma in the chest ''cavity'', or breast cancer. Occasionally cancers that are more distant may seed these lymph nodes, such as genital cancers or ''colon cancer''. Some inflammatory causes of the swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone (clavicle) can include ''tuberculosis'' or ''sarcoidosis''.''Swollen lymph nodes in the groin:'' Swollen lymph nodes in the groin may be normal in young people but they could also result from some ''sexually transmitted diseases'', local infections, infections of a lower extremity (including the foot and toes), or genital cancers.' on the neck, behind the ear, at the base of the skull (occipital area), under the jaw, above the collar bone, under the arms, and around the groin."
How do you check for swollen lymph nodes?,"'Usually lymph nodes are not visible. Once they enlarge, they can become visible in certain areas of the body. Especially behind the ear, or in your neck or groin, you might notice them as enlarged ""''bumps''."" Enlarged lymph glands can also often be felt by slowly moving your hands around the swollen area. You can determine if they are tender or not.' "
What infections and viruses cause swollen lymph nodes?,"'There are many causes for swollen lymph nodes, sometimes referred to as ""swollen glands"" (lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis). In general, lymph nodes become swollen when they are active due to either a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, inflammation, or cancer.''Viral infections are the most common causes of swollen lymph nodes. The most common cause is viral upper respiratory infections such as the ''common cold''.''Viruses that can cause swollen lymph nodes include:'

"Inflammatory diseases, cancers, and other conditions that cause swollen lymph nodes","'Inflammatory and immunologic causes of swollen lymph nodes include diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''lupus'' as well as sensitivity to some medications.''Many cancers can also cause swelling of lymph nodes. These cancers may originate from the lymph nodes or blood cells such as lymphomas and some types of ''leukemia''. They may also be cancers that spread from another organ in the body (metastatic cancers). For example, breast cancer may spread to the nearest lymph nodes in the underarm (axilla), or ''lung cancer'' may spread to the lymph nodes around the collarbone.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic ''lipid'' storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, ''sarcoidosis'', and many other conditions.''There are many other less common causes of swelling of nodes, such as genetic lipid storage diseases, transplant graft rejections, sarcoidosis, and various other conditions.''Lymph node swelling is not always a sign of an underlying disease. Sometimes swollen lymph nodes can be normal. For example, small (less than 1 centimeter), flat lymph nodes under the jaw (submandibular lymph nodes) in healthy children and young adults or small (up to 2 centimeters), groin lymph nodes (inguinal lymph nodes) in young individuals may be normal.''In many instances, a definitive cause for swollen lymph nodes may not be determined even after performing through examination and testing.' "
Signs and symptoms of swollen lymph nodes,"'Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes vary widely. A person could be completely free of symptoms (asymptomatic) and swollen lymph nodes are may only be found when a doctor notes them during a general physical examination.''Sometimes, swollen lymph nodes can be extremely tender, painful, and disfiguring.''Other signs and symptoms related to an underlying disease that accompany the lymph node swelling may be more significant and clinically relevant than the lymph node swelling alone. Signs and symptoms of more serious medical conditions that may cause swollen lymph nodes may include:'   Fever Night sweats Weight loss Loss of appetite Abdominal pain Swelling of multiple lymph nodes or only an isolated one Localized red patches of the skin over the lymph nodes Hard lumps or masses felt under the skin in the area of the swollen lymph node Sore throat or runny nose Local infections (toothache, sore throat)"
When should I see the doctor for swollen lymph nodes?," If you notice swollen lymph nodes, see your primary care doctor for an evaluation and possible treatment. Depending on the reason for the swelling of the lymph nodes, you might need treatment by a hematologist/oncologist (if the swollen lymph nodes can't be explained or are due to an underlying cancer) or an infectious disease specialist (if they are due to a complicated infection). Sometimes you might be referred to a surgeon to biopsy or remove the lymph node. If swollen lymph nodes are associated with fevers, night sweats, or weight loss, and the person does not have any obvious infection, he or she may need a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. People who were appropriately treated for an infection but have persistent swollen lymph nodes should see their doctor. If a person has a known cancer, or was treated for one in the past and new lymph nodes in the general area of the cancer are noted, see a doctor."
How is the cause of swollen lymph nodes diagnosed?,"""Swollen lymph nodes closer to the surface of the body are generally diagnosed by a doctor's examination and feeling for areas known to have coalescence of lymph nodes, for example, swollen lymph nodes under the arms (axillary lymph nodes), swollen lymph nodes in the sides of the neck (cervical lymph nodes), or swollen lymph nodes in the groin (inguinal lymph nodes). These swollen lymph nodes can be seen and felt easily.""'Other times, deeper lymph nodes could be seen on imaging studies, such as ''CT scan'' (computed tomography), of different parts of the body.''Tonsils'' in the back of the throat are also lymph nodes, and they are the most visible ones in the body.''Diagnosing the cause of swollen lymph nodes may be challenging. The most important component of evaluating a swollen lymph node is a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination by a doctor. The doctor may ask about symptoms such as ''sore throat'', fever and ''chills'', ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'"", a complete list of medications, sexual activity, vaccination history, recent travels, and the patient's own and his/her family's previous history of cancers if any.""'A group of lymph nodes in a particular area of the body reacts to disturbances in that general region. If there is a specific infection in the region of the swollen lymph nodes, that may be the most likely cause of swelling. For instance, infections of the leg or some sexually transmitted diseases can cause swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin area.''Physicians usually examine the lymph nodes by feeling them and characterize them based upon what the lymph nodes feel like. They could be characterized, for example, as:''These characteristics can be useful in suggesting the cause of the lymph node swelling. For example, a hard, nontender, non-moveable lymph node may be more characteristic of a cancer spread to that node. On the other hand, a soft, tender, moveable lymph node could more likely represent an infection.''If the enlarged lymph nodes are suspected to be related to a cancer, then a biopsy of the lymph node may determine the cancer type. For example, a swollen lymph node around the collar bone (supraclavicular lymph node), may signify lung cancer in a person who may have other clinical clues suggestive of lung cancer.'

An enlarged lymph node inside the abdomen may compress the ''intestines'' and cause an obstruction of the intestines.'  "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient. ' "
What is lymphedema?,"'\tLymphedema is swelling in one or more extremities that results from impaired flow of the lymphatic system.''\tThe lymphatic system is a network of specialized vessels (lymph vessels) throughout the body whose purpose is to collect excess lymph fluid with proteins, ''lipids'', and waste products from the tissues. This fluid is then carried to the ''lymph nodes'', which filter waste products and contain infection-fighting cells called lymphocytes. The excess fluid in the lymph vessels is eventually returned to the bloodstream. When the lymph vessels are blocked or unable to carry lymph fluid away from the tissues, localized swelling (lymphedema) is the result.''\tLymphedema most often affects a single arm or leg, but in uncommon situations both limbs are affected.'   
Primary lymphedema is the result of an anatomical abnormality of the lymph vessels and is a rare, inherited condition. 
Secondary lymphedema results from an identifiable damage to or obstruction of normally-functioning lymph vessels and nodes. 
		Worldwide, lymphedema is most commonly caused by filariasis (a parasite infection), but in the U.S., lymphedema most commonly occurs in women who have had breast cancer surgery, particularly when followed by radiation treatment."
What does lymphedema look like (pictures)?,"'Mild lymphedema first may be noticed as a feeling of heaviness, tingling, tightness, warmth, or shooting pains in the affected extremity. These symptoms may be present before there is obvious swelling of an arm or leg. Other signs and symptoms of early or mild lymphedema include:''As lymphedema progresses to a more moderate to severe state, the swelling of the involved extremity becomes more pronounced. The other symptoms mentioned above also persist with moderate or severe lymphedema.''''' a decreased ability to see or feel the veins or tendons in the extremities, 
	 tightness of jewelry or clothing,  redness of the skin,  asymmetrical appearance of the extremities,  tightness or reduced flexibility in the joints, and  slight puffiness of the skin. "
What causes lymphedema?,"""Primary lymphedema is an abnormality of an individual's lymphatic system and is generally present at birth, although symptoms may not become apparent until later in life. Depending upon the age at which symptoms develop, three forms of primary lymphedema have been described. Most primary lymphedema occurs without any known family history of the condition.""'Secondary lymphedema develops when a normally-functioning lymphatic system is blocked or damaged. In the U.S., ''breast cancer'' surgery, particularly when combined with ''radiation'' treatment, is the most common cause. This results in one-sided (unilateral) lymphedema of the arm. Any type of surgical procedure that requires removal of regional ''lymph nodes'' or lymph vessels can potentially cause lymphedema. Surgical procedures that have been associated with lymphedema include vein stripping, lipectomy, ''burn'' ''scar'' excision, and peripheral vascular surgery.''Damage to lymph nodes and lymph vessels, leading to lymphedema, can also occur due to ''trauma'', ''burns'', radiation, infections, or compression or invasion of lymph nodes by tumors.''Worldwide, however, filariasis is the most common cause of lymphedema. Filariasis is the direct infestation of lymph nodes by the parasite ''Wuchereria bancrofti''. The disease is spread among persons by mosquitoes, and affects millions of people in the tropics and subtropics of Asia, Africa, Western Pacific, and parts of Central and South America. Infestation by the parasite damages the lymph system, leading to swelling in the arms, breasts, legs, and, for men, the genital area. The entire leg, arm, or genital area may swell to several times its normal size. Also, the swelling and the decreased function of the lymph system make it difficult for the body to fight infections. Lymphatic filariasis is a leading cause of permanent disability in the world.' Congenital lymphedema is evident at birth, is more common in females, and accounts for about 10-25% of all cases of primary lymphedema. A subgroup of people with congenital lymphedema has a genetic inheritance (in medical genetics termed ""familial sex-linked pattern""), which is termed Milroy disease. Lymphedema praecox is the most common form of primary lymphedema. It is defined as lymphedema that becomes apparent after birth and before age 35 years and symptoms most often develop during puberty. Lymphedema praecox is four times more common in females than in males. Primary lymphedema that becomes evident after 35 years of age is known as Meige disease or lymphedema tarda. It is less common than congenital lymphedema and lymphedema praecox."
What are the symptoms of lymphedema?,"'The swelling of lymphedema usually occurs in one or both arms or legs, depending upon the extent and localization of damage. Primary lymphedema can occur on one or both sides of the body as well. Lymphedema may be only mildly apparent or debilitating and severe, as in the case of lymphatic filariasis (see above), in which an extremity may swell to several times its normal size. It may first be noticed by the affected individual as an asymmetry between both arms or legs or difficulty fitting into clothing or jewelry. If the swelling becomes pronounced,  ''fatigue'' due to added weight may occur, along with embarrassment and restriction of daily activities.''The long-term accumulation of fluid and proteins in the tissues leads to inflammation and eventual scarring of tissues, leading to a firm, taut swelling that does not retain its displacement when indented with a fingertip (nonpitting ''edema'""). The skin in the affected area thickens and may take on a lumpy appearance described as an orange-peel (peau d'orange) effect. The overlying skin can also become scaly and cracked, and secondary bacterial or fungal infections of the skin may develop. Affected areas may feel tender and sore, and loss of mobility or flexibility can occur.""'Other symptoms can accompany the swelling of lymphedema including:''The immune system function is also suppressed in the scarred and swollen areas affected by lymphedema, leading to frequent infections and even a ''malignant tumor'' of lymph vessels known as lymphangiosarcoma.'   Warmth, redness, or itching Tingling or burning pains Fever and chills Decreased flexibility in the 
	joints Aching, pain, and fullness of the 
	involved area 
	Skin rash"
How is lymphedema diagnosed?,"'\tA thorough medical history and physical examination are done to rule out other causes of limb swelling, such as ''edema'' due to ''congestive heart failure'', ''kidney failure'', ''blood clots'', or other conditions. Often, the medical history of surgery or other conditions involving the lymph nodes will point to the cause and establish the diagnosis of lymphedema.''\tIf the cause of swelling is not clear, other tests may be carried out to help determine the cause of limb swelling.'   
		CT or MRI scans may be useful to help define lymph node architecture or to identify tumors or other abnormalities. 
		Lymphoscintigraphy is a test that involves injecting a tracer dye into lymph vessels and then observing the flow of fluid using imaging technologies. It can illustrate blockages in lymph flow. 
		Doppler ultrasound scans are sound wave tests used to evaluate blood flow, and can help identify a blood clot in the veins (deep venous thrombosis) that may be a cause of limb swelling."
What are possible treatments for lymphedema?,"'There is no cure for lymphedema. Treatments are designed to reduce the swelling and control discomfort and other symptoms. ''Compression treatments can help reduce swelling and prevent scarring and other complications. Examples of compression treatments are:''Surgical treatments for lymphedema are used to remove excess fluid and tissue in severe cases, but no surgical treatment is able to cure lymphedema. ''Infections of skin and tissues associated with lymphedema must be promptly and effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics to avoid spread to the bloodstream (''sepsis''). Patients affected by lymphedema must constantly monitor for infection of the affected area. In affected areas of the world, the drug diethylcarbamazine is used to treat filariasis.'   Elastic sleeves or stockings: These must fit properly and provide gradual 
compression from the end of the extremity toward the trunk. Bandages: Bandages that are wrapped more tightly around the end of the extremity and 
wrapped more loosely toward the trunk, to encourage lymph flow out of the 
extremity toward the center of the body.  Pneumatic compression devices: These are sleeves or stockings connected to a 
pump that provides sequential compression from the end of the extremity toward 
the body. These may be used in the clinic or in the home and are useful in 
preventing long-term scarring, but they cannot be used in all individuals, such 
as those with congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, or certain 
infections. Manual compression: Massage techniques, known as manual lymph drainage, can 
be useful for some people with lymphedema. Exercises: Exercises that lightly contract and stimulate arm or leg muscles may be 
prescribed by the doctor or physical therapist to help stimulate lymph flow."
What are complications of lymphedema? Can lymphedema be fatal?,"'As noted before, secondary infections of the skin and underlying tissues can complicate lymphedema. Inflammation of the skin and connective tissues, known as ''cellulitis'', and inflammation of the lymphatic vessels (lymphangitis) are common complications of lymphedema. Deep venous thrombosis (formation of ''blood clots'' in the deeper veins) is also a known complication of lymphedema. Impairment of functioning in the affected area and cosmetic issues are further complications of lymphedema.''Those who have had chronic, long-term lymphedema for more than 10 years have a 10% chance of developing a ''cancer'' of the lymphatic vessels known as lymphangiosarcoma. The ''cancer'' begins as a reddish or purplish lump visible on the skin and spreads rapidly. This is an aggressive ''cancer'' that is treated by amputation of the affected limb. Even with treatment, the prognosis is poor, with less than 10% of patients surviving after 5 years.' "
Can lymphedema be prevented?,"'Primary lymphedema cannot be prevented, but measures can be taken to reduce the risk of developing lymphedema if one is at risk for secondary lymphedema, such as after ''cancer'' surgery or radiation treatment.''The following steps may help reduce the risk of developing lymphedema in those at risk for secondary lymphedema:' Keep the affected arm or leg elevated above the level of the heart, when 
possible. Avoid tight or constricting garments or jewelry (also avoid the use of 
blood pressure cuffs on an affected arm). Do not apply a heating pad to the affected area or use hot tubs, steam 
baths, etc. Keep the body adequately hydrated. Avoid heavy lifting and forceful activity with the affected limb; but 
normal, light activity is encouraged. Do not carry a heavy purse on an affected arm. Practice thorough and careful skin hygiene. Avoid 	insect bites and
	sunburns."
What is the prognosis for lymphedema? Is lymphedema curable?,"'Lymphedema cannot be cured, but compression treatments and preventive measures for those at risk for secondary lymphedema can help minimize swelling and associated symptoms. As mentioned above, chronic, long-term edema that persists for many years is associated with an increased risk of developing a rare ''cancer'', lymphangiosarcoma.' "
Where can one get help and support for lymphedema?,"'Many hospitals and treatment centers have support groups for people dealing with specific chronic conditions. Health care professionals may be able to recommend a local support group for those with lymphedema.''The National Lymphedema Network (NLN) (''http://www.lymphnet.org/'') is a non-profit organization founded in 1988 to provide education and guidance to lymphedema patients, health care professionals, and the general public by disseminating information on the ''prevention'' and management of primary and secondary lymphedema.

The entire leg, arm, or genital area may swell to several times its normal size. Also, the swelling and the decreased function of the lymph system make it difficult for the body to fight infections. Lymphatic filariasis is a leading cause of permanent disability in the world.' Congenital lymphedema is evident at birth, is more common in females, and accounts for about 10-25% of all cases of primary lymphedema. A subgroup of people with congenital lymphedema has a genetic inheritance (in medical genetics termed ""familial sex-linked pattern""), which is termed Milroy disease. Lymphedema praecox is the most common form of primary lymphedema. It is defined as lymphedema that becomes apparent after birth and before age 35 years and symptoms most often develop during puberty. Lymphedema praecox is four times more common in females than in males. Primary lymphedema that becomes evident after 35 years of age is known as Meige disease or lymphedema tarda. It is less common than congenital lymphedema and lymphedema praecox."
What are the symptoms of lymphedema?,"'The swelling of lymphedema usually occurs in one or both arms or legs, depending upon the extent and localization of damage. Primary lymphedema can occur on one or both sides of the body as well. Lymphedema may be only mildly apparent or debilitating and severe, as in the case of lymphatic filariasis (see above), in which an extremity may swell to several times its normal size. It may first be noticed by the affected individual as an asymmetry between both arms or legs or difficulty fitting into clothing or jewelry. If the swelling becomes pronounced,  ''fatigue'' due to added weight may occur, along with embarrassment and restriction of daily activities.''The long-term accumulation of fluid and proteins in the tissues leads to inflammation and eventual scarring of tissues, leading to a firm, taut swelling that does not retain its displacement when indented with a fingertip (nonpitting ''edema'""). The skin in the affected area thickens and may take on a lumpy appearance described as an orange-peel (peau d'orange) effect. The overlying skin can also become scaly and cracked, and secondary bacterial or fungal infections of the skin may develop. Affected areas may feel tender and sore, and loss of mobility or flexibility can occur.""'Other symptoms can accompany the swelling of lymphedema including:''The immune system function is also suppressed in the scarred and swollen areas affected by lymphedema, leading to frequent infections and even a ''malignant tumor'' of lymph vessels known as lymphangiosarcoma.'   Warmth, redness, or itching Tingling or burning pains Fever and chills Decreased flexibility in the 
	joints Aching, pain, and fullness of the 
	involved area 
	Skin rash"
How is lymphedema diagnosed?,"'\tA thorough medical history and physical examination are done to rule out other causes of limb swelling, such as ''edema'' due to ''congestive heart failure'', ''kidney failure'', ''blood clots'', or other conditions. Often, the medical history of surgery or other conditions involving the lymph nodes will point to the cause and establish the diagnosis of lymphedema.''\tIf the cause of swelling is not clear, other tests may be carried out to help determine the cause of limb swelling.'   
		CT or MRI scans may be useful to help define lymph node architecture or to identify tumors or other abnormalities. 
		Lymphoscintigraphy is a test that involves injecting a tracer dye into lymph vessels and then observing the flow of fluid using imaging technologies. It can illustrate blockages in lymph flow. 
		Doppler ultrasound scans are sound wave tests used to evaluate blood flow, and can help identify a blood clot in the veins (deep venous thrombosis) that may be a cause of limb swelling."
What are possible treatments for lymphedema?,"'There is no cure for lymphedema. Treatments are designed to reduce the swelling and control discomfort and other symptoms. ''Compression treatments can help reduce swelling and prevent scarring and other complications. Examples of compression treatments are:''Surgical treatments for lymphedema are used to remove excess fluid and tissue in severe cases, but no surgical treatment is able to cure lymphedema. ''Infections of skin and tissues associated with lymphedema must be promptly and effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics to avoid spread to the bloodstream (''sepsis''). Patients affected by lymphedema must constantly monitor for infection of the affected area. In affected areas of the world, the drug diethylcarbamazine is used to treat filariasis.'   Elastic sleeves or stockings: These must fit properly and provide gradual 
compression from the end of the extremity toward the trunk. Bandages: Bandages that are wrapped more tightly around the end of the extremity and 
wrapped more loosely toward the trunk, to encourage lymph flow out of the 
extremity toward the center of the body.  Pneumatic compression devices: These are sleeves or stockings connected to a 
pump that provides sequential compression from the end of the extremity toward 
the body. These may be used in the clinic or in the home and are useful in 
preventing long-term scarring, but they cannot be used in all individuals, such 
as those with congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, or certain 
infections. Manual compression: Massage techniques, known as manual lymph drainage, can 
be useful for some people with lymphedema. Exercises: Exercises that lightly contract and stimulate arm or leg muscles may be 
prescribed by the doctor or physical therapist to help stimulate lymph flow."
What are complications of lymphedema? Can lymphedema be fatal?,"'As noted before, secondary infections of the skin and underlying tissues can complicate lymphedema. Inflammation of the skin and connective tissues, known as ''cellulitis'', and inflammation of the lymphatic vessels (lymphangitis) are common complications of lymphedema. Deep venous thrombosis (formation of ''blood clots'' in the deeper veins) is also a known complication of lymphedema. Impairment of functioning in the affected area and cosmetic issues are further complications of lymphedema.''Those who have had chronic, long-term lymphedema for more than 10 years have a 10% chance of developing a ''cancer'' of the lymphatic vessels known as lymphangiosarcoma. The ''cancer'' begins as a reddish or purplish lump visible on the skin and spreads rapidly. This is an aggressive ''cancer'' that is treated by amputation of the affected limb. Even with treatment, the prognosis is poor, with less than 10% of patients surviving after 5 years.' "
Can lymphedema be prevented?,"'Primary lymphedema cannot be prevented, but measures can be taken to reduce the risk of developing lymphedema if one is at risk for secondary lymphedema, such as after ''cancer'' surgery or radiation treatment.''The following steps may help reduce the risk of developing lymphedema in those at risk for secondary lymphedema:' Keep the affected arm or leg elevated above the level of the heart, when 
possible. Avoid tight or constricting garments or jewelry (also avoid the use of 
blood pressure cuffs on an affected arm). Do not apply a heating pad to the affected area or use hot tubs, steam 
baths, etc. Keep the body adequately hydrated. Avoid heavy lifting and forceful activity with the affected limb; but 
normal, light activity is encouraged. Do not carry a heavy purse on an affected arm. Practice thorough and careful skin hygiene. Avoid 	insect bites and
	sunburns."
What is the prognosis for lymphedema? Is lymphedema curable?,"'Lymphedema cannot be cured, but compression treatments and preventive measures for those at risk for secondary lymphedema can help minimize swelling and associated symptoms. As mentioned above, chronic, long-term edema that persists for many years is associated with an increased risk of developing a rare ''cancer'', lymphangiosarcoma.' "
Where can one get help and support for lymphedema?,"'Many hospitals and treatment centers have support groups for people dealing with specific chronic conditions. Health care professionals may be able to recommend a local support group for those with lymphedema.''The National Lymphedema Network (NLN) (''http://www.lymphnet.org/'') is a non-profit organization founded in 1988 to provide education and guidance to lymphedema patients, health care professionals, and the general public by disseminating information on the ''prevention'' and management of primary and secondary lymphedema. ' "
What is colitis?,"'There are many different types of colitis with different causes. Some examples of colitis include:' Colitis means inflammation of the colon. The colon, also known as the large intestine or large bowel, constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. The colon is a long, muscular tube that receives digested food from the small intestine. The colonremoves water from the undigested foodstores the undigested food, andthen eliminates it from the body through bowel movements. removes water from the undigested food stores the undigested food, and then eliminates it from the body through bowel movements. The rectum is the last part of the colon adjacent to the anus. The common symptoms of colitis include:abdominal pain,diarrhea, andsometimes, rectal bleeding. abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sometimes, rectal bleeding. Bacterial infectious colitis caused by bacteria (such as  shigella,  Campylobacter, E. coli, and C. difficile) Viral infectious colitis caused by a virus (such as cytomegalovirus [CMV]) Radiation colitis (such as following treatment with radiation for prostate cancer) Ischemic colitis (such as blockage of an artery in the colon by a blood clot. If the blood clot interrupts the flow of blood to a segment of the colon, the result is inflammation of that segment and, sometimes, even death [gangrene] of the segment) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are two related conditions that are caused by abnormalities of the body's immune system in which the body inappropriately makes antibodies and chemicals that attack the colon. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are also referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  Visible abnormalities of the inner lining of the colon Infectious, radiation, ischemic, ulcerative, and Crohn's colitis all have abnormalities of the colon. These abnormalities includeedema (swelling of the lining),redness, bleeding from the lining with gentle rubbing (friability), andulcers. edema (swelling of the lining), redness, bleeding from the lining with gentle rubbing (friability), and ulcers. These abnormalities can be seen during colonoscopy (examination of the entire colon using a long flexible viewing tube) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (examination of the rectum and the sigmoid colon - the segment of the colon closest to the rectum). Edema and inflammation of the colon's lining interferes with the absorption of water from the undigested food, and the unabsorbed water exits the rectum as diarrhea. Pus and fluid also are secreted into the colon and add to the diarrhea. The redness, bleeding from the lining with gentle rubbing (friability), and ulcerations in the lining of the colon contribute to the rectal bleeding. The prevalence of microscopic colitis in the U.S. is not clearly known. Microscopic colitis most commonly occurs in the middle aged and elderly patients and is more common among women than men."
What is microscopic colitis?," Microscopic colitis refers to inflammation of the colon that is only visible when the colon's lining is examined under a microscope. The appearance of the inner colon lining in microscopic colitis is normal by visual inspection during colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. The diagnosis of microscopic colitis is made when a doctor, while performing colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, takes biopsies (small samples of tissue) of the normal-appearing lining, and then examines the biopsies under a microscope. There are two types of microscopic:Lymphocytic colitis. Lymphocytic colitis, there is an accumulation of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) within the lining of the colon.Collagenous colitis. In collagenous colitis, there is an additional layer of collagen (scar tissue) just below the lining. Lymphocytic colitis. Lymphocytic colitis, there is an accumulation of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) within the lining of the colon. Collagenous colitis. In collagenous colitis, there is an additional layer of collagen (scar tissue) just below the lining. Some experts believe that lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis represent different stages of the same disease. The inflammation and the collagen probably interfere with absorption of water from the colon, resulting in the diarrhea."
What are the symptoms and signs of microscopic colitis?,"'The primary symptom of microscopic colitis is chronic, watery diarrhea.''A person should seek medical care if the diarrhea lasts for more than 2 weeks or is accompanied with symptoms such as ''weight loss'', ''fatigue'', and ''abdominal pain''.'   People with microscopic colitis can have diarrhea for months or years before the diagnosis is made. Typically, the symptoms begin very gradually and are intermittent with periods when the person feels well, followed by bouts of chronic diarrhea. This chronic diarrhea of microscopic colitis is different from the acute diarrhea of infectious colitis, which typically lasts only days to weeks. Some individuals with microscopic colitis also may experience mild abdominal cramps and pain. Blood in the stool is unusual for microscopic colitis."
What causes microscopic colitis?,"'The cause(s) of microscopic colitis is unknown. Some experts suspect that microscopic colitis is an autoimmune disorder similar to the autoimmune disorders that cause chronic ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's disease.""'One study has implicated long term (longer than 6 months) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), for example, ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'""), as a cause of microscopic colitis. Some individuals' diarrhea improves after stopping the NSAIDs.""'Several other drugs have also been incriminated as a cause of microscopic colitis.'   The most common drugs that can cause microscopic colitis are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid SoluTab). omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid). esomeprazole (Nexium). the Statin simvastatin (Zocor). SSRI sertraline (Zoloft). P2Y12 inhibitor ticlopidine (Tilcid). H2 blocker ranitidine (Zantac), was removed from the market April 1, 2020 due to fatal side effects."
Microscopic colitis vs. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),"'Individuals with ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') do not have colitis, even though this condition is sometimes referred to as having ""''spastic colitis''."" These individuals may have symptoms that mimic colitis such as diarrhea, ''abdominal pain'', and ''mucus'' in ''stool''. Nevertheless, there is no inflammation of the colon in patients with ''IBS''. The cause of symptoms in ''IBS'' is not clearly known; it may be caused by either abnormal motility (abnormal contractions) of the intestinal muscles or abnormally sensitive nerves in the ''intestines'' (visceral hypersensitivity).' "
What procedures and tests diagnose microscopic colitis?,"'The diagnosis of microscopic colitis is made by performing biopsies from different regions of the colon during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.'""The abnormalities of the colon's lining in microscopic colitis occur in a patchy distribution (areas of normal lining may coexist adjacent to areas of abnormal lining). For this reason, multiple biopsies should be taken from several different regions of the colon in order to accurately make a diagnosis.""'The patchy nature of microscopic colitis also is the reason why flexible sigmoidoscopy often is inadequate in diagnosing the condition because the abnormalities of microscopic colitis may be absent from the sigmoid colon (the colonic segment that is closest to the rectum and is within the reach of a sigmoidoscope) in some of the patients with microscopic colitis.''Thus, biopsies of other regions of the colon accessible only with colonoscopy may be necessary for diagnosing microscopic colitis.' "
What is the treatment for microscopic colitis?,"'The treatment of microscopic colitis has not been standardized because there have not been adequate large scale, prospective, placebo controlled treatment trials. The following strategies are safe and may relieve diarrhea in some patients:''Controlled trials showed that budesonide (Entocort, a poorly absorbed steroid) is effective in controlling diarrhea in more than 75% of the patients with collagenous colitis, but the diarrhea tends to recur soon after stopping Entocort.''Though data supporting their use is lacking, some doctors may use medications that potently suppress the immune system such as ''azathioprine'' (Imuran, Azasan) and 6-''mercaptopurine'' in patients with severe microscopic colitis that is unresponsive to other treatments.'   Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the other drugs mentioned under causes of microscopic colitis. Trial of lactose elimination (just to eliminate the possibility that intolerance to lactose in milk is aggravating the diarrhea) Antidiarrhea agents such as loperamide (Imodium) or diphenoxylate and atropine (Lomotil) Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) budesonide (Entocort EC) 5-ASA (mesalamine) compounds such as Asacol, Pentasa, or Colazal"
Can microscopic colitis be cured?,"'The long term prognosis (course) of microscopic colitis is not clear. In approximately two-thirds of the patients with microscopic colitis, the diarrhea resolves spontaneously after several years. The remaining one-third of the patients with microscopic colitis experience persistent or intermittent diarrhea and/or abdominal ''pain'' for many years (possibly indefinitely).\xa0''There is no cure for the microscopic colitis.'  "
Can microscopic colitis be prevented?,"'Since the cause of microscopic colitis is not known, no advice can be provided about preventing this disease.' "
What is the lymph system?,"""The lymph (lymphatic) system helps the body fight infections and other diseases. It's made up of tissue and organs:"" Lymph vessels: The lymph system has a network of lymph vessels. Lymph vessels branch into all the tissues of the body. Lymph: Lymph vessels carry clear fluid (lymph). Lymph contains white blood cells, especially lymphocytes such as B cells and T cells. Lymph nodes: Lymph vessels are connected to small, round organs called lymph nodes. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, armpits, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymph nodes store white blood cells. They trap and remove harmful substances that may be in lymph. Other parts of the lymph system: Other parts of the lymph system include the tonsils, thymus, and spleen. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body including the stomach, skin, and small intestine."
What is Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Hodgkin lymphoma starts in the lymph system, usually in a lymph node. The disease may be found because of a swollen lymph node in the neck, chest, or other areas.''The disease begins when a lymphocyte (almost always a B cell) becomes abnormal. The abnormal cell divides to make copies of itself. The copies keep dividing, making more abnormal cells that build up.''When white blood cells collect around the abnormal cells, the lymph node that contains abnormal cells becomes swollen. Abnormal cells may spread through the lymph vessels or blood vessels to other parts of the body.'""Although normal cells die when they get old or damaged, abnormal cells don't die. Also unlike normal cells, abnormal cells can't help the body fight infections.""  "
What are the types of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'In 2013, more than 9,000 Americans will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. About 4,000 of these people will be children, teens, and adults younger than 35 years old.''Classical type''Most people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma have the classical type. In 2013, about 8,550 Americans will be diagnosed with this type.''In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal cell is called a Reed-Sternberg cell. See photo of the large cell below.''Other abnormal cells may also be found in people with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are called Hodgkin cells. They are larger than normal lymphocytes but smaller than Reed-Sternberg cells.''Rare type''In 2013, about 450 Americans will be diagnosed with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. In this rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal cell is called a lymphocyte-predominant cell, and the treatment options are different.' "
How is the staging determined for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'After you learn that you have Hodgkin lymphoma, you may need other tests to help with making decisions about treatment. Staging tests can show the stage (extent) of disease, such as whether lymphoma cells are found in more than one group of lymph nodes.''Lymphoma cells usually spread from one group of lymph nodes to the next. For example, Hodgkin lymphoma that starts in lymph nodes in the neck may spread first to lymph nodes above the collarbones, and then to lymph nodes under the arms and within the chest.''In time, lymphoma cells can invade blood vessels and spread to almost any other part of the body. For example, they can spread to the ''liver'', ''lungs'', bone, and bone marrow.''Staging tests may include:''Other staging tests may include biopsies of lymph nodes or other tissue.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about testing'   CT scan: Your doctor may order a CT scan of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. An x-ray machine linked to a computer will take a series of detailed pictures of these areas. You'll receive contrast material by mouth and by injection into a blood vessel in your arm or hand. The contrast material makes swollen lymph nodes and other abnormal areas easier to see. The pictures can show whether Hodgkin lymphoma has spread. PET scan: Your doctor may use a PET scan to find Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread. You'll receive an injection of a small amount of radioactive sugar. A machine makes computerized pictures of cells in your body that have taken up the radioactive sugar.  Because lymphoma cells take up sugar faster than do normal cells, areas with lymphoma cells look brighter on the pictures. Bone marrow biopsy: To check for lymphoma cells in the bone marrow, your doctor will use a thick needle to remove a small sample of bone and bone marrow from your hipbone or another large bone. Local anesthesia can help control pain. What type of Hodgkin lymphoma do I have? How do I get a copy of the report from the pathologist? Has the lymphoma spread? Was it found on both sides of the diaphragm?"
What are the stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'The stage of Hodgkin lymphoma depends mainly on:''Stages of Hodgkin lymphoma''Doctors describe the stages of Hodgkin lymphoma using the Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Stage I is early-stage ''cancer'', and Stage IV is advanced cancer, such as Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread to the liver.''Stage I''Lymphoma cells are in one lymph node group (such as the lymph nodes in the neck or armpit). Very rarely, Hodgkin lymphoma may start somewhere in the body other than a lymph node and lymphoma cells are found in only that one part.''Stage II''Lymphoma cells are in at least two lymph node groups, but both groups are on the same side of the diaphragm. Or, lymphoma cells are in one part of a tissue or an organ and the lymph nodes near that organ on the same side of the diaphragm. Lymphoma cells may be in other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.''Stage III''Lymphoma cells are in lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm. Lymphoma cells may also be found in one part of a tissue or an organ near these lymph node groups or in the spleen.''Stage IV''Lymphoma cells are found in several parts of at least one organ or tissue. Or, lymphoma cells are in an organ (such as the liver, lung, or bone) and in lymph nodes on the other side of the diaphragm.''A, B, E, and S''In addition to using the Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV, doctors describe the stages of Hodgkin lymphoma with the letters A, B, E, and S.''A and B''Your doctor may describe the stage as A or B:''E and S''Your doctor may describe the stage with an E, S, or both letters:' The number and location of lymph nodes that have Hodgkin lymphoma cells Whether the disease has spread to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, lung, or bone A (without symptoms): You have not had symptoms, such as weight loss, drenching night sweats, or fevers. B (with symptoms): You have had symptoms, such as weight loss, drenching night sweats, or fevers. E (outside the lymph system): Lymphoma is found in tissues outside the lymph system, such as in liver or lung tissue. Other less common places to find lymphoma include the bone, bone marrow, skin, digestive tract, kidneys, ovaries, or testicles. For example, the stage may be IIE. S (in the spleen): Lymphoma is found in the spleen. For example, the stage may be IIIS."
What is the treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'People with Hodgkin lymphoma have many treatment options. Treatment options include:'""The treatment that's right for you depends mainly on the type of Hodgkin lymphoma (most people have classical Hodgkin lymphoma), where the lymphoma was found in your body (its stage), and whether you've had ""'weight loss'', drenching night sweats, or fevers.

How do people get a second opinion for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about your diagnosis and treatment options. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some insurance companies actually require a second opinion.'""If you get a second opinion, the second doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment recommendation. Or, the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at all of your options.""""It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In most cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually will not make treatment less effective.

Chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'Most people with Hodgkin lymphoma are treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses ''drugs'' to kill lymphoma cells.''Many drugs are used for Hodgkin lymphoma. Usually, the drugs are given through a thin needle directly into a vein (intravenously). Some are given by mouth.'""You'll probably receive a combination of drugs in a clinic, at the doctor's office, or at home. Some people need to stay in the hospital during treatment.""'The side effects depend mainly on which drugs are given and how much. Chemotherapy kills fast-growing Hodgkin lymphoma cells, but the drugs can also harm normal cells that divide rapidly:''Ask your health care team whether the chemotherapy used for Hodgkin lymphoma could make you unable to have children. The ''fertility'' of adults may be harmed by the drugs, but most children treated for Hodgkin lymphoma seem to have normal fertility when they grow up. If you want to have a child someday after treatment, you may choose to store sperm or eggs before treatment starts.''Some of the drugs used for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause ''heart disease'' or cancer later on. See the Follow-up Care section for information about checkups after treatment.''The NCI booklet Chemotherapy and You has helpful ideas for coping with chemotherapy side effects.' Blood cells: When drugs lower the levels of healthy blood cells, you're more likely to get infections, bruise or bleed easily, and feel very weak and tired. Your health care team will check for low levels of blood cells. If your levels are low, your health care team may stop the chemotherapy for a while or reduce the dose of the drug. Cells in hair roots: Chemotherapy may cause hair loss. If you lose your hair, it will grow back after treatment, but the color and texture may be changed. Cells that line the digestive tract: Chemotherapy can cause a poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or mouth blisters. Your health care team can give you medicines and suggest other ways to help with these problems."
Targeted therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'People with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma may be treated with a targeted therapy. The drug binds to lymphoma cells, and the body destroys them.''People receive targeted therapy directly into a vein through a thin needle. The drug may cause ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', night sweats, or tingling hands or ''feet''. Side effects usually go away after treatment ends.''You may want to read the NCI fact sheet Targeted Cancer Therapies to learn more about this type of treatment.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about chemotherapy or targeted therapy' Which drug or drugs do you suggest for me?

How will we know the treatment is working? Will there be lasting side effects?"
Radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'Many people with classical or lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma receive radiation therapy after chemotherapy. Some people with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma receive radiation therapy without chemotherapy. Radiation therapy can destroy lymphoma cells, shrink tumors, and help control pain.'""Radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma is usually given by a large machine outside the body. This kind of radiation therapy won't make you radioactive. While you're lying on a treatment table, the machine will aim high-energy rays that you can't see or feel at the areas affected by the Hodgkin lymphoma. Each treatment session usually lasts less than 30 minutes. You'll probably go to a hospital or clinic for radiation therapy 5 days a week for several weeks.""'Side effects may develop during radiation therapy or years later. Side effects depend mainly on how much radiation is given and on what part of your body receives treatment. For example, radiation to your chest and neck may cause a ''cough'' or ''shortness of breath''.'""It's common for skin in the treated area to become red, dry, and ""'itchy''. Check with your doctor before using lotion or cream in that area. After treatment is over, your skin will slowly return to normal.'""You're likely to become tired during radiation therapy, especially in the later weeks of treatment. Although getting enough rest is important, most people say they feel better when they ""'exercise'' every day. Try to go for a short walk, do gentle stretching exercises, or do ''yoga''.''It may help to know that, in most cases, the side effects of radiation therapy are not permanent. However, you may want to ask your doctor about the chance of possible long-term effects. After treatment is over, some people have an increased chance of developing a second cancer, such as breast or ''lung cancer''. Also, radiation therapy aimed at the chest may cause ''heart'' or ''thyroid disease''.''Women who have radiation therapy aimed at the pelvis may have ''hot flashes'' and ''vaginal dryness'', and their menstrual periods may stop. Menstrual periods are more likely to return for younger women.''Radiation therapy aimed at the pelvis can make both women and men unable to have children. This side effect may be temporary or permanent. People with Hodgkin lymphoma who may want to have a child after treatment should ask their health care team about ways to preserve their eggs or sperm before radiation therapy starts.''The NCI booklet Radiation Therapy and You has helpful ideas for coping with radiation therapy side effects.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about radiation therapy' Why do I need this treatment? When will treatment start? When will it end? How often will I have treatments? How will we know the treatment is working? What side effects should I expect? What should I tell you about? Are there any lasting effects?"
Stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma receive a stem cell transplant. A transplant of blood-forming ''stem cells'' allows you to be treated with high doses of chemotherapy. The high doses destroy both lymphoma cells and healthy blood cells in the bone marrow.'""Stem cell transplants take place in the hospital. You may need to stay in the hospital for several weeks. After you receive high-dose chemotherapy to kill lymphoma cells, you'll receive healthy stem cells through a flexible tube placed in a large vein in your neck or chest area. New, healthy blood cells will develop from the transplanted stem cells. The healthy blood cells will replace the abnormal ones that were destroyed by treatment.""'Healthy stem cells may come from you, or they may come from a family member or another donor. If the healthy stem cells will come from you, then stem cells will be removed from your body before you receive high-dose chemotherapy. The stem cells may be treated to kill any lymphoma cells that may be present, and the healthy stem cells are then frozen and stored until the stem cell transplant takes place.''You may want to read the NCI fact sheet Bone Marrow Transplantation and ''Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation''. It tells about the types of transplants and their side effects.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about stem cell transplants' How long will I be in the hospital? Will I need special care? How will I be protected from germs? What care will I need when I leave the hospital? What are the risks and side effects? What can we do about them? How will we know if the treatment is working? What is my chance of a full recovery? How long will that take?"
Nutrition during cancer treatment,"'Eating well is important before, during, and after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.'""Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, mouth blisters, and other side effects of treatment can make it hard for you to eat.""'Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to help you meet your ''nutrition'' needs. Also, the NCI booklet Eating Hints has many useful ''recipes'' and lists of foods that can help with side effects.' "
What is the follow-up care after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""After treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, you'll need regular checkups, such as every 3 or 4 months for the first year and less often after that.""'Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems between checkups, contact your doctor.''Hodgkin lymphoma may come back after treatment.Your doctor will check for the return of lymphoma. Checkups also help detect health problems that can result from cancer treatment, such as ''heart disease'', thyroid disease, or cancer.''Checkups may include a physical exam, blood tests, chest ''x-rays'', ''CT scans'', or other tests.''You may find it helpful to read the NCI booklet Facing Forward: Life After Cancer Treatment. You may also want to read the NCI fact sheet Follow-up Care After Cancer Treatment.' "
What other support is available for cancer patients?,"""Learning that you have Hodgkin lymphoma can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that a diagnosis of cancer can bring.""'Concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills are common. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing your daily activities.'""Here's where you can go for support:""'For tips on coping, you may want to read the NCI booklet Taking Time: Support for People With Cancer.' Doctors, nurses, and other members of your health care team can answer questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Social workers, counselors, or members of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or concerns. Often, social workers can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support. Support groups can also help. In these groups, people with Hodgkin lymphoma or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group. NCI's Cancer Information Service can help you locate programs, services, and NCI publications. Call 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).

What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient.
