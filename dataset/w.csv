Questions,Answer
What is a stroke?,"'A stroke, also called ''cerebrovascular accident'' (CVA), occurs when the blood supply is cut off or reduced to a part of the brain. This causes a decrease in oxygenation of the brain and prevents the brain tissue from receiving sufficient ''nutrition''. Eventually, the brain cells begin to die. This entire process takes place within a few minutes. A stroke is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Quick diagnosis and treatment can reduce ''brain damage'', disabilities, and other complications that can be permanent.' "
What causes a stroke?,'The possible causes of a stroke include:''Several factors that increase the risk of a stroke:' Atherosclerosis (fatty substance/cholesterol called plaque gets collected in your arteries and narrows them) A blood clot in the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain Bleeding within the brain  Bleeding with the brain stem Heart attack Defects of the heart valves  Arrhythmia (Irregular heart rhythm) High blood pressure Trauma Bleeding disorders Recreational drug abuse (especially cocaine) Abnormal blood vessels Age above 65 years High cholesterol High blood pressure Uncontrolled diabetes  Obesity History of strokes Family history of strokes Smoking  Alcoholism Hormone therapy and oral contraceptive pills Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise 
What do you do if you suspect a stroke?,"'It is important to be able to identify the signs of a stroke and immediately seek medical help. Being able to identify a stroke and calling for help could be lifesaving for oneself and for a person having a stroke because brain damage begins within minutes. The acronym ''F.A.S.T.'' is helpful to remember the most common warning signs of a stroke and react accordingly. Even if the signs of a stroke disappear, medical attention is still required.' F - Face drooping: One side of the face droops or is numb. When asked to smile, the smile becomes uneven or lopsided. A - Arm weakness: It is weakness and/or numbness of one arm. When asked to lift both arms, the arm of the affected side drifts downward. S - Speech difficulty: It is slurring of speech. When asked to speak, the words cannot be comprehended. T - Time: It is time to call for help (911 in the United States. Helpline numbers are different in different countries) or rush to a hospital, whichever is faster. The Sooner the treatment begins, the better the prognosis. It is recommended that treatment begins within 4.5 hours."
What are the complications of a stroke?,"'A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities, which can drastically reduce the individual’s quality of life and prevent them from being self-sufficient. The risk of complications depends on how long the oxygen supply to the brain has been compromised, part of the brain is affected and is the onset of treatment. Seeking immediate medical attention and appropriate treatment may minimize or prevent complications. Complications may include:' Paralysis: Patients may become paralyzed on one side of the body or lose control of certain groups of muscles on one side of the body. In some cases, such as a brain stem stroke, patients may be completely paralyzed below the neck (Locked-in syndrome). Difficulty talking or swallowing: A stroke can permanently cause loss of control of the muscles in your mouth and throat, causing difficulty in speaking, swallowing, or eating. Difficulty in comprehending: Difficulty in comprehending and responding to speech and language, reading, or writing. Memory loss or thinking difficulties: Many stroke patients have memory loss, difficulty thinking, reasoning, making judgments, following instructions, and understanding concepts. Emotional problems: Stroke patients can have difficulty controlling their emotions, and they may have emotional outbursts or develop depression. Pain: Pain, numbness, tingling, or other uncomfortable sensations may occur throughout the parts of the body affected by a stroke."
What are warts? What causes warts? Are warts contagious?,"'Warts are local growths in the skin caused by ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'') infection. There are over 100 types of HPV. Some HPV types infect the genital and oral mucosa and produce large masses, which can occasionally become cancerous. Other HPV types are responsible for benign common skin warts that are not associated with ''cancer''. Although warts are considered to be ''contagious'', it is not uncommon for just one family member to have them. In addition, they often affect just one part of the body (such as the hands or the ''feet''), but they can be spread to other areas. The form taken by the wart infection seems to be partially dependent on the genetic type of the wart virus, as well as its anatomical location. For example, the same type of wart virus can cause common hand warts, as well as plantar warts.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of the different types of warts?," There are familiar type of dome-shaped warts on the backs of fingers, toes, and knees. These warts often have small black dots on their surfaces, which represent multiple thrombosed (clotted) capillaries. Some people mistakenly call these dots ""seed warts."" Plantar warts are found on the sole (plantar surface) of the foot (not to be mislabeled as a planter's wart). Similar in appearance are warts on the palms (palmar warts). Small warts growing in clusters on the plantar surface of the foot have been called mosaic warts. Flat (""plane"") warts may arise on the face, legs, and other parts of the body, often in large numbers. Periungual warts are warts around or under the nail. Filiform warts have a single long stalk, often on the face. Most warts have a rough surface, as well as a number of black pinpoint spots that represent small clotted capillaries. Traumatized warts occasionally bleed and have been called blood warts."
What is the treatment for warts? Are there home remedies for warts?,"'Common warts can be annoying to anyone. It is worth considering that, in normal people, half of all warts, on average, spontaneously go away within about 18 months. The information in this article is about the treatment of common warts. It does not apply to venereal or ''genital warts''. Over-the-counter treatment for common skin warts has long been based upon the use of products containing salicylic acid to destroy the wart. Newer nonprescription wart treatments include carbon dioxide aerosols to freeze warts.''These are available as drops, gels, pads, and plasters. They are designed for application to many types of warts, from tiny ones to larger ones. Salicylic acid is a keratolytic medication, which means it dissolves skin protein (keratin), which makes up most of the mass of the wart and the thick layer of dead skin that often surmounts it.''Nonprescription freezing methods''Aerosol wart treatments that are available over the counter use sprays that freeze warts at a temperature of minus 90 F (minus 57 C). This compares with the liquid nitrogen used by most dermatologists, which is considerably colder (minus 320 F or minus 196 C). The ''over-the-counter products'' may not work nearly as well as the colder agents applied by a doctor.''It has been reported that warts can be treated by covering them with duct (duck) tape or other nonporous tape, such as electrical tape. This treatment requires that the tape must be left in place all the time and removed only a few hours once per week. The tape must be replaced frequently. Many are of the opinion that this is no better than a placebo, based on published studies.'  "
Is it safe to use over-the-counter wart treatments?,"""It is important to follow the directions when treating warts with nonprescription medications. If salicylic acid gets on normal skin, it can cause burning or redness but rarely infection or scarring. The skin returns to normal when the individual stops applying the salicylic acid product. Still, it's probably better not to use salicylic acid on sensitive areas like the face or groin, where it's likely to make nearby skin raw and uncomfortable. It generally is recommended that salicylic acid not be used in people with ""'diabetes'' or in areas where there is poor circulation. Likewise, nonprescription freezing products are also reasonably safe but must be used carefully and only according to package instructions because they work by destroying living tissue.'  "
Are wart treatments effective?,"'Above all, wart treatments require patience. The fact that there are a wide variety of wart treatments is evidence for the fact that there is no single best therapy. Warts can appear and disappear without an identifiable cause and often disappear on their own without treatment. Warts are generally painless unless they are present in areas prone to pressure or friction like the palms and soles. Treatment methods may require several sessions over weeks, months, or longer.''Here is a practical approach to the treatment of warts:'""With an all-but-impossible case, don't try too hard. Don't make the treatment worse than the disease. Here are some examples:"" Ignore the warts. Eventually, they'll go away (although eventually can mean a long time -- even months or years). With an uncomplicated case (a single wart on the face or one or a few on the hands), see a doctor for a quick freeze or electrical destruction. These methods are simple, although somewhat painful, and generally non-scarring. With a difficult case, start by treating the warts for a few weeks at home. Here are some examples: Plantar warts: Warts on the bottom of the foot feel deep, but they are still within the superficial layer of the skin. Tender plantar warts can be rendered painless by paring the wart thinner without causing bleeding. Salicylic-lactic acid (Duofilm solution) in flexible collodion and plasters help remove the thick overlying callus responsible for making the wart feel less like a marble in the shoe. Nonprescription aerosol freezing may be used, as well. Common hand warts: These are typically unattractive although not painful. Salicylic acid often shrinks the wart, encouraging resolution, as can nonprescription freezing. Warts under and around the nails: These are extremely resistant to treatment. One or two tries by the doctor are worth a shot, but if they fail, putting acid on them oneself just makes them look rough and unattractive. ""Mosaic"" warts: These tiny warts can proliferate by the dozens or hundreds all over the sole of the foot. They don't usually hurt, and they rarely respond to any sort of treatment, although in this case, too, one or two tries at treatment may be in order. Flat warts: These are small, flat, flesh-colored bumps and may be numerous on one part of the body (for example on the face, arms, or groin). Getting rid of them by a light application of salicylic acid or other method is easy enough, but they have a tendency to recur."
What if wart removal treatments fail?,"'If these treatments fail, see a doctor to freeze the wart with liquid nitrogen or ''burn'' it with an electric needle.''Other treatments a doctor may use are''Unless warts are very large and uncomfortable, surgical removal or aggressive laser surgery to remove the warts is generally avoided because of the likelihood of scarring.

What are genital warts (HPV infection)? Who gets them?,"'HPV infection (genital warts) is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD, ''sexually transmitted infection'', ''STI'') in the U.S. About 75% of the men and women of reproductive age has been infected with sexually transmitted genital warts at some point. Approximately 6 million people become infected with HPV every year in the US, and approximately 50% of those infected are between the ages of 15 and 25.'""HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the development of warts, cancers, or even symptoms. In fact, the majority of people infected with HPV have no symptoms or lesions at all. Determination of whether or not a person is infected with HPV involves tests that identify the genetic material (DNA) of the virus. Moreover, it has not been definitely established whether the body's immune system is able to permanently clear the body of an HPV infection. Many people will test positive for HPV infection, and then have negative HPV tests for months to years, only to have a positive test result later. Currently, it is unclear if this is due to a latent (continuing but hidden) viral infection or if the person has become re-infected with the virus.""'Asymptomatic people infected with HPVs (those without HPV-induced warts or lesions) are still able to spread the infections to others through sexual contact.''It is important to note that in the U.S. and other developed countries, screening and early treatment of precancerous changes of the cervix have dramatically reduced the incidence of ''cervical cancer''. In developing countries lacking the medical infrastructure or financial means to implement a screening program, the incidence of cervical ''cancer'' resulting from HPV infection is much higher. In fact, cervical ''cancer'' develops in around 500,000 women each year worldwide, and, in many countries, it is the most common cause of cancer deaths.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of genital warts in women?,"'Women who have genital warts inside the vagina may experience symptoms such as bleeding following sexual intercourse or an abnormal ''vaginal discharge''. Rarely, bleeding or urinary obstruction may occur if the wart involves the urethral opening.'  Genital warts appear as raised, flesh-colored lumps or bumps. They may have a corrugated (cauliflower-like) appearance. Many women with genital warts have no symptoms, but sometimes they may occur at the location of the warts, and include:ItchingBurningTenderness Itching Burning Tenderness Size of the warts may vary, and multiple warts may be present at the same time. They may appear anywhere on body surfaces that are exposed in sexual contact, including the vulva, vagina, cervix, or groin in women and the penis, scrotum, thigh, or groin in males."
Are genital warts painful?,"'Usually, genital warts are not painful, although they may be associated with itching, tenderness or burning at the site of the wart.' "
What is the incubation period for genital warts?,"'The time between exposure or infection with HPV and the development of genital warts is very variable. Because most people who have the infection do not have any symptoms and do not develop warts, it is not possible to determine when the warts will arise after infection. Warts may appear days, months, or even years after the infection has been aquired.' "
How do you get genital warts (HPV infection) and What Are HPV Types?," Over 100 types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect humans. Of these, more than 40 types can infect the genital tract and anus (anogenital tract) of men and women. Sometimes, they cause genital lesions known as condylomata acuminata or venereal warts. A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead to precancerous changes in the uterine cervix and cervical cancer. HPV infection is also associated with the development of other anogenital cancers. The HPV types that cause cervical cancer have been linked with both anal and penile cancer in men as well as a subgroup of head and neck (oropharyngeal) cancers in both women and men. Genital warts and HPV infection are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partner's increases. The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also cause infection. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such as genital warts are termed ""low-risk"" HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found most commonly in cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called ""high-risk"" group of HPVs. Other HPV types infect the skin and cause common warts elsewhere on the body. Some types of HPVs (for example, HPV 5 and 8) frequently cause skin cancers in people who have a condition known as epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). The HPV infection is spread through skin-to-skin contact including sexual intercouse."
Is there a vaccine for genital warts and HPV infection?,"'A ''vaccine'' is available against common HPV types associated with the development of genital warts and cervical and anogenital carcinomas.' This vaccine (Gardasil 9) has received FDA approval for use in females and males aged 9 through 45. It confers immunity against 9 HPV types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. An earlier version of this vaccine (Gardasil) was directed at four common HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18). Another vaccine directed at HPV types 16 and 18, known as Cervarix, was approved for use in females aged 10 to 15, but was withdrawn from the market in 2016 due to low demand."
Is there a treatment or cure for genital warts? Can they be removed or cured?,"'No treatment will cure genital warts or HPV infection. The only treatment is to remove the lesions caused by the virus. Unfortunately, even removal of the warts does not necessarily prevent the spread of the virus, and genital warts frequently recur. None of the available treatment options is ideal or clearly superior to others.''Available treatments for genital warts lesions, signs, and symptoms include:'  A 0.5% solution or gel of podofilox (Condylox). Alternatively, a 5% cream of imiquimod (Aldara), which is a substance that stimulates the body's production of cytokines, chemicals that direct and strengthen the immune response). Only an experienced doctor can perform some of the treatments for genital warts. These include, for example, placing a small amount of a 10% to 25% solution of podophyllin resin on the lesions, and then, after a period of hours, washing off the podophyllin. The treatments are repeated weekly until the genital warts are gone. An 80% to 90% solution of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloracetic acid (BCA) can also be applied weekly by a doctor to the lesions. Injection of 5-flurouracil epinephrine gel into the lesions has also been shown to be effective in treating genital warts. Interferon alpha, a substance that stimulates the body's immune response, has also been used in the treatment of genital warts. Alternative methods include cryotherapy (freezing the genital warts with liquid nitrogen) or laser surgery. Laser surgery and surgical excision both require a local or general anesthetic, depending upon the extent of the lesions. It is important to note that you should not use home remedies or treatments for common skin warts on genital warts."
What happens if genital warts aren't treated?," In some people, genital warts may go away in their own within months to a few years. In other cases they may persist if not removed and may grow larger and form clusters. Even removal is not a guarantee that the warts will not return at some point."
What if a woman has precancerous changes (dysplasia) of the cervix? Can genital warts cause cancer?,"'Women who have evidence of moderate or severe precancerous changes in the uterine cervix require treatment to ensure that these cells do not progress to cancer. In this case, treatment usually involves surgical removal or destruction of the involved tissue.' Conization is a procedure that removes the precancerous area of the cervix using a knife, a laser, or by a procedure known as LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure, which uses an electric current passing through a thin wire that acts as a knife). LEEP is also referred to as LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone). Cryotherapy (freezing) or laser therapy may also be used to destroy tissue areas that contain potentially precancerous changes."
Will birth control protect against genital warts or HPV infection?," Abstinence from sexual activity can prevent the spread of HPVs that are transmitted via sexual contact. A person who abstains from sex may still become infected with other HPV types, such as those that cause common skin warts. Some researchers have postulated that HPV infection might be transmitted from the mother to her infant at the time of delivery because some studies have identified genital HPV infection in populations of young children and cloistered nuns. Hand-genital and oral-genital transmission of HPV has also been documented and is another means of transmission. HPV usually is transmitted by direct genital contact during sexual activity. The virus is not found in or spread by bodily fluids, and HPV is not found in blood or organs harvested for transplantation. Condom use seems to decrease the risk of transmission of HPV during sexual activity, but it does not completely prevent HPV infection. Spermicides and hormonal birth control methods cannot prevent the spread of HPV infection."
What do you do if you have been exposed to genital warts (HPV infection)?,"'Both people with HPV infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading HPV and the appearance of the lesions. They should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that condoms are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. It is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity.'""Finally, female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix, as precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer. Similarly, men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers, although it is not yet been determined how to optimally screen for or manage early ""'anal cancer''.' "
Is there a test to diagnose genital warts?,"'HPV sometimes can be suspected by changes that appear on a ''Pap smear'', since pap smears identify infected abnormal cells that may be precursors to cancer. HPV infection can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix that are recognized on a Pap smear. If a woman has an abnormal Pap smear, more advanced tests may be performed. HPV also can be seen on biopsy (for example, from a ''genital wart'' or from the uterine cervix).' "
Is there a DNA test for types of HPV infection?," In 2009, the U.S. FDA approved the first DNA tests for diagnosis of the common cancer-causing HPV types in cervical samples. Two tests known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR, are used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with cancer. These are HPV types 16 and 18, as well as other ""high risk"" or cancer-associated HPV types. These tests do not replace standard Pap testing or clinical examination, and they are used in combination with traditional screening methods to help estimate a woman's risk and aid in management decisions."

What is hydrocephalus?,"'The term hydrocephalus is derived from the Greek words ""hydro"" meaning water and ""cephalus"" meaning head. As the name implies, it is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain. Although hydrocephalus was once known as ""water on the brain,"" the ""water"" is actually cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)--a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The excessive accumulation of CSF results in an abnormal widening of   spaces in the brain called ventricles. This widening creates potentially harmful pressure on the tissues of the brain.''The ventricular system is made up of four ventricles connected by narrow passages.. Normally, CSF flows through the ventricles, exits into cisterns (closed spaces that serve as reservoirs) at the base of the brain, bathes the surfaces of the brain and spinal cord, and then reabsorbs into the bloodstream.''CSF has three important life-sustaining functions: 1) to keep the brain tissue buoyant, acting as a cushion or ""''shock'' absorber""; 2) to act as the vehicle for delivering nutrients to the brain and removing waste; and 3) to flow between the cranium and spine and compensate for changes in intracranial blood volume (the amount of blood within the brain).''The balance between production and absorption of CSF is critically important. Because CSF is made continuously,  medical conditions that block its normal flow or absorption will result in an over-accumulation of CSF.  The resulting pressure of the fluid against brain tissue is what causes hydrocephalus.'  "
What are the different types of hydrocephalus?,"'Hydrocephalus may be congenital or acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be caused by either events or influences that occur during ''fetal development'', or genetic abnormalities. Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward. This type of hydrocephalus can affect individuals of all ages and may be caused by injury or disease.''Hydrocephalus may also be communicating or non-communicating. Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked after it exits the ventricles. This form is called communicating because the CSF can still flow between the ventricles, which remain open. Non-communicating hydrocephalus - also called ""obstructive"" hydrocephalus - occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked along one or more of the narrow passages connecting the ventricles. One of the most common causes of hydrocephalus is ""aqueductal stenosis."" In this case, hydrocephalus results from a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius, a small passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the middle of the brain.''There are two other forms of hydrocephalus which do not fit exactly into the categories mentioned above and primarily affect adults: hydrocephalus ex-vacuo and normal pressure hydrocephalus.''Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when ''stroke'' or traumatic injury cause damage to the brain. In these cases, brain tissue may actually shrink. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can happen to people at any age, but it is most common among the elderly. It may result from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, head ''trauma'', infection, ''tumor'', or complications of surgery. However, many people develop normal pressure hydrocephalus even when none of these factors are present for reasons that are unknown.' "
Who gets this hydrocephalus?,"'The number of people who develop hydrocephalus or who are currently living with it is difficult to establish since there is no national registry or database of people with the condition.  However, experts estimate that hydrocephalus affects approximately 1 in every 500 children.' "
What causes hydrocephalus?,"'The causes of hydrocephalus are still not   well understood. Hydrocephalus may result from   ''inherited'' genetic abnormalities (such as the genetic defect that causes aqueductal stenosis) or developmental disorders (such as those associated with ''neural tube defects'' including ''spina bifida'' and encephalocele). Other possible causes include complications of premature birth such as intraventricular hemorrhage, diseases such as meningitis, tumors, traumatic ''head injury'', or subarachnoid hemorrhage, which block the exit of CSF from the ventricles to the cisterns or eliminate the passageway for CSF into the cisterns.'  "
What are the symptoms of hydrocephalus?,"""Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age, disease progression, and individual differences in tolerance to the condition. For example, an infant's ability to compensate for increased CSF pressure and enlargement of the ventricles differs from an adult's. The infant skull can expand to accommodate the buildup of CSF because the ""'sutures'' (the fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull) have not yet closed.''In infancy, the most obvious indication of hydrocephalus is often a rapid increase in head circumference or an unusually large head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, downward deviation of the eyes (also called ""sunsetting""), and ''seizures''.''Older children and adults may experience different symptoms because their skulls cannot expand to accommodate the buildup of CSF. Symptoms may include ''headache'' followed by vomiting, ''nausea'', papilledema (swelling of the optic disk which is part of the optic nerve), blurred or ''double vision'', sunsetting of the eyes, problems with balance, poor coordination, gait disturbance, urinary ''incontinence'', slowing or loss of developmental progress, lethargy, drowsiness, irritability, or other changes in personality or cognition including ''memory loss''.''Symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus include, problems with ''walking'', impaired bladder control leading to urinary frequency and/or incontinence, and progressive mental impairment and ''dementia''. An individual with this type of hydrocephalus may have a general slowing of movements or may complain that his or her ''feet'' feel ""stuck."" Because some of these symptoms may also be experienced in other disorders such as '""Alzheimer's""' disease, '""Parkinson's""' disease, and ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'', normal pressure hydrocephalus is often incorrectly diagnosed and never properly treated. Doctors may use a variety of tests, including brain scans (CT and/or ''MRI''), a ''spinal tap'' or lumbar catheter, intracranial pressure monitoring, and neuropsychological tests, to help them accurately diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalus and rule out any other conditions.''The symptoms described in this section account for the most typical ways in which progressive hydrocephalus manifests itself, but it is important to remember that symptoms vary significantly from one person to the next.'  "
How is hydrocephalus diagnosed?,"'Hydrocephalus is diagnosed through clinical neurological evaluation and by using cranial imaging techniques such as ''ultrasonography'', computed tomography (CT), ''magnetic resonance imaging'"" (MRI), or pressure-monitoring techniques. A physician selects the appropriate diagnostic tool based on an individual's age, clinical presentation, and the presence of known or suspected abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord."" "
What is the current treatment for hydrocephalus?,"'Hydrocephalus is most often treated by surgically inserting a shunt system. This system diverts the flow of CSF from the CNS to another area of the body where it can be absorbed as part of the normal circulatory process.''A shunt is a flexible but sturdy ''plastic'' tube. A shunt system consists of the shunt, a catheter, and a valve. One end of the catheter is placed within a ventricle inside the brain or in the CSF outside the spinal cord. The other end of the catheter is commonly placed within the abdominal ''cavity'', but may also be placed at other sites in the body such as a chamber of the ''heart'' or areas around the lung where the CSF can drain and be absorbed. A valve located along the catheter maintains one-way flow and regulates the rate of CSF flow.''A limited number of individuals can be treated with an alternative procedure called third ventriculostomy. In this procedure, a neuroendoscope — a small camera that uses ''fiber'' optic technology to visualize small and difficult to reach surgical areas — allows a doctor to view the ventricular surface. Once the scope is guided into position, a small tool makes a tiny hole in the floor of the third ventricle, which allows the CSF to bypass the obstruction and flow toward the site of resorption around the surface of the brain.' "
What are the possible complications of a shunt system?,"'Shunt systems are not perfect devices. Complications may include mechanical failure, infections, obstructions, and the need to lengthen or replace the catheter. Generally, shunt systems require monitoring and regular medical follow up. When complications occur,   the shunt system usually   requires some type of revision.''Some complications can lead to other problems such as overdraining or underdraining. Overdraining occurs when the shunt allows CSF to drain from the ventricles more quickly than it is produced. Overdraining can cause the ventricles to collapse, tearing blood vessels and causing ''headache'', hemorrhage (subdural ''hematoma''), or slit-like ventricles (slit ventricle syndrome). Underdraining occurs when CSF is not removed quickly enough and the symptoms of hydrocephalus recur. In addition to the common symptoms of hydrocephalus, infections from a shunt may also produce symptoms such as a low-grade ''fever'', soreness of the neck or shoulder muscles, and redness or tenderness along the shunt tract. When there is reason to suspect that a shunt system is not functioning properly (for example, if the symptoms of hydrocephalus return), medical attention should be sought immediately.' "
What is the prognosis for hydrocephalus?,"'The prognosis for individuals diagnosed with hydrocephalus is difficult to predict, although there is some correlation between the specific cause of the hydrocephalus and the outcome. Prognosis is further complicated by the presence of associated disorders, the timeliness of diagnosis, and the success of treatment. The degree to which relief of CSF pressure following shunt surgery can minimize or reverse damage to the brain is not well understood.''Affected individuals and their families should be aware that hydrocephalus poses risks to both cognitive and physical development. However, many children diagnosed with the disorder benefit from rehabilitation therapies and educational interventions and go on to lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment by an interdisciplinary team of medical professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and educational experts is critical to a positive outcome. Left untreated, progressive hydrocephalus may be fatal.''The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus usually get worse over time if the condition is not treated, although some people may experience temporary improvements. While the success of treatment with shunts varies from person to person, some people recover almost completely after treatment and have a good quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment improves the chance of a good recovery.' "
What research is being done for hydrocephalus?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to hydrocephalus in laboratories and clinics at the NIH and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.  Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as hydrocephalus. The NINDS also conducts and supports a wide range of fundamental studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal and abnormal brain development.' "

How to lower blood pressure without medication,"'Lifestyle changes are effective in controlling ''high blood pressure''. A healthy lifestyle can avoid, delay, or reduce the need for ''blood pressure'' medications.''Here are 10 ways to control blood pressure without medications:' Weight loss: Obesity can increase the risk of high blood pressure. Weight loss has been the most effective way of reducing blood pressure. Even losing 10 pounds can lower blood pressure. Besides losing weight, one should generally focus on abdominal fat. Men having a waist measurement above 40 inch and women having waist measurement above 35 inches are at risk of high blood pressure. DASH diet: A program called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is advised for control and prevention of high blood pressure. It advises cutting away high-fat foods, processed foods, and sugar and salt-containing foods; avoiding excess salt for dressing and excess caffeinated drinks such as coffee and energy drinks; and focusing on fruits, fresh vegetables, whole grains, and high fiber and high calcium food.  Daily exercise: Daily exercise is an excellent way to lose fat and reduce high blood pressure. Exercising daily for 30 minutes can bring down the blood pressure by about five to eight mm Hg. Walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or dancing are the most effective ways of controlling blood pressure. Meditation and stress relaxing techniques can also help. Reduce sodium intake: Most Americans consume about 3400 mg of sodium a day, whereas the recommended daily intake of sodium is 2300 mg, with an optimal limit of less than 1500 mg for those with high blood pressure. Avoid keeping salt at the table for sprinkling over food and eating salted nuts and chips. Read labels: Labels reveals a lot. Read labels for high sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol value, which can contribute to the risk of high blood pressure. Processed foods, prepackaged foods, and restaurant foods contain the highest amount of sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Be a smart shopper and avoid foods that contain a high amount of sodium, saturated fats, and cholesterol. Increase potassium intake: Add more potassium to the diet because it regulates the heart rate and nullifies the effect of the sodium in the body. Before incorporating these foods into the diet, consult your physician for the right amount of potassium to be taken. Patients with significant kidney disease should restrict the amount of potassium. Potassium-rich foods are as follows:Fruits such as papaya, orange, melons, avocadoes, and apricotsGreen leafy vegetables such as spinach and kaleVegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoesTuna and salmonBeansNuts and seeds Fruits such as papaya, orange, melons, avocadoes, and apricots Green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale Vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes Tuna and salmon Beans Nuts and seeds Abstain from heavy alcohol drinking: Alcohol in moderation may not cause much harm to the body. However, three drinks in one sitting can increase blood pressure temporarily. The general guidelines for moderate drinking are as follows:Two drinks a day for men younger than 65 yearsOne drink a day for men aged 65 years and olderOne drink a day for women of any age Two drinks a day for men younger than 65 years One drink a day for men aged 65 years and older One drink a day for women of any age Quit smoking: Cigarette smoking can increase blood pressure. Cutting down on smoking helps the blood pressure return to normal. It also helps in preventing the risk of heart diseases and improves overall health. Avoid excess stress: Stress hormones or cortisol constrict the blood vessels and can lead to temporary spikes in blood pressure. Stress can also result in overeating, poor sleep, and misusing drugs and alcohol. Stress-relieving meditations and breathing techniques can help in mitigating stress. Control the risk factors: Uncontrolled diabetes can make it harder to keep blood pressure under control. Hence, controlling diabetes and other risk factors is of utmost importance. Taking the prescription medicines at given doses and at given times is important. Regular monitoring of blood pressure at home is also advised."
12 ways to alleviate acid reflux ,"'Patients suffering from ''acid reflux'' may try the below steps:' Eating sparingly and slowly: Patients can try eating small meals more frequently rather than three large meals daily to reduce acid reflux symptoms. The food must be eaten in small bites and chewed properly. Reducing weight and maintaining a healthy lifestyle: Obesity causes the lower esophageal sphincter to go lax, decreasing the pressure that holds the sphincter closed. This leads to reflux and heartburn. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with reducing body weight can help in decreasing the symptoms of acid reflux.  No smoking: Nicotine relaxes the esophageal sphincter causing symptoms of heartburn, so quitting the habit of smoking may help in reducing the symptoms of acid reflux.  Avoiding carbonated beverages: Carbonated beverages may make a person burp, which sends acid into the esophagus. Quitting the habit of or avoiding carbonated beverages and drinking water instead of sparkling water can curb the symptoms of acid reflux.  Avoiding certain foods: People with acid reflux may be instructed to eliminate some foods that are more likely than others to trigger reflux, including fatty foods, spicy foods, tomatoes, onions, garlic, coffee, tea, chocolate, and alcohol.  Staying up after eating: When standing, or even sitting, gravity alone helps keeps acid in the stomach, where it belongs. It is recommended to finish eating three hours before going to bed. This means no naps after lunch and no late suppers or midnight snacks. Don't move too fast: Avoiding vigorous exercise or strenuous workout for a couple of hours after eating can curb the symptoms of acid reflux.  Taking medications: Some medications such as postmenopausal estrogen, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti-inflammatory painkillers can relax the sphincter or can irritate the esophagus. Identifying and curbing such medications after discussing with a doctor can curb acid reflux symptoms. Adjusting sleeping position: Most acid reflux occurs during sleep. To prevent nighttime attacks, patients may need to position their head at an angle, higher than the abdomen. The head of the bed should be elevated to a minimum of 30°, perhaps with a firm foam-rubber wedge or by putting bricks under the bedposts. Lying flat down should be avoided, especially right after eating.  Limit alcohol: Drinking alcohol may increase the severity of acid reflux and heartburn. It aggravates symptoms by increasing stomach acid, relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter and impairing the ability of the esophagus to clear itself of acid. Limit caffeine intake: Coffee temporarily weakens the lower esophageal sphincter, increasing the risk of acid reflux. Similar to coffee, caffeine weakens the lower esophageal sphincter.  Limit citrus juice: Drinking citrus juice makes acid reflux symptoms worse as citrus juice irritates the lining of the esophagus."
What is gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD)?,"'Repeated backflow of acid from the stomach into the food pipe or mouth is called gastroesophageal reflux disorder (''GERD'').''Three conditions can cause ''GERD'':''The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscle that controls the passage of food between the esophagus (food pipe) and stomach. Sometimes, this muscle does not close completely, leading acid from the stomach to flow back into the throat or esophagus. This abnormal condition is called gastroesophageal reflux or acid reflux.\xa0''Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux include sour taste in the mouth, dry ''cough'', and burning sensation in the throat. Sometimes, it may cause a heartburn (''pain'' in the upper abdomen and chest that sometimes feel like an individual is having a ''heart attack'').''When these symptoms become recurrent and severe, it is called GERD.' Poor tone of lower part of the esophagus (food pipe) Too much acid in the stomach Delayed stomach emptying"
Which type of a diet can fight GERD?,"'A certain type of food or ''diet'' can help fight gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), which include the following:' Chicken breasts: Skinless chicken breasts that may be baked should be included. Lean and packed with protein, chicken breasts are very easy to digest and can be a good and easy diet for patients with GERD. Plain water: Frequently consuming water can make the digestion process better and curb GERD symptoms.  Ginger: A diet or food with ginger can calm the over acidic stomach. Ginger tea may also be included in the diet.  Watermelon: Watermelon is a low-acid fruit that won’t trigger symptoms and can be added to the routine diet to fight GERD.  Brown rice: Brown rice is a good substitute in the regular diet rather than white rice.  Oatmeal: Oatmeal is a better choice because it has plenty of fiber and may give sufficient energy to the body.  Potatoes, carrots, turnips, and parsnips: They’re full of healthy complex carbohydrates and digestible fiber. Olive oil: Body needs fat to work right; olive oil is a good substitute rather than regular cooking oil.  Lettuce and celery: Reflux can make us gassy, so foods such as beans and dried fruits can cause GERD. Mild veggies such as lettuce and celery are healthy, low in calories, easy on the stomach, and they won’t cause more gas. Fennel: It is low in acid, which can help soothe the upset stomach that can be both a cause and symptom of GERD. Patients can roast it and serve it as a main course, sauté it as a side dish, or slice it raw and add it to a salad."
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32% to 36%.''Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): ''is the average size of platelets in a volume of blood.' White blood cell count (WBC or leukocyte count) WBC differential count Red blood cell count (RBC or erythrocyte count) Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hbg) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Red cell distribution width (RDW) Platelet count Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)"
What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
What is Weber-Christian disease? What are the risk factors for this disease?,"'Weber-Christian disease is an uncommon inflammatory disease of the fatty tissues of the body. Weber-Christian disease is also referred to as idiopathic lobular ''panniculitis'' (ILP) and relapsing febrile nodular panniculitis syndrome.''The term Weber-Christian often refers to a group of diseases that involve the deep fat. These disorders first appear on the skin as reddish, tender nodules. Mostly, Weber-Christian describes cases of recurring inflammation of special sections of fat called lobules. The exact cause of Weber-Christian panniculitis is unknown. The disorder is frequently associated with systemic symptoms such as ''fever'' and body aches.''Weber-Christian disease is most commonly seen in females 30-60 years of age. It can occur in both sexes, in all ages, and rarely in infants. There are no other known risk factors.''Usually, both sides of the body are affected, and the thighs and lower legs are the most frequent areas. The inflamed areas can lose their blood supply, the skin can actually die in the area, ooze yellowish drainage, and become infected. Scarring is common.''The appearance of the skin symptoms are usually accompanied by ''fever'' and malaise (feeling poorly). The skin lumps may vary in size but are usually small, the size of two to three fingertips or about 1-2 cm in size. The skin lumps may gradually flatten, soften, and start to decrease over several weeks. Frequently, the areas heal with a brownish or tan discoloration and leave a sunken ''scar'' from the underlying fat necrosis. Less commonly, the skin discoloration may take weeks to months to fade away completely and leave no scar.' "
What is panniculitis?,"'The tissue layer under the skin (''epidermis'' and dermis) is called the subcutaneous fat or panniculus.  This subcutaneous tissue is very important in temperature regulation and protective insulation of the body. Inflammation of this essential layer of fatty tissue is called panniculitis. In panniculitis, the overlying skin typically appears as red or purplish lumps.' "
What are other symptoms of Weber-Christian disease?,"'Weber-Christian disease can also cause symptoms other than in the skin,such as fever, ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''weight loss'', and ''joint pain''.Occasionally, inflammation occurs in other organs of the body to cause''heart'', lung, kidney, ''liver'', and/or spleen problems. Liver involvement may first cause ''abdominal pain''. The skin symptoms provide perhaps the most important clue to the diagnosis of Weber-Christian syndrome. Overall, symptoms with this syndrome may come and go, and relapses are common.'  "
What causes Weber-Christian disease?,'The cause of Weber-Christian disease or idiopathic lobular panniculitis is not known. ''Idiopathic'' means unknown cause. A misdirected immune reaction may play a role. The cause may be related to an abnormal bodily response to the normal inflammation.' 
How is Weber-Christian disease diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis is made usually by taking a piece of tissue (biopsy) and examining it under a microscope. There is inflammation of the affected fatty lobules (central part of the fat) with increased numbers of white blood cells around the fat and sometimes degeneration or death of fat cells called necrosis.''Laboratory tests using a simple blood draw may be helpful as extra information to suggest inflammation when Weber-Christian disease is suspected. There is no single lab test that completely defines this disease. Abnormal tests such as a highly elevated erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'', also called ""sed rate"" or ESR, may be useful. Additionally, mildly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) on a complete blood cell count (''CBC'') may be found.''Normal lab tests, including serum and urine amylase and lipase, help to distinguish Weber-Christian from other diseases of the fat caused by ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). A normal alpha-1 ''antitrypsin'' level helps to differentiate Weber-Christian disease from a separate fatty inflammatory disease (panniculitis) caused by ''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency''.'  "
What is the prognosis of Weber-Christian disease?,"'The prognosis or long-term outlook is very different for each patient with Weber-Christian disease and depends on the severity of organ involvement. Some patients have mild, intermittent, annoying symptoms, while in others Weber-Christian disease can be fatal. After several years of symptoms, Weber-Christian disease may go away permanently (remission).' "
What is the treatment for Weber-Christian disease?,"'There is no cure or uniformly effective treatment that works for everyone with Weber-Christian  disease. Possible treatments include oral medications that alter the immune-system reaction and decrease overall inflammation. Some patients have had improvement with medications including ''chloroquine'', ''thalidomide'', ''cyclophosphamide'', ''tetracycline'', ''cyclosporine'', ''azathioprine'', ''prednisone'', and a host of nonsteroidal medications like ''ibuprofen'' and ''indomethacin''.''Accompanying treatments for the symptoms may include additional oral ''pain'' medications as well as topical salves to treat and prevent local skin infections.'' Overall, when internal organs are inflamed, medicines directed toward the underlying inflammation are considered. In summary, treatment for Weber-Christian disease is nonspecific, and antiinflammatory therapy may not be fully effective for everyone with the disease.'  "
What is granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an uncommon type of inflammation of small arteries and veins (vasculitis). It classically involves inflammation of the arteries that supply blood to the tissues of the ''lungs'', the nasal passages (sinuses), and the kidneys. ""Incomplete"" forms exist that only involve one of these areas. When both lungs and kidneys are affected, the condition is sometimes referred to as generalized granulomatosis with polyangiitis. When only the lungs are involved, the condition is sometimes referred to as limited granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

How is granulomatosis with polyangiitis diagnosed?,"'Abnormal lab findings in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis include urine tests that detect protein and ''red blood cells'' in the urine (not visible to the naked eye) and ''X-rays'' of the chest and sinuses, which detect abnormalities resulting from lung and sinus inflammation. Blood tests that detect the abnormal inflammation include the ''sedimentation rate'' (sed rate) and ''C-reactive protein''. A more specific blood test used to diagnose and monitor granulomatosis with polyangiitis is the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA test), which is commonly elevated when the disease is active.''The diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is confirmed by detecting both abnormal cellular formations, called granulomas, and vasculitis in a biopsy of tissue involved with the inflammatory process. For examples, an open lung biopsy or a kidney biopsy are commonly used in making a diagnosis of the condition.' "
What is the treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a serious disease and without treatment can be fatal within months. Treatment is directed toward stopping the inflammation process by suppressing the immune system.''A newer and more effective treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis is ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan''), given intravenously weekly for four weeks in combination with cortisone medication. These new regimens are welcome news for patients with as medical researchers are searching for better treatments.'   Medications used to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis include high-dose cortisone (prednisone) and the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Recent reports also suggest that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) also can be helpful to prevent relapse of disease activity in patients with the condition. Cytoxan that is taken by mouth with prednisone until the disease is in remission and then switched to methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) for two years and tapered off has been reported to be effective and less toxic than the traditional long-term Cytoxan treatment. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) has been introduced as a drug for Cytoxan treatment failures. Moreover, it now appears that Cytoxan will not be necessary in order to maintain long-term remission, and that doctors can convert to the less toxic methotrexate for maintenance. Reports also demonstrate that methotrexate can eventually be tapered off entirely after two years. Azathioprine (Imuran) has also been used as a maintenance medication after Cytoxan. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) has been shown to be helpful in treating relapses of granulomatosis with polyangiitis."
What is the prognosis for granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'The prognosis for granulomatosis with polyangiitis depends on which organs are involved, to what degree they are involved, the duration of the disease, and the response to treatment.

Treatment is directed toward stopping the inflammation process by suppressing the immune system.''A newer and more effective treatment for granulomatosis with polyangiitis is ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan''), given intravenously weekly for four weeks in combination with cortisone medication. These new regimens are welcome news for patients with as medical researchers are searching for better treatments.'   Medications used to treat granulomatosis with polyangiitis include high-dose cortisone (prednisone) and the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). Recent reports also suggest that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) also can be helpful to prevent relapse of disease activity in patients with the condition. Cytoxan that is taken by mouth with prednisone until the disease is in remission and then switched to methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) for two years and tapered off has been reported to be effective and less toxic than the traditional long-term Cytoxan treatment. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) has been introduced as a drug for Cytoxan treatment failures. Moreover, it now appears that Cytoxan will not be necessary in order to maintain long-term remission, and that doctors can convert to the less toxic methotrexate for maintenance. Reports also demonstrate that methotrexate can eventually be tapered off entirely after two years. Azathioprine (Imuran) has also been used as a maintenance medication after Cytoxan. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) has been shown to be helpful in treating relapses of granulomatosis with polyangiitis."
What is the prognosis for granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,"'The prognosis for granulomatosis with polyangiitis depends on which organs are involved, to what degree they are involved, the duration of the disease, and the response to treatment. Today, with an optimal response to treatment, people with the condition scan lead normal lives.' "
Weight control and smoking cessation introduction,"'Congratulations on your decision to ''quit smoking''! Quitting is one of the best actions you can take to improve your health. You may be concerned about gaining weight, but try not to worry about it as you quit. Focus on stopping ''smoking'' first, and then continue to improve your health in other ways, such as reaching and maintaining a healthy weight for life.' "
Will I gain weight if I stop smoking?,"'Not everyone gains weight when they stop ''smoking''. Among people who do, the average ''weight gain'' is less than 10 pounds. Roughly 10 percent of people who stop ''smoking'' gain a large amount of weight - as many as 30 pounds. ' "
What causes weight gain after quitting?,"'When ''smokers'' quit, they may gain weight for a number of reasons. These include:' Feeling hungry. Quitting smoking may make a person feel hungrier and eat more than usual, but this feeling usually goes away after several weeks.
	 Having more snacks and alcoholic drinks. Some people eat more high-fat, high-sugar snacks and drink more alcoholic beverages after they quit smoking.
	 Burning calories at a normal rate again. Every cigarette you smoke makes your body burn calories faster, but is also harmful to your heart. Once you quit, you are no longer getting this temporary effect. Instead, you are burning slightly fewer calories on a daily basis.

12 Popular Weight Loss Pills and Supplements Reviewed,"'A bodyweight over the healthy limit is associated with several health conditions, such as ''diabetes'', ''heart'' diseases, and certain ''cancers''. According to health experts, long-term ''weight loss'' can be safely attained by making healthy lifestyle changes like healthy eating patterns, limiting calorie intake, and doing regular physical activity. Many people, however, are not able to make these healthy lifestyle changes. Almost two-thirds of adults and one-third of adolescents are ''overweight'' or ''obese'' in the United States. Many of the overweight or obese individuals seek ''dietary supplements'' to ''lose weight''. Around 10% of American men and 21% of American women have used a weight-loss supplement at some point in their lives.''Various ''weight loss'' ''supplements'' are available in the market in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, bars, and liquids. The knowledge over their efficacy is limited. ''Weight loss'' ''supplements'', however, have the potential to cause physical harm. They can also interact with many medications. This may cause several side effects or a reduction in the effectiveness of the medication.''It is always prudent to ask your healthcare provider before taking any supplements or pills for weight loss. Some of the common weight loss supplements are reviewed below:' Garcinia cambogia (Hydroxycitric acid): It is a fruit-bearing tree native to Asia, Africa, and the Polynesian islands. The active ingredient in the fruit of this tree is hydroxycitric acid. It is claimed to inhibit fat production in the body and suppress food intake. Research suggests that it has little or no effect on body weight. It may produce side effects, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, running/stuffy nose, mania, and liver damage. African mango (Irvingia gabonensis): It is proposed that this product act by reducing fat-formation (adipogenesis) and decreasing the hunger regulating hormone (leptin) levels in the body. Research suggests that it can have a modest effect on weight and waist size. There are no safety concerns reported for doses up to 3,150 mg/day for 10 weeks. It can cause some side effects, such as headaches, difficulty sleeping, flatulence, and gas. Caffeine: Caffeine from sources, such as guarana, kola nut, yerba maté green tea, can have a modest effect on body weight or decreased weight gain over time. There are significant safety concerns for doses higher than 400-500 mg/day for adults. Some of the side effects of caffeine include nervousness, vomiting, increases heart rate (tachycardia), and jitteriness. Capsaicin and other capsaicinoids: They can increase energy expenditure and lipid oxidation. They may increase satiety and reduce caloric intake. They, however, do not affect body weight. Capsaicin and capsaicinoids may cause bowel distress, increased insulin levels, and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL or good cholesterol) levels. Carnitine: L-carnitine, commonly called as fat-burner, is a type of amino acid. It can cause a modest reduction in body weight. Recommended doses are up to 2 g/day for a year or 4 g/day for 56 days. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and a “fishy” body odor. Carnitine may increase Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels, which are associated with a higher risk of heart disease. Chitosan: It is a type of carbohydrate commonly obtained from the outer hard skeleton of shellfishes, including crab, lobster, and shrimp. It has a minimal effect on body weight. It can cause allergic reactions like flatulence, bloating, constipation, indigestion, nausea, and heartburn. Green coffee bean extract: It has been proposed that this reduces fat accumulation and modulates glucose metabolism. Studies suggest that it can have a modest effect on body weight. It can cause headaches and urinary tract infections (UTI). Green tea and green tea extract: It is proposed that these products cause weight loss by increasing energy expenditure and fat oxidation as well as reducing fat-production and fat absorption. Research shows that it can have a modest effect on body weight. Its side effects include constipation, abdominal discomfort, nausea, increased blood pressure, and liver damage."
Lap band (gastric banding) introduction,"'Obesity'' is a growing concern. By medical standards, ''obesity'' is defined as having a ''body mass index'' (''BMI'') of over 30 kg/m2. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone for treatment, surgical options are becoming more popular. One of the surgical treatments for obesity is called gastric banding, commonly known as lap-band surgery. Some of the specifics of gastric banding will be addressed in this article.' "
What is gastric banding?,"'Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of an adjustable belt around the upper portion of the stomach using a laparascope. The band is made of silicone and can be tightened by adding saline to fill the band (like blowing air into a doughnut-shaped balloon). The band is connected to a port that is placed under the skin of the abdomen. This port is used to introduce or remove saline into the band.''LAGB ultimately restricts the size of the stomach and the amount of food it can hold. It also slows the passage of food to the intestine. By doing so, signals to the brain from the gut allow for a sensation of fullness and satiety with the consumption of less food. This signal is sent from a small pouch created by the band in the upper stomach. When the pouch fills, the same signal is sent to the brain that occurred previously when the entire stomach filled.' "
What is a lap band?,"'The LAP BAND® is a specific device brand name and is made by Allergan Inc. The term is often used in the lay community interchangeable with gastric banding (similar to the way we interchange the brand name Kleenex for facial tissue). There are different sizes and models of the LAP BAND. There are also other companies that make gastric banding devices such as the REALIZE® adjustable gastric band (by Ethicon), the MIDBAND®, and the Heliogast® gastric band (which are not available in the US).' "
Who are candidates for the lap band system?,"'Generally, candidates for LAGB have a body mass index over 40 kg/m2, or are more than 45 kilograms over their ideal body weight. LAGB can be performed on a person with a ''BMI'' of 35-40 kg/m2 if there are problematic medical conditions that are weight-related, such as ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') or ''diabetes''.''Most surgeons and programs will want to note a history of failed ''weight loss'' in the past using more conventional approaches. The procedure is indicated for adults only, and is not to be performed on those less than 18 years old. All patients must demonstrate an understanding of the procedure, and be willing to adhere to the lifestyle changes that are needed to make this procedure successful. Most large centers have a psychological assessment to assure that this last criteria is met.''LAGB is usually contraindicated if the potential patient has difficulty understanding the procedure, is emotionally unstable, or is dependent on ''drugs'' or ''alcohol''. Those potential cases with a history of gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers need to be reviewed carefully. Similarly, those that have underlying medical conditions that make them high risk for surgery- such as ''heart'' or lung conditions- may be refused the procedure. Associated with these risks is a BMI of greater than 50kg/m2. In this group, there may be a request to ''lose weight'' prior to the procedure (although this seems paradoxical). Again, the risks of the procedure in this subgroup of ''obese'' patients may outweigh the benefits of surgery. By dropping the BMI under 50 kg.m2, outcomes may be better.''While there is growing discussion about offering LAGB to those with a BMI of 30-35 who have ''diabetes'', there are no current guidelines for this.' "
How is the lap band (LAGB) procedure performed?,"'Lap band or LAGB is a surgical procedure done under full general anesthesia and takes about 1 to 2 hours to perform. It is done using a laparoscopic technique. This involves making 3 to 5 small incisions, each about 1 inch in length. The surgeon inserts a small camera attached to a tube into one of these incisions and views the procedure on a screen. The other incisions allow for the use of surgical instruments and placement of the band. The gastric band is placed around the upper part of the stomach and set into position with ''sutures''. The port is then placed in the wall of the abdomen and sutured in place.' "
How do I prepare for lap band surgery?,"'Depending on the surgeon or the program, the preparation for surgery will vary. Many centers like to see a commitment from the patient to the necessary lifestyle changes even before surgery. It may be suggested that the patient start eating 5 to 6 small meals a day to prepare for the changes ahead. It may be recommended to wean off ""slippery"" high calorie foods such as ice cream or milk shakes (since these will continue to be easily absorbed after the procedure).''If the BMI is greater than 50, or if there are other medical issues, medical risk reduction may be needed preoperatively and should be discussed in detail. In addition, a ''weight loss'' of 5% to 10% prior to surgery has been shown to improved post operative outcomes, and may be a goal that your surgeon or preoperative care team will discuss with you.' "
How long is the recovery after lap band surgery?,"'Recovery varies with each individual. However, in general, LAGB offers a shorter hospitalization and quicker recovery than gastric bypass procedures. In general, most people can return to work 1 week after surgery (if their job is not too physically demanding). Normal activity can usually resume after 6 weeks.' "
What is a lap band fill?,"'A lap band ""fill"" is the common term for gastric band adjustments. Once surgery is performed, there is a period of healing that must take place before the first adjustment. Usually, the first fill takes place around 6 to 8 weeks. It involves injecting saline into the port just under the skin which is connected to the band. Prior to this, there may be little change in appetite. Fills are painless and are usually performed by the surgeon who performed the procedure. These adjustments may take place to enhance ''weight loss'', especially if there is a plateau phase in ''weight loss'', and they may to performed to overcome side effects such as ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (in this latter case, the band is loosened).' "
What can I expect my lifestyle to be after lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Immediately after surgery, there will be some ''pain'' and discomfort that can be controlled with medications. This is part of the normal recovery phase after any surgical procedure. After 6 to 8 weeks, one can generally return to normal activities. ''Weight loss'' with LAGB is a gradual process. Initially, the ''weight loss'' may be more dramatic- say 2 to 3 pounds per week. However, this generally slows to a pound or so weekly over the long-term. Naturally, the food choices made will govern this weight loss rate. After about 18 months, the weight loss tends to slow significantly. The average weight loss for this procedure is 40% of excess body weight in the first year, with an additional 10% to 20% in the second year. Patients are usually asked to keep in contact with their surgeon regularly during this time period as further band adjustments may be needed. ' "
What are the side effects of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'Side effects include ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ulceration at the band site, ''esophageal reflux'' (''indigestion''), weight regain, and ''dehydration''. Since this type of surgery is restrictive and does not cause malabsorption of nutrients, vitamin deficiencies are not usually seen. However, many centers recommend multivitamin supplementation. ''Constipation'' is commonly encountered.' "
What are the risks and complications of lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'LAGB has a low risk of surgical complications compared to other weight reduction procedures. The mortality (death) rate is about 1 in 2000. There is the possibility of the band slipping or eroding into the stomach and of mechanical malfunction. Other complications may include infection, bleeding, and/or ''abdominal pain''. ' "
What type of surgeon performs lap band surgery (LAGB)?,"'When choosing a surgeon, it is important to search for one who is a qualified bariatric surgeon. In general, practice makes perfect, and the more surgeries performed the better. A surgeon performing 100 or more procedures annually is likely going to have better outcomes. A surgeon who is part of a clinical team of nutritionists, nurses, psychologists, and physicians in general can provide better counseling and support in the pre- and postoperative period. ' "
What is leptospirosis?,"""Leptospirosis (also known as Weil's disease, grippotyphosa, and canicola) is a disease caused by bacteria (""'Leptospira interrogans'') that produce a wide range of symptoms that may occur in two phases; some patients may develop kidney or ''liver'' failure, respiratory failure, meningitis, or even death. The bacterial infection is spread by the urine of infected animals from many species, both domesticated (such as ''dogs'' and horses) and wild infected animals (such as rodents or wild pigs). It is termed a ''zoonotic disease'' or a ''zoonosis'' because it occurs in wild animals. The bacteria can survive in freshwater and soil for months. The disease is most common in temperate and tropical climates. The infecting bacteria occur worldwide (for example, in the United States, ''Leptospira'"" has been found in Hawaii's freshwater ponds and waterfalls)."" "
What causes leptospirosis?,"'The cause of leptospirosis is bacteria (genus ''Leptospira'' and species ''interrogans''), a Gram-negative spirochete (spiral-shaped bacteria). The ''Leptospira'' bacteria infect many types of animals (many wild animals, rodents, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, for example) that subsequently contaminate water, lakes, rivers, soil, and crops when they urinate because the bacteria are present in urine. The bacteria then infect humans when they invade through breaks in the skin or ''mucus'' membranes or when people ingest them. The bacteria multiply in the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system. Person-to-person transfer of this disease is rare.' "
Is leptospirosis contagious? What is the contagious period for leptospirosis?,"'In general, human leptospirosis is considered weakly ''contagious''. This is because, like other animals, humans can shed leptospirosis in the urine during and after illness. Consequently, individuals exposed to the urine of humans who are infected may become infected. For example, although the bacteria are not airborne and have a low risk of being in saliva, individuals handling wet bedding or blood-soaked material from an infected person can increase the chances of getting the infection. There are a few reports of transmission between sexual partners, but the incidence of this type of spread seems very low. Unfortunately, ''pregnant'' mothers who get leptospirosis can infect their fetus.''The contagious period for leptospirosis depends on how long viable organisms are shed in the urine. Most individuals will shed organisms in the urine for a few weeks but there are reports that humans can continue to shed the organisms in urine for as long as 11 months. Some experts suggest that there is risk for up to 12 months after getting the initial infection.' "
What is the incubation period for leptospirosis?,'The incubation period for leptospirosis is approximately seven to 12 days but it may range from two to 30 days.' 
What are risk factors for leptospirosis?,"'Risk factors include occupational exposure in people to with farm animals, wild animals, and to contaminated water and soil (farmers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, miners, military personnel, disaster workers and victims, for example). People who participate in outdoor activities such as camping or kayaking are also at higher risk for infection. Any exposure to sewage or animal waste, including stools from infected dogs, increases the risk of getting leptospirosis. Heavy rainfall may cause the bacterial infection to increase in a population that experiences flooding. This is evidenced by a reported four deaths from leptospirosis due to flooding in Puerto Rico.' "
What are leptospirosis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms and signs of leptospirosis are variable and are similar to those seen in many other diseases (''dengue fever'', ''hantavirus'', ''brucellosis'', ''malaria'', and others). Symptoms can arise about two days to four weeks after exposure to the bacteria. Although some people have no symptoms, others may exhibit''These symptoms usually occur in the first phase of the infection, and when present, they often occur abruptly. Some patients resolve their symptoms and do not progress to the second phase. Others may seem to briefly recover but relapse (about 5%-10%) with more severe symptoms and organ damage in the severe form of the disease. The second-phase symptoms may overlap with the first-phase symptoms in severe disease and include the following:'""This is the second phase of leptospirosis, called Weil's disease. If it's not treated, it may not resolve for several months, and some patients may develop long-term complications such as kidney and lung problems. The death rate is about 1%-5%.""  high fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and muscle pain, fatigue, sore throat, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, pain in the joints or muscles, rash, and reddish eyes. Jaundice Renal failure (kidney damage) Pulmonary hemorrhage Cardiac arrhythmias Pneumonitis Septic shock"
What specialists treat leptospirosis?,"'Clinic doctors, primary care doctors, pediatricians, and emergency-medicine specialists often treat leptospirosis in countries where it is endemic and the patients are in the first phase of the disease. Other specialists are often consulted if the patient begins to enter the second phase of the disease. These specialists may include critical care, infectious-disease, hospitalists, internists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, and kidney specialists.' "
How do physicians diagnose leptospirosis?,"""Physicians make a presumptive diagnosis based on the patient's history and physical exam. Only specialized labs perform serological serology tests for leptospirosis serogroups (specific types of the bacteria that react with certain antibodies). Health care professionals may perform definitive tests by isolating the bacteria from the patient (blood or CSF) or by a positive microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Other tests (""'ELISA'', ''PCR'', urine dipsticks) may provide additional evidence of infection. Patients with severe symptoms should be treated as confirmatory tests are time consuming.' "
What is the treatment for leptospirosis?,"'Although there is controversy about using antibiotics in the first phase of leptospirosis, antibiotics (''penicillin'' - penicillin G, ''ampicillin'' [Omnipen, Polycillin, Principen], ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', ''Trimox'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid''], or ''erythromycin'' [E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''PCE'', Pediazole, Ilosone]) are recommended for treatment of patients with phase two or more severe symptoms. Some patients may require IV antibiotics and supportive hospital care such as rehydration.''For those clinicians who choose to treat phase-one patients, the choice of antibiotics includes the above, but many choose to treat with doxycycline.' "
What is the prognosis of leptospirosis?,"""Overall, the prognosis of leptospirosis is good. Many people become infected and spontaneously recover without treatment. However, the prognosis worsens as the symptoms increase. People with Weil's disease may have a prognosis ranging from good to poor, depending on their response to treatment. Pregnant women who become infected have a high rate of fetal mortality, especially if they acquire the disease early in ""'pregnancy''.' "
Is a vaccine available for leptospirosis? Is it possible to prevent leptospirosis?,"'A leptospirosis vaccine is not currently available in the U.S.; however, high-risk workers in some European and Asian countries may have access to a vaccine. Unfortunately, the ''vaccines'' are serovar-specific (bacterial-strain specific) and thus do not offer widespread protection as there are over 200 serovars (immunologically distinct types of the bacteria). Some vaccines are available for animals but these, like the human vaccines, are only effective against a narrow range of serovars. In addition, side effects of the vaccine can cause painful swelling. Chemoprophylaxis (using ''drugs'' to prevent illness) is possible under certain circumstances. Some individuals who may have high short-time risk (for example, military personnel) may take doxycycline (200 mg/week), beginning one to two days before potential exposure to have about a 95% chance of preventing infection with chemoprophylaxis. This preventive treatment is not recommended for long terms of exposure.''Avoiding contact with animal excrement, good hygiene, and avoiding contaminated water and soil are other ways to reduce the chance of getting leptospirosis.'""Dogs, and many other animals, can be infected with leptospirosis. Veterinarians have access to vaccines that can protect (or prevent) leptospirosis in dogs and other animals for at least 12 months. This vaccination may help protect the animals' owners and other local or family owned animals from the disease for approximately one year."" "
What is the history of West Nile virus?,"'West Nile encephalitis'' is an infection of the brain that is caused by a virus known as the West Nile virus. First identified in Uganda in 1937, the virus is commonly found in Africa, West Asia, and the Middle East. West Nile virus infection has now been reported in all U.S. states except Alaska. ""''Encephalitis''"" means inflammation of the brain. The most common causes of encephalitis are viral and ''bacterial infections'', including viral infections transmitted by mosquitoes.''West Nile virus infection is also called West Nile ''fever'' or West Nile encephalitis. The virus is a type of arbovirus (''arbo'' comes from the term ARrthropod-BOrne, as many bugs are arthropods). It is a member of the ''Flavivirus'' genus and the family ''Flaviviridae''. Other flaviviruses that affect humans include ''yellow fever'', ''Zika'', and dengue. Human and veterinary cases of West Nile virus are reported electronically by state and local health departments to ArboNET. ArboNET is the U.S. surveillance system for arboviral diseases managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC). Human cases include people with signs of infection as well as blood donors whose specimens are positive by screening.''West Nile virus had not been previously reported in the U.S. prior to an outbreak in New York in September 1999. According to the CDC, from 1999-2015, 43,937 people in the U.S. were reported to be infected with West Nile virus. Of those infected, 1,911 died.''In 2016, 2,149 cases of West Nile virus disease in people were reported to ArboNET for the year. This is the highest number of reported West Nile virus cases in a single year since the virus was first detected in the U.S. in 1999. Of these, 56% were classified as neuroinvasive disease (meningitis or encephalitis) and 44% were non-neuroinvasive disease. Since 1999, Alaska is the only state that has not reported a human West Nile virus infection.''Among all people who become infected with West Nile virus, most have mild symptoms that do not get reported. Typically, less than 1% will actually develop severe neuroinvasive disease, according to the CDC.''West Nile virus infection is also called West Nile fever or West Nile encephalitis. The virus is a type of arbovirus (""arbo"" comes from ARrthropod-BOrne, as many insects are arthropods). It is a member of the ''Flavivirus'' genus and the family ''Flaviviridae''.' "
Where did the West Nile virus come from?,"'To date, ''strains'' of the West Nile virus have been commonly found in humans, birds, and other vertebrate animals in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia, and the Middle East. Prior to 1999, the West Nile virus had not been recognized in the Western Hemisphere.''The first recorded epidemics were reported in Israel in the 1950s and in Europe in 1962. A subsequent outbreak occurred in New York in 1999. The American strain of the virus is almost indistinguishable from a strain found in a goose on an Israeli farm in 1998. Thousands of people travel between New York and the Middle East each year. The virus may well have hitchhiked a ride to New York with an infected ''traveler''.' "
Are there other viruses like the West Nile virus?,"'The West Nile virus is closely related to the Japanese encephalitis virus and the ''St. Louis encephalitis'' virus, which are found in the southeastern and Midwestern United States. These ''viruses'' are also mosquito-borne and have a similar life cycle in birds and mosquitoes and occasionally strike people.''A major difference is that St. Louis encephalitis is ""silent"" in birds, generally not killing them, so there is usually no warning before a human case occurs. With the West Nile virus (at least the American strain), birds, particularly crows, become ill or die and therefore offer an early warning system.' "
How do people get West Nile virus?,'People get West Nile virus from bites of a mosquito (primarily the ''Culex pipiens'' mosquito) that is infected with the West Nile virus. This mosquito is often referred to as the house mosquito or the West Nile virus mosquito.'  
How do mosquitoes get infected with the West Nile virus?,"'The ''Culex'"" species that transmits West Nile virus is called the house mosquito because it prefers to lay eggs in small containers of stagnant water, which are common around homes. Humans are not their preferred meal, however, and they become infected by feeding on birds. The infected birds may or may not become ill. The birds are preferred and amplifying hosts of the virus (meaning that the virus reproduces in high numbers) and are important for the virus' life cycle and transmission cycle.""'Among birds, crows are most vulnerable to infection by the West Nile virus. They are often killed by the virus. More than 200 species of birds have been found to be infected by the virus, and the common dust-colored house sparrow is probably a principal bird reservoir for the virus in New York. Sparrows can harbor the virus for five days or more at levels high enough to infect mosquitoes that bite them.''The infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus when they bite and suck blood from nearby people and animals and, in the process, inject the virus into their victim.'

When is there an increased risk for West Nile virus infection?,"'The risk of infection is highest during mosquito season and does not lower until mosquito activity ceases for the season (when freezing temperatures occur). In temperate areas of the world, cases of West Nile virus infection occur primarily in the late summer or early fall. In southern climates where temperatures are milder, West Nile virus infections can occur year round. Interestingly, increases in drought may increase human exposure risk, as mosquitoes and birds congregate more around human habitats, which tend to be good sources of water in containers, irrigation systems, etc.' "
"Who is at risk for getting 
a West Nile virus infection?","'A risk factor for developing West Nile virus infection is living in areas where active cases have been identified. A risk factor for developing a more severe case is being 50 years of age or older.''The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' states that children appear to be at low risk for the disease, although the youngest person in New York to become seriously ill was 5 years old.' "
"Besides mosquitoes, can other insects transmit the West Nile virus?","'Infected mosquitoes are the primary method of transmission of the West Nile virus and were the source of the 1999 New York outbreak.''Ticks'' infected with the West Nile virus have been found in Asia and Africa. Their role in the transmission and maintenance of the virus is uncertain. However, ticks have not been associated in the transmission of the West Nile virus in the New York outbreak.' "
Is the West Nile virus contagious?,"'The West Nile virus is not ''contagious''. It cannot be transmitted from person to person. A person cannot get the virus, for example, from touching or kissing a person who has the disease or from a health-care worker who has treated someone with the disease.''Humans are called a ""dead-end"" host for the virus, meaning one that can be infected but whose immune system usually prevents the virus from multiplying enough to be passed back to mosquitoes and then spread to other hosts.''There also is no evidence that a person can get the virus from handling live or dead infected birds. However, avoiding skin contact when handling dead animals, including dead birds, is recommended. Gloves or double ''plastic'' ''bags'' should be used to remove and dispose of carcasses.' "
What is the incubation period for a West Nile virus infection?,'The incubation period (the time from infection to the development of symptoms) is five to 15 days.' 
What are West Nile virus infection symptoms and signs?,"'Mild or symptom-free infections are common with the West Nile virus. Among all people who become infected, only two out of 10 develop any symptoms. Of those, most only have mild symptoms similar to those of the ''flu'', such as ''headache'', body aches, ''joint pain'', ''swollen lymph nodes'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or ''rash''. The symptoms are not severe enough for most people to seek medical care, but ''tiredness'' and ''weakness'' can last for several weeks. Typically, only one in 150 infections lead to severe or neuroinvasive (nervous system disease) infections, according to the CDC. Neuroinvasive disease is caused by infection and inflammation of the surface covering of the brain (meningitis) or deeper infection of the brain itself (encephalitis).''Neuroinvasive disease is uncommon but more likely to occur in those over age 50. There are two general symptoms of neuroinvasive disease. Meningitis is marked by ''headache'', high fever, and ''neck stiffness''. Encephalitis causes these symptoms but may progress to stupor (sleepiness), disorientation, ''hallucinations'', paralysis, ''coma'', ''tremors'', convulsions, and rarely death. Sometimes general weakness progressing to complete paralysis occurs, similar to ''polio''; this is called acute flaccid paralysis.''West Nile virus can have some long-term effects after severe illnesses. West Nile virus meningitis or encephalitis may result in a prolonged recuperation and rehabilitation period, especially in the elderly. ''Memory loss'', ''depression'', irritability, and ''confusion'' are the most prevalent residual effects.''Patients may also experience difficulty ''walking'', muscle weakness, joint ''pain'', ''fatigue'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''insomnia''.''Symptoms in children and ''babies'' are basically the same as symptoms in adults. Children may complain of ''headache'', may have a fever, and may become lethargic.''Since most cases of West Nile virus infection are mild, the prognosis for recovery is generally good. In severe cases, death rates are highest in the elderly.'  "
Can you get West Nile virus infection from a blood transfusion?,"'In 1999, the CDC estimated the likelihood West Nile virus transmission from blood products at 2.7 infections per 10,000 units of transfused blood.''Since 2003, however, the blood supply in the U.S. has been screened with highly sensitive nucleic acid tests (NAT) for West Nile virus. Since most infections cause no symptoms, screening greatly reduces the risk of transmission by blood products. Donated blood that tests positive for the virus is not administered to patients. It is impossible to completely eliminate all risks of infection from blood products, but the blood supply is currently very unlikely to cause an infection.''In addition, donation centers do not allow donation if a donor has been diagnosed with West Nile virus infection within the past 120 days.' "
Can you get West Nile virus infection from having an organ transplantation?,"'In 2002, prior to screening of the blood supply, WNV infection was first reported from an organ donor. Three recent recipients of organs from the same donor developed neuroinvasive disease soon after transplantation, and a fourth developed fever. The donor had received multiple blood transfusions from over 60 donors prior to dying from ''trauma''. Blood specimens before and after the transfusions did not detect WNV infection; however, tissue and blood from the time of organ harvest tested positive on WNV NAT assays. The source of infection was narrowed down to one blood donor who developed evidence of WNV infection after donation.''Since then, cases of WNV infection linked to organ donors have been reported sporadically in the U.S. and Europe. Most of these cases have involved severe disease with encephalitis. This is not unexpected, since the immune systems of organ recipients are artificially weakened to prevent organ rejection. Screening of donors for WNV prior to transplant is not routinely performed by all centers and is controversial. Blood and tissue screening of donors has not been consistently positive in cases of transmitted WNV. Donated organs are also quite precious, because there are many more people on transplant lists than donors. Once an organ becomes available, there is very limited time to complete successful transplantation, and the recipient may not survive the wait for another one. A few cases of WNV transmitted by organs have been successfully treated with intravenous antibody preparations to temporarily boost immune defenses. More study is needed to determine the best way to prevent and manage these rare and difficult cases.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a West Nile virus infection?,"'The diagnosis of West Nile virus infection is confirmed with a blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test to detect WNV-specific IgM antibodies. A CSF test requires a ''lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'') to obtain a specimen. IgM antibodies represent recent infection and are usually detectable during active or recent infection within three to eight days after infection, but a negative test within eight days should still be repeated if WNV infection is truly suspected. Unfortunately, WNV IgM antibodies can persist for three months or more, so the test may be positive from a prior infection, or a positive test may be due to cross-reactivity with antibodies to other flaviviruses. Therefore, a positive WNV IgM antibody must be confirmed by much more specialized testing by CDC.''WNV-specific IgG antibodies appear soon after the IgM antibodies, and remain present for life, so testing for these antibodies is not helpful for diagnosis of new infection. However, it can help sort out past infection from new infection when a person lives in an area where WNV is active or has been exposed. For example, a positive IgG with a negative IgM suggests no current or active WNV infection. This may help decide whether other causes of illness could be considered.' "
What is the treatment for West Nile virus? Is it possible to prevent West Nile virus infection with a vaccine?,"'There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection at this time. Intensive supportive therapy is directed toward the complications of brain infection. Anti-inflammatory medications, intravenous fluids, and intensive medical monitoring may be required in severe cases. In milder cases, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ''pain'' relievers such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') or ''aspirin'' may help reduce symptoms of pain and fever. There is no specific antibiotic or antiviral for the viral infection. There is no ''vaccine'' to prevent the virus.'  "
Is a woman's pregnancy at risk if she gets infected with the West Nile virus?,"'There is no clear evidence that a ''pregnancy'' is at risk due to infection with West Nile virus, and ''pregnant'' women are not more likely to become infected. However, the CDC states that in 2002, one case of transplacental (mother-to-child) transmission of West Nile virus was reported. In this case, the infant was born with West Nile virus infection and severe medical problems. In 2003 and 2004, a CDC registry identified 77 women who acquired West Nile virus illness while pregnant. Seventy-one of these women delivered live infants, two had elective abortions, and four miscarried in the ''first trimester''. The CDC is continuing to gather research and outcome data for ''pregnancies'' of West Nile virus-infected mothers.''Due to concerns that mother-to-child West Nile virus transmission can occur, the CDC recommends pregnant women take precautions to reduce their risk for West Nile virus and related mosquito-borne diseases, such as ''Zika virus''. Pregnant women should avoid wooded areas and times of day (early mornings and early evening) when mosquitoes are active. They should wear protective clothing and use repellents proven to be effective, including DEET, which is safe during pregnancy when used as directed. Effective repellents that are safe in pregnancy are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). More information can be found on the CDC web site:''""Insect Repellent Use & Safety""''https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/repellent.html''Pregnant women who become ill should see their health-care professional, and those who have an illness consistent with acute West Nile virus infection should undergo appropriate diagnostic testing.' "
What is the prognosis of West Nile virus infection?,"'Since 80% of people who get infected never have any symptoms or signs, the overall prognosis (or likelihood of full recovery) is excellent. Of the 20% who develop symptoms and signs, most are mild and may last for a week, but they may be left with some level of weakness, ''fatigue'', and ''difficulty concentrating'"" for weeks to months. These residual symptoms are most likely in those over age 50. A questionnaire study of people infected during the 1999 outbreak in New York found that only 37% reported complete return to normal by one year after infection. Interestingly, the likelihood of full recovery does not differ in those who have mild symptoms and signs versus severe disease. Age and overall health before infection is more predictive of an individual's likelihood of recovery. Those over 65 years of age are more likely to be hospitalized, to be discharged to a residence outside the home, and to have prolonged residual effects. Those under 65 years of age are most likely to have full recovery. Children are least likely to be affected by neuroinvasive disease or prolonged residual symptoms and signs."" "
"What can a community do to reduce the risk of an outbreak of 
the West Nile virus?","'First, local and state health departments may monitor the bird population for this virus; this includes surveillance of birds that are sick or have died of disease. The CDC has guidance documents for in setting up arbovirus surveillance programs.''Second, the community can watch for and remove sources of stagnant water, particularly around housing, where ''Culex'' mosquitoes tend to breed. Individuals can do a great deal to control disease-carrying mosquitoes simply by inspecting areas around housing where even a bottle capful of water may collect and emptying them. For example, pots should be stored upside down to prevent water collection or stored inside. Rain gutters should be inspected and cleared of debris that can block drainage. Used tires should be disposed of by recycling or at tire disposal centers. Stored outdoors, they make excellent mosquito incubators, offering pockets of stagnant water and shelter from the elements.''Third, public or private mosquito-control programs (including the use of spraying and larvacide) may be warranted for prevention of West Nile virus infection.''Rigorous surveillance and mosquito control programs help to greatly reduce the likelihood that the virus may infect people.' "
"What can a person do to reduce the risk of becoming infected with 
the West Nile virus?","'The following recommendations can help reduce the risk of becoming infected with the virus:' Stay indoors at dawn, dusk, and in the early evening. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply EPA-registered insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin and clothing according to manufacturer's instructions. An effective repellent contains 20%-30% DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide). DEET in high concentrations (greater than 30%) may cause side effects, particularly in children and babies, but it is safe to use in pregnancy. Avoid products containing more than 30% DEET. Picaridin is a newer repellent that is effective and about as long-lasting against mosquitoes as DEET at the same concentrations. It has been used in Europe and has been available in the U.S. since 2005. Unlike DEET, picaridin has no odor, does not damage synthetic fabrics and plastics, and is non-greasy. There are some repellents with essential oils like geranium oil that may be an option for some people, but there is much less data on duration of protection or reliability of protections against mosquitoes. B vitamins are not effective repellents against mosquitoes. Repellents may irritate the eyes and mouth, so avoid applying repellent to the hands of children. Insect repellents should not be applied to very young children (under 3 years of age) or babies. Spray clothing with repellents containing picaridin or DEET since mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing. There are permethrin products that can be applied to clothing that will remain effective through a few washes. For those who work outdoors or need extended protection, permethrin-impregnated clothing is also available. Whenever using an insecticide or insect repellent, be sure to read and follow the manufacturer's directions for use, as printed on the product. Take preventive measures in and around your home. Repair or install door and window screens, use air conditioning, and reduce breeding sites (eliminate standing water). If someone finds a dead bird, the CDC recommends not handling the carcass with bare hands. Contact a local health department for instructions for the notification procedure and disposing of the carcass. After logging a report, they may tell you to dispose of the bird. Note: Vitamin B and ""ultrasonic"" devices are not effective in preventing mosquito bites."
What is West syndrome?,"'West syndrome, also known as infantile spasm, is a very uncommon epileptic ''seizure'' disease that was first described by Dr. W. West (in 1841) in his own son.'  "
Who gets West syndrome?,"'West Syndrome is an age related disease in infants. Symptoms of the syndrome appear between 3 and 12 months of age, usually occurring at the fifth month.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of West syndrome?,"'The following conditions are symptoms of West syndrome:'   Hypsarrhythmia (abnormal brain waves detected by an electroencephalogram [EEG]) Mental retardation Infantile spasms (seizures), some of which are termed “jackknife seizures” because the infant suddenly bends forward at the waist."
What causes West syndrome?,"'Any type of ''brain damage'' can cause West syndrome, for example:''Cryptogenic West syndrome is the term used when the cause of the syndrome cannot be identified.'   Severe brain injury at birth Brain malformations Metabolic disease Chromosome abnormalities Tuberous sclerosis (a genetic condition)"
Is there a test to diagnose West syndrome?,"'The diagnosis is made if the infant or child has at least two of the three symptoms of hypsarrhythmia, mental retardation, or infantile seizures.' "
What is the treatment for West syndrome? Is there a cure?,"'Since there are so many potential causes of West syndrome, treatment is based on the cause. There is no cure for West syndrome, so unfortunately, the only treatment is to reduce symptoms.''West syndrome treatments usually include a course of ''prednisolone'' and/or an anti-epileptic medication. In a few individuals, surgery in the brain may help reduce symptoms.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for West syndrome?,"'Due to the various causes of West syndrome, each individual will have a somewhat different prognosis. However, children that can become free of attacks with appropriate medication (about 50% of all individuals with West syndrome) have a fair prognosis.''Individuals that do not have EEG abnormalities and show early response to treatment have a better prognosis. Unfortunately, up to about 90% of all children with West syndrome still suffer severe cognitive and physical impairments.''Life expectancy for West syndrome is variable. About five in every 100 infants and children with West syndrome do not survive beyond five years of age. A study of 214 Finnish children over 25 years of age showed about 61% dying at or before age 10 years.' "
What are other names for West syndrome?,"'West syndrome has had many different names, including:' Infantile epileptic encephalopathy Infantile myoclonic encephalopathy Generalized flexion epilepsy Massive myoclonia Salaam spasms Jackknife convulsions Infantile spasms"
What is drowning and what are the statistics?,"'According to WHO, ""Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid."" The possible outcomes of drowning are classified as death, morbidity (the development of disability or injury), and no morbidity.'""This simple definition was agreed upon at the 2002 World Congress of Drowning held in Amsterdam. Prior to that meeting, some definitions and classifications of drowning were not necessarily well defined, and their meanings were subject to a variety of interpretations by different countries and health organizations. While some people still try to sort drowning events into categories (for example wet vs. dry, primary vs. secondary, fatal vs. nonfatal), these terms may or may not adequately describe a patient's situation, the effects of drowning on their body, or the potential outcome."" Drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury related deaths. According to WHO, more than 350,000 people die every year from drowning. This number significantly underestimates the actual number because they do not include those who drown in floods, boating, or water transport accidents. Almost half of all drowning in the world occur in China and India. The death rate from drowning does not reflect the potential morbidity (disability) due to brain injury for those who survive a drowning episode. Most countries do not keep nonfatal drowning statistics."
What happens during drowning?,"'Drowning occurs when water comes into contact with the larynx (voice box).'   After an initial gasp, there is a period of voluntary breath holding. This is followed by spasm of the larynx and the development of hypoxemia (hypo=low + ox=oxygen + emia=blood), or decreased levels of oxygen in the bloodstream. Lack of oxygen causes aerobic metabolism to stop, and the body becomes acidotic. If not corrected quickly, the lack of oxygen in combination with too much acid may lead to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart (cardiac arrest) and lack of blood supply to the brain. As body function declines, aspiration may occur as the larynx relaxes, allowing water to enter the lungs. However, up to 20% of drowning victims have persistent spasm of the larynx, and no water is aspirated (this was formerly known as ""dry"" drowning)."
Does the type of drowning matter?,'There have been a variety of theories reported regarding the potential responses of the body to different drowning situations. Most discuss dry vs. wet drowning and salt vs. fresh water drowning.' 
Wet vs. dry drowning,"'Most drownings are unwitnessed, and the victim is found floating. While only a small amount of aspirated water is required to cause significant problems with lung function, it is the prolonged submersion time and lack of breathing that causes complications due to hypoxemia.''Approximately 10% to 20% of drowning victims have dry drowning with no water found in the lungs at ''autopsy'', but even most wet drowning victims have less than 4cc/kg of water found in their lungs. For a 50 pound child, this amounts to less than 3 ounces of water.' "
Salt vs. fresh water drowning,"'In the lung, the breathing tubes (trachea, bronchi, ''bronchioles'') branch into smaller and smaller segments until they end in an air pocket called an alveolus (plural alveoli). This is the part of the lung where air and ''red blood cells'' in capillary blood vessels come near enough to allow the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the two. Alveoli are covered with a chemical called surfactant that allows the air pocket to open and close easily when breathing occurs.''When fresh water enters an alveolus, it destroys the surfactant and causes the alveoli to collapse, unable to open with breathing. A mismatch can develop where blood is pumped to parts of lung where no oxygen is available to be absorbed. This may lead to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen in the blood called a ventilation-perfusion mismatch.'""Salt water doesn't destroy surfactant; rather it washes it away and damages the membrane between the alveolus and the capillary blood vessel. Once again, the body sends blood flow to areas of the lung that aren't able to provide it oxygen, and hypoxemia occurs.""'Regardless of the type of water, lung function is compromised because of the lack of surfactant, and the effect it has on lung function. In some circumstances, ''electrolyte'' abnormalities may occur with fresh water drowning.' "
What are the risk factors of drowning?,"'There are two peak ages for drowning: children aged younger than 4 and young adults aged 15 to 25.'   Infants less than 1 year old most often drown in bathtubs. Children younger than age 5 most commonly drown in residential swimming pools. Young adults tend to drown in larger bodies of water (for example, rivers and lakes). Neck fractures caused by diving into shallow water are associated with drowning in this age group. Alcohol is also implicated in up to 50% of drownings in this age group. Medical emergencies that occur in the water also can lead to drowning. These may include, among others, seizures, heart attack (myocardial infarction), sudden cardiac death, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar in a person with diabetes)."
What are the symptoms of drowning?,"'The consequences and symptoms of drowning vary widely. A drowning victim may show no symptoms and have no complaints, or may be found dead.''It is the rare person who is found thrashing in water. Instead, most drownings are unwitnessed and the person is found floating or submerged in the water.''For those who are alive, they may be anxious, confused, and short of breath. Brain function and lung function are the main concerns in drowning victims.''Young children may have a mammalian diving reflex that occurs when drowning occurs in very ''cold'' water. When suddenly immersed in cold water less than 68 F (20 C), victims can stop breathing, slow their heart rate dramatically, and shunt all the blood flow to the heart and brain. Though not common, these children may be resuscitated and return to normal function. Cases of survival have been reported, even after being underwater for an hour.' "
When should one seek medical care for drowning?,"'All individuals who are victims of drowning, even if they have no symptoms, should be evaluated by a health care professional. Sometimes, subtle information will be revealed that may make the diagnosis of an underlying medical condition.' "
How is drowning diagnosed?,"'The initial evaluation of any drowning victim will begin with a history of the events.''Physical examination will begin with taking and monitoring the vital signs (the ABCs will be evaluated -- ''airway'', breathing, and circulation). Careful examination of the whole body will be required, especially focusing on the neurological examination to assess brain function. Lung and heart examination will also be performed.''If trauma or a diving injury is a consideration, the neck and spine may be immobilized to protect against potential spinal cord damage.''Laboratory and X-ray testing will be utilized depending upon the situation and potential injuries.' How old is the patient? Are there any underlying medical problems? Does the patient take any prescription or non-prescription medications? Is there a history of drug or alcohol use? How long was the person unattended prior to being found? Was there any potential trauma associated with the drowning (diving/falling into the water/falling out of a boat, falling through ice)? Was there loss of consciousness before, during, or after the drowning episode? Did the patient have a witnessed seizure? Did the person complain of chest pain and was he or she a victim of sudden cardiac arrest before falling into the water? Has there been any change in behavior after being removed from the water? Has the person had vomiting?"
How is drowning treated?,"""Treatment begins at the water's edge. The American Heart Association recommends, if possible, sending one person to activate emergency medical services and to call 911. Send another person to bring an automatic external ""'defibrillator'"" (AED) to the victim's side.""'If no pulse can be identified and the patient is not breathing, start CPR. Drowning is one of the special situations where hands-only CPR is NOT indicated. If there is a potential for a ''neck injury'', take special care to prevent further injury to the victim by keeping the neck and body in alignment.''If the patient is breathing but not awake, place the person on his or her side in the rescue position to prevent aspiration if ''vomiting'' should occur.'   Further treatment by EMTs, paramedics, and staff at the hospital will depend upon the severity of the symptoms. Those patients who have no symptoms may require nothing more than observation. Those who are in cardiopulmonary arrest will likely undergo CPR with attempts to restore a regular heart rhythm and heartbeat. Those patients who have symptoms related to the function of their heart, lung, or brain will need further evaluation and treatment tailored to their specific circumstances and situation. And, unfortunately, for those who are found dead with no potential for resuscitation, further treatment or evaluation may not be indicated."
What are the complications of drowning?," Hypoxemia causing brain damage is the major complication in drowning victims who do not die. Direct lung tissue damage caused by water aspirated into the lung can also occur and may lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If the drowning occurs in colder water, there is the risk of hypothermia or a drop in core body temperature. Drowning may occur as a consequence of injury or illness. For example, cervical spine fractures (broken neck) due to diving injuries may result in breathing problems and subsequent drowning. Drowning can occur as a result of syncope or loss of consciousness in the water, due to a variety of medical conditions including heart attack and seizure."
How can drowning be prevented?,"'Most drownings are preventable, and simple steps can be taken to help with water safety.'  Learn how to swim. When in the water, use the buddy system. Do not use alcohol or drugs when swimming or boating. Supervise children closely around water and make certain they are the focus of your attention. Even bathtubs and buckets full of water can be dangerous. Swimming pools should have barriers (fences, gates, alarms) to prevent children from entering unattended. Learn CPR."
What is the prognosis for a drowning victim?,"'The prognosis for many drowning victims is poor. The brain does not tolerate lack of oxygen well and the amount of potential damage is dependent upon the time the patient spends hypoxemic in the water.''Even if the brain survives, ''acute respiratory distress syndrome'' (''ARDS'') may cause significant short- and long-term problems as the lungs try to recover from their injuries.''The key to the treatment of drowning is ''prevention''.' "
How successful are injections for wet macular degeneration?,"'Clinical studies have documented a definite success of ''intraocular'' (into the eye) injections for wet ''macular degeneration''. After one year of intraocular therapy, the vision improved by about 25-34% compared with 5% in those who did not choose intraocular injections.''Avastin'' (bevacizumab), Lucentis (ranibizumab), and Eylea (aflibercept) are the medications\xa0 used for the treatment of wet macular degeneration. These are injected into the eye every four weeks for around one year. After one year, the frequency at which you require injections may be decided by your eye doctor.''These injections have shown to halt the ongoing ''vision loss'' and, in some cases, even improve the vision. The therapy is most effective if started between 7 and 21 weeks of the onset of symptoms.''In many studies, improvements were consistent and maintained for two years after starting the treatment. A continued treatment showed an improvement in the retinal structure and reduced retinal scarring in the various scans conducted.' "
What is wet macular degeneration?,"'The retina is a thin layer at the back of the eye. It contains the receptors (cells) for light and color detection. These cells trigger the nerve signals for image formation in the brain. The retina plays a central role in our vision.''The macula is the oval area near the center of the retina where the visual receptor cells are concentrated. The macula is involved in visual sharpness and color vision. Any damage to the macula can cause permanent ''blindness''.''Wet macular degeneration is an age-related disease. It may be seen after 50 years of age. In this disease, there is an abnormal growth of blood vessels over the retina. These blood vessels leak fluid, ''lipids'', and blood all over the retina. The leaks damage the retinal structure and cause scarring of its layers. People with a damaged retina experience the following issues:''The main culprit behind the blindness seen in macular degeneration is the growth of abnormal blood vessels over the retina and macula. These vessels grow because of a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the retina. The VEGF in the retina may be produced in response to a compromised blood supply causing poor oxygen supply to the cells within.' A gradual loss of vision Haziness when they see Distorted images New blind spots or an increase in the number of the blind spots Complete blindness is rare, but there is a reduction or loss of central vision over time"
What conditions can put you at a risk of wet macular degeneration?,"'The following conditions predispose the person to a risk of wet macular degeneration:''Age:'' After the age of 50 years, a person is at a high risk of the condition.''Ethnicity:'' It appears to be more prevalent in Caucasians.''Genetics and family history: ''Individuals who have a family member who has macular problems are at risk of macular degeneration. Certain genetic changes are known to put you at risk of macular problems.''Smoking'': ''Smoking'' increases the risk of macular damage. ''Smokers'' have a rapid progression to blindness and have poorer treatment response. This is because the ''nicotine'' in cigarettes is toxic to the eye cells.''Alcohol'' use:'' More than three ''drinks'' per day is associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration.''Cardiovascular disease'': ''A history of a ''stroke'' or ''heart disease'' may put you at an increased risk of wet macular degeneration. Individuals with ''diabetes'' also have an increased risk of wet macular degeneration.''Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS''):'' Patients with ''AIDS'' have been reported to have a 1.75-fold increase in the incidence of macular degeneration.''Chronic myeloproliferative diseases:'' Patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases (diseases of the blood and bone marrow) have an increased risk of macular degeneration. These include:''Medications:'' ''Aspirin'' and certain ''drugs'' used in ''heart'' conditions (''nitroglycerin'' and ''beta-blockers'') may put you at a high risk of macular disease, although this claim needs further studies for validation.' Essential thrombocythemia (below normal platelets, causing a tendency to bleed) Polycythemia vera (abnormally high red blood cells)  Myelofibrosis (scarring of the bone marrow causing low blood cell production in the bone marrow)"
Do intraocular drugs have any side effects?,"'Drugs injected in the eye have certain side effects. However, it must be remembered that in most cases, the benefits outweigh the risks.' Eye pain and bleeding into the eye Retinal detachment (separation of the retinal membrane from the blood vessels of the eye) Increased floaters (moving spots in the vision) Eye infection Increased eye pressure that can adversely harm the optic nerve Endophthalmitis (a serious condition that can cause severe eye swelling and blindness if not treated) Increased risk of stroke and blood clots"
What is acne? ,"'We all love surprises, but not all surprises are pleasant. One such surprise being acne or ''pimple'' that may appear like an uninvited guest on our face. Often, this may happen right before an important event, such as a function or a presentation. Acne is one of the commonest ''skin conditions'' affecting almost everyone at some point in their life. It results when the tiny hair follicles present on the skin get blocked by oil or dead skin cells. They are not just a cosmetic concern, but they also make the skin painful and inflamed. Acne can appear anywhere on the body including the back, shoulders, and chest; however, they most often occur on the face. Acne usually affects teenagers but can even occur in people aged 40-50 years. Acne may resolve on its own, but in many cases when not treated properly, it can flare-up, get infected, and even cause marks on the skin.''Acne may manifest in several forms, namely:' Comedones: They are also called blackheads or whiteheads. They appear as small bumps that may be yellowish (whiteheads) or black (blackheads) caused by clogging of the hair follicle. Papules: They appear as small, inflamed bumps that appear red and are painful to touch. Pustules: They are also called pimples. They are small, red, and tender bumps that are filled with pus. Cysts: They are deeper and larger forms of pimples and appear as lumps that are filled with pus. Nodules: They appear as big and hard bumps that may be painful to touch."
What causes acne?,"'The skin bears several tiny tunnel-like structures at the bottom of which the hair grows. These tiny pores in the skin are called hair follicles. Acne occurs when these tiny hair follicles present on the skin get blocked by oil or dead skin cells. The hair follicles are connected to tiny glands called sebaceous glands. These glands produce the oily substance called sebum, which lubricates the hair. Acne results when excess oil production by the sebaceous glands clogs the hair follicles. This may be followed by infection of the follicles by bacteria present on the skin leading to the formation of various acne lesions, such as pustules.''Some conditions may predispose a person to get acne. These include:' Excess testosterone hormone production particularly during puberty. Hormonal changes in women, such as during periods and pregnancy, may also cause acne flare-ups. Medical conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome or PCOS Genetic vulnerability in some people can cause familial acne Certain medications, such as steroids and Lithium Smoking may cause acne flare-ups Certain cosmetics Diet rich in processed foods, such as chips, pastries, and fries"
What age is a child considered a toddler?,"'A child between one to three years of age is considered a toddler. This is the time that your child is progressing from being an infant to being able to attend a preschool. You will observe drastic changes in the social, emotional, motor and communication skills of your child.' "
What are the developments to look for in a toddler?,"'As the days go by, you will notice many changes in your toddler. Toddlers become more aware of themselves and their surroundings. You need to keep observing and monitoring your child’s progress daily.\xa0''Look for the following developments in your toddler and act accordingly.' Your toddler will try to be continuously mobile, doing some things or the other; exploring things and people; running; going from room to another and writing on the walls will be a routine for several months. The toddler’s attention span becomes shorter than before. They will be doing something and will then turn toward something else that grabs their attention in no time. You will see improvements in their running process over time. They will start running smoothly and in a coordinated way unlike how they started out.  Toddlers will learn to judge the safety of places while they walk. They can walk backward. They can avoid sharp corners. But you will have to keep an eye on them until you are sure they can do things on their own. Toddlers can choose from the many activities that they like. Give them a different activity to do at various times. See what they like and what they do not like. You do not have to force them into doing something that they are the least interested in. Send your child to play outside in the open in gardens, parks or yards. Try to take time out of your schedule to go with them or let the nanny accompany them. At home, there are hurdles such as furniture that can hurt them while they run. See which place works better for you. Your toddler will like to do things by themselves without anyone’s help. Let them do so while supervising them. Toddlers observe other people and try to imitate them. Make sure they are not imitating something that is dangerous. Explain to them in words and with gestures that what they are doing is not right.  Look for signs of social interaction at this age. Do they point to objects or look toward objects that you point out? Do they like being cuddled by you? Do they maintain eye contact while talking? Do they smile? Do they turn towards you when called? Absence of these actions may point to autism."
How do you toilet train a toddler?,"'Toilet training is teaching the child how to control their bowel and bladder until they reach the bathroom/toilet to release the urge.\xa0''There is no specific method to train a toddler to go to the toilet and make them urinate or poop on their own. The various methods of toilet training for a toddler usually work by trial and error technique. Remember, what works for one toddler may not work for another. It may happen that you chose a particular method initially which does not work and then you switch to another.\xa0''A few of the methods that can be used to toilet train a toddler include''Instead of using a single method, you can use several combinations of these methods to toilet train your child. Do not rush the process. Remember that each child is unique. It is normal for your child to take time to learn it and then do it on their own. Gradually, you will understand and accept your child’s unique habits and qualities and learn ways to adjust to their specific behaviors.''It is always wise to consult a childcare specialist with any of your concerns regarding your child’s developmental milestones.' Asking the child every few hours about whether they need to go (to the toilet/bathroom) Rewarding the child with some gifts for the act of going to the toilet Taking dedicated time from your schedule especially for toilet training your child Reading a book about potty training and talking it over with your child Demonstrating toilet use for your child (the child can imitate you)"
What causes blood oxygen levels to become low?,'Blood oxygen levels can get low due to any of the problems that include:' Low air oxygen levels: Atmospheric oxygen becomes extremely low at high altitudes such as mountainous regions. Decreased capacity of the body to take in oxygen: This can be caused by lung conditions that include:AsthmaEmphysema (damage of the air sacs in the lung)BronchitisPneumoniaPneumothorax (leaking of air in the space between the lung and chest wall)Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)Pulmonary edema (the lung swells due to build-up of fluid)Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs)Interstitial lung disease (a large group of lung disorders that generally cause progressive scarring of the lungs)Viral infections such as COVID-19 Asthma Emphysema (damage of the air sacs in the lung) Bronchitis Pneumonia Pneumothorax (leaking of air in the space between the lung and chest wall) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Pulmonary edema (the lung swells due to build-up of fluid) Pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs) Interstitial lung disease (a large group of lung disorders that generally cause progressive scarring of the lungs) Viral infections such as COVID-19 Other conditions include:AnemiaSleep apnea (temporary cessation of breathing during sleep)Smoking Anemia Sleep apnea (temporary cessation of breathing during sleep) Smoking Decreased capacity of the heart to supply the oxygenated blood back to the lungs: The most common causes are congenital heart diseases (heart defects present by birth).
How are blood oxygen levels checked using the ABG test?,"'Blood oxygen levels can be checked by withdrawing blood from your artery present in the wrist, elbow, or groin. You may feel a sharp ''pain'' when the needle enters the artery. The blood will be put in an ABG machine (blood gas analyzer) that provides your blood oxygen levels in the form of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).' "
How are blood oxygen levels checked using a pulse oximeter?,"'A pulse oximeter is a small, mobile, and handy medical device. It is most commonly used when doctors want to know your blood oxygen levels quickly. It is also used to monitor the response of your body to certain medications or supplemental oxygen. Blood oxygen levels are indicated as SpO2, which is the percent saturation of oxygen in the blood.''The test that measures blood oxygen levels using a pulse oximeter is known as pulse ''oximetry''. The procedure is very simple and requires only clipping the pulse oximeter in between any of the fingers for a few seconds. The reading appears on the pulse oximeter screen. This test may be slightly less accurate than ABG but is easier to perform than ABG tests when needed quickly.' The brain gets affected when the SpO2 level falls below 80-85%. Cyanosis develops when the SpO2 level drops below 65%. The normal oxygen levels in a pulse oximeter usually range from 95% to 100%.  Note: Normal levels may vary if you have lung disorders. Your doctor can tell what levels are normal for you."
What are the signs and symptoms of hypoxemia?,"'Hypoxemia can give rise to many signs and symptoms depending on its severity. These signs and symptoms include:''Not having enough blood oxygen levels results in inadequate oxygen supply to the organs and tissues of the body. Severe hypoxemia can become dangerous. If left untreated for a long time, it can end up affecting the brain or heart.' Headache (mild to severe) Shortness of breath Dizziness Coughing Wheezing (breathing with a whistling or rattling sound in the chest) Confusion Rapid heartbeat Cyanosis (bluish color in the skin, fingernails, and lips)"
How is hypoxemia treated?,"'Treating hypoxemia involves measures that increase the levels of oxygen in the blood. This is achieved by' Treating underlying conditions: Treating the cause of hypoxemia is the most important part of the therapy that gives long-lasting effects. Many times, medications are given through an inhaler that quickly enables you to breathe the medicine into your lungs. Oxygen therapy: You are given supplemental oxygen through an oxygen cylinder (which can be portable). The pressure of delivered oxygen can be controlled."
How can you prevent hypoxemia?,"'You can maintain your normal blood oxygen levels after you recover from hypoxemia.''Here are a few lifestyle steps you can take to help prevent hypoxemia:' Deep breathing exercises Mild exercise such as walking or as advised by your doctor Yoga Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet Drink water adequately Quit smoking"
Gaslighting examples,"'10 examples of gaslighting:' Telling lies: They tell blatant lies because they are setting up a precedent, and the victim is not sure if what they say is true, keeping them off balance. Denying they ever said or did something, despite having proof: They outright deny everything when questioned, which makes the victim question themselves and the facts/proof they have. The victim eventually accepts what they are being told. Projection: They often blame others to defend themselves for their mistakes. For example, if they are alcoholics or cheaters, they blame the victim for it and make the victim feel guilty and responsible for something that is not their fault. Turning people against the victim: Gaslighters are manipulative and they keep the people who will always agree with them close and use these people against the victim. They tell the victim that these people also think the same way about the victim, though it’s usually a lie. The victim usually is not sure about who to trust and often tends to believe the gaslighter because they are great liars. Telling the victim that they are crazy: The gaslighter tells the victim they are crazy and others also think the same about them. This makes the victim question reality and their sanity. It can be so bad that it actually drives the victim crazy. Using what is important to the victim against them: They identify what is important to the victim and use that against them. Most often, an individual’s identity is most important to them, so it may be one of the first things they attack. They may tell the victim that they would only be of worth if they didn't have so many negative traits and attack the foundation of the person. They start wearing people down: This usually happens gradually over time as the gaslighting worsens. Even the smartest person may be susceptible to it. Actions don’t match their words: They are all talk. Their actions don’t match their words and often make false promises. They confuse the victim with occasional positive reinforcements: They suddenly praise or compliment the victim. This confuses the victim and weakens them. This is often seen in abusive relationships. When the abusive partner praises the victim occasionally, it confuses them, makes them think the relationship is not so bad and makes them continue the relationship. Telling the victim everyone else is a liar: They convince the victim that everyone is a liar like their friends and family. This makes the victim lose confidence and enables the gaslighter to have complete control over the victim."
What is testicular cancer?,"'Testicular cancer'' arises from the testes (a part of the male reproductive system). The testicles are responsible for the production of male sex hormones and sperm for reproduction. They are located within the scrotum, a loose bag of skin below the penis. Testicular ''cancer'' is the most common type of ''cancer'' occurring in males in the US between the ages of 15 and 35.''Testicular ''cancer'' can be aggressive and grow and spread rapidly. However, this cancer is highly treatable even after it spreads. Hence, the prognosis for men with testicular cancer is good. Studies have shown that the risk of dying from testicular cancer is about\xa01 in 5,000.' "
How is testicular cancer treated?,"'The treatment may involve one or a combination of multiple treatment modalities, which depends on the extent of the disease.''The treatment options include' SurgeryOrchiectomy: Removal of the testicle. A prosthetic can be placed in the sac.Testes-sparing surgery: The tumor is carefully removed and the healthy part of the testis is left behind. This is ideal for patients with small tumors or benign/noncancerous tumors. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: Surgical removal of the lymph nodes to which cancer commonly spreads.  Orchiectomy: Removal of the testicle. A prosthetic can be placed in the sac. Testes-sparing surgery: The tumor is carefully removed and the healthy part of the testis is left behind. This is ideal for patients with small tumors or benign/noncancerous tumors.  Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: Surgical removal of the lymph nodes to which cancer commonly spreads.  Radiation therapy: This targets and kills cancer cells and shrinks tumors using radiation.  Chemotherapy: The tumor cells are killed with cancer medication.  Targeted therapy: This treatment uses medications that target tumor-specific proteins that the cancer cells display. This is the most specific therapy for cancer and known for minimal side effects. Stem cell therapy may be a treatment option in some cases. However, stem cell therapy is still in the experimental stages in most countries."
What causes testicular cancer?,"'The exact cause of testicular cancer is unknown. Some factors increase the risk of testicular cancer, including\xa0' Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) are a risk factor for the development of testicular cancer. Surgical correction of undescended testes before puberty reduces the risk of testicular cancer.  Age: Testicular cancer usually occurs in males between the agesof 20 to 35. Race: Testicular cancer is more common in Caucasian men than in those of other races. Genetic conditions like Klinefelter syndrome cause abnormal development of the testes. Family history of cancer. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection."
What are the warning signs of testicular cancer?,"'The initial signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include' A painless lump in the testicle. Dull aching in the scrotum or the groin. Varicocele (swollen blood vessels) appearing as enlarged, dark blue veins. Hydrocele (fluid around the testicle) causing swelling. Twisting of the testicle (torsion) may be the presenting symptom. On further investigation, the mass may be discovered. The affected testicle feels firmer and harder than the other.  Formation of blood clots in blood vessels which can reach the lungs causing chest pain and breathlessness. Back pain.  Infection of the testicle can occur causing pain."
What are the types of testicular cancer?,"'Most testicular ''cancers'' are germ cell (cells that produce sperm) tumors. There are two main types of testicular cancer, seminomas and nonseminomas.' Seminomas grow and spread slowly. There are two subtypesClassical seminoma: This is the most common type and it usually occurs in men between the ages of 25 to 45.Spermatocytic seminoma: This commonly occurs in older men and it usually does not spread. Classical seminoma: This is the most common type and it usually occurs in men between the ages of 25 to 45. Spermatocytic seminoma: This commonly occurs in older men and it usually does not spread. Nonseminomas grow and spread more quickly. They usually consist of multiple types of cancer cells, including Embryonal carcinoma: This cancer contains cells that look like embryonic cells under a microscope. Yolk sac carcinoma: This cancer contains cells that look like the sac that surrounds an embryo. This cancer usually occurs in children. Choriocarcinoma: This cancer is usually rare and spreads to the rest of the body quickly. Teratoma: This is a rare tumor that contains other tissues and organs, including teeth and hair."
How is testicular cancer diagnosed?," Self-examination can help in early diagnosis and treatment. The affected testis is enlarged, firm and usually painless.  The physician orders testicular sonography and Doppler ultrasound to reveal the tumor. The physician performs a complete physical assessment. A testicular biopsy confirms the diagnosis. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves obtaining a small sample of the testicle. Testicular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal the extent of the tumor. Lymphangiography may be performed to assess the local spread of the tumor to the lymph nodes of the groin."
What is a flexor tendon?,"'A tendon is a tissue that connects the muscles to bone. Flexor tendons on the palm side of the fingers help in bending the fingers.''Tendons and muscles of the forearm, wrist, and hand control the movement in the hand and fingers. When muscles tighten, tendons pull on the bones, resulting in the movement of fingers. The tendons on the top of the fingers (extensor tendons) straighten the fingers.''Surrounding the flexor tendon is the tendon sheath, a membranous layer that helps to keep the tendon in place.' "
What is a flexor tendon laceration?,"'A flexor tendon laceration is a deep cut on the palm side of the fingers, hand, wrist, or forearm that can injure the flexor tendon.''Flexor tendon lacerations make it impossible to bend joints in a finger. Because the flexor tendons are close to the surface of the skin, a deep cut on the skin can affect the flexor tendon.\xa0''If the tendon is torn, the ends of the tendon will rip, leading to insufficient healing of the tendon. Sometimes, a nerve close to the tendon may be damaged, causing numbness on one or both sides of the fingers.' "
What are the symptoms of a flexor tendon laceration?,"'A flexor tendon laceration causes sudden ''pain'' and immobility of the fingers. Other common signs include' open wound on the hand, inability to bend or straighten a joint or finger, pain while bending the finger, numbness of the finger and tenderness of the finger."
Who is likely to get a flexor tendon laceration?,"'Flexor tendon lacerations can occur to anyone who sustains a deep cut to the hand, wrist, or arm. Diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' weakens the tendon, making it vulnerable to a sudden rupture. Additionally, athletes are at a high risk of flexor tendon injury.' "
How are flexor tendon lacerations diagnosed?,"'The physician physically examines for any ''cuts'', swelling, ''bruising'', and flexibility of fingers. An X-ray can be useful to identify any damage to the bone.' "
What are the treatments for a flexor tendon laceration?,"'A flexor tendon laceration can be managed by surgical and non-surgical therapy.''Partially torn tendons can be treated with nonsurgical treatments. Non-surgical management can only be done if less than 60% tendon is involved. Non-surgical treatment options include''These are not definitive treatments. Physicians might order surgical therapy if the injury is restricting the blood flow to the hand or finger.''As tendons tear in different ways—such as straight across, at an angle, or pulled right off of the bone—there are various methods to repair the flexor tendon injury. These surgical methods involve special ''stitches'' or ''sutures''.''Tendon injuries can lead to scarring and ''stiffness'' after the surgery. It can take up to two months for the hand to heal completely after the repair. It may take another month or so before the hands can be used in full force.''Specific exercises and physical therapy will restore the function and movement of the hands.' using a splint, applying ice packs on the affected area and anti-inflammatory and pain relievers, such as ibuprofen."
What are the symptoms of hypertension?,"'Most people with ''high blood pressure'' have no signs or symptoms, even if ''blood pressure'' readings reach dangerously high levels.''In some patients, the following symptoms may be seen''Apart from the common symptoms above, below are a few rare symptoms' Severe headaches Fatigue   Confusion Dizziness Sweating Chest pain Vision problems Nosebleed Nausea and vomiting Difficulty breathing Irregular heartbeat Blood in the urine Facial flushing Blood spots in eyes"
What is hypertension?,"'Hypertension'' is the condition in which the blood pressure is high enough to eventually cause health problems. ''High blood pressure'' results from the tightening of very small arteries called arterioles. Arterioles regulate the blood flow throughout the body. As these arterioles tighten, the ''heart'' has to work harder to pump blood through the smaller space and the pressure inside the vessels grows. ''Hypertension'' is known as ""the silent killer” due to the absence of symptoms in many. Untreated ''high blood pressure'' increases the risk for ''heart attack'', ''kidney failure'' and ''stroke''.' "
What are the different types of hypertension?,"'There are two types of ''hypertension'' which include''Primary hypertension or essential hypertension:'' There is no known cause for this type of ''high blood pressure''. This is the most common type of hypertension. This type of blood pressure usually takes many years to develop. It is probably a result of lifestyle, environment and how a body changes with age.''Secondary hypertension: ''This is when a health problem or medicine is causing high blood pressure. Things that can cause secondary hypertension include' Kidney problems Sleep apnea Thyroid or adrenal gland problems Some side effects of medicines"
When is blood pressure considered high?, Healthy blood pressure < (less than) 120/80 mm Hg Pre-hypertension is 120/80 mm Hg to 139/89 mm Hg Hypertension > (greater than) 140/90 mm Hg Blood pressure readings above 180 /120 are dangerously high and require immediate medical attention.
What are the common causes of high blood pressure?,'High blood pressure may be caused by several factors which include' Age Family history of high blood pressure Being of Afro-Caribbean or South Asian origin High-fat diet High amount of salt in the diet Lack of exercise Being overweight Smoking Excessive alcohol consumption Stress Pre-existing health conditions
How is high blood pressure treated?,"'The goal of treatment is to reduce blood pressure so that a patient may have a lower risk of health problems caused by high blood pressure.\xa0''If blood pressure is between 120/80 and 130/80 mm Hg, the doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to bring blood pressure down to a normal range. Medicines are rarely used at this stage.''Stage 1 hypertension: ''Systolic (upper) reading is between 140 to 159 mm Hg and diastolic (lower) reading is between 90 to 99 mm Hg. The management includes lifestyle changes with a single hypertensive drug.''Stage 2 hypertension:'' If blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg or higher, the doctor may start the patient on combination medication of at least two medicines with strict lifestyle changes.' Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also called ACE inhibitors): These work via controlling a kidney-mediated blood pressure process. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (also called ARBs): They work in about the same way as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Diuretics: They simply increase the fluid and salt removal via the kidneys and reduce blood pressure. Beta-blockers: These drugs reduce the workload of the heart. Calcium channel blockers relax blood vessels by reducing calcium entering into cells. Alpha-blockers: These help relax blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure. Centrally acting drugs signal the brain and nervous system to relax the blood vessels. Vasodilators signal the muscles in the walls of blood vessels to relax. Renin inhibitors, a newer type of medicine for treating high blood pressure, act by reducing the amount of certain chemicals in the kidneys, thereby relaxing blood vessels."
What are common side effects of blood pressure medications?,"'Some common side effects of high blood pressure medicines include' Cough Dizziness or lightheadedness Erection problems Feeling tired, weak, drowsy or a lack of energy Headache Nausea or vomiting Skin rash Weight loss or gain without trying"
Humidifier uses,"'Humidifiers are a part of many households during the winter or ''flu'' season when the air is dry. It’s recommended to keep the humidity between 30 and 50% to create a well-balanced environment. Humidity above 60% may invite ''fungal infections'' in the house. There are many different versions of humidifiers, but they all add moisture to\xa0the air. The moisture in turn increases the level of humidity in the living space, which\xa0helps alleviate the ''common cold''–weather\xa0conditions.\xa0Below are a few common benefits of humidifiers:' Skin: During the winter, the air tends to be cold and crisp; we may develop chapped lips and flaky skin. However, with a humidifier in hand, one can get through winter without feeling moisture-deprived. Snoring: If a person breathes through the mouth while sleeping, they are likely going to be waking up feeling dry. Run a humidifier during the night to help soothe the throat and nose from dryness. It will help an individual to sleep more comfortably while also minimizing snoring. Additionally, running the humidifier during the day as well helps your throat to stay moist. Beneficial to the home: If a home has wooden floors or furniture, keeping the humidity balanced can help the wood to last longer. Furthermore, houseplants will benefit from a little extra moisture in the air. Prevents static: Ever noticed how frizzy hair can get during the winter or static electricity is noticed when removing the sheet from the bed? Dry conditions in your home can cause this. Static electricity isn’t just annoying; it can also be dangerous if it builds up because it can damage certain electronics. Higher humidity can help to prevent or lessen static. Prevents spreading of airborne viruses: In recent studies, it was shown that airborne viruses were least likely to spread when the humidity was at least 43%. The study showed that nearly 85% of viruses were virtually ineffective in more humid conditions. Moisture can prevent the movement of germs because they drop to the nearest surface when combined with moisture. As a result, it’s more difficult for germs to spread through the air. Breathing problems: Humidifiers are also useful when an individual is suffering from breathing issues. They help reduce inflammation in the sinuses and loosen up any mucus that may have formed. Breathing in warm, humid air can help loosen up pockets of mucus left in the lungs and sinus passages, making illness pass quicker. Arthritis: Arthritis is caused most often due to swelling and inflammation of the joints. This is most often due to the wearing down of the cartilage that protects the ends of your bones. Patients who suffer from arthritis oftentimes report flare-ups during the colder, drier months due to low temperatures and lack of humidity in the air. A humidifier can help these symptoms by putting moisture back into the air, which has been tied with reducing overall inflammation felt like a symptom of the condition. Warming properties of humidifiers can also help cut down on the discomfort caused by cold air leaking into your room or home, making the symptoms of arthritis less painful. There is no real cure to arthritis as of now. One has to just work around it by managing the pain.  Calms allergies: Itchy eyes, sneezing, runny noses, and irritated skin are just some of the daily struggles with which allergy sufferers must deal. In severe cases, allergies can adversely affect one’s productivity and result in taking days off work that could otherwise be avoided. A humidifier for allergies can help to limit the discomfort caused by allergic reactions. The vapor released by a humidifier hydrates the nose and throat, thinning out mucus and allowing the little hair in the nose to move freely and easily. This helps nasal passages to trap bacteria, dust, and other allergy-causing particles before they enter your respiratory system, thereby helping to prevent swelling and reduce instances of allergies flaring up. Furthermore, in a dry environment, pollen, dust, and other allergens more easily become airborne. Moderate relative humidity levels of around 40% enable moisture to condense upon the particles, weighing them down so that they fall out of the air and are less likely to be inhaled."
What is a muscle biopsy?,"'A biopsy is an examination of tissue removed from a living body to discover the presence, cause, or extent of a disease. A biopsy of skeletal muscle tissue (muscle biopsy) is a diagnostic procedure used in the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases and patients with suspected myopathy.\xa0''A muscle biopsy is also sometimes indicated for diagnosing various systemic disorders that also present with skeletal muscle tissue pathology. The surgical procedure to obtain a muscle biopsy is relatively simple and poses little risk to the patient.' "
Why is a muscle biopsy performed?,"'When a clinical diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder is considered, a muscle biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis. It also helps diagnose other systemic disorders that affect the muscles.' "
What are the clinical features of neuromuscular disorders?,"'Neuromuscular disorders affect the nerves, muscles, or neuromuscular functioning.\xa0Some examples of neuromuscular disorders are''Skeletal muscles are mostly affected. Skeletal muscles are muscles that are connected to the skeletons (bones), forming the mechanical system of the body that helps in movement and voluntary actions.\xa0''Risk factors for neuromuscular disorders could be genetic, vitamin B12 deficiency, heavy metal/chemical poisoning, or autoimmune (when the body’s immune system attacks its own cells). Besides muscle biopsy, other diagnostic tests such as electromyography, genetic testing, and blood and radiological tests may be performed.''Patients with neuromuscular disorders present the following signs and symptoms:' Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, etc. Muscle pain Spasms Paresis (muscle weakness) Rigidity Paralysis Involuntary movements (tremors, tightness in muscles, and uncontrollable tics) Muscle wasting Inability to extend the joints Night sweats Decreased lung function affecting breathing Difficulty swallowing"
How is a muscle biopsy performed?,"'The procedure is usually performed with local anesthesia. General anesthesia may be used in children or anxious and uncooperative adult patients. A biopsy of a clinically involved muscle is important.\xa0''Different disorders affect different groups of muscles with varying severity. Some disorders may have a patchy distribution rather than being diffusely distributed in the affected muscles. Hence, it occasionally happens that even if an affected muscle is biopsied, the biopsy might not sample the pathology.''The selection of a muscle to be biopsied is based on the provisional diagnosis based on the history and clinical assessment by the doctor. For example, if ''polymyositis'' is suspected, a proximal muscle that is likely involved in the condition may be the best choice for a biopsy.''When possible, a biopsy is usually performed on a mildly symptomatic muscle, but not on the one that is too weak or wasted because this may result in obtaining a sample of an end-stage muscle.\xa0''In an end-stage muscle, the loss of myofibers is severe, hence does not help in diagnosis of pathology. The biopsy sample is then sent to the pathologist for evaluation.' "
What are the complications of a muscle biopsy?,'The surgical procedure to obtain a muscle biopsy is relatively simple and poses little to no risk to the patient.''Uncommon complications are:' infection and a possibility of infection after the procedure.
What is postnasal drip?,"'The inner lining of your nose and throat has several small glands that secrete a sticky fluid called ''mucus''. This mucus moistens the inside of the nose and sinuses (air-filled ''cavities'' present in the skull), traps inhaled dust and other particles, helps guard against infections and moistens the air and makes it more comfortable to breathe. You subsequently swallow the mucus produced throughout the day without even realizing it. Postnasal drips refer to the feeling of mucus collecting or dripping inside the throat from the back of your nose (postnasally). This may occur when there is excess mucus formation, when the mucus becomes too thick or when the normal flow of mucus is blocked or hindered.\xa0''Postnasal drip'' may cause various symptoms that include' Feeling that something is dripping or collecting in the throat Need to frequently clear the throat Cough that may get worse at night Feeling as if there is a lump in the throat Frequent swallowing Hoarse or gurgling speech Fever and pain may occur if infection occurs"
What causes postnasal drip?,"'Postnasal drip may be caused by several factors that may lead to excess mucus formation, making mucus too thick or blocking the normal flow of mucus. These include' Viral or bacterial infections including colds, flu and sinusitis (sinus infections) Various allergies  Non-allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (expansion or dilation of the blood vessels inside the nose) Foreign body or object stuck inside the nose  Medications such as birth control pills and antihypertensives (medications to treat high blood pressure) Certain foods or spices Cold temperatures  Pregnancy Problems in the structure of the nose, such as deviated nasal septum (the partition between the left and right side of the nose) or nasal polyps (small growths of tissue inside the nose) Gastroesophageal reflux (reflux of acidic contents of the stomach into the esophagus) Environmental fumes, dust, pollutants and other chemicals"

What is internal fixation?,"'Internal fixation involves setting and stabilizing the fractured bones by cutting open the skin. The bones are realigned to their normal position. Internal fixation uses special implants such as plates, screws, nails, and wires, which hold together the corrected bones.''The advantages of internal fixation are as follows:''The implants are usually made of stainless steel, titanium, cobalt, or chrome, which are sturdy and strong. Implants are generally compatible with the body and hardly cause any ''allergic'' reactions.' Shorter hospital stay Allows the patients to return to the function earlier Reduces the chances of improper healing Prevents the healing of bone in the improper position"
What are the general principles of internal fixation?,'The general principles of internal fixation are as follows:''Stable fixation involves fixation that prevents the movement of the fractured fragments.''Compression on the ''fractured bone'' produces friction that prevents the displacement of the fractured fragments and holds it in place. Compression also helps in maintaining a close contact between the fragment surfaces.''The general purposes of implants are' Realignment of the bone fracture to the normal alignment Preservation of the blood supply Stable internal fixation Faster healing for pain-free mobilization of the joints and muscle Minimized risk of complications Full restoration of function To provide short-term support To maintain alignment during fracture healing To allow for rehabilitation
What are the different implants used during internal fixation?,"'The different implants used for internal fixation include the following:' Plates: Internal splints used to hold the broken bone, they are fixed to the bone with screws. They may be left in place for healing or may be removed in selective cases. Screws: Most commonly used for internal fixation, they are available in different designs and sizes for the bones of different sizes. They can be used alone or with plates, rods, or nails. They may be left inside for healing or removed. Rods or nails: For certain fractures of the thighbones or shinbones, rods are inserted through the hollow center of the bone. Screws at the end of the rod prevent the fracture from rotating and keep the rods in place. Wires or pins: Fractures that are too small to fix by screws usually require wires to pin them to the bone. They generally treat small fractures of the hands or foot if used alone. Wires can be used in conjunction with other implants."
What are the complications of internal fixation?,"'The complications of internal fixation are' infection, implant failure, refracture and nonunion (arrest in the fracture repair process)."
What is the function of endocrine glands?,"'Endocrine glands are organs that are specialized in regulating various functions of your body. These functions include growth and development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction and mood.''Normally, your body has eight major endocrine glands, each serving a different set of functions. Most of the time, these endocrine glands work in coordination with each other and their processes are interdependent. Hormones secreted by an endocrine gland influence the functioning of the various organs and other endocrine glands in the body. Endocrine disorders occur when an organ or a gland fails to respond to the hormones secreted by another endocrine gland or when the body does not react to the hormones in the way it should.' "
What are the symptoms of endocrine disorders?,"'Each endocrine disorder has its own set of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms depend upon what type of hormone the endocrine gland secretes and the body functions that the hormone regulates. However, ''fatigue'' and ''weakness'' are common symptoms found in many endocrine disorders. Other symptoms may include weight changes, blood glucose level fluctuations, abnormal ''cholesterol levels'', ''mood changes'', etc.' "
What are some common endocrine disorders?,"'If your hormone levels are too high or too low, you may have an endocrine disorder, commonly known as a hormone disorder.\xa0''Diabetes'' is the most common disorder in the United States. It happens either when the body cells become less sensitive to the ''insulin'' hormone or insulin is secreted in less quantity by your pancreas. This causes your blood ''sugar'' levels to increase. Uncontrolled blood ''sugar'' levels affect multiple organs over the course of time.\xa0\xa0''Other common endocrine disorders are as follows' Hyperthyroidism: Your thyroid gland becomes overactive and secretes more hormone (T3 and/or T4). This causes rapid weight loss, heart problems, anxiety and many other symptoms. Hypothyroidism: This is commonly referred to as an underactive thyroid in which your thyroid gland produces less hormones. This leads to complaints such as unintentional weight gain, constipation, dry skin, fatigue and so on. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are usually high in hypothyroidism.  Polycystic ovary syndrome: The principle function of your ovaries, which is ovulation (releasing eggs for conception), is disturbed. This leads to a myriad of problems such as missed periods, abnormal growth of hair in areas such as upper lips and infertility among many others. Acromegaly: The pituitary gland makes an excess of growth hormones, which makes your bones grow bigger and makes your hands and feet look huge compared to the rest of your body. Adrenal insufficiency: Your adrenal glands secrete low amounts of the hormone known as cortisol, making you unable to deal with stress. You may start experiencing fatigue, weakness and weight loss gradually over time. Cushing's disease: The adrenal glands secrete excess cortisol and make your face puffy and round resembling the moon (moon face). Hypopituitarism: Your pituitary gland fails to produce one or more of its hormones or makes less of them. This disturbs the functioning of your adrenal and thyroid glands along with organs such as the ovaries and testes. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN): This is a group of disorders that tends to run in families. It causes tumors in several endocrine glands. Precocious puberty: When glands that control reproduction don’t work properly, some children start puberty abnormally early, around eight in girls and nine in boys."
What causes endocrine disorders?,'Endocrine disorders are usually diagnosed after matching your signs and symptoms with your blood tests that include hormone levels. There may be either an increase or a decrease in the hormones with an endocrine disorder.\xa0''The endocrine system works on the principle of a feedback system known as the endocrine feedback system. This feedback system involves balancing the levels of various hormones by decreasing or increasing the levels of certain hormones. The cause of endocrine disorders is usually a disturbance in this feedback system.\xa0''Other causes of endocrine disorders include the following' A genetic disorder (multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] or congenital hypothyroidism) Idiopathic (cause unknown) Infections Poor lifestyle habits Injury to the endocrine gland Tumor of the endocrine gland Major stress Changes in the blood’s fluids Electrolyte imbalance Pregnancy can trigger some endocrine disorders (thyroid and diabetes)
What is an eye infection?,"'An eye infection is a condition in which ''viruses'', bacteria or other microbial agents may attack the eye. This can cause ''itching'' around the eyes or the eyes may turn pink. The infection can affect the following parts of the eye' Eyelid Cornea: A clear surface that covers outside of the iris. Conjunctiva: A thin, moist area that covers the inside of the eyelids and outer part of the eye."
What are some common eye infections?,"'Some common eye infections include the following' Conjunctivitis: Commonly known as “pink eye,” this is an infection of the conjunctiva. Besides bacteria or viruses, this can also be due to an allergic reaction or irritants. It can make the eye look pink or reddish. Keratitis: It is an inflammation of the cornea that can be caused due to bacteria, viruses or parasites in the water. It is more common in people using contact lenses. Stye: It occurs as a painful, red bump under the eyelid or at the base of the eyelashes. The bacteria infect the oil glands in the eyelid or eyelashes to produce stye. Styes are not contagious and harmless. Fungal eye infections: Infections that occur due to fungal infections are rare but serious. Fungal infections usually occur after an eye injury or from using dirty lenses. Uveitis: It is the inflammation of the middle layer of the eye called the uvea. Viruses such as herpes or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause uveitis. Blepharitis: It is the inflammation of the base of the eyelashes caused by bacteria."

Other causes of taste disorders include' Upper respiratory and middle ear infections Poor oral hygiene and dental problems Radiation therapy for head and neck cancers Head injury Surgeries of the ear, nose or throat or extraction of wisdom teeth Exposure to certain insecticides and medications (antibiotics and antihistamines) Cigarette smoking"
How does your sense of taste work?,"'Taste cells or gustatory cells are scattered throughout the tongue. When you chew food or drink, some molecules from food are released that stimulate the taste cells. The taste cells then send messages to the brain and the brain can identify the taste. Receptors in the taste cells respond to one of the five basic taste qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami.''The sensations like the coolness of mint and the burning or irritation of chili pepper are not taste sensations. These are identified via separate chemosensory mechanisms.''Smell and taste are interrelated probably because when you smell the aroma of food, you can enjoy the taste of food. However, without smell, food tastes bland and has little flavor.''Aromas activate the sense of smell through a special channel which connects the roof of the throat to the nose.' "
How can taste disorders be diagnosed?,"'An otolaryngologist or an ENT doctor diagnoses taste disorders by' Measuring the lowest concentration of taste quality that you can recognize Asking you to compare the tastes of different foods Asking you to do the sip, spit and rinse test Applying chemicals directly to specific areas of the tongue Doing a physical examination of the ears, nose and throat Administering the scratch and sniff test"
How are taste disorders treated?,"'Treatment may include''Some tips that may help make food taste better include' Treating the underlying medical condition Stopping or changing medicines that contribute to the disorder Surgical removal of obstructions that may be causing the disorder Counseling Quitting smoking Preparing foods with a variety of foods and colors Using aromatic herbs and spices to make the dish more flavorful If your doctor permits, adding small amounts of cheese, bacon bits, olive oil or toasted nuts on vegetables to enhance flavor Avoiding combination dishes that may dilute individual flavors and taste"
What is a temporary abdominal closure done for?,"'A temporary abdominal closure (TAC) is performed when abdominal ''compartment syndrome'' (ACS) is the concern and the abdomen is left intentionally open during surgery. ACS is a condition that increases the pressure in the abdomen (intra-abdominal pressure or IAP), which adversely affects the organs by exerting pressure, producing toxins and causing fluid and ''electrolyte'' imbalance in the body. ACS may be observed in people who sustained an injury or a ''fracture'' in or around the abdomen and people with infections in the abdomen. If left untreated, ACS is uniformly fatal.''ACS is most often observed during the early postoperative period after surgery on the abdomen. ACS may develop in people with the following conditions:''The above-mentioned conditions may reduce blood flow to the abdominal organs. It causes the release of various chemicals in the body, leading to swelling and death of cells, manifesting as organ swelling and secondary pressure effects on the ''lungs'', heart, blood vessels, brain, and spinal cord. For the management of ACS, a defect or an opening is intentionally created in the abdominal wall during the surgery that exposes the abdominal organs. This is called an open abdomen.' Massive ascites (collection of fluid in the abdomen)/massive bleeding in the abdomen Ileus (loss of bowel movement) Hemorrhagic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas associated with bleeding)  Pregnancy Cancer of the ovaries Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rupture of an abnormally dilated aorta that is a large blood vessel carrying oxygenated blood from the heart) Abdominal burns Liver transplant Polytrauma (two or more severe injuries in at least two areas of the body)"
What are temporary abdominal closure techniques?,"'To prevent and manage abdominal ''compartment syndrome'' (ACS), once a decision has been made to leave the abdomen open (or reopen it), the abdominal defect must be covered. This is termed as temporary abdominal closure (TAC).''The techniques of TAC are varied, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. All of them face a similar challenge—management of the open abdomen.''The purpose of TAC is to''There are various techniques for TAC such as:' Allow abdominal organs to expand and thus prevent abdominal hypertension. Allow the patient to return to the critical care setting for further management. Allow the trauma team to assess the patient further and to define other potential life- or limb-threatening injuries. Control bleeding/blood clotting. Avoid further injury. Prevent fluid and protein loss from the body. Prevent heat loss from the body. Towel-clipping of skin edges: It is one of the simplest and fastest forms of TAC. Towel clips are placed 1 cm apart and 1 cm away from each side of the skin edge. As many as 30 towel clips may be required to close an incision. The incision may then be covered with an adherent plastic drape. Open packing of the abdomen: In this technique, the open abdomen is covered with a rayon cloth. Zipper closure: In this technique, a zipper is sewn on the surface of the abdomen with continuous sutures. Wittmann patch: It involves a Wittmann patch sheet sutured to the abdominal wall with a Velcro-like closure (one sheet with hooks and the other with loops). Synthetic mesh closure: Here, a mesh of synthetic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene–polyethylene mesh is used. Silastic (plastic bag) closure: Here, a sterilized soft 3-L plastic cystoscopy fluid irrigation bag is cut and shaped to cover the abdominal incision and exposed organs."
What is an abdominal washout procedure?,"'The abdominal washout procedure is a technique in which the inside of the abdomen (abdominal ''cavity'') is irrigated with a sterile solution (such as normal saline) to “clean” the abdominal ''cavity'', including the organs. Abdominal washouts help prevent infections that may develop in wounds following the surgery or severe trauma. These infections can prevent the ''wound'' from healing, leading to the spread of infections throughout the body.' "

You suffered from viral infections during your pregnancy. Your baby had a low birth weight."
What does blood type mean?,"'You must have heard about the terms “blood group” or “''blood type''.” If you ever have undergone surgery or been admitted to a hospital for medical conditions, your doctor might have examined your blood for various parameters, such as blood counts and blood type. Your blood contains various cells and the liquid portion is called the plasma. The ''red blood cells'' or RBCs present in the blood carry certain molecules, called antigens, on their surface that determine what blood group you have. The antigens depend on the genes you inherit from your parents. These antigens may be grouped in various categories to form a system for blood typing called the ABO system. Based on this classification, your blood group may be''The table below includes various ''blood types''.''Table 1. Blood Types' A: This type of blood group means the RBCs have the antigen called antigen A on their surface. Apart from the ABO antigens, there is another important antigen on the RBC surface called the Rh antigen. If a person with blood group A bears Rh antigen on their RBCs, the blood group is called A+ (A positive). Likewise, if the Rh antigen is absent the person will be A- (A negative). B: People with the B antigen on the RBC surface have blood group B. This can also be either blood group B+ or B- based upon the Rh antigen status. O: Blood group O means that both antigen A and B are absent from the RBC surface. Blood group O can be O- (O negative) or O+ (O positive) depending upon the absence or presence of the Rh antigen on the surface of the RBCs. AB: Some people may have both the antigens, A and B, on the surface of the RBCs. When both antigens are present, the blood group is called the AB blood type. This may also be AB- or AB+ depending on the absence or presence of the Rh antigen on the surface of the RBCs."
What are the 3 rarest blood types?,"'The blood types vary depending on the genetic ''makeup'' of an individual. Since there are differences in the distribution of genes in different parts of the world, the rarest and most common blood groups also vary in different populations across the globe. The rarest blood type in the United States is the AB- (AB negative) blood type, which is seen in just 0.6 percent of people followed by B- (found in 1.5 percent of the United States population) and AB+ (present in just 3.4 percent of people in the United States).''Table 2. The Various Blood Types and Their Prevalence in the United States''Prevalence in the United States (Percentage ''of the United States population)' "
What is the importance of blood type?,"'Your blood group varies depending on the tiny molecules called blood group antigens that are present on the surface of your red blood cells or RBCs. The antigens depend on the genes you inherit from your parents. These antigens also determine the presence of certain antibodies against blood group antigens in your blood. Thus, a person with blood group A will not have antibodies against the A antigen in their blood. Similarly, a person with AB type of blood will not have antibodies to both blood group antigens A and B. The presence of the antibodies is responsible for the ''blood transfusion'' reactions that occur when incompatible blood is transfused into a person. Your blood group determines the blood type you can receive and who you can donate your blood to.''Table 3. Blood Type Compatibility for Transfusion''It has also been observed that people who have certain blood types are prone to certain maladies. It has been observed that people with blood group A are most prone to throw clots and have ''heart disease''. <i>''H pylori''</i> infection is associated most with people who have O type blood. People with B type blood are most susceptible to ''TB'' and <i>E coli</i> infections. These associations are mostly due to a specific subset of the cell proteins present along with the blood group antigens.' "
What does iron deficiency mean?,"'Iron is an important substance that our body needs in minute amounts. Daily ingestion of iron is needed for the health of red blood cells and muscle proteins, as well as the functioning of body cells. The normal body iron content in an adult is approximately 3-4 grams. The majority of iron is present in circulating red blood cells (RBCs) with additional iron in myoglobin and certain enzymes, as well as iron in storage and transport forms.''Iron deficiency is the condition in which there is less iron available for use than needed.

What is congestive heart failure?,"'Congestive heart failure'' is a severe progressive condition that affects the pumping power of ''heart'' muscles. Because of decreased cardiac output, the organs get inadequate blood, oxygen, and nutrients. Congestive ''heart failure'' usually affects the ''lungs'', heart, and kidneys. A decrease in cardiac output causes kidneys to retain water and salt. Because of the increased water retention, other organs get congested, leading to increased pressure on the heart.\xa0' "
What causes congestive heart failure?,"'There are several conditions that can impair the pumping efficiency of the heart. Below are a few common and rare conditions that can cause congestive heart failure:' Coronary artery disease (CAD): This is the most common cause of congestive heart failure, as the arteries become blocked or severely narrowed, which decreases blood flow to the heart. High blood pressure (hypertension) Alcohol abuse Disorders of heart valves Thyroid abnormalities, viral infection, and heart rhythm abnormalities are a few rare cases that can cause congestive heart failure. "
What are the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure?,"'Difficulty ''breathing'' or ''shortness of breath'' are the most common and distinctive symptoms of congestive heart failure.\xa0' Difficulty breathing may occur when a patient is at rest, during an activity, while lying flat, or even while waking up.  Chest pain is another common symptom seen in patients with congestive heart failure. Due to water retention in the kidneys, patients will have a fluid overload in ankles, feet, stomach, and lungs, which is another key symptom seen in heart failure patients. "
What are the four stages of congestive heart failure?,"'The New York Heart Association developed the four stages of congestive heart failure depending on the functional capabilities of the heart.\xa0' Class I: Patients will have no problem while performing physical activity. Class II: Patients will have minor limitations of physical capacity due to a marked increase in physical activity. This leads to weakness, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, and chest pain, but they may be comfortable at rest. Class III: Patients with marked limitation of physical activity in which minimal ordinary activity results in weakness, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, and chest pain; however they are comfortable at rest. Class IV:  Patients cannot carry on any physical activity without discomfort and have symptoms of heart failure or chest pain, even at rest."
How is congestive heart failure diagnosed?,"'Congestive heart failure can become a medical emergency because it affects the heart’s pumping mechanism, making breathing difficult. Hence, the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is important. Below are the diagnostic methods for congestive heart failure:' Electrocardiogram: To assess heart rate and rhythm.  Chest X-ray: To determine heart size and presence or absence of fluid in the heart.  Blood tests: To know the risk factors that may cause congestive heart failure. Kidney function test: To determine water overload due to congestive heart failure. BNP: B-type natriuretic peptide, a chemical released by the heart muscle when the heart muscle is overloaded; this diagnostic test confirms congestive heart failure. Echocardiogram: To assess the function of the heart."
How is congestive heart failure treated?,'Treatment of congestive heart failure is usually focused on recovering the function of the heart as much as possible and treating the underlying causes. Doctors would recommend lifestyle modifications if an individual is at risk of developing congestive heart failure. Below are a few common treatments used for congestive heart failure:' Common diuretics (water pills) such as Lasix (furosemide) help in decreasing fluid in the body and also treating hypertension. Beta-blockers help in pumping sufficient blood by slowing down the heart rate.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors help in improving blood flow by relaxing blood vessels and lowering blood pressure.

It affects the joints, skin, brain, ''lungs'', kidneys, and blood vessels, leading to inflammation and tissue damage in the affected organs.\xa0\xa0When internal organs are involved, the condition is called systemic ''lupus''erythematosus (''SLE'').' "
What are the four types of lupus?,'The four types of ''lupus'' are:' Lupus dermatitis: Lupus affecting the skin in the form of a rash. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): This type of lupus affects the internal organs and is the most serious type. Drug-induced lupus: This type of lupus occurs as a result of an overreaction to certain medications such as Apresoline (hydralazine) or quinidine and Pronestyl (procainamide). It is similar to SLE. Neonatal lupus: Lupus affecting an infant as a result of passively acquiring antibodies from a mother with SLE.
How does a person get lupus?,"'The exact cause of SLE is unknown, however, there are several risk factors that increase your chances of getting lupus, such as the following:''Genetic and hormonal factors may contribute to lupus''Environmental factors''Other risk factors''Early-life risk factors' Exposure to UV rays Microbial response Certain medications Silica dust Cigarette smoking Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight) Family history of SLE Female sex Chronic infections Use of estrogen in women undergoing menopause Vitamin D deficiency Pregnancy and breastfeeding have shown to decrease the risk of SLE. Women of childbearing ages (15-44 years) High-risk ethnic backgrounds such as African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, and Caucasians. Low birth weight (<2,500 g) Preterm birth (birth that occurs before the 37th week of pregnancy) Exposure to pesticides during childhood"
What is usually the first sign of lupus?,"'Fatigue'', ''fever'', ''joint pain'', and weight changes are usually the first signs of lupus. Some adults may have a period of SLE symptoms known as flares, which may occur frequently, sometimes even years apart and resolve at other times—called remission. Other symptoms include:''Apart from the above symptoms, ''nausea'', ''indigestion'', ''abdominal pain'', and ''confusion'' may also be seen in some patients.' Sun sensitivity Oral ulcers Arthritis Seizure Blood cell and immunological abnormalities Loss of appetite Muscle aches Alopecia (hair loss) Facial rash (butterfly rash) Chest pain caused due to inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lung (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis) Raynaud’s phenomenon (poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure) Vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)"
What are the complications of lupus?,'The complications that accompany lupus are as follows:' Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) Lupoid hepatitis (liver disease) Fibromyalgia (muscle pain and tenderness) Pancreatitis (inflammation in pancreas) Infections Coronary heart disease (damage or disease in the heart’s major artery) Blood clots Kidney failure
How is lupus diagnosed?,"'Physicians diagnose lupus with the help of the following laboratory tests:''Radiographic tests such as computed tomography scan, ''magnetic resonance imaging'', and joint radiograph also detect abnormalities.''Ultimately, a ''skin biopsy'' is performed to confirm the diagnosis.' Specific antibody tests for SLE (e.g., antinuclear antibodies) Complete blood cell count (CBC) to screen for anemia and thrombocytopenia Serum creatinine for kidney disease Urinalysis for kidney disease Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)  for inflammation Liver function tests"
How is lupus treated?,"'There is no cure for lupus. Management of SLE depends on disease severity and disease manifestations.\xa0''Hydroxychloroquine'' is effective in the long-term treatment of SLE. Immunosuppressive medicines help to inhibit the activity of the immune system, which can also be useful in treating SLE.\xa0''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') and ''corticosteroids'' help to treat inflammation and ''pain'' in the muscles, joints, and other tissues.'

40 Menopause Symptoms and Signs,"'Menopause'' is the end of the reproductive era of a woman’s life that is characterized by drastic changes in her emotional and physical aspects. Studies have identified around 40 signs and ''symptoms of menopause'', but not every woman gets all of them. Most women suffer from only a few of these symptoms and do not need any treatment. But for the symptoms that become intolerable, there are effective therapies to relieve them.' Irregular periods: Irregular periods around the typical menopausal age (45 to 55 years) are usually the first clue to menopause. These periods may be heavier than normal. Hot flashes: Hot flashes are a sudden feeling of warmth on the upper part of the body normally accompanied by redness. These affect around 75% of menopausal women. Night sweats: Night sweats are periods of sweating occurring at night. Vaginal dryness: Lack of estrogen reduces blood supply to the vagina. This results in thinning (atrophy) of the vagina and vaginal dryness. Painful sex/discomfort during sex: A dry and thin vagina may cause painful penetration. Decreased sexual drive: Estrogen is the major hormone responsible for controlling a woman’s sexual drive. Decreased estrogen levels can affect a woman’s sexual drive. This is worsened by accompanying disturbances in sleep and mood swings. Mood swings: While their bodies adjust to the dip in hormone levels, some women experience mood swings when they suddenly feel irritable or depressed. Anxiety: With the changes in hormone levels, menopausal women may notice increased feelings of anxiety. Panic attacks: Fluctuating hormones around menopause (perimenopause) and during menopause can cause panic attacks. Depression: Depression is four times more likely to affect menopausal women than menstruating women. Sleep disturbances: Anxiety, night sweats or mood swings can lead to disturbed sleep. Fatigue: Fatigue is a common symptom for many postmenopausal women. Difficulty concentrating: Lack of sleep affects health and makes women feel tired. This may cause trouble with focus and reduced concentration. Forgetfulness: Poor sleep and reduced estrogen levels can result in foggy memory. Headaches: Women who have experienced headaches during their periods are more likely to experience them during menopause.  Stress incontinence: Stress incontinence is the involuntary passing of a small amount of urine while sneezing or lifting heavy weights due to postmenopausal loss of bladder control.  Urge incontinence: Urge incontinence, a sudden and frequent urge to urinate, is due to an overactive bladder. Nocturia: Women with postmenopausal bladder control problems may have to get up in the middle of the night due to the urge to urinate. Painful urination: Some women feel urethral pain while urinating.  Hair loss/thinning: Hormone levels do influence hair growth. With menopause, many women experience hair loss and thinning. Weight gain: Some women experience weight gain after menopause that is triggered by lower levels of estrogen. The good news is that this weight gain is reversible and can usually be controlled by healthy eating and doing physical activities. Joint pain/muscle ache: As estrogen levels affect the joints, ligaments, tendons, and muscles women may experience joint pains and muscle aches during menopause. Breast tenderness/soreness: Drastic fluctuations in hormone levels can cause breasts to become sore or tender. Dryness of mouth: A decrease in saliva secretion induced by low estrogen levels can cause dryness of the mouth. Digestive problems: Major hormonal changes seen in menopause can lead to stomach upset such as bloating, indigestion, constipation or diarrhea. Osteoporosis: This is a drop in bone density by more than 20% and it can increase the risk of fractures. Increase in aches and pains: Menopause can intensify pain levels in chronic conditions such as migraine. Body odor:  This may occur due to sweating and hormone changes. Gum problems: This may result due to a loss of bone mass in and around the teeth. Burning mouth syndrome: This is a hot sensation that affects the tongue, lips, cheeks and the mouth. Brittle nails Facial hair growth Dry skin Dry eyes Tingling sensations in the extremities Electric shock-like sensations  Dizzy attacks Frequent allergies: Poor immune system due to hormonal changes can make women prone to colds and flu. Irregular heartbeat/racing heart Lack of motivation"
Fruits and vegetables,"'It is recommended to eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables. They contain ''vitamins'' and ''minerals'' that are essential to maintain body health and prevent diseases. They are rich in ''fiber'', help in ''digestion'', and maintain gut health. They are low in fat and hence help with hunger pangs without increasing calorie consumption.\xa0''Tips to get five portions of fruits and vegetables in a day:' Having a banana or an apple with breakfast or adding chopped fruits to cereals or smoothies Having a piece of fruit as a mid-morning snack Having a bowl of salad or vegetable soup  Snacking on raw carrots, cucumbers, or celery Filling half the plate with fruits and vegetables during meals  Consuming fruits and vegetables in the form of smoothies and juices, which are fresh and sugar-free Adding small amounts of dried fruits such as raisins and apricots to meals"
Dairy,"'Dairy and dairy alternatives are good sources of proteins and ''vitamins''. They also contain calcium, which is beneficial for bone health. Semi-skimmed, skimmed, and 1% fat milk contain less fat than full-fat milk while still providing sufficient proteins, vitamins, and calcium. Dairy-free milk alternatives such as soya milk and other nut milks can be consumed by those with dietary restrictions.\xa0' "
Starch and carbohydrates,"'Examples of starchy foods are potatoes, bread, rice, and pasta. Starch is required to fuel the body and is a good source of energy. Whole carbohydrates contain essential fiber, calcium, iron, and other vitamins.''Wholegrain foods usually contain more fiber and nutrients. They take longer time to digest and hence help to remain full for a longer time, thus reducing food consumption. Examples of whole grains are brown rice, whole wheat pasta, brown bread, etc. Whole grains must be consumed with caution by those who have digestion problems.' "
Proteins,"'This food group is an important component of many meals, culture and lifestyles and a wide variety of foods are eaten from this food group.\xa0' Pulses: Pulses are foods such as beans, peas, and lentils. They’re a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals and are low in fat. Pulses are good for bulking up dishes such as soups and gravies. They add flavor and texture and can replace meat. Other vegetable proteins: Other vegetable-based sources of proteins include tofu, bean curd, and Quorn. They are full of proteins, low in fat, and can be used in place of meat in most recipes.  Fish: Fish is rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Oil-rich fish such as salmon contain vitamin A, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids that benefit the heart, skin, nails, memory, and digestion and are healthy and a good source of vitamins A and D. Oil-rich fish can sometimes contain small amount of pollutants that can accumulate in the body, so it is advised not to eat more than four portions of oil-rich fish per week. White fish such as haddock and cod are low in fat and contain important vitamins and minerals. Shark, swordfish, and marlin may contain high levels of mercury. Hence, it should not be consumed more than once a week. Eggs: Eggs are a good source of proteins, vitamins, and minerals. Egg dishes are quick to make and healthy, provided too much oil or salt is not used while cooking.  Meat: Meat is rich in proteins, vitamins (especially vitamin B12), and minerals. Vitamin B12 is only found in animal meat and milk. Red (beef, lamb, and pork) and processed meat increase the risk of colon cancer. Some types of meat contain high unsaturated fats that increase the cholesterol levels in the body, affecting the heart and brain. Choosing lean cut meats and reducing meat consumption replacing with other sources of protein is recommended. Fats: Some unsaturated fats such as plant-based and olive oil are recommended because they can help lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart diseases. "
How do I plan my meals?,"'The US government\xa0(U.S. Department of Agriculture\xa0[USDA])\xa0developed a\xa0help guide called ''MyPlate''\xa0for\xa0adults and children to have a healthy, balanced ''diet''.

 How do you suspect mental illness in a person?,"'Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the mental disorder and severity of the condition.''Some signs and symptoms that are seen in mental disorders include:' Feeling sad and unhappy Inability to concentrate Excessive fears  Unnecessary feelings of guilt Severe mood changes Easy irritability The tendency to react with violence Withdrawal from friends and activities Inability to maintain relationships Inability to work or study Disorganized speech (talking meaningless sentences that don’t make sense) Feeling tired and lethargic Insomnia (difficulty sleeping) or sleeping too long Detachment from reality  Delusions (false and sometimes unrealistic beliefs in which the person refuses to stop believing, despite providing proof, for example, believing they are God, that aliens are reading their minds, etc.) Paranoia Hallucinations (having unreal sensations such as hearing voices, seeing things, feeling sensations on the skin, having strange odors that aren’t real, etc.) Inability to cope with daily problems or stress Consuming excessive alcohol Drug abuse Loss of appetite or excessive eating Decreased sex drive Suicidal thinking (requires immediate medical attention)"
What causes mental illness?,"'The exact cause of mental illnesses is not always known. It could be caused due to various genetic and environmental factors or a combination of both:' Genetic: Mental illness is more common in those who have a blood relative with mental illness. Certain genes may be inherited that can increase the risk of mental illness. Environmental factors and other psychological or physical stressors can trigger mental illness in those with genetic predispositions. Environmental exposures before birth: Exposure to environmental stressors, inflammatory conditions, toxins, alcohol, or drugs during pregnancy can increase the risk of mental illness in the child later in life. Altered chemistry in the brain: Neurotransmitters are chemicals in the brain that carry signals to other parts of the brain and the rest of the body. When the functions of these chemicals are impaired, the normal function of the nerve systems changes, leading to mental disorders."
What are the risk factors for mental illness?,"'Certain factors may increase your risk of mental illness:' Family history of mental illness Previous history of mental illness Intense psychological or physical stress due to stressful situations in life such as financial problems, loss of a job, death of a loved one, or a divorce Traumatic experiences such as sexual assault, war, etc. Unpleasant childhood due to bullying, abuse, or neglect Chronic medical conditions, especially diseases that are associated with chronic pain and diseases affecting quality of life, such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, fibromyalgia, etc. Trauma to the brain Alcoholism and/or drug abuse"
What causes chronic kidney disease?,"'CKD happens when 85-90% of your kidney gets damaged and becomes functionally impaired. CKD is caused by a variety of conditions that gradually affect the kidney’s functions over a few to several years.''The conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include' Diabetes (common cause) Hypertension (high blood pressure) Inflammation of the kidney’s structural unitsGlomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli)Interstitial nephritis (an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures) Glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli) Interstitial nephritis (an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures) Polycystic kidney disease (multiple cysts or fluid-containing sacs in the kidney that occur by birth) Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract by conditions, such asEnlarged prostateKidney stonesTumors Enlarged prostate Kidney stones Tumors Pyelonephritis (bacterial infection of the kidney) Painkiller consumption over a long time"
What are the signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease?,"'Patients with CKD stages 1-3 generally do not have symptoms. Typically, signs and symptoms start appearing during the last stages of 4-5 (GFR < 30). These include:' Nausea Loss of appetite Weight loss Fatigue Weakness Headaches Trouble sleeping Drowsiness Changes in how much you urinate Muscle cramps Swelling of feet and ankles Itching Dry skin or darkened skin Shortness of breath Uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) Difficulty concentrating"
How is chronic kidney disease diagnosed?,"'The doctor will take your complete medical history along with your family history, such as if anyone in your family has or had ''diabetes'', whether you are on any medications (that can cause kidney damage), and so on. They will perform a thorough physical examination to see if you have any signs or symptoms of CKD.''A few tests will help your doctor confirm the diagnosis of CKD. These are:' Kidney function tests: This test will look at your creatinine levels to check if you have trouble with your kidney. Blood tests: Low hemoglobin levels are found in CKD. Urine test: This will be done particularly to check for the presence of protein or persistent protein (proteinuria) in the urine, which is a sign of kidney damage. Other things that the doctor will look for include red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs). Ultrasonography: To check for any cysts or scarring or size of the kidney."
What are the complications of CKD?,'CKD can affect many systems of your body. Some of its complications are:' High blood pressure High cholesterol levels Pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs) Cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms due to a sudden rise in potassium levels) Heart diseases Osteopenia (weakening of bones) Anemia (low hemoglobin level/low blood count) Erectile dysfunction
Can chronic kidney disease be cured?,"'There is no cure for CKD. However, treatments and an appropriate ''diet'' (low-protein, low-salt) can help manage its signs and symptoms. They can help you halt the progression of CKD to a certain extent.''Medications given to treat the complications of CKD can help you make feel better.''There are two main treatments for ''kidney failure'':\xa0' Dialysis: Dialysis is a procedure in which a machine placed outside of your body takes the role of a kidney. This procedure needs to be performed at least three times a week. Kidney transplant: A damaged kidney is replaced with a healthy kidney taken from a donor."
5 Stages of Huntington’s Disease,"'HD Stage 1: Preclinical stage''HD Stage 2: Early stage''HD Stage 3: Middle stage''HD Stage 4: Late stage''HD Stage 5: End-of-life stage''The end-of-life stage is when patients become confined to the bed completely and dependent on others for all their activities. They need help to live the last few months or years of their lives peacefully and in the best way, they can.''Patients with Huntington’s disease (HD) usually live for anywhere between 10 and 20 years after the symptoms first appear. The cause of death usually is a complication of HD, such as ''pneumonia''. ''Pneumonia'' in such patients results from aspiration of food into the ''lungs''.''Doctors may refer to only the three stages of HD, namely, early, middle, and late for the ease of explaining to the patients.''How early the stages begin and how severe are the symptoms differ among patients with HD. These differences have been linked to variations in genetic mutation causing HD.' The preclinical stage is when mild symptoms start appearing, but the doctor has not diagnosed the person to have Huntington’s disease (HD). Symptoms of HD most commonly start between 40 and 60 years of life, but they can appear as early as 2 years or as late as 80 years. The affected person can usually carry all their day-to-day work without requiring any assistance. Mood problems may appear at this stage. The symptoms become noticeable enough to arrive at the diagnosis of Huntington’s disease (HD). There may be twitches or slight tremors in the hands or face, which may be missed as nervous tremors. Although people with HD carry most of their daily activities, some activities do require help from people around them. The affected people can usually go or drive to work by themselves. There may be trouble in eating and sleeping. Thinking becomes difficult for some tasks that appeared simple earlier. The person grapples with depression, anxiety, and irritability. At this stage, people with Huntington’s disease (HD) are unable to carry most of the activities on their own. Substantial help is needed from the people around in activities involving domestic and financial chores. People start experiencing difficulty in swallowing, and slurring of speech may be noticed. They might experience difficulty in walking and maintaining balance. There is drastically worsening in the thinking ability of the affected person. The person might experience difficulty in learning new things and remembering information. Depression and irritability become evident at this stage. Sex drive or performance may be reduced. By this stage, people with Huntington’s disease (HD) require assistance in all areas of life and become bedridden.  Movements become extremely slow and rigid. They are unable to convey what they feel because of speech impairment. The inability to swallow necessitates the use of a feeding tube that is inserted surgically into the stomach. People may become constipated or have trouble urinating. Extreme difficulty in falling asleep or staying asleep is experienced. Patients may choose whether to spend their last moments in a hospital or at a familiar place such as their home."
What is prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer'' affects the prostate glands of men. ''Prostate cancer'' is the second-leading cause of ''cancer'' deaths for men in the United States.''The prostate is a small organ that lies below the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum (part of the ''large intestine''). In men, it is normal for the size of the prostate to increase with age. In younger men, it is about the size of a walnut. The prostate makes a milky fluid, which is a part of semen. This fluid feeds the sperm.''Growth in the prostate can be of two types:''Prostate ''cancer'' starts in the ''prostate gland'' and may spread to other organs.\xa0' Benign growths: These are noncancerous growths and rarely a threat to life e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia. Malignant growths: These are cancerous growths that can be life-threatening."
What causes prostate cancer?,"'The exact cause of prostate ''cancer'' is unknown. One in three men older than 50 years has some cancer cells in the prostate. Luckily, eight out of 10 tumors are found to be small and harmless after the biopsy. Although the reason for prostate cancer is unknown, there are many risk factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer:' Age over 55 (peak age 65-74) years Ethnicity: Common in blacks as compared to Caucasians. Genetic/family history Poor dietary habits: High fat, unhealthy diet Cigarette smoking Alcohol intake Obesity Lack of exercise Hormonal causes"
What are the 5 warning signs of prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer rarely produces symptoms in the early stage; however, few signs can help in detecting prostate cancer. Five potential warning signs of prostate cancer are:' Bone pain (due to spread) Symptoms from compression of the spine Painful urination or ejaculation Sudden erectile dysfunction (trouble in getting an erection) Blood in urine or semen"
What are the other symptoms of prostate cancer?,"'Symptoms of prostate cancer are:' Weight loss Frequent urination particularly at night Loss of bladder control Weak urine flow Dull pain in the lower pelvic area Pain in the lower back, hips, or thighs Loss of appetite Weight loss Bone pain Anemia Pain and edema in the legs and feet Neurologic deficit (an altered function of a body area) Loss of bowel control"
How is prostate cancer diagnosed?,'Screening asymptomatic men help identify early prostate cancer. Screening is recommended in men:''Screening methods include:\xa0' Who are between 55 and 69 years of age Who is African American Who have a family history of prostate cancer Digital rectal examination (DRE) helps to find prostate problems Prostate-specific antigen (PSA): Increased PSA levels in the blood can sometimes indicate prostate cancer. Diagnosis: Definite diagnosis is based on the biopsy of the prostate tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging studies and imaging tests may be used to assess the distant spread (metastasis).
How is prostate cancer treated?,'The treatment plan for prostate cancer depends on the following factors:''Treatment choices for prostate cancer involve:' The stage and grade of cancer Age and health Risk category Patient values and preferences Life expectancy SurveillanceActive surveillance: Monitoring cancer closely by carrying out PSA and DRE examinationWatchful waiting: Relies mainly on the changing symptoms in men Active surveillance: Monitoring cancer closely by carrying out PSA and DRE examination Watchful waiting: Relies mainly on the changing symptoms in men Localized therapySurgery involves the removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy)Radiation therapyCryotherapy is the use of very cold temperatures to freeze and kill the cancerous cellsFocal therapy Surgery involves the removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy) Radiation therapy Cryotherapy is the use of very cold temperatures to freeze and kill the cancerous cells Focal therapy Drug therapies that spread throughout the body to destroy cancer cells involve:Hormonal therapyChemotherapyImmunotherapy Hormonal therapy Chemotherapy Immunotherapy
What is the survival rate for prostate cancer?,'Most of the men diagnosed with prostate cancer will not die from it. Other medical conditions along with prostate cancer can cause death.''Survival rates for men with prostate cancer have increased over the years due to increased screening and treatment options. Ninety-nine percent of men with prostate cancer will survive for a minimum of five years after diagnosis.' 
What is urinary incontinence?,"'Urinary incontinence is loss of bladder control. The severity ranges from occasionally leaking urine while straining, coughing, or sneezing or having a frequent urge to urinate that occurs suddenly. Some people may only experience occasional and minor leaks of urine, whereas others may lose small-to-moderate amounts of urine frequently. Urinary incontinence can affect daily activities and quality of life; hence, it requires appropriate treatment. Treatment involves medical management and lifestyle changes.' "
What causes urinary incontinence?,"""Urinary incontinence isn't a disease; it's a symptom of another underlying condition causing loss of bladder control.""'Causes of temporary urinary incontinence:'' Certain foods, ''drinks'', and medications can stimulate the bladder, increase fluid excretion, and increase the volume of urine. They include:''Urinary incontinence due to treatable medical conditions:''Causes of persistent urinary incontinence:' Excessive caffeine Alcohol Aerated drinks  Artificial sweeteners High dose of vitamin C Chocolate Foods that are high in spice, sugar, or acid, for example, citrus fruits Medications to treat heart conditions and regulate blood pressure, sedatives, muscle relaxants, and diuretics  Urinary tract infection Constipation Pregnancy: Increased weight and size of the fetus and an expanding uterus can increase pressure in the uterus causing incontinence. Childbirth: Vaginal delivery can damage the nerves of the bladder and weaken muscles of the pelvic floor that are necessary for bladder control. Aging: Aging causes weakening of the bladder muscle and reduces the bladder's urine storage capacity. Involuntary bladder contractions may occur during old age. Menopause: After menopause, in women, there is a decrease in the reproductive hormone causing thinning of the lining of the bladder and urethra that can lead to incontinence. Hysterectomy (uterus removal surgery): The bladder and uterus are supported by many of the same muscles and ligaments. A hysterectomy can cause weakening of the pelvic floor muscles, leading to incontinence. Enlarged prostate: Enlargement of the prostate gland, benign or cancerous, can cause incontinence. Obstruction in the urinary tract: A tumor or stones in any part of the urinary tract can block the normal urinary flow and can lead to overflow incontinence.  Neurological disorders: Nerve damage due to neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, brain tumors, a stroke, a brain tumor, and a brain or spinal injury can damage the nerves that affect bladder control."
What is ankle taping and bracing?,"'Ankle ''sprains'' are one of the most common sports-related injuries in the United States which can result in significant breaks from sports, training and other physical activities. Ankle sprains tend to involve partial or complete ligament tears.\xa0''The concept of prophylactic (preventative) ankle wrapping was introduced more than 60 years ago to prevent or reduce the severity of ankle injuries. It may be applied before practice or a competition.''Ankle bracing and taping should be done under the guidance of a sports medicine physician or a training athletic staff.' "
What is the difference between ankle taping and bracing?,"'The concept of ankle bracing evolved from ankle taping.\xa0''Braces'' are presently\xa0 being used instead of traditional taping by many athletes at all levels of competition. Ankle ''braces'' are self-applied, reusable, and re-adjustable. In the long run, braces are likely more cost-effective than taping. Disadvantages of bracing include the fact that many athletes feel less comfortable or stable when wearing braces than they do when the ankle is taped. Braces also may tear and require replacement.''Another disadvantage to ankle taping is you can’t self-apply it, hence you can’t remove and reapply when it causes discomfort. Taping may also cause ''skin inflammation'' and sores.\xa0''Some athletes find ankle tape more comfortable and stable than ankle braces, however.' "
Is ankle taping and bracing effective?,"'Many studies have shown that braces are slightly more effective than taping, but that both were better than no support. Both have been found to effectively reduce range of motion, reduce the risk of injuries or help heal ankle injuries that have occurred. They are also beneficial during rehabilitation after major ankle injuries, when patients begin physical activities again.''Studies have shown that simply wearing high-top instead of low-top shoes prevented some ankle injuries, while wearing\xa0high-top shoes plus taping led to more than 50% fewer injuries than in test groups wearing low-top shoes plus taping.' "
How is ankle taping and bracing done?,"'Ankle bracing and taping should be done by a sports medicine physician or a training athletic staff or under their guidance. The following are descriptions of the ankle-taping and bracing procedures done to protect an existing ankle injury.''A common concern is that prolonged taping or bracing of the ankle may result in weak ankles that are actually more prone to injury, hence it is important to follow the instructions of usage from a healthcare professional.' The ankle injury is first assessed by the doctor, and radiological tests assess the extent of injury. Open injuries would be treated first and dressed before ankle taping and bracing. There are many different types of athletic tape available. The healthcare professional would advise an appropriate type of tape.  For standard ankle application, the tape of choice is 1.5- or 2-in. (3.8- or 5.1-cm) white, porous athletic tape or nonelastic tape.  It is applied on clean and dry skin. It is wrapped from the midfoot to one third of the way up the lower leg. Braces generally come in two types, though small variations exist between various manufacturers. A healthcare professional would advise the ideal brace.  One type of ankle braces is nonrigid and resembles a thick canvas or nylon lace-up sock. Some nonrigid braces are also made of neoprene. The nonrigid style provides compression to the ankle, may help in injury prevention and provides stability. Some nonrigid braces are also made of neoprene. The nonrigid style provides compression to the ankle, may help in injury prevention and provides stability. The other type of ankle brace is the semirigid type. Its construction is similar to the nonrigid type but with the added feature of molded plastic struts or air cushions. These braces provide more stability and are often used during the rehabilitation following ankle injury. These braces provide more stability and are often used during the rehabilitation following ankle injury. Most nonrigid and semirigid braces also use fabric straps to simulate heel locks. These are usually on the outside of the brace and fastened with Velcro."
What is bone broth? ,"'Broth, also known as stock, made from bones of animals and birds has long been consumed as food since prehistoric times. Traditionally, it has been used as a home remedy for certain diseases, such as the ''flu''. A 12th-century physician, Moses Maimonides, prescribed chicken broth for respiratory illnesses like colds and ''asthma''.\xa0''Modern research has confirmed that broth has some role in preventing and treating ''upper respiratory tract infections''. Bone broth is often actively promoted and used as a part of therapy for individuals suffering from a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, who holds a degree in medicine and a postgraduate degree in both neurology and human ''nutrition'', has made bone broth more famous through her gut and psychology syndrome (GAPS) ''diet''. She has recommended this ''diet'' for conditions, such as''Bone broth consumption is also encouraged by people who advocate a paleolithic diet. A paleo diet is a diet consisting of fish, nuts, lean meats and vegetables. It limits grain consumption. Small studies suggest that such a paleolithic diet may help people with ''hypertension'', high ''cholesterol levels'' and ''diabetes''.''Health benefits of bone broth include' Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Dyslexia Dyspraxia Depression Schizophrenia Improved hydration: Bone broth can provide better hydration to you when you need something more than water. Weight management: Bone broth is a low-calorie food that can make you full and help you keep your weight under check. Better sleep: Glycine is an amino acid in bone broth that can help improve your sleep. It also has a role in preventing liver ailments. Tasty nutrient boost: Bone broth is easy to make and when combined with other vegetables becomes a tasty and relatively inexpensive source of nutrition. Protein source: Bone broth contains around 20 to 26 percent protein. It helps increase immunity, repair body cells and reduces hunger pangs."
How to make bone broth,"'Bone broth involves taking bones along with the surrounding cartilage and simmering it in a large pot over a long period, which can range from 6 to 24 hours. The addition of spices and vegetables makes the bone broth more nutritious and enhances taste. The longer the cooking time, the more flavorful the broth.''In their recipe for chicken stock, Fallon and Enig have recommended the following method' Take a whole chicken (including its head and its feet) and cut it into pieces Put the chicken pieces into a large stainless-steel pot filled with water, vinegar and vegetables. Boil the mixture and then simmer for up to 24 hours. Spices like garlic, ginger, thyme, celery and coriander may be added for more flavor. It can be made in large quantities and stored in the fridge for up to 4 days."
What does the current evidence say about bone broth?,"'While bone broth may offer health benefits, such as clearing ''nasal congestion'', certain claims like improvement in joint health and better skin lack scientific evidence. The collagen found in bone broth is cited as the main substance responsible for these claims. However, scientists have refuted the claim by saying that plant-based foods are better at providing collagen-building blocks to the body rather than the direct collagen, which does not reach the bones and the skin.''Due to the increasing popularity of bone broth as a health drink, scientists went on to investigate the composition of bone broth made from chicken. They found the cooked chicken broth that contained the bones, skin or cartilage are contaminated with lead in amounts many times higher than in tap water. This was true even in the farm raised organic chicken. Cooking bones for a long time was a sure way to leach the lead from the bones into the broth that we consume. Lead is a known poison that has delirious effects on children as well as adults. The chicken meat without bones, cartilage and skin had much lower concentrations of lead. Hence, given the startling findings, those who want to make broth can discard the bones, cartilage and skin and choose to make chicken broth with the remaining chicken parts.' "
What nutrients do strawberries provide?,"'Strawberries are available all around the year as fresh or frozen products and thus, represent a relevant dietary source of various nutrients.''Strawberries are loaded with essential ''vitamins'', a good amount of ''fiber'', and particularly high levels of antioxidants known as polyphenols. Most health-promoting polyphenols in strawberries are anthocyanins, which give strawberries their bright-red color as well.''Other antioxidants present in strawberries include ''Vitamin C'', potassium, and manganese. Just one cup of strawberries provides more Vitamin C than an orange. Antioxidants are substances that help in preventing chronic diseases, such as ''diabetes'', heart diseases, and ''cancers''. Strawberries rank in the top 20 fruits in antioxidant capacity.''Strawberries are also naturally low in ''sugar'' with only 7 grams of natural ''sugar'' in a cup of strawberries.''Strawberries also contain fat-soluble ''vitamins'', such as ''Vitamin E'' and ''Vitamin K'', and a sufficiently good amount of several other vitamins, such as thiamin, riboflavin, ''niacin'', and Vitamin B6.''Strawberries are one of the richest natural sources of the micronutrient called folate, which plays an essential role in promoting good health and preventing diseases.''Strawberries are also a good source of ''minerals'' that include:' Manganese Iodine Magnesium Copper Iron Phosphorus"
What are the health benefits of eating strawberries?,'Consuming one cup of strawberries thrice a week may help improve your health by' Reducing total cholesterol levels Increasing high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol or good cholesterol Lowering blood pressure Protecting against heart disease Keeping weight under check (by providing satiating effect) Preventing a rise in blood sugar levels after meals (fiber present in strawberry slows down digestion and makes you feel full for longer) Lowering the risk of some cancers Supporting cognitive function
"What is massage, traction and manipulation?","'Various forms of ''massage'', traction, and manipulation'' have been used as a part of medical practice.\xa0''Although there is no knowledge of the complete physiology of massage, traction or manipulation, it is generally accepted that these treatment approaches are beneficial in musculoskeletal conditions.''Each modality represents an approach to treatment. Each of these treatment approaches carries some potential risks and may be contraindicated in certain conditions. Hence, it is important to consult with a medical professional first.\xa0''The procedures are performed by trained professionals, including a physiotherapist, chiropractor, orthopedic surgeon, sports medicine specialist or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist.''From an osteopathic perspective, these techniques are not always intended to be a standalone treatment. A combination of treatment approaches and a “team approach” may be required to achieve complete recovery of the patient.' "
What is a massage?,"'A massage is a therapeutic manipulation of soft tissue\xa0of the body with the goal of achieving normalization of those tissues. There are various forms of massage techniques with origin west and east. Massages are performed by trained professionals, and the duration can vary from 15 to 120 minutes.''Some benefits of a massage are as follows:' Mobilization of tissue fluids Reduction or modification of edema (fluid trapped in the body tissues) Increase in blood flow Decrease in chronic muscle pain, soreness and stiffness Facilitation of relaxation and mood improvement Prevention or elimination of adhesions"
What is a traction?,"'A traction ''refers to the practice of slowly and gently pulling on a fractured or dislocated body part. It is usually performed by a medical professional such as a physiotherapist, using ropes, pulleys, and weights. These tools help apply force to the tissues surrounding the damaged area.\xa0''A manual traction'' involves the practitioner using their hands on the patient’s body and providing tractive force of the patient’s body weight.\xa0''Auto-traction ''is controlled by the patient pulling on bars or handles without the direct involvement of a practitioner. Gravitational traction with a tilt table and underwater variations may be used sometimes.\xa0' Stabilizing and realigning bone fractures Helping reduce the pain of a fracture before the surgery  Treating bone deformities, such as deformities of the spine Correcting stiffness and constriction Relieving chronic pain of the neck and back Skeletal traction: This involves placing a pin, wire, or screw in the fractured bone, after which weights are attached to it, so the bone can be pulled back into the correct position. This may be done using general, spinal, or local anesthesia to avoid pain during the procedure. Skin traction: Less invasive than skeletal traction, it involves applying splints, bandages, or adhesive tapes to the skin directly below the fracture, after which weights are attached to it. The affected body part is then pulled into the right position using a pulley system attached to the hospital bed. Cervical and lumbar traction: During cervical traction, a metal brace is placed around the neck or back. The brace is then attached to a body harness or weights, which help correct the affected area. The procedure may be performed under general anesthesia."
What is manipulation?,"'Manipulation is the use of the hands by a professional on the patient by using specific techniques and maneuvers to achieve painless movement and right posture of the musculoskeletal system.''The most common types of manipulation involve passive mechanical forces applied to specific vertebral segments, regions, or other joints to restore a complete range of motion.' Treatment of musculoskeletal problems, especially those of the rib cage, upper and lower extremities, back, pelvis, and neck Treatment of the loss of motion or function Decrease in localized tenderness or pain during motion Direct thrust (high velocity/low amplitude): The practitioner rotates, bends sides, and either flexes or extends the adjacent vertebral segments, locking the facet so that further motion is limited to the segment in question. Articulatory technique (low velocity/high amplitude): This involves the passive movement of a vertebral joint within a reduced range of motion. Indirect positional techniques: This involves thrust, articulation, and muscle energy techniques to lengthen shortened, passive tissues."
What is pulse oximetry?,"'Pulse ''oximetry'' is a quick, noninvasive test that measures the oxygen level (oxygen saturation) in the\xa0blood. It is an easy, painless method to measure how well oxygen is carried to parts of the body furthest from the ''heart'', such as the arms and legs. The pulse oximeter is a clip-like device that is attached to a body part, such as a finger or ear lobe. This device uses light to measure how much oxygen is in the blood. This information helps to know if a person needs extra oxygen. It can show whether\xa0the heart\xa0and\xa0''lungs''\xa0are supplying sufficient oxygen through your body.\xa0' "
What are the benefits of pulse oximetry?,"'Pulse oximeters are useful for people who have conditions that affect blood oxygen levels. pulse oximetry can help:''A doctor may also use pulse oximetry as part of a\xa0''stress''\xa0test. Pulse oximeters are used in infants in ''neonatal'' intensive care units to help staff alert if there is a drop in oxygen saturation. These devices help patients who are at risk of ''sudden infant death syndrome'' (''SIDS'') and sleeping accidents.' Monitor oxygen saturation over time Alert to dangerously low oxygen levels, particularly in newborns Offer peace of mind to people with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions Assess the need for supplemental oxygen Monitor oxygen saturation levels in people under anesthesia Indicate dangerous side effects in people taking drugs that affect breathing or oxygen saturation. Determine the effectiveness of breathing interventions, such as oxygen therapy and ventilators Doctors to assess the safety of the patient during physical activity or exercise (e.g., in people with cardiovascular or respiratory problems)"
What is pulse oximetry used for?,"'The purpose of pulse oximetry is to check how well a heart is pumping oxygen through the body. It may be used to monitor the health of individuals with any type of condition that can affect blood oxygen levels, especially while they’re in the hospital. These conditions include:''Moreover, pulse oximetry helps to:' Lung disease like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, and lung cancer Anemia Heart diseases like a heart attack or heart failure and congenital heart defects assess how well a new lung medication is working evaluate how a ventilator is working for ventilator-dependent patient monitor oxygen levels during or after surgical procedures that require sedation determine how effective supplemental oxygen therapy is, especially when treatment is new assess the individual’s ability to tolerate increased physical activity. evaluate whether individual momentarily stops breathing while sleeping (like in cases of sleep apnea during a sleep study)"
How accurate are pulse oximetry readings?,"'Pulse oximetry is usually an accurate test. It consistently provides results within a 2% difference either way of what it truly is. If a reading was 82%, for example, the true oxygen saturation level may be anywhere from 80% to 84%. However, the quality of the waveform and assessment of the individual must be considered. Factors such as movement, temperature, or nail polish can impact accuracy. Typically, more than\xa089% of blood\xa0should be carrying oxygen. This is the oxygen saturation level needed to keep cells body healthy. An oxygen saturation level of 95%is considered normal for most healthy individuals. A level of 89% indicates potential\xa0''hypoxemia'' or deficiency in oxygen reaching tissues in the body.' "
What is estrogen therapy?,"'Estrogen therapy, also known as ''hormone replacement therapy'', is a treatment for alleviating the symptoms caused by menopausal transition (when a woman’s ovaries reduce or stop producing estrogen and ''progesterone''). ''Menopause'' is when a woman has no periods for one year.\xa0''Estrogen therapy is also used for protecting menopausal women against potential diseases that low estrogen levels may cause.''Estrogen therapy is most beneficial for women under 60 years of age or when started early in ''menopause'', within 10 years from ''menopause''. ''Hormone therapy'' is unsuitable for ''breast cancer'' survivors. For women with an intact uterus, estrogen is usually combined with a progestogen hormone to reduce the risk of ''uterine cancer''.' "
What does estrogen do?,"'Estrogen and progesterone are steroid hormones naturally occurring in the body. Though commonly known as female sex hormones, males also have estrogen and progesterone in low levels.''Estrogen plays an important role in the development and regulation of the sexual and reproductive system. Estrogen also stimulates egg production (''ovulation'') by the ovaries. Apart from the reproductive system, estrogen has effects on almost the entire body including:''The central nervous system functions such as:''The body produces three forms of estrogen:''Progesterone is a form of progestogen, another important hormone produced by the body. Progesterone prepares the uterus to receive the fertilized egg by thickening the uterine lining (''endometrium''), and supports pregnancy. Progestin is a synthetic progestogen used in the preparation of hormonal medications.' Gastrointestinal system Urinary tract Organs such as: Skin Hair Breasts Blood vessels Bones Mood Sleep Cognition Estradiol: Produced by the ovary and predominant in premenopausal women. Estrone: Formed from estradiol in a chemical reaction predominant after menopause. Estriol: Secreted by the placenta during pregnancy, and also derived as a metabolite (waste product after processing) from estradiol and estrone."
What happens during menopause?,"'Absence of ''menstruation'' for 12 consecutive months is defined as menopause, after all other reasons are ruled out. The median age for ''natural menopause'' is about 52 years. Menopausal transition may take up to three years. Menopause may also occur earlier due to reasons other than natural such as surgery, ''radiation'' or ''chemotherapy''.\xa0''During menopausal transition, ''menstruation'' becomes irregular and the intervals increase. The ovarian function reduces and estrogen levels drop which give rise to early menopausal symptoms such as:''Many other conditions may mimic the vasomotor ''symptoms of menopause'' and must be ruled out with tests before starting hormone therapy. ''Post menopause'', estrogen deficiency may lead to genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) which may cause:''Menopausal women are at higher risk for developing diseases such as:' Hot flashes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms) Sleep disturbances and insomnia Mood changes Headaches Genital symptoms such as:Vaginal dryness or dischargeBurning or itching of vulvaSexual symptoms such as:Painful intercourseSpotting or bleeding after intercourse Vaginal dryness or discharge Burning or itching of vulva Sexual symptoms such as: Painful intercourse Spotting or bleeding after intercourse Urinary symptoms such as:Recurrent urinary tract infectionsPainful or difficult urination (dysuria)Frequency and urgency in urination Recurrent urinary tract infections Painful or difficult urination (dysuria) Frequency and urgency in urination Cardiovascular disease Thromboembolic disease Breast cancer Osteoporosis"
What are the FDA-approved hormone therapies? ,"'Currently hormone therapy is approved for the following:''Hormone therapies are individualized based on the individual’s conditions and symptoms. The therapy may consist of estrogen alone or a combination of estrogen and a progestogen. Following are the FDA-approved hormone therapies, which are administered in four forms:''Most oral tablets are taken once daily. The FDA-approved ''drugs'' include:''SERMs are selective estrogen receptor modulators, which act as both agonists and antagonists to estrogen. SERMS help estrogen bind with certain tissues like bone and help prevent bone loss, but block estrogen from binding to breast tissues and protect against ''breast cancer''.''Progestin tablets''Skin patches''Skin patches may be prepared with only estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone. Skin patches are placed on the lower stomach and replaced with new ones once or twice weekly.''Vaginal products are applied directly in the vagina. Creams and tablets are applied one to three times a week. Vaginal rings are generally replaced every three months.''Vaginal creams''Vaginal gels''Intrauterine devices are inserted into the uterus. Intrauterine devices release measured hormone doses daily and last up to five years.

What are the benefits of taking estrogen?,"'Estrogen therapy, with or without progesterone, is consistently effective in relieving menopausal symptoms. Estrogen therapy is also beneficial for preventing some estrogen deficiency symptoms.''The benefits of taking estrogen are clear in some of the conditions arising from menopause, but results are mixed in some. Following is an analysis of estrogen therapy benefits in menopause-related conditions:' Vasomotor symptoms: Studies show that hormone therapy reduces the frequency and severity of hot flashes by 65% to 90%. Cardiovascular disease: Studies indicate that hormone therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke in women younger than 59 or less than 10 years from menopause, but increases the risk in older women and those who are more than 10 years from menopause. Breast cancer: Hormone therapy is not recommended for breast cancer survivors. The risk for breast cancer may be more with a combination of estrogen with medroxyprogesterone acetate than estrogen-only therapy. Oral estrogen with bazedoxifene did not show increased risk for breast cancer in two years. Breast density may increase with hormone therapy. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause: Vaginal hormone products are useful in relieving genitourinary symptoms and may also prevent urinary tract and bladder infections. Prevention of bone loss: Conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene reduces bone density loss and the risk of fracture in menopausal women. Hormone therapy is usually used only when vasomotor symptoms are also present, because other non-hormonal medications are available for osteoporosis. Cognition and quality of life: Hormone therapy, if started early, may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s, but may increase the risk if started after 60 years of age or more than 10 years after menopause. Relief from menopausal symptoms can improve quality of life. Other benefits: Other potential benefits of hormone therapy include:Improved sleepBetter retention of collagen, skin thickness and elasticityReduced risks of cataracts and open-angle glaucomaImproved balanceImproved maintenance of joint healthPossible reduction in risks of colon cancer and type II diabetes Improved sleep Better retention of collagen, skin thickness and elasticity Reduced risks of cataracts and open-angle glaucoma Improved balance Improved maintenance of joint health Possible reduction in risks of colon cancer and type II diabetes"
What are the possible risks and side effects of estrogen therapy?,"'On the whole, estrogen therapy’s benefits outweigh risks when initiated early in menopause, when the woman is relatively young. All estrogen therapies carry increased risks for certain conditions such as:''Common side effects of hormone therapy include:''Oral hormone therapy''Other potential risks of hormone therapy include:' Stroke due to venous thromboembolism (blood clots in the veins) Uterine hyperplasia (overgrowth of endometrial tissue) Estrogen therapies with progestin have additional risks such as: Breast cancer Cardiovascular disease Painful and swollen breasts Irregular vaginal bleeding Vaginal discharge Headache Nausea Can cause liver problems and is not suitable for women with liver damage.

Following exercises may help reduce back pain," Partial crunches: Partial crunches can help strengthen the muscles of the back and stomach. You must lie down on a yoga mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Your arms may be crossed over and placed over the chest or behind the neck. You have to contract or tighten the muscles around your tummy and raise your shoulders off the floor while breathing out. Avoid using your elbows or arms to lift yourself off the floor. Once you lift your shoulders off the floor, you can hold the position for a few seconds and then slowly lower back down. You may repeat this 8-12 times a day. Wall sits: You must stand 10-12 inches away from the wall and then lean back on the wall until the back is flat against the wall. Slowly slide down until your knees are slightly bent while pressing your lower back into the wall. Hold for a count of 10 seconds or how many seconds possible and then slowly slide back up the wall and stand. This can be repeated 8-12 times a day. Press-up back extensions: Lie flat on your stomach on a yoga mat, with your hands under your shoulders. Push your shoulders off the floor using your hands. After this, you may place your elbows directly under the shoulders and hold for a few seconds. You place additional cushioning under the elbows. This may be repeated 8-12 times a day. Bird dog: Start on your hands and knees, as you would in a cat pose, and contract your belly muscles. Lift and extend one leg behind up to the hip level and hold for five seconds, bring it down, and then switch to the other leg. If comfortable, you may also extend the opposite arm forward, while lifting the leg. This may be repeated 8-12 times on each side for each side. You may gradually increase the holding time. Knee to chest: Lie on a yoga mat on your back with the knees bent and feet flat on the mat. Bring one knee to your chest, while keeping the other foot flat on the mat. The lower back should remain pressed to the floor. This position may be help for 15-30 seconds and then repeated on the other side. This exercise may be done two to four times for each leg. Pelvic tilts: Lie flat on your back on a yoga mat with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Tighten your stomach as tight as possible till you feel your back pressing into the floor, with your hips rocking back. Hold this position for 5-10 seconds while inhaling and exhaling slowly. This may be repeated 8-12 times a day. Aerobic exercises: Aerobic exercises such as swimming, walking, and biking can strengthen your muscles, lungs, heart, and blood vessels and help you lose weight and reduce back pain. You may start with short sessions and gradually build up over time."

What are the common causes of high cholesterol?,"'Below are few common factors that may increase bad ''cholesterol'' in the body:' Hereditary: Cholesterol or heart diseases may run in the family and is usually inherited. Comorbid diseases: Diabetes, liver diseases, and kidney and thyroid diseases Smoking cigarettes or passive smoking: Cigarette smoking damages the walls of your blood vessels, making them more prone to accumulate fatty deposits. Smoking might also lower your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or ""good"" cholesterol. Age: The risk of high cholesterol increases with age as functioning of the liver may reduce and may become less able to remove low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Diet: Eating an excessively unhealthy diet that includes saturated fat, found in animal products, and trans fats, found in some commercially baked cookies and crackers and microwave popcorn, can increase the cholesterol level. Foods that are high in cholesterol, such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, will also increase your cholesterol. Excessive weight: Having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher puts you at risk of high cholesterol. Obesity is directly related to high cholesterol and bad health.  Physical activity: Lack of physical activity and exercise may increase bad cholesterol deposits in the arteries. Exercise helps boost our body's HDL or good cholesterol. "
What is cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol is an important substance required by the body to build healthy cells. It is waxy and sticky in nature. Excess cholesterol is harmful for the body. Cholesterol usually comes from the below sources:' Liver: It is the main site for cholesterol synthesis in the body. Food: The remainder of cholesterol in the body comes from foods derived from animals (meat, poultry, and full-fat dairy products). Foods that are usually high in saturated and trans fats cause the liver to make more cholesterol. This added production means excess cholesterol production, which is harmful for the body. Some tropical oils: Oils such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil if consumed in high quantity may lead to high cholesterol levels. These oils are often found in baked goods."
What are the different types of cholesterol?,"'There are two types of cholesterol:\xa0''Too much of the bad kind, or not enough of the good kind, increases the risk of plaque buildup in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. A plaque is found on the inner side of the large blood vessels. It is made of cholesterol, calcium, and blood products. It makes the lumen of these blood vessels narrow.' Bad cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol: It transports cholesterol particles throughout the body. LDL cholesterol builds up in the walls of the arteries, making them hard and narrow. Good cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol: It picks up excess cholesterol from the blood vessels and takes it back to your liver."
Why is excessive cholesterol harmful?,"'Usually, cholesterol circulates in the blood, making the blood more viscous. As the amount of cholesterol in the blood increases, so does the risk to the health. Cholesterol can combine with other substances to form a thick, hard deposit on the inside of the arteries. This can narrow the arterial openings and also make them less flexible (a condition known as ''atherosclerosis''). If a ''blood clot'' forms and blocks one of these narrowed arteries, it may result in a ''heart attack'' or ''stroke''. With high cholesterol, one can develop fatty deposits in the blood vessels. Eventually, these deposits increase, making it difficult for enough blood to flow through your arteries. Sometimes, those deposits can break suddenly and form a clot that may cause a heart attack or ''stroke''.' "
What are the acceptable levels for cholesterol?,"'Healthy levels of cholesterol don’t vary much for typical adults. Variation of recommended levels tends to change due to other health conditions and considerations.''Total cholesterol:''Bad cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL):''Good cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL):' Adults who have total cholesterol levels less than 200 mg/dL are considered healthy. If total cholesterol is between 200 and 239 mg/dL, it is borderline high. If total cholesterol is 240 mg/dL and above, it is considered high and harmful. LDL cholesterol levels should be less than 100 mg/dL. 100-129 mg/dL is acceptable for people with no health problems but may be a concern for anyone with heart diseases or heart disease risk factors. 130-159 mg/dL is borderline high. 160 mg/dL and above is considered high and harmful. HDL levels should be kept higher. The optimal reading for HDL levels is 60 mg/dL or higher. If HDL is less than 40 mg/dL, it can be a major risk factor for heart diseases."
What are mouth ulcers?,"'An ulcer usually forms as a break in the skin or mucous membrane with loss of surface tissue.''Mouth ulcers'' are also called ''canker sores'', aphthous ulcers, and are a form of ''mouth sores''. They are small, round ulcers that may be red, yellow, or gray. They occur inlining of the oral ''cavity'' (mucous membrane), usually on the inner surface of the lips and cheeks.' "
What are the types of mouth ulcers?, Minor mouth ulcers: These are the most common type of mouth ulcer and typically occur three or four times a year. They occur more commonly in the age-group of 10 to 20 years. They are less than 1 centimeter in diameter and heal within a week with no scarring. Major mouth ulcers: These are less common. The ulcers are bigger and last more than weeks. They tend to heal with scarring. Herpetiform mouth ulcers: These are rare and appear as clusters of tiny ulcers. They usually heal in about a week.
What are the causes of mouth ulcers?,"'The causes of mouth ulcers can be traumatic, environmental, systemic disease, or medication.

How are mouth ulcers treated?," Mouthwashes: Your doctor may prescribe medicated mouthwashes that have a steroid or painkiller. Topical medication: Medicated ointments containing antiviral medicine, steroids, or local anesthesia can be applied over the ulcer to numb the area. Oral medications: Oral tablets and syrups may be prescribed to promote healing and reduce pain. Nutritional supplements: These might be prescribed if a nutritional deficiency is suspected or to help the ulcers heal faster. Cautery: Dental lasers or cauterization (medically burning) of the ulcer with chemicals provide instant relief. Diseases: Treatment of underlying systemic disease.

What are the causes of restless legs syndrome?,"'Restless legs syndrome'' (''RLS'') is a condition that causes people to compulsively move their legs, especially when they are at rest.\xa0''The following are the causes of ''RLS''Many researchers suggest that abnormalities in a certain neurotransmitter (''dopamine'') in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) play some causative role. Neurotransmitters, including dopamine, are chemicals that regulate the transmission of nerve impulses.' Genetics: Parents with RLS can pass it down to their children. Up to 92% of patients with RLS have a first-degree relative with the disorder. These patients tend to develop symptoms earlier in life (before age 45) than those with RLS without the genetic link. Chronic diseases: Certain long-term medical conditions include RLS symptoms such as iron deficiency, Parkinson’s disease, kidney failure or renal disease, diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. Lifestyle: Excess use of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine may cause RLS. Lack of sleep can trigger symptoms or make RLS worse. Medications: Some drugs might make symptoms worse, including anti-nausea medicines, antipsychotics, some antidepressants and cold and allergy medications that have antihistamines. Pregnancy: Some women have RLS during pregnancy, especially in the last trimester. Symptoms usually go away within a month after delivery."
What is restless legs syndrome?,"'Restless legs syndrome'' (RLS) is considered a ''sleep'' and nervous system\xa0disorder. It is a condition that causes an uncontrollable urge to move the legs because the person feels an uncomfortable sensation in the legs. It typically happens while resting when sitting or lying down. It also causes sensations described as creeping, ''itching'', pulling, crawling, tugging, throbbing, burning or gnawing in the legs. Moving eases the unpleasant feeling temporarily. Due to this condition, patients may have disturbed sleep or may not be able to sit for long periods of time. RLS, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, can begin at any age and generally worsens with age. It can interfere with daily activities. RLS is more common in women and especially in middle-aged people.\xa0' "
How is restless legs syndrome treated?,"'There are treatments available that can help control the symptoms, so patients may get a good night’s sleep. Patients must discuss treatment options\xa0 with their doctor. Supplementation or medications are usually helpful, but no single medication effectively manages restless legs syndrome (RLS) for all individuals. Trials of different drugs may be necessary. In addition, medications taken regularly may lose their effect over time or even make the condition worse, making it necessary to change medications. Treatment options for RLS include the following' Lifestyle changes: Certain lifestyle changes and activities may provide some relief in people with mild-to-moderate symptoms of RLS. These steps include avoiding or reducing the use of alcohol and tobacco, changing or maintaining a regular sleep pattern, following a program of moderate exercise, massaging the legs, taking a warm bath or using a heating pad or an ice pack. A foot wrap that puts pressure underneath the foot and another that is a pad that delivers vibration to the back of the legs is usually helpful in treating RLS symptoms. Aerobic and moderate-intensity leg-stretching exercises may provide some relief from mild symptoms. Iron: For individuals with low ferritin and transferrin saturation in blood, a trial of iron supplements is recommended as the first treatment. Iron supplements are available overthe- counter. A common side effect is upset stomach, which may improve when using a different type of iron supplement or stool softeners. In some people, iron supplementation may be given through an intravenous (IV) line to boost iron levels and relieve symptoms. Dopaminergic drugs: These act on the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain (examples include Mirapex [pramipexole] and Neupro [rotigotine]). Benzodiazepines: This is a type of sedative that may help with sleep, but the drugs can cause daytime drowsiness. Narcotic pain relievers: These may be helpful in treating symptoms of RLS. Anticonvulsant or antiseizure drugs: These are becoming the first-line prescription drugs for those with RLS. These drugs can reduce sensory disturbances such as creeping, crawling and nerve pain. Dizziness, fatigue and sleepiness are among the possible side effects (examples include Neurontin [gabapentin] and Lyrica [pregabalin])."
What is the prognosis for people with restless legs syndrome?,"'There are medications and therapies that can control the disorder, minimize symptoms and increase periods of restful sleep. Patients must discuss all possible options with their doctor. Symptoms may gradually worsen with age, although the decline may be somewhat faster for individuals who also suffer from an associated medical condition. Some individuals have remissions in which symptoms decrease or disappear for days, weeks, months or years although symptoms often eventually reappear.' "
Which hepatitis is an STD?,"'Hepatitis A'', B, and C can be sexually transmitted.' Hepatitis A: Although the fecal-oral route is common for hepatitis A, the virus can also be transmitted from any sexual activity. The use of condoms does not effectively prevent the spread of hepatitis A. Hepatitis B: Sexual contact is the most common mode of Hepatitis B transmission in the United States. Compared to HIV, a hepatitis B infection is 50 to 100 times more likely to be transmitted sexually. The transmission risk is higher among unvaccinated people with risk behaviors like having multiple sex partners and men having sex with men (MSM). Hepatitis C: The Hepatitis C virus may be transmitted via sexual contact. However, studies have shown that such transmission is very rare. A higher rate of sexual transmission of the hepatitis C infection is seen in MSM, especially those who practice unprotected anal intercourse and have an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)."
What are the chances of getting Hep C sexually?,"'Hepatitis C spreads by contact with an infected person’s blood. Although uncommon, hepatitis C can be transmitted through sexual activity, if the person has genital sores and ''cuts''. It can also be transmitted during ''menstruation''. However, just 2% of hepatitis C cases are sexually transmitted.''The risk of getting hepatitis C sexually increases in the following situations:' Presence of an STD (sexually transmitted disease) or HIV Sex with multiple partners Poor intimate hygiene Men who have sex with men"
Can vaccines prevent the sexual transmission of hepatitis?," Hepatitis A: Measures used to prevent the spread of STDs, like the use of condoms, do not prevent hepatitis A transmission. Fortunately, an effective vaccine for preventing Hepatitis A transmission is available and is the most important measure to protect people at risk of infection. Hepatitis B: A hepatitis B vaccine safely and effectively protects against infection of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended the hepatitis B vaccination for:Sexually active people who are not in long-term, mutually monogamous relationships (e.g., people with more than one sex partner in the previous six months).People seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease.CDC also recommends hepatitis B testing and hepatitis B vaccination forSexual partners of people with hepatitis B. Sexually active people who are not in long-term, mutually monogamous relationships (e.g., people with more than one sex partner in the previous six months). People seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease. CDC also recommends hepatitis B testing and hepatitis B vaccination for Sexual partners of people with hepatitis B. Hepatitis C: There is no vaccine available for hepatitis C. The most effective protection against hepatitis C is avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease, like sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs and avoiding multiple sexual partners."
Do women have a higher risk of getting infected with hepatitis through sexual contact?,"'Sex does not determine the risk of being infected with hepatitis through sexual contact. The presence of behavioral and other risk factors may make a person vulnerable to getting hepatitis by sexual contact. Some studies, however, suggest that it is easier for a man to transmit ''HCV'' to a woman than vice versa. Furthermore, MSM are 10 to 15 times more at risk of getting infected with hepatitis B than the general population.' "

What are thyroid problems?,"'The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the anterior (front) aspect of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, body temperature, heartbeat and the ''digestive system''. ''Hypothyroidism'' occurs when the thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. ''Hyperthyroidism'' occurs when the thyroid gland produces excess levels of thyroid hormones. Thyroid problems can begin at any age and women are more affected than men. The clinical presentation and complications of hypothyroidism and ''hyperthyroidism'' are different. They may be diagnosed after a routine blood test or after symptoms begin. There are several treatment options that are safe and effective.' "

What are the complications of hypothyroidism?,"'If untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to various complications' Goiter: The lack of thyroid hormone causes constant stimulation of the thyroid gland causing enlargement of the thyroid gland. This is called goiter. Goiter can cause cosmetic concerns and can affect breathing and swallowing.   Cardiac (heart) problems: Hypothyroidism increases the risk of heart disease and causes irregular heart rate and heart failure. Hypothyroidism increases the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, known as the “bad” cholesterol, leading to cardiovascular complications. Mental health issues: Depression, slow mental function, lethargy and poor memory can occur and may worsen over time.  Peripheral neuropathy: Long-term untreated hypothyroidism can cause damage to your peripheral nerves (in the arms and legs). Patients present with pain, numbness and tingling in affected areas. Myxedema: This is a rare, life-threatening complication of long-term, untreated hypothyroidism. Its signs and symptoms include swelling of the face including the lips, eyelids, and tongue and swelling and thickening of the skin and underlying tissues anywhere in the body having a waxy texture. Patients also have intense cold intolerance and drowsiness followed by profound lethargy and unconsciousness. Infertility: Low levels of thyroid hormone can interfere with ovulation presenting with irregular periods.  Birth defects: Babies born to women with untreated thyroid disease may have a higher risk of being born with birth defects. The children also have a risk of serious developmental problems. Infants: Infants with untreated hypothyroidism present at birth are at risk for serious problems with both physical and mental development.  Pregnant women: Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, premature delivery preeclampsia (high blood pressure in the last trimester of pregnancy) and birth defects in the developing baby."
What are the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism?,"'Hyperthyroidism can mimic other health problems; hence, it may be misdiagnosed. The common signs and symptoms include the following'""Graves' ophthalmopathy"" Weight loss, despite normal appetite and diet Tachycardia (increased heartbeat)  Arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm)  Increased appetite Anxiety and irritability Tremor (trembling) of the hands and fingers Sweating Menstrual cycle changes Increased sensitivity to heat Changes in bowel movements Goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland)  Fatigue Muscle weakness Difficulty sleeping Thinning of the skin and hair Dry eyes Red or swollen eyes Protruding eyes Excessive tearing or discomfort in one or both eyes Light sensitivity Blurry or double vision"
What are the complications of hyperthyroidism?,"'If untreated, hyperthyroidism can lead to various complications' Cardiac (heart) complications: Cardiac complications of hyperthyroidism can be serious and life threatening. Cardiac complications include a rapid heart rate and altered heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that can increase the risk of stroke and heart failure. Brittle bones: Untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to osteoporosis (weak, brittle bones) causing the bones to fracture easily. Increased thyroid hormones impair the body's ability to incorporate calcium into the bones. Eye complications: Those with Graves' ophthalmopathy develop eye problems, including bulging, red or swollen eyes, photophobia (sensitivity to light), blurry vision or double vision and even loss of vision/blindness. Skin complications: Those with Graves' disease develop Graves' dermopathy, which is characterized by redness and swelling of the skin, usually on the shins and feet. Thyrotoxic crisis: Thyrotoxic crisis is a sudden intensification of symptoms, causing fever, palpitations and altered mental status. This requires emergency medical attention."

What is a headache?,"'Pain'' originating in any region of the face, head or neck is called ''headache''. This ''pain'' can be dull or severe and localized to the face, skull or neck. The head is the most common site of pain in the body. ''Headache'' may sometimes be associated with ''nausea'', ''vomiting'' or ''dizziness''.' "
What are the different types of headaches?,"'The International ''Headache'' Society categorizes more than 150 types of ''headaches'', and based on it ''headaches'' are classified into three main categories which include:''Headaches due to underlying medical condition are\xa0called secondary headaches. This includes infection, severe injury, tumors, bleeding in the brain and sometimes, even life-threatening causes.\xa0 Below are few common types of secondary headache:''Any other headaches, facial pain and pain involving the 12 cranial nerves (nerves supplying from brain to other parts of body) are classified in this group.\xa0\xa0' Primary headaches: Headache with no clear underlying cause is called primary headache. It may be due to overactivity or strain. Primary headaches might not be life-threatening, but may affect the quality of life. Below are few common types of primary headache: Tension headaches: These occur when the muscles of the face or the scalp become tense. This may be due to physical or mental stress. Migraine headaches: Migraine pain is moderate to severe and can last from four hours to three days. Multiple factors cause migraines, and they may have a hormonal origin. Migraine symptoms include sensitivity to light, noise or smell.  Cluster headaches: This type of headache is rare but is the most severe type of primary headache. The pain is severe, throbbing and mostly localized to behind the eye. It may be accompanied by watery eyes and sensitivity to light.  Sinus headaches: The sinus headaches are associated with infection of the sinuses. This pain is  associated with a deep and constant throbbing in cheekbones, forehead or bridge of your nose. The pain usually gets worse with sudden head movement or straining.  Medication overuse headaches: These occur due to overuse over-the-counter painkillers This is among the most common type of severe headache seen in hospitals and is also called “transformed” headache. It is believed that 4% of the population worldwide has chronic daily headaches of some type — a significant subset of which are due to medication overuse. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN): It is the most common cause of facial pain; pain is so severe that it affects the daily life of the patient leading them to depression. "
What are the different causes of headaches?,'Triggers for the headache are:' Physical stress Emotional stress Alcohol use Skipping meals Changes in sleep patterns Excessive medication use Illness Genetics Environment
How to get rid of headaches,'Headaches can be usually treated at home; however secondary headaches and severe headaches should be evaluated by medical professionals to rule out underlying medical causes. Below are a few common ways to get rid of headaches.\xa0' Get maximum rest Drink sufficient water and stay hydrated Head massage Over-the-counter painkillers such as acetaminophen can relieve the symptoms
What are knee injections?,"'Knee injection'' is a procedure in which medications are injected into the ''knee joint'' to treat the ''pain'' due to various causes.\xa0''There are different types of knee injections. ''The most common type of intra-articular knee injection is ''corticosteroids''. Other agents used are ''hyaluronic acid'', ''infliximab'', ''Botox'' (botulinum neurotoxin), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP).''Knee pain'' and ''stiffness'' can be debilitating and difficult to treat. Knee conditions may negatively affect the quality of life and emotional wellbeing.''Weight management'', ''exercise'', physiotherapy, medications, knee injections, and surgery are some of the approaches used to treat ''knee pain''.\xa0''Knee ''pain'' can result from ligament or tendon injury, ''fracture'', cartilage loss in ''osteoarthritis'', and inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory ''arthritis'' or\xa0''septic arthritis''. Knee pain can also be due to joint malalignment or dysfunction and referred pain from other areas.\xa0''Diseases of the knee can be diagnosed based on\xa0' clinical presentation,  radiographic tests, and  joint aspiration (arthrocentesis). "
Why is knee injection done?,"'Knee injection is performed to treat the pain arising from various diseases of the knee joint. The type of medication injected and the frequency depends on the condition being treated. Based on the diagnosis and extent of the disease, the doctor would recommend a treatment plan.''Indications for the various agents used for knee injections are as mentioned below.\xa0''Steroid injections help to relieve pain and inflammation in individuals with:''Infliximab suppresses inflammation and can be used to treat the following:''Hyaluronic acid (HA) is naturally present in the joints, eyes, and skin. HA levels decrease with age, leading to joint friction and arthritis. HA knee injections lubricate the joint, decrease friction, decrease impact, delay joint ''aging'', reduce pain, and stiffness. HA is used in the treatment of the following:' Osteoarthritis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Acute monoarticular gout or pseudogout Rheumatoid arthritic knees Knee monoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Spondyloarthropathy (ankylosing spondylitis) knee osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis Botox inhibits the sensory neurons causing pain. Hence, joint pain and stiffness significantly improve.  PRP is obtained from the patient’s own blood. It contains growth factors that stimulate collagen formation and lubricate the joint. PRP can improve joint function and reduce pain."
How is knee injection performed?,"'Knee injection'' is a relatively quick procedure and may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain. A needle of appropriate size and length connected to a syringe is introduced into the joint and the medication is injected. Radiological guidance may sometimes be used to aid injection.\xa0\xa0''After the procedure, ''the patient would need to rest for a few minutes, and then they can resume normal activities. Patients may experience pain, swelling, and ''bruising'', which resolve in a few days. Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and ''bruising''.' "
How long does it take for a knee injection to work?,"'The time taken for the knee injections to work depends on the medication injected. Different medications have different durations of onset and longevity.\xa0' Steroids take two to three days following injection for patients to see relief of symptoms. In case of severe joint disease, it takes longer for the effects to begin. Steroid knee injections are usually injected three to four times a year as the effects last for 6 to 12 weeks. Hyaluronic acid takes three to four weeks to see the effect on pain relief after the initial injection. The effects last for two to six months, after which the injection needs to be repeated.  PRP takes longer for its action on the joints to begin, around six months, but the results are more superior and last longer than hyaluronic acid.  Infliximab may take a few days up to two to six weeks for the effects to begin after the first treatment. The treatment can be repeated every eight weeks. Botox takes three to 14 days to see pain relief and the results last for about three months."
What are the complications of knee injection?,"'Complications are rare and are typically resolved. Some common complications are:' Joint bleeding, swelling, and bruising  Damage to cartilage  Infection"
What are the treatment options for seizures?,"'Below are treatment options for seizures:''Medication:''Surgery: ''Doctors usually consider surgery when the condition is not improved by medication. Surgery is done in the portion of the brain responsible for seizures (e.g., brain resection, disconnection, or stimulation).' Doctors may prescribe an antiepileptic drug or anticonvulsant to treat seizures. These drugs are taken every day, sometimes several times a day, for as long as needed. Common drugs include Dilantin (phenytoin), Tegretol (carbamazepine), Depakote (valproic acid), and Phenobarbital. These drugs may be used alone or in combination with each other when seizures are difficult to control. Most of them have side effects, which include fatigue, drowsiness, nausea, and blurred vision."
What is a vasectomy?,"'Vasectomy is a simple, safe, effective, and permanent male ''contraception'' method that ''cuts'' off the supply of sperm to the semen. It is carried out by cutting and sealing the tubes that carry sperm (vas deferens). Due to the position of male reproductive organs, this surgery is straightforward. More than 500,000 men prefer to have vasectomies every year in the United States. After the vasectomy, ejection and climaxes are all normal. The only difference is that your semen will no longer contain sperms.' "
What are the advantages of having a vasectomy?,"'Vasectomy is 99% effective in preventing ''pregnancies''. It offers many advantages as a ''birth control'' option. Vasectomy is a one-time procedure, which is a reliable form of contraception. Unlike female ''tubal ligation'', a vasectomy provides the following advantages:' Simple procedure More effective Can be performed in an outpatient setting Have fewer complications Less expensive No birth control options required Recovery is faster"

History of excessive bleeding or blood disorders Allergy to local anesthetics Skin disease involving the scrotum Regular use of aspirin History of an injury or a surgery to the scrotum or groin History of repeated genital or urinary tract infections"
How is the vasectomy procedure done?,"'Vasectomies are of two types: Incision vasectomy and the no-scalpel vasectomy. The surgeon creates an opening either by an incision or a puncture in the upper part of the scrotum. Next, the physician locates the vas deferens and pulls it through the opening. The withdrawn part is cut and sealed by tying it using heat (cauterizing), surgical clips, or a combination of methods. The physician then transfers the ends of vas deferens into the scrotum and closes the opening.' "
What to expect after a vasectomy?,"'Mild discomfort, pain, ''bruising'', and swelling are common after a vasectomy, which resolves after a few days.''You may have a bandage around the scrotum and need to wear tight-fitting underwear for at least 48 hours after a vasectomy. The bandage should be changed if soiled.''Apply ice packs to the scrotum for the first two days.''You can start showering the day after a vasectomy. Sometimes, the skin may separate due to tissue fluid, oozing blood, or body fluids.''Limit heavy work or sexual activity for a week after surgery.' "
How can you tell if you have diabetes?,"'The early signs of ''diabetes'' depend on if one has type 1 or ''type 2 diabetes''. ''Type 1 diabetes'' usually occurs in children, whereas ''type 2 diabetes'' is prevalent in adults. Usually, in ''type 2 diabetes'', the signs may be unnoticeable unless some complications occur. With ''type 1 diabetes'', the symptoms are severe and appear quickly. Routine blood ''sugar'' level check-up is an ideal way to detect ''diabetes'' at an early stage.' "

What is endometriosis?,"'The ''endometrium'' is the inner lining of the uterus, which changes\xa0 throughout the ''menstrual cycle'', shedding during menstrual periods. ''Endometriosis'' is the presence of normal endometrial tissue abnormally implanted in locations other than the inner wall of the uterus.\xa0''The abnormally located endometrial tissue (endometrial implant) nevertheless responds to natural cyclic hormonal fluctuations in much the same way as the tissue located in the uterus. The result is, thickening, hormone secretion and cyclic sloughing of menstrual material. Thus, the symptoms of ''endometriosis'' depend on the cyclic production of menstrual hormones as well as where it has spread.''Typically, the abnormal sites of ''endometrium'' implants are in the pelvis:\xa0''More unusual sites include:' Ovaries Fallopian tubes Vagina Cervix  Soft tissue Surgical scars  Lungs and their covering (pleura) Diaphragm  Kidney Spleen Gallbladder Nose Around spinal cord Stomach Breast  "
What are the symptoms and signs of endometriosis?,"'Almost a third of women with ''endometriosis'' do not have any symptoms.\xa0When symptoms are present, they depend on the site where endometrial implant has occurred. A common complaint is ''pain'' in the pelvic region, which varies with the menstrual cycle. The main symptoms include:' Pain during menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea) Heavy or irregular bleeding Pain in the pelvic region Lower abdominal or back pain  Infertility Pain or discomfort during intercourse (dyspareunia) Pain on passing feces (dyschezia), often with cycles of diarrhea and constipation Bloating, nausea, and vomiting Pain in the groin Pain on passing urine and/or increased urine frequency Pain during exercise Blood in sputum Seizures that change in severity with the menstrual cycle"
How is endometriosis diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of endometriosis is based on a detailed history, including the symptoms mentioned above, physical examination, and investigations.\xa0''Usually, the findings on physical examination are subtle. The most common finding is pain on applying pressure in the pelvic area.''Diagnostic examinations include:' Laparoscopy Studying tissue samples (histopathological examination) Ultrasonography imaging MRI imaging"
What are the risk factors for developing endometriosis?,'Risk factors for endometriosis include the following:' Family history of endometriosis Getting the first menstrual period at an early age Short menstrual cycles (less than 27 days) Long duration of menstrual flow (more than seven days) Heavy bleeding during menses Delayed childbearing Defects in the uterus or fallopian tubes Anemia
What is the treatment for endometriosis?,"'Although there is no permanent cure available, several treatment options exist.''Management with medication\xa0''The following ''drugs'' form the mainstay of pharmacologic care:' Combination oral contraceptive pills Danazol Progestational agents Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs Conservative: when the reproductive potential of the patient is retained Semiconservative: when reproductive ability is eliminated, but the function of ovaries is preserved Radical: when the uterus and ovaries are removed (hysterectomy)"
What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?,"'Diabetes'' is a chronic disease characterized by increased blood ''sugar'' (glucose) level.\xa0 ''Diabetes'' is caused by either insufficient ''insulin'' secretion or resistance to that hormone’s action.\xa0''Insulin is produced by the pancreas and helps process the glucose in the blood. Thus, with inadequate insulin, the bodies can’t ''burn'' all the blood ''sugar'' for energy in an efficient way. This means the glucose level in the blood rises, causing a variety of symptoms and when severe may even lead to death.\xa0''An estimated 9.4% of the population in the United States (30.3 million) were affected by ''diabetes'' in 2017, according to the report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC).''Factors that influence the development of ''type 2 diabetes'' include:' Genetic factors Increased intake of carbohydrates Excessive intake of calorie Obesity High-risk ethnic backgroundAsian Hispanic Native American African AmericanAsian American  Asian  Hispanic  Native American  African American Asian American  Lack of physical activity Sedentary lifestyle Age greater than 45 years Family history of diabetes History of diabetes during pregnancy Ovarian cyst diseas"
 What are the symptoms and signs of type 2 diabetes?,"'The classic symptoms of ''type 2 diabetes'' seen in the early stages are''The symptoms which occur in the later stages are''Most frequently, however, ''type 2 diabetes'' does not cause any symptoms for several years and may go unnoticed.' Increased thirst Increased urine frequency Increased appetite Urinating frequently at night Weight loss Fatigue Blurred vision Numb or tingling hands and feet Wounds that heal slowly Increased infections than usual Low blood sugar level"
What are the complications of type 2 diabetes?,"'Diabetes, if poorly controlled or left untreated, can lead to severe complications, which are as follows:' It may affect different organs of the body especially, the heart, eye, kidney, and nerves. It may affect the eyes causing blindness in adults. It is a major contributor to end-stage kidney disease in the United States. It can lead to leg amputation. There is an increased rate of post-surgery pneumonia. The risk of stroke is higher. The death rate is higher among COVID-19 patients with an underlying diabetic condition."
How is type 2 diabetes diagnosed?,"'The different diagnostic criteria set by the American Diabetes Association are:' A fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dL, or higher An oral glucose tolerance test which shows 200 mg/dL or higher A random glucose test of 200 mg/dL or higher in a patient showing typical symptoms of increased blood glucose level A hemoglobin A1C (HA1C), the test should show a result of 6.5% or higher"
What is the treatment for type 2 diabetes?,"'Goals of treatment are as follows:''Drugs'' that are used to treat diabetes are known as anti-diabetic medications. The different classes of antidiabetic drugs used are:' Preventing blindness or end-stage kidney disease, through control of blood sugar level and blood pressure Preventing stroke or heart disease by controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, and tobacco use. Preventing nerve damage by controlling blood sugar Biguanides: metformin Sulfonylureas: glyburide, glipizide Meglitinide derivatives: repaglinide Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose Glucagon-like peptide: semaglutide Thiazolidinediones: pioglitazone Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors: sitagliptin Amylinomimetics: pramlintide Selective sodium-glucose transporter inhibitors: dapagliflozin, canagliflozin Bile acid sequestrants: colesevelam Rapid-Acting insulins Intermediate-acting insulins Long-acting insulins Dopamine agonists: bromocriptine"
Can diabetes be cured?,"'Diabetes can be well-controlled by controlling the symptoms, but it cannot be completely cured as it is a chronic disease. Hence, prevention is key.' Lead a healthy lifestyle by reducing weight. Ensure a balanced diet with proper nutrition. Avoid junk food or extremely fatty foods. Exercise daily for 30-40 minutes. Limit the intake of alcohol and refrain from smoking tobacco. Increasing the intake of some essential minerals such as magnesium has shown to decrease the risk of diabetes. Monitor the blood sugar level from time to time. Be conscientious about your annual eye check-ups."
What is appendicitis?,"'Appendicitis'' is inflammation of the ''appendix''. It is the most common condition for emergency surgeries in the United States. Appendicitis can affect anyone; however, it is most common in people 10 to 30 years of age.''The appendix is a small tube-like organ that is connected to the large bowel (colon). It is usually present in the right lower part of the belly. The appendix has no known essential function in the body (vestigial organ). The length of the appendix may vary with age.''Appendicitis occurs when the appendix gets blocked leading to increased pressure, altered blood flow, and inflammation. Appendicitis is a medical emergency. Untreated appendicitis may cause the appendix to burst. This results in the release of the infection in the abdomen causing a serious condition called ''peritonitis''. The blockage of appendicitis may be caused by stools, worms, or swollen lymph tissue within the wall of the appendix.''When the appendix gets blocked, it cannot empty the fluid and ''mucus'' it makes. This leads to swelling and rising pressure within the appendix. This further provides a suitable environment for bacteria to grow. The swelling also disturbs the blood supply to the appendix. Lack of blood supply may cause the death of the affected parts leading to a hole (perforation) through which infection can spread to the rest of the abdomen (peritonitis).' "
How is appendicitis diagnosed?,"'For the diagnosis of appendicitis, your doctor will take a detailed history of your symptoms. They will examine you to look for the signs of appendicitis, such as tenderness in the abdomen and ''fever''. They may order certain tests, such as abdominal ''ultrasound'', X-ray, and ''CT scan''. Blood tests do not tell whether you have appendicitis. They may, however, tell whether you have an associated infection.\xa0' "
Can appendicitis be treated without surgery?,"'Surgical removal of the appendix (''appendectomy'') is needed in most cases of appendicitis. The appendix has no known important functions in the body. Thus, its timely removal in a case of appendicitis gives the best results. In certain less severe cases of appendicitis, the doctor may prescribe\xa0antibiotics. This is usually followed by surgery.\xa0This is because untreated appendicitis can burst and cause serious complications, such as peritonitis and painful collection of pus (''abscess'') in the body.''If the appendix has not burst, it may be removed through a small surgical cut in the ''belly button'' (keyhole or laparoscopic ''appendectomy''). Laparoscopic appendectomy can be done in people of all ages. The recovery with this procedure typically takes between 2-4 weeks.''In complicated cases, such as when the appendix has ruptured, open surgery may be needed. The recovery in the case of a ruptured appendix is often longer.''Thus, you must seek urgent medical care if you have any ''symptoms of appendicitis''. Timely management gives the best results.' "
What are the early warning signs of stomach cancer?,"'Stomach cancer'', in its early stages, rarely shows any warning signs or symptoms. Due to its gradual and seemingly silent progress, ''stomach cancer'' is usually hard to detect in its early stages. Because of the late appearance of the symptoms, just 20% of the stomach ''cancers'' in the United States are found at an early stage before the ''cancer'' spreads to other parts of the body.''The signs and symptoms of stomach ''cancer'' include''Most of these symptoms are usually caused by a stomach virus or ulcer (''peptic ulcer'') rather than ''cancer''. If symptoms such as heartburn or changes in bowel habits do not get better or become worse, seek medical help.' Loss of appetite Unintended weight loss  Abdominal or belly pain A sensation of vague discomfort in the belly, usually above the navel Change in bowel habits such as diarrhea or constipation Feeling of fullness, typically in the upper abdomen, after eating a small meal Indigestion or acid reflux (heartburn) Bloating Nausea Vomiting, with or without blood Swelling or fluid buildup in the abdomen Blood in the stool Pallor because of anemia (low red blood cell count)"
What are the risk factors for stomach cancer?,"'Studies have suggested the existence of several risk factors for stomach cancer. A person, however, may not develop the disease despite the presence of risk factors. Additionally, some people may not have any risks or few risks, yet they can get stomach cancer.\xa0''The risk factors for stomach cancer are as follows' Gender: Men are at a higher risk of stomach cancer than women. Age: The rate of stomach cancer is high in people over the age of 50. Most patients with stomach cancer are diagnosed between their late 60s and 80s. Ethnicity: Stomach cancer in the United States is more common in Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Native Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders than in non-Hispanic whites. Helicobacter pylori infection: The bacteria Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori is one of the major risk factors for stomach cancer. H. pylori infection is usually associated with cancer in the lower or distal part of the stomach. Diet: A diet rich in smoked foods, salted fish and meat and pickled vegetables increases the risk of stomach cancer. Cured meats are rich in cancer-causing substances such as nitrates and nitrites. Certain bacteria, such as H. pylori, can change these substances into compounds that have been shown to cause stomach cancer in lab animals. A diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of stomach cancer. Tobacco use: Smoking can increase the risk of stomach cancer by around two times. Family history: People who have a family history of stomach cancer are at higher risk. A history of stomach cancer in first-degree relatives (parents, siblings or children) may increase the risk of stomach cancer in a person. Stomach lymphoma: People with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma have an increased risk of stomach cancer. Being overweight or obese: Excess weight may increase the risk of stomach cancer, especially in the cardia (upper part) of the stomach. Previous stomach surgery: Previous surgeries for reasons such as stomach ulcers may increase the risk of stomach cancer. It might be due to less acid production that causes the nitrite-producing bacteria to multiply in the stomach. Bile reflux into the stomach after surgery may also contribute to stomach cancer. Pernicious anemia: This is a type of anemia due to the failure of the stomach to make intrinsic factor that is needed for vitamin B12 absorption. Pernicious anemia can increase the risk of stomach cancer. Type A blood group: People with type A blood are at a high risk of stomach cancer. Lynch syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of certain cancers including stomach cancer. Certain occupations: People who work in coal, metal and rubber industries may have a high risk of stomach cancer."
Is stomach cancer curable?,"'The prognosis of stomach cancer mainly depends on the patient’s general health and stage of the disease. Stomach cancer is often detected in later stages when the disease has spread to other parts of the body. In the advanced stage, the cancer can be treated but not cured. When detected in its initial stages, there are higher chances of recovery from stomach cancer.' "
What is a migraine?,"'A ''migraine'' is a type of severe ''headache'' that is often accompanied by ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''. External influences and changes in the brain are thought to trigger a ''migraine'', however, the exact cause is still unknown. Experiencing ''migraines'' is often ''inherited'' and passed on in the family (hereditary), suggesting a genetic component.\xa0''Individuals with ''migraines'' are seen to be sensitive to light, sound, and smell.

Low-grade fever Prolonged diarrhea (usually not bloody and often intermittent) Abdominal pain Weight loss Generalized fatigue Cramping in the lower-right abdomen Pain may be partially relieved by defecation Nausea and vomiting Painful oral ulcers"
What are the late signs of Crohn’s disease?," Bowel obstruction: Inflammatory swelling (edema) and spasms cause transient bowel obstruction. Over time, inflammation can cause scarring, thickening and narrowing in parts of the bowel, which may block the flow of digestive contents. Ulcers: Chronic inflammation may lead to erosion (ulcers) anywhere in the lining of the digestive tract. Fistulas: Sometimes, ulcers extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating an abnormal connection between different body parts (fistula). Fistulas can develop between the intestine and skin, or between the intestine and another organ. Fistulas can become infected. Anal fissure: A tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus. This causes painful bowel movements. Malnutrition and nutritional deficiency: This is due to poor absorption of nutrients, diarrhea, and the inability to eat due to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  Colon cancer: Crohn's disease increases your risk of colon cancer. A regular colon cancer screening may be required. Musculoskeletal symptoms: Crohn’s disease causesArthritis,Osteoporosis,Spondylitis,Fibromyalgia (muscle pain and weakness).

What is MS?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is a disease in which a person’s immune system attacks the cells of their brain and spinal cord. The exact cause of ''MS'' is unknown. It is an autoimmune disease -- a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues.''MS'' damages the nervous system to the extent that most of the patients are physically disabled in a span of 20 to 25 years. There can be symptom-free periods in between symptomatic episodes occurring months to years apart that damage different parts of the body. Some patients may not have symptom-free intervals and may experience steadily progressive worsening of symptoms.''Causative factors for MS, according to researchers:' Role of genes Viral infections Low vitamin D levels"
What are the first signs of MS?,"'MS presents differently in different individuals affected. Some people are affected mildly, whereas others lose their ability to read, write and speak.

What age does MS start?,"'Symptoms of MS usually begin between the ages of 20 to 40 years. However, MS can occur at any age.' "
How do you get multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is an inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS).\xa0''Within the CNS, the immune system attacks and damages the fatty substance that surrounds, insulates and protects the nerve cell (myelin sheath).\xa0 This damage to nerve cells is known as ''demyelination''. This results in the inability of the brain and its electrical impulses to perform normally, causing various nerve-related ''symptoms of MS''. The damaged areas develop multiple areas of scarring of the brain and spinal cord, which gives the disease its name.''MS'' is one of the most common causes of non-injurious disability in young and middle-aged adults.\xa0''The exact cause of the disease is unknown; however, scientists believe that a combination of factors triggers ''MS'', including:' Genetic factors Family history of MS Viral infection due to Epstein-Barr virus Low levels of vitamin D due to low sunlight exposure Age between 15 and 45 years A high-risk ethnic group such as Eskimos Hepatitis B vaccine Women are more affected than men Obesity Cigarette smoking"
What are the very first signs of multiple sclerosis?,"'The presentation of MS varies from individual to individual. Sensory loss, ''vision loss'', ''double vision'', ''blurred vision'', and ''pain'' on eye movement are early signs of MS''Some people have a predominance of changes in thinking, while others develop muscle cramping with ''spasticity''; bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction; ''depression''; or visual symptoms.\xa0''The prominent feature of MS is what is called an “attack” wherein symptoms occur and then resolve (remit) and may appear again (relapse) sometimes months or years apart affecting different organs. The most common symptoms are:''Less common symptoms seen are:''Secondary symptoms that occur as a complication of the above symptoms are:' Sensory loss  Fatigue (occurs in nearly 80 percent of patients) Walking difficulties Numbness of the face, arms, and legs Muscle spasms in the leg Deterioration of unused muscle leading to muscle weakness Dizziness and lightheadedness are commonly seen in patients with MS Sexual problems Constipation Loss of bowel control  Loss of bladder control Chronic pain and itching (noted in 55 percent of patients) Memory loss Analytical and problem-solving ability starts diminishing Significant depression, mood swings, irritability, and other emotional changes Slurring speech (dysarthria) and loss of volume (dysphonia) Difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) Vigorous shaking (tremor) Sudden uncontrollable vigorous jerking (seizures) Breathing difficulty Hearing loss or impaired hearing Loss of bladder control leads to urinary tract infection Physical inactivity or immobility leads to bedsores, muscle weakness, and poor posture"
What are the different types of multiple sclerosis?,"'There are four types of MS, based on the relapse rate and time to disease progression:' Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS): A recurrent attack is the characteristic of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis RRMS (which resolves completely on treatment). The relapse period may last for weeks to years. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS): Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) occurs when patients with RRMS develop a rapid worsening of the disease. It does not respond to the currently available treatment. Primary progressive MS (PPMS): Primary progressive MS accounts for approximately 10 percent of patients with MS in which the function diminishes gradually without relapses. Progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS): In progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS) bouts of symptoms overlay the progressing disease. It accounts for 5% of the total MS cases."
What tests help in diagnosing multiple sclerosis?,"'Currently, there are no specific symptoms, physical findings, or laboratory tests that are used to diagnose MS. However, approaches for diagnosing MS include:''A ''spinal tap'' involves the collection of spinal fluid, using a needle and syringe, in order to confirm the presence of any inflammation and other substances.' taking a medical history a nerve-related examination various imaging tests, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) spinal fluid analysis blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions"
What is the life expectancy for a person with multiple sclerosis?,"'MS, if untreated, can lead to physical disability within 20-25 years after onset. The survival rate in MS is correlated with disability.\xa0 Patients with MS have a high risk of falling; hence care should be taken to prevent falling.' "
What are the most common prostate problems?,"'The three most common prostate problems are:''Benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''):'' BPH is the noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. It is the most common problem in men, and it is a part of the normal ''aging'' process. Factors like changes in hormone levels and fibrosis may play a role in causing BPH. Fibrosis is the thickening and ''stiffness'' of the organ wall.''Prostatitis:'' Prostatitis is the inflammation (swelling) of the prostate. Though it can affect men of all ages, it is more common in men younger than 50 years. It is of two types:''Bacterial prostatitis:'' Bacterial prostatitis can be either acute or chronic. Diagnosis usually involves detecting white blood cells and bacteria in the urine with laboratory urine tests.''Chronic prostatitis'' (also known as inflammatory chronic ''pelvic pain'' syndrome):'' Doctors do not know the exact cause of chronic prostatitis. The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis is done when there are symptoms of prostatitis but no signs of infection. Bacteria are absent in urine tests.''Prostate cancer'': ''Prostate cancer'' is the most common ''cancer'' amongst men in America. Having your father or brother with prostate ''cancer'' makes you more likely to develop it. High-fat diets also put you at risk for prostate ''cancer''.' Acute bacterial prostatitis: The symptoms of acute bacterial prostatitis appear suddenly and usually subside with antibiotic therapy. Chronic bacterial prostatitis: In chronic bacterial prostatitis, the symptoms build up gradually and stay for a couple of weeks."
How are prostate problems diagnosed?,"'Your doctor diagnoses prostate problems based on the following:''Evaluation of your medical and family history.''A physical exam, including a digital rectal exam of your prostate. The doctor inserts their lubricated finger in the prostate to feel its texture.''Urine tests:'' The sample of urine is checked under a microscope to check for any signs of infection.''Blood tests:'' ''Complete blood count'' (''CBC'') is done to find out if there is an infection. Levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is done to check if there is prostate cancer.''Cystoscopy'':'' A tube-like camera is inserted through your urethra to reach into the bladder. This helps the doctors visualize the inside of the bladder with the help of images on the screen.''Urodynamic studies:'' This test involves visualizing the pressure changes in the lower urinary tract while you urinate.''Ultrasound'': ''This test involves moving a probe (transducer) over your belly or inserting the same into your rectum to check for any abnormalities in the prostate.''Prostate biopsy:'' Doctors surgically remove a small piece of your prostate by making a few small ''cuts'' in your abdomen. The prostate sample is sent into the laboratory to check for the presence of cancer cells.''Magnetic resonance imaging'':'' This may be required if the ''sonogram'' shows a heavy prostate and the PSA values are higher than normal.'

How do you get rid of inflammation in your body?,"'Besides the above home remedies, inflammation can be treated in several ways. Treatment for inflammatory diseases may include:\xa0''Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'' such as ''aspirin'',\xa0''ibuprofen'', or\xa0''naproxen'') or ''corticosteroids'' (''prednisone'')''A treatment plan will always depend on the type of disease, age, any pre-existing diseases, and overall health.\xa0''The goals of treatment should include:' Rest Exercise Surgery to correct the inflammation in the injured body part Correct, control, or slow down the disease process Avoid or change activities that aggravate pain Relieve pain through pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs Keep joint movement and muscle strength through physical therapy Lower stress on joints by using braces, splints, or canes as needed"
What are the most common surgeries performed to ease inflammation?,"'Some chronic inflammation requires surgical intervention to ease the pain and swelling. Below are a few common surgeries performed to give relief and make the patient feel better:' Arthroscopy: This is usually done to fix muscle or tissue tears, and is even sometimes performed to remove pieces of bone. Small cuts around the affected joint are done to insert thin instruments to fix damaged tissue. Osteotomy: This is done to remove part of the bone near a damaged or infected joint. Synovectomy: All or part of the lining of the joint is removed if it is inflamed or has grown too much. Arthrodesis: This is done to fuse bones together with pins or plates after a severe injury. Joint replacement: This is done to replace a damaged joint with an artificial one made of metal, plastic, or ceramic."
What is an anti-inflammatory diet?,"'An anti-inflammatory ''diet'' is a healthy diet that can reduce inflammation. Changing eating habits by emphasizing anti-inflammatory foods and avoiding inflammatory foods can control the bouts of inflammation.''Below are a few foods that have anti-inflammatory properties:''With an anti-inflammatory diet, you can improve your health and reduce your risk of disease caused by inflammation.' Vegetables and leafy vegetables, such as tomatoes and spinach Edible oil like olive oil Nuts (almonds, walnuts) Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, sardines) Fruits (berries, oranges)"
What is narcolepsy?,"'Narcolepsy''\xa0is a neurological disorder that affects your ability to ''sleep'' and\xa0wake up. People with\xa0''narcolepsy''\xa0have excessive, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. They may also suddenly fall asleep at any time, during any type of activity.''About in 1 in 2,000 Americans have some type of narcolepsy.''In the normal ''sleep'' cycle, there’s an early stage, then the deeper stage and finally rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is typical of 90 minutes. In narcolepsy, the person goes directly into the ''REM sleep'' almost immediately.''There are two types of narcolepsy:''People with narcolepsy do not sleep more than people without the sleep disorder.' Type 1: This type of narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and deficiency of a chemical substance in the brain known as hypocretin. This substance controls arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. Type 2: This type of narcolepsy is characterized by continuous excessive sleepiness without cataplexy. "
What are the five signs of narcolepsy?,"'The five classical signs of narcolepsy are:' Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS): This can be seen even after getting enough sleep. It is hard to perform any activities. Cataplexy: This means a sudden loss of muscle tone. This can cause problems such as slurred speech or total body collapse. Sleep paralysis: It is the inability to move upon awakening. Sleep paralysis last for few seconds to several minutes Hallucinations: They can occur either during sleep onset (hypnagogic) or during awakening (hypnopompic). Disrupted sleep: Sleep may be disturbed at night due to vivid dreams, breathing problems or body movements"
What causes narcolepsy?,"'The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown; however, specific genes that control the production of hypocretin may be linked with the disease.''Risk factors for narcolepsy include:' Age between 15 to 25 years Family history of narcolepsy Infections Brain injury or tumor Environmental toxins such as pesticides and heavy metal"
What are the narcolepsy-related conditions?,"'There are many conditions or behavior associated with narcolepsy that include:' Restless leg syndrome: It is a sleep disorder in which there’s an irresistible urge to move your legs. Sleep apnea/Snoring: It’s a sleep disorder that disrupts breathing while sleeping. Automatic behavior: In this, you may fall asleep while doing some activities like, walking, driving, or talking. You carry on the activity while asleep and wake up without any memory of the activity."
How does a physician diagnose narcolepsy?,'The diagnosis of narcolepsy involves:' Your doctor might perform a physical examination and may ask about your medical history and sleep history. Polysomnogram is a sleep study that requires you to stay at a sleep center overnight. Multiple sleep latency tests (MSLT) measures your day time sleepiness. Hypocretin level measurement involves measuring your hypocretin level.
How can narcolepsy be treated?,"'Narcolepsy doesn’t have any cure. But treatments that can ease the symptoms include:''Some lifestyle changes which can manage the symptoms are:' Stimulants to treat sleepiness. This includes methylphenidate, modafinil, armodafinil, solriamfetol, amphetamines.  Antidepressants  Xyrem (sodium oxybate) to treat cataplexy and EDS Wakix (pitolisant) to treat day time sleepiness Refrain from caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine Have small meals throughout the day rather than heavy meals at once. Maintain a sleep schedule; follow proper sleep hygiene, 7.5-8 hours of sleep every night. Exercise daily for 20 to 30 minutes Take power naps (15 to 20 minutes) during the day"
How long does narcolepsy last?,"'Narcolepsy is a life-long disorder and cannot be cured completely. However, it usually does not exacerbate with age.' "
What is Crohn’s disease?,"'Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract.

5 Types of insomnia,"'Acute insomnia''Acute insomnia is the most common type of insomnia. It is short term and lasts for a few days up to a month. It is also commonly called adjustment insomnia because it is usually caused by a change in environment or stressful events. Some common causes of acute insomnia are as follows:\xa0''Chronic insomnia''Insomnia is usually a transient or short-term condition. In some cases, insomnia can become chronic or long term. Insomnia is said to be chronic if the patient experiences difficulties in sleeping at least three days a week for at least a month. Chronic insomnia may be primary or secondary. Primary chronic insomnia is also called idiopathic insomnia because there is no specific cause. Secondary chronic insomnia is also called comorbid insomnia. Comorbid insomnia is more common than primary insomnia and occurs due to other underlying medical conditions (comorbidities).''Common causes of chronic insomnia include the following:''Maintenance insomnia''Maintenance insomnia is when the patient has difficulty staying asleep or waking up too early and difficulty going back to sleep. Maintenance insomnia may be caused by chronic medical conditions or psychological conditions such as ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or ''stress''. Some medical conditions that may cause maintenance insomnia are as follows:''Behavioral insomnia of childhood''Behavioral insomnia of childhood (BIC) can usually be managed with appropriate behavioral therapy. BIC has three subtypes:' New environment and unfamiliarity Excessive noise or light Extremes of temperature Uncomfortable bed or mattress New job or school Relocation to a new place Jet lag Work deadlines or examinations Death of a relative or close friend Difficulties in a relationship Physical discomfort such as pain  Certain medications Acute illness and allergies Chronic medical conditions such as acid reflux disease, thyroid disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain Psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder Medications such as anti-hypertensives (blood pressure [BP] medication), respiratory medications, anti-histamines, hormonal medication, anti-epileptic drugs (seizure medication), anti-depressants and chemotherapy The central nervous system (CNS) or brain stimulants such as nicotine and excessive caffeine Lifestyle factors such as frequent travel causing jet lag, constantly rotating shift work, irregular naps and sleep timings Nasal block and sinus allergies Age (Insomnia becomes more common with age) Onset insomnia Onset insomnia is difficulty initiating sleep. This type of insomnia may be short term or chronic. The common causes are as follows: CNS stimulants such as nicotine and excessive caffeine Change in environment and unfamiliarity Stress and anxiety Chronic pain Asthma and other respiratory conditions Nose block and sinus allergies  Restless leg syndrome Acid reflux disease Chronic pain BIC sleep-onset: It can usually be resolved with a few behavioral changes such as creating a healthy sleep routine or learning self-soothing or relaxation techniques. It occurs due to negative associations with sleep, such as needing to go to sleep by being rocked or nursed or watching TV while going to bed. BIC limit-setting: This occurs due to the child’s refusal to go to bed. BIC combined type: This is a combination of both BIC subtypes."
How is insomnia treated?,"'The treatment usually includes a combination of more than one treatment modality and uses a multi-disciplinary approach. Treatment options include the following:''Cognitive-behavioral therapy''Medication to treat insomnia:''Sedative-''hypnotic drugs'', sedating ''antidepressants'', ''antihistamines'', and other drugs may be prescribed by a physician.''Devices: ''FDA-approved prescription devices can be used in patients with insomnia.''Diet'' and ''exercise'':''Patients are advised the following:' Sleep hygiene education: This addresses behavior that is incompatible with sleep such as caffeine or alcohol use, environmental noise, inappropriate room temperature, and watching TV in bed. Cognitive therapy and relaxation therapy: This involves inculcating correct sleep beliefs, reducing stress and anxiety, relaxation exercises, and meditation. Acupressure and massage therapies can help in relaxation and reducing chronic pain. Stimulus-control therapy: This works by associating the bed with only sleepiness and when it is time to sleep. Sleep-restriction therapy: This is based on the fact that excessive time in bed can lead to insomnia. Hence, it is advised for adults to limit sleep time to around five to seven hours. To avoid caffeinated beverages in the late afternoon or evening To avoid alcohol in the evening To avoid large meals right before bedtime To exercise in the late afternoon or early evening (six hours before bedtime) can promote sleep"
What is schizophrenia?,"'Schizophrenia'' is a chronic, severe mental disorder which is one of the most disabling mental conditions. ''Schizophrenia'' affects the person’s perception of reality, thoughts, emotions, actions and their interaction with others. Patients often have difficulty maintaining relationships and performing at work or school. This is a lifelong disease with no cure but can be controlled with appropriate medical treatment and psychological therapy.\xa0''Schizophrenia'' involves psychosis characterized by ''hallucinations'' (seeing things which are not there), ''delusions'' (altered perception) and changes in personality and behavior. The patients are unable to distinguish between reality and their imagination. Patients eventually tend to lose touch with reality. They may become a danger to themselves or others.''The severity of schizophrenia varies in patients. Some patients have only one psychotic episode, whereas others have many recurring psychotic episodes. Some patients tend to have repeated cycles of psychotic episodes and periods of remission (asymptomatic periods) during which they can lead normal lives. Others show very little improvement between psychotic episodes.' "
What are the five types of schizophrenia?,"'There are five classical subtypes of schizophrenia''Paranoid schizophrenia''Paranoid schizophrenia is one of the most common forms of schizophrenia.''Symptoms include''Hebephrenic/disorganized schizophrenia''In this subtype of schizophrenia, the patient doesn’t have hallucinations or delusions.

What is breast cancer?,"'When the cells of the breast tissue grow at an abnormal rate and their growth cannot be controlled by the body’s immune system, it is called ''breast cancer''. \xa0When the ''cancer'' cells spread to other parts of the body, it is called metastasized ''breast cancer''. ''Breast cancer'' and its complications can affect nearly every part of the body. Breast ''cancer'' affects men as well, but at far lower rates.' "
What are the five warning signs and symptoms of breast cancer?,"'The majority of breast ''cancer'' patients first seek diagnosis because of a lump on the breast. This is one of the five warning signs of breast cancer:''Breast lump'': A hard, fixed mass or lump felt anywhere in the breast.''Changes to the ''nipple'' and the surrounding area'':\xa0Changes in the nipple area, nipple retraction and inverted nipple are common warning signs of breast cancer. Bloody discharge from the nipple is another warning sign.\xa0''Change in color and/or thickening of skin on the breast'':\xa0Any dimpling or thickening of breast skin that resembles an orange rind is a warning sign of breast cancer. If the breast skin changes color, typically to a pink or reddish hue that covers more than half the breast that may also be a warning sign.''A non-healing sore anywhere on the breast, including the nipple'':\xa0A red, scaly, flaky nipple, and any persistent skin change, including blood or fluid from the nipple with non-healing sore, may be a warning sign of breast cancer\xa0''Swelling of axillary ''lymph nodes'' (lymph nodes in the armpit)'':\xa0Many patients who end up diagnosed with breast cancer have swelling of lymph nodes in the armpit, they may or may not have changes in the structure of the breast, but they come in for a consult because they feel lump under their arm. This may mean that cancer from the breast has traveled to the\xa0lymph nodes, and now there is ''lymph node'' invasion.\xa0' "
What are the different types of breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer usually begins either in glands that produce milk (called\xa0lobular ''carcinoma''), or the ducts that carry it to the nipple (called\xa0ductal carcinoma). It can grow larger in the breast and spread to nearby lymph nodes or through your bloodstream to other organs.\xa0''The cancer may grow and invade other areas around your breast, such as your skin or chest wall. Different\xa0types of breast cancer\xa0grow and spread at different rates. Some take years to spread beyond your breast, while others grow and spread quickly.\xa0''There are several types of breast cancer, and they are broken into two main categories: “invasive” and “noninvasive,” (in situ). These two categories are used to describe the most common types of breast cancer, which include:' Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): DCIS is a noninvasive condition. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in the breast, and have not invaded the surrounding breast tissue. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):  LCIS is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of breast. Like DCIS, the cancer cells do not invade the surrounding tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): It is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in the milk producing ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma: It first develops in breast’s tubes and invades nearby tissues. Paget disease of the nipple: This type of breast cancer begins in the ducts of the nipple, but as it grows, it begins to affect the skin and areola of the nipple. Phyllodes tumor: This very rare type of breast cancer grows in the connective tissue of the breast. Most of these tumors are benign, but some are cancerous. Angiosarcoma: This cancer that grows on the blood and lymph vessels in the breast."
What are heart sounds?,'Heart'' sounds are generated by blood flowing in and out of the heart’s chambers through the valves as they open and close. Listening to the heart sounds through a stethoscope (auscultation) is one of the first steps a physician takes in evaluating a patient’s medical condition.''Heart sounds provide the doctor valuable information about ''heart function''. Auscultation is used to detect abnormal heart sounds and decide on further course of action.' 
How does the heart function?,"'The heart is a muscular organ and has four\xa0chambers that receive and pump blood:''The left ventricle’s contractions while pumping out blood create the systolic ''blood pressure'' in the arteries (the higher number in a blood pressure reading). A web of nerve tissue runs through the heart to send electric signals to the heart muscle to initiate the heart’s contraction.\xa0''Heart valves ensure that the flow of the blood is in only one direction, by opening and closing as the heart pumps blood. The four heart valves are' Right atrium Right ventricle Left atrium Left ventricle The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it into the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body through a network of arteries. The right atrium receives the oxygen-depleted blood from the body through veins and pumps it into the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs for oxygenation. Tricuspid valve separating right atrium and right ventricle Mitral valve separating left atrium and ventricle Pulmonic valve between right ventricle and pulmonary artery Aortic valve between the left ventricle and aorta"
What creates the heart sounds?,"'Blood flow creates vibrations in the heart chambers and valves which produce audible sounds that can be heard through a stethoscope. Smooth, low-resistance blood flow is called a laminar flow. When the flow is rough with high resistance it is known as a turbulent flow.''Vibrations increase along with blood flow turbulence and depend on the diameter of the blood vessel as well as the blood’s''Some of the functions of the heart that generate heart sounds are' viscosity density velocity Opening or closing of the heart valves Flow of blood through the valve opening Flow of blood into the heart’s ventricles Rubbing of cardiac surfaces"
What are the four heart sounds?,"'The cardiac cycle is made of two phases:\xa0''These two phases constitute the heartbeat.\xa0''In a healthy adult, the heart makes two sounds, commonly described as ‘lub’ and ‘dub.’\xa0''The third and fourth sounds may be heard in some healthy people, but can indicate impairment of the heart function. S1 and S2 are high-pitched and S3 and S4 are low-pitched sounds.''When the two ventricles contract and pump out blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery the mitral and tricuspid valves close to prevent the blood flowing back into the atria. The first sound S1 is generated by vibrations created by the closing of these two valves.''Normally the mitral valve closes just before the tricuspid valve, and when the two different sounds are detectable, it is called a “split S1.” A split S1 may be indicative of certain conditions affecting the heart.\xa0''After pumping the blood, the ventricles relax to receive blood from the atria, and the diastole phase starts. The aortic and pulmonic valves close and cause vibrations, giving rise to the second heart sound, S2. The increase in intensity of this sound may indicate certain conditions.''When the aortic valve closes just before the pulmonic valve, it may generate a split S2. This may indicate impairment in the heart function.''The third heart sound is a low-pitched sound audible with the rapid rush of blood from the atrium into the ventricle as it starts relaxing. This may be a normal sound in some people but in people with heart conditions, S3 may indicate ''heart failure''.''The fourth is a low-intensity sound heard just before S1 in the cardiac cycle. The sudden slowing of blood flow by the ventricle as the atrium contracts causes this sound, which may be a sign of ''heart disease''.' Systole while the ventricles contract to pump out blood  Diastole when the ventricles relax and fill with blood. "
Other heart sounds,"'Opening snap (OS) is a high-pitched sound that is caused by rapid opening of the mitral or tricuspid valve following the aortic valve closing sound (S2). This may indicate narrowing (stenosis) of the mitral or tricuspid valve; the closer in time the OS is to S2, the more severe the stenosis.''These sounds are heard during the early part of the ventricular contraction, which may be''In some people, ''heart murmurs'' are just the sound of blood flow characteristic to that person. Doctors call this an “innocent ''heart murmur''.” ''Heart murmur'' may also be caused by turbulent flow of blood across the heart valves, however, which may indicate ''heart disease''.' Valvular ejection sounds due to defects in the aortic or pulmonic valves  Vascular ejection sounds due to defects of the aortic or pulmonary artery Nonejection systolic click due to mitral or tricuspid valve prolapse"
What is the structure of the human heart?,"'The ''heart'' is a muscular organ situated in the chest just behind and slightly toward the left of the breastbone. It roughly measures the size of a closed fist. The heart works all the time, pumping blood through the network of blood vessels called the arteries and veins. The heart and its blood vessels are known as the ''cardiovascular system''.''The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are called the atria, whereas the lower two chambers are known as the ventricles. The ''right atrium'' and ''right ventricle'' are referred to as the right heart, whereas the ''left atrium'' and ''left ventricle'' are referred to as the ''left heart''. The various chambers of the heart are separated by partitions, each of which is called a septum.''The flow of blood into the heart, within the heart chambers and from the heart is guarded by the four valves present in the heart. The heart gets its nutrients and oxygen via the coronary arteries that run along the surface of the heart. It is also richly supplied by a web of nerve tissue that facilitates the rhythmic heartbeat. The heart is enclosed within a fluid-filled sac called the pericardium. The pericardium is a protective covering that produces fluid, which lubricates the heart and prevents friction between the heart and the surrounding organs.' The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle gets blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs to load it with oxygen. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle is the strongest chamber of the heart. It pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body."
What are the four main functions of the heart?,'The four main functions of the heart are:' Pumping oxygenated blood to the other body parts. Pumping hormones and other vital substances to different parts of the body. Receiving deoxygenated blood and carrying metabolic waste products from the body and pumping it to the lungs for oxygenation. Maintaining blood pressure.
What are the medical conditions related to the heart?,"'Some of the common diseases of the heart are:' Coronary artery disease (CAD): The narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the heart (coronary arteries). If the arteries develop complete blockage from a suddenly lodged blood clot, the condition is called a heart attack. Stable angina pectoris: Chest pain due to insufficient blood supply to the heart from doing strenuous physical activity. The reason is due to narrowed coronary arteries that are unable to supply sufficient oxygen-rich blood to the heart during exertion. Typically, there is relief from symptoms upon rest. Unstable angina pectoris: Chest pain or discomfort is new in onset, worsening or occurring even at rest. Unstable angina pectoris is an emergency as it may precede a heart attack, serious abnormal heart rhythm or cardiac arrest. Myocardial infarction (MI or heart attack): When a coronary artery is suddenly blocked, some of the heart muscles die as they are starved of oxygen. Arrhythmia (dysrhythmia): Ann abnormal heart rhythm, which may interfere with the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. Congestive heart failure (CHF): In CHF, the heart is unable to pump blood to body tissues efficiently. The term congestive heart failure refers to the collection of fluid because of a failing heart. Cardiomyopathy: A disease of the heart muscles, which makes the heart abnormally large, thickened and/or stiff. As a result, it weakens the ability of the heart to pump blood. Myocarditis: The inflammation of the heart muscles. Pericarditis: The Inflammation of the covering of the heart (pericardium). Pericardial effusion: In this medical condition, there is a collection of fluid between the covering of the heart (pericardium) and the heart itself. Heart valve diseases: Diseases that affect the valves that direct flow of blood to the heart. Cardiac arrest: A sudden cessation of heart function."
What are the four main types of psychotherapy?,"'There are various approaches to ''psychotherapy''. Which type of therapy will work best may vary from person to person. Therapists often use more than one type of psychotherapy approach in helping their clients. The four most common types of psychotherapy are as follows''1. ''Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapies: ''This psychotherapeutic approach is dedicated to changing the problematic behaviors, feelings and thoughts by discovering their unconscious meanings and motivations. This approach works in close partnership between the patient and doctor. ''Psychodynamic therapy'' analyzes the impact of life events (such as marriage, birth and death of a loved one), desires and past and current relationships on the person’s feelings and choices they make because of them. It involves the affected person and doctor working together to identify compromises the person made to defend themselves against painful thoughts or emotions. These compromises might have been made knowingly or unknowingly by the person. For example, a failed relationship may make a person believe that all relationships will be painful. They may seclude themselves because of such beliefs and keep struggling with this fear of being cheated on or hurt. Psychodynamic therapy helps discover such links and makes the person know themselves better. This will help the person overcome their fears and do better in life. An American ''neurologist'', Sigmund Freud, developed the process of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis is focused on uncovering the unconscious roots of a person’s symptoms and helps them apply this understanding to their life. Psychoanalysis may be short term or long term. It may focus broadly or more narrowly on a particular issue or symptom a person is having. The therapy also focuses on the person’s interaction with the people around them. It enables a person to better understand their needs in a relationship, healthy and unhealthy ways of meeting those needs and what they can do to improve their ability to express or communicate. This can help people manage life events such as the ''loss of a loved one'' or a relationship and disturbances within their relationships. They also become better equipped to meet the demands of shifting roles such as retirement or caring for a parent or a ''newborn''.''2. ''Behavioral therapy: '""This psychotherapeutic approach is based on the principle that all types of behaviors are learned and unhealthy or harmful behaviors can be changed. It focuses on exploring the reasons behind the development of both normal and abnormal behaviors in a person. A classic example of behavioral therapy is Ivan Pavlov's famous experiment where he found that the ""'dogs'' began ''drooling'' when they heard their dinner bell because they associated the sound of the bell with food. Behavioral therapy has several approaches including:''3. ''Cognitive therapy (CT): ''This was developed by an American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck. It is focused on cognition (what a person thinks) rather than actions (what they do). It is based on the principle that harmful or dysfunctional thinking leads to dysfunctional emotions or behaviors. It focuses on changing the person to change the way they feel and what they do.''4. ''Humanistic therapy: ''This type of therapy is focused on valuing a person’s capacity to make rational choices and develop to their maximum potential. It emphasizes the idea of respect and concern for others. Humanistic therapy is often “client-centered,” which means it devalues the idea of therapists as authorities of their clients’ inner experiences. It is like a partnership where therapists help their clients change by emphasizing their concern, care and interest.' Cognitive behavioral therapy: This focuses on changing the thoughts and beliefs that are causing problems with the person’s mood and actions.  Aversion therapy: This therapy involves teaching the person to associate a desirable but unhealthy stimulus with an extremely unpleasant stimulus. For example, the person may associate alcohol or drug use with an unpleasant memory. Systematic desensitization: This helps people overcome phobias through various relaxation techniques."
What is COPD?,'COPD'' (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'') is a group of diseases that cause an inflammatory reaction and irreversible damage in the ''lungs''. The result is obstruction of normal airflow and ''breathing'' difficulties. ''Emphysema'' and ''chronic bronchitis'' are the most common diseases that ''makeup'' ''COPD''. ''COPD'' is a lifelong disease with periods of flare-ups. It negatively impacts the quality of life and longevity.' 
What happens in COPD?,"'During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into tubes called bronchi. The bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. The ends of bronchioles open into little air sacs called alveoli, which aid in ''gas'' exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels through which the exchange of gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, take place.''Exposure to the causative factors of COPD lead to the infiltration of different types of white blood cells and inflammatory factors. This leads to tissue inflammation, damage, and increased ''mucus'' secretion in the ''airway'' and alveoli.' Emphysema: Emphysema is a disease of the alveoli. There is irreversible damage to the alveoli making them less elastic. There is decreased exchange of gases leading to decreased oxygen in the blood. Eventually patients have severe difficulty breathing. Chronic bronchitis: Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchus. The trachea can also be involved. Inflammation due to irritants causes inflammation leading to an increase in the number and size of mucus secreting glands. There is also damage to the airway cilia, which are small hair like structures that help clear mucus. As a result, there is also decreased clearance of mucus which accumulates and thickens, causing airway obstruction. Chronic inflammation also leads to narrowing of the airways."
What are the causes of COPD?," Tobacco smoking: accounts for 90% COPD risk Environmental factors:Passive smokingIndoor cooking with poor ventilationAir pollutionExposure to chemicalsExposure to industrial dust and fumes Passive smoking Indoor cooking with poor ventilation Air pollution Exposure to chemicals Exposure to industrial dust and fumes Intravenous drug abuse Infections, such as HIV Genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency"
What are the four stages of COPD?, Stage I: Mild COPD Stage II: Moderate COPD Stage III: Severe COPD Stage IV: Very severe COPD
What are the signs and symptoms of COPD?,"'The signs and symptoms and the severity depend on the stage of COPD. They worsen during flare ups.''STAGE I:''Symptoms are mild and often missed but the damage to the lungs begins. Symptoms include:''STAGE II:''STAGE III:''Stage III has a bigger impact on the quality of life. The symptoms in stage III worsen considerably. Additional symptoms include:''STAGE IV:''This is the final stage of COPD. Occurs after years of continuous damage to the lungs. Patients have worsened symptoms of stage III and frequent flare ups that are sometimes fatal. Patients have a very poor quality of life.\xa0 Symptoms include:' Persistent cough, which could be dry or accompanied with mucus that is clear, white, yellow or green Shortness of breath on exertion Persistent cough with mucus that may be worse in the morning Shortness of breath even with mild routine activity Wheezing on exertion Disturbed sleep Fatigue Frequent respiratory tract infections Swelling of the ankles, feet and legs Tightness in the chest Trouble taking a deep breath  Wheezing and other breathing issues when doing basic tasks Barrel shaped chest Constant wheezing Being out of breath Delirium Increased heart rate/heartbeat Loss of appetite and weight Increased blood pressure"
How is COPD diagnosed?,"'The physician may recommend a series of blood and radiological tests, including a ''chest X-ray''. A gold-standard test for COPD is the pulmonary (lung) function test (PFT).' "
How is COPD treated?," Short-term and long-term bronchodialators (inhalers) Oral steroids or steroid inhalers Medication to clear and thin the mucus, and clear the airway Antibiotics for infection Stop smoking and avoid exposure to other irritants Pulmonary rehabilitation Oxygen therapy Surgery in severe cases, including a lung transplant may be required Breathing exercises"
What is the prognosis of COPD?,"'COPD is not curable in any stage of the disease. With early diagnosis and treatment, the disease progression and flare-ups can be controlled and longevity optimized. Patients can live a good quality of life and are encouraged to ''exercise'' as is possible. The patients must ''quit smoking'' and avoid exposure to other environmental factors.''\xa0' "
What is diabetic retinopathy?,"'Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that affects a person with ''diabetes''. This happens when ''high blood sugar'' levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. In some, the blood vessels swell and leak or can obstruct the blood flow whereas, in some, there may be a growth of abnormal new vessels on the surface of the retina. All these changes can lead to vision loss or permanent blindness. Diabetic retinopathy usually affects both eyes.' "
What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?,"'Diabetic retinopathy hardly manifests any symptoms during the early stages. As the diabetic retinopathy progresses, the following symptoms may be observed:' Blurry vision Losing vision Poor night vision Noticing colors appear faded or washed out Increased number of floaters Seeing blank or dark areas the field of vision A vision that sometimes changes from blurry to clear"
How is diabetic retinopathy treated?,"'Treatment of diabetic retinopathy mainly involves controlling blood ''sugar'' levels. When diabetic retinopathy progresses to diabetic macular edema, the eye specialist may prescribe various treatment options, which include:''Regular eye check-ups are necessary to prevent vision loss and further eye complications.' Injecting the anti-VEGF medications that include Avastin, Eylea, and Lucentis into the eye to reduce swelling and improve vision Steroid injections may also help to reduce macular swelling Laser surgery might help seal the leaking blood vessels Vitrectomy may be recommended in advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy"
What is HIV?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') attacks the cells of the immune system. The CD4+ cells help the body to resist any infections. With a lack of these cells, the body is less resistant, which makes it vulnerable to other infections and diseases. ''HIV'' spreads mainly via body fluids (blood and semen) from the infected person.''If untreated, ''HIV'' can lead to ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS''). Hence, treating HIV with antiretroviral therapy (ART, HIV medicine) is necessary to reduce the viral load and prevent transmission of HIV to the patient’s sexual partners.' "
What are the four stages of HIV?,"'The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into four stages''The normal CD4+ cell count should be between 500 and 1600 cells per microliter. The higher the CD4+ cell count, the lower the chances of opportunistic diseases.\xa0' Stage 1 (HIV infection): The CD4+ cell count is at least 500 cells per microliter. Stage 2 (HIV infection): The CD4+ cell count is 350 to 499. Stage 3 (advanced HIV disease or AHD): The CD4+ cell count is 200 to 349. Stage 4 (Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]): The CD4+ cell count is less than 200."
How is HIV transmitted?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted by coming in direct contact with certain body fluids of the person infected with HIV. These fluids are as follows''Transmission only occurs when the fluid gets into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through open sores or ''cuts'', by direct injection or a ''mucus'' membrane.''The most common ways of spreading HIV are as follows''Hence, taking precautions either while having sex or sharing a needle is the best way to prevent HIV.' Blood Semen Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk Having anal or vaginal sex with an HIV-positive person Sharing needles with a person who has HIV Less common ways are as follows During pregnancy or breastfeeding Having oral sex Receiving blood products that are contaminated with HIV Getting stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle"
What are the symptoms of HIV?,"'Not everyone will have identical symptoms because it depends on the person and what stage of the disease they are in.''There are three stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Each stage has a unique set of symptoms. These include the following''This stage starts around two to four weeks after getting HIV. The symptoms are similar to those of the ''flu'', which last for a week or two. Symptoms include the following''In this stage, the virus multiplies at a low level and people may not experience any symptoms at all. Without HIV treatment, the person can remain in this stage for 10 to 15 years. However, the virus remains active during this stage.''If left untreated, HIV leads to ''AIDS''. ''AIDS'' can weaken the immune system causing several opportunistic diseases. Symptoms include the following' Fever Rash Sore throat Swollen glands Headache Upset stomach Joint aches and pains Muscle pain Unexplainable weight loss Recurring fever Getting tired easily Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin or neck Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week Sores of the mouth, anus or genitals Pneumonia Memory loss and depression Purplish spots on the skin that don’t go away Night sweats Bruises or bleeding due to an unknown reason"
What are the types of HIV tests?,"'There are three types of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests used to diagnose HIV infections, which are' Antibody tests: These tests check for HIV antibodies in the blood or oral fluid. Antigen/antibody tests: These help to detect both HIV antibodies and antigens in the blood. Nucleic acid tests: These look for HIV in the blood."
What is the treatment for HIV?,"'The treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) involves a combination of medications known as antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART cannot cure HIV; however, it can increase the survival rate of patients.''ART halts the multiplication of the virus and reduces the amount of virus in the body to help the patient stay healthier.''Once the treatment has been started, the patient must remain compliant with the dosage for the medicines to be effective. Noncompliance can result in developing resistance to the medicines.' "
What is osteoarthritis?,"'Osteoarthritis'' (OA), also called ""wear and tear"" ''arthritis'' or ''degenerative joint disease'', is a common joint disease affecting over 32.5 million US adults. The joints affected with OA are painful—sometimes swollen and sometimes stiff.\xa0''Most people above 60 years have some degree of OA, which is a top cause of disability in older people. However, OA also affects people in their 20s and 30s.''OA occurs in the knees, spine, hips, hand joints, and big toes. In your entire lifetime, you have a 46% chance of OA of the knee and a 25% chance of OA of the hip.''OA is a chronic disease that develops gradually and worsens over time. There is no cure for the disease, but some treatments can slow its progression.' "
What is the main cause of osteoarthritis?,"'Every joint has a firm material known as the cartilage that cushions the ends of the bone. This helps in reducing friction between the bones in a joint.''Due to ''aging'' or a joint injury, the cartilage is more likely to wear and tear. Further deterioration of the cartilage can make the bones rub against each other, giving rise to ''painful joint'' movements.' "
What puts you at risk of osteoarthritis?,"'Osteoarthritis'' (OA) can occur at any age. However, certain things that put you at risk of getting it include the following:' Older age Family history of OA Obesity Trauma to the joint Repeated overuse of the joints over the years Joint deformity (Maybe by birth or that has developed over the years) Being a woman (More likely to develop OA than men, especially after menopause) Weak bones (Osteoporosis)"
What are the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis?,'Osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms can vary greatly among patients. These include:' Joint pain (While bending and even at rest over time) Joint stiffness Swelling at the joint Crepitus (Cracking noise) with joint movement Loss of joint flexibility
What are the four stages of osteoarthritis?,"'The four stages of osteoarthritis (OA) have been graded on the basis of X-ray findings. Higher grades indicate more severe signs of OA and the need for surgery.''The symptoms experienced at each stage may vary from individual to individual. Some people have few symptoms despite the deterioration of their joints. Others experience ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' that hamper their routine chores.''Delay in the treatment will progress the OA increasing the severity of the symptoms. Hence, it is vital to consult your doctor when you experience frequent joint ''pain'' or stiffness.\xa0' Grade 0 is the stage when the joint is healthy—there are no signs on X-ray. Grade 1: Doubtful narrowing of the joint space with possible bone spurs (tiny pointed bony growth) Grade 2: Definite bone spurs with possible reduced joint space Grade 3: Definite moderate joint space narrowing (at least 50%)Multiple bone spurs presentPossible deformity of the bone contour Multiple bone spurs present Possible deformity of the bone contour Grade 4: Most severe stage of OALarge bone spursDramatic reduction in the joint spaceDefinite deformity of the bone contour Large bone spurs Dramatic reduction in the joint space Definite deformity of the bone contour"
What happens when you have an allergic reaction?,"'Allergic'' reactions are exaggerated sensitivities (hypersensitive reactions) that occur when your immune system responds abnormally to common substances such as ''pollen'', dust and certain foods.\xa0''These substances, called allergens, are harmless in a majority of people.\xa0 But for those who are allergic, they can cause reactions upon skin contact or when they are breathed, swallowed or injected.\xa0''Allergic reactions are quite common and may happen seconds to hours after contact with the ''allergen''. Some reactions may take more than 24 hours to appear. Though many allergic reactions are mild, others may be dangerous or life-threatening. They may be localized, involving a small part of the body or may affect a large area or the whole body.''Certain metal jewellery or certain ''cosmetics'' may cause skin ''rash'' in some, for example. Others sneeze uncontrollably on exposure to dust or pollen.\xa0''An ''allergic reaction'' begins when you touch, inhale or swallow an allergen. In response to this trigger, the body starts making a type of protein called IgE or immunoglobulin E.\xa0''IgE molecules bind with the allergen molecules in an antigen-antibody reaction. This attachment of the antigen and antibody leads to the release of some chemicals (such as histamine) in the body. These chemicals cause the inflammatory symptoms of allergic reactions such as ''rashes'', ''itching'' and ''sneezing''.\xa0' "
What are the four types of allergic reactions?,"'Two British immunologists, Coombs and Gell, have classified allergic reactions into four types, Type I, II, III and IV.\xa0''Type I, II and III allergic reactions are called immediate types of allergic reactions because they occur within twenty-four hours of exposure to the allergen. Type IV reactions typically occur after 24 hours of exposure and are called delayed allergic reactions.\xa0''Type I or anaphylactic reactions'': Type I reactions are mediated by proteins called IgE antibodies produced by the immune system. These are produced in response to the allergens such as pollen, animal dander or dust mites, or even certain foods. This causes the release of histamine and other chemicals causing inflammation and swelling. Examples of type I\xa0allergic\xa0reactions include\xa0''Anaphylaxis is the most severe form and is a medical emergency because it can lead to a sudden, life-threatening respiratory failure. People with anaphylaxis have extreme difficulty in ''breathing'', swelling, ''low blood pressure'', bluish skin and shock.\xa0''Type II or cytotoxic reactions'': This type of allergic reaction is mediated by proteins called IgG and IgM antibodies. The antibodies involved in type II reaction damage cells by activating a component of immunity called the complement system. Type II\xa0allergic\xa0reactions\xa0can be seen in certain conditions like\xa0''Type III or immunocomplex reactions'': Type III reactions are also mediated by proteins i.e. IgM and IgG antibodies. These antibodies react with the allergen to form immunocomplexes (antigen-antibody complexes). These complexes are responsible for the reaction. Type III allergic reactions can be seen in\xa0''Type IV or cell-mediated reactions'': Type IV allergic reactions are also called the delayed type of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions as they occur after at least 24 hours of exposure to the allergen. These reactions typically take 48-72 hours or longer to appear after contact with the allergen. Many long-term infectious diseases, such as ''tuberculosis'' and ''fungal infections'', show cell-mediated reactions. Certain skin sensitivity reactions esp. to metals may also belong to this type.' bronchial asthma,  allergic rhinitis,  allergic dermatitis,  food allergies,  allergic conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and  anaphylaxis (allergic shock).  autoimmune hemolytic anemia,  immune thrombocytopenia and  autoimmune neutropenia. lupus,  serum sickness and  Arthus reaction."
What are the triggers of allergic reactions?,"'Substances that trigger an allergic reaction are called allergens. They include:' Dust mites Animal/pet dander Pollen Bee/wasp stings Certain medications such as penicillin and penicillin-based antibiotics  Certain foods such as soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, milk and wheat Mold Latex Certain metals Some plants"
What is asthma?,"'Asthma'' is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways (bronchi). Bronchi generally allow for the passage of air in and out of the ''lungs''. In ''asthma'', these airways develop hypersensitivity, inflammation, and narrowing. This causes difficulty in ''breathing''. In the United States, approximately 26 million adults and 7 million children are affected by ''asthma''.''Asthma can be classified into four types based on the severity of the disease, which includes:''The typical characteristics of this type are:''The typical characteristics of this type are:''The typical characteristics of this type of asthma are similar to those of mild persistent asthma.''In this type of asthma, the symptoms worsen continuously resulting in limitation of activities.\xa0' Symptoms are mild that occur less than twice a week Nighttime symptoms occur less than twice a month  Few asthma attacks occur   Symptoms occur three to six times a week Nighttime symptoms occur three to four times a month Asthma attacks may affect activities"
What is the main cause of asthma?,"'Several factors may cause asthma. Based on the triggers that cause an asthma episode, asthma can be classified as:''Asthma may also be triggered by\xa0' Exercise-induced asthma: Exercise can worsen the symptoms of asthma. Simple exercise may exacerbate the symptoms in people with highly inflamed airways. Nocturnal asthma: Aggravation of asthma at night is common in people with nocturnal asthma. Occupational asthma: Exposure to dirt, chemicals, and irritants in the workplace can induce asthma. Steroid-resistant asthma: Some severe cases of asthma may not respond to steroid therapy (steroid resistance). Allergic asthma: Allergens such as pollen, mite, dust, mold, latex, and pets can trigger asthma in some people. Nonallergic asthma: Extreme weather, stress, and infections such as sinusitis, colds, and the flu could be some of the trigger factors that induce nonallergic asthma. Aspirin-induced asthma: Aspirin may induce asthma symptoms in some people. Eosinophilic asthma: High levels of white blood cells called eosinophils can cause this type of asthma. Air pollution Tobacco smoke Gastroesophageal disease (like GERD) Intense emotions such as anxiety, laughter, sadness, or stress Sulfites, which are used as a food preservative in shrimp, pickles, beer, wine, dried fruits, and bottled lemon and lime juices"
What are the symptoms of asthma?,"'Recognizing the symptoms early and treating it is of utmost importance. The three major signs of asthma are ''airway'' obstruction, inflamed airways, and sensitive airways.''Early warning signs of asthma, which occur before an episode, include:''An asthma episode, also known as an ''asthma attack'' or asthma flare-up, is characterized by\xa0' Sneezing Headache Runny/stuffy nose Coughing Throat itching Feeling tired Difficulty sleeping Dark circles under the eyes Mood swings Breathing changes Less tolerance for exercise Coughing Wheezing or whistling  Shortness of breath Tightness in the chest"
When to consult a doctor for asthma?,"'If any of the below severe asthma symptoms occur, seek emergency medical treatment immediately:' Severe coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness Fast or slow breathing Cyanosis (blue-colored or pale face, lips or fingernails) Difficulty walking Hunched shoulders Difficulty speaking or concentrating Retraction (ribs or stomach that move inwards while breathing) Rapid movement of nostrils"
How is asthma treated? ,"'There is no cure for asthma, however, asthma symptoms can be managed by lifestyle modifications and treatment.''Asthma treatment includes:''These are usually in the form of inhaler pumps and nebulizers.''Asthma symptoms can be managed by bringing some lifestyle modifications:''With timely treatment and management, asthma symptoms can be controlled and complications can be prevented.' Inhaled corticosteroids,  Leukotriene modifiers,   Theophylline,  Short-acting beta-agonists and  Anticholinergics Exercise regularly Avoid asthma triggers Stay fit and healthy Practicing yoga may help to control symptoms"
What is breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is the disease in which cells in the breast grow out-of-control, displacing normal breast cells. \xa0When ''breast cancer'' spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastasized ''breast cancer''. Breast ''cancer'' and its complications can affect nearly every part of the body. Although breast ''cancer'' predominantly occurs in women, it can also affect men.' "
What are the four types of breast cancer?,"'Breast ''cancer'' may be called\xa0lobular ''carcinoma'' if it begins in glands that make milk, or\xa0ductal carcinoma if it begins in the ducts that carry milk to the ''nipple''. The cancer may grow and invade other areas around the breast, such as skin or chest wall.\xa0''Different\xa0types of breast cancer\xa0grow and spread at different rates. Both types of breast cancer may be invasive or non-invasive.''Apart from above four types, below are few less-common types of breast cancer:\xa0' Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): DCIS is a noninvasive condition. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in the breast and have not invaded the surrounding breast tissue. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): LCIS is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of the breast. Like DCIS, the cancer cells do not invade the surrounding tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): It is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in the milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside milk ducts, it can spread to other nearby organs and tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma first develops in lobules of the breast (milk glands) and then invades nearby tissues. Paget disease of the nipple: This type of breast cancer begins in the ducts of the nipple, but as it grows, it begins to affect the skin and area of the nipple. Phyllodes tumor: This very rare type of breast cancer grows in the connective tissue of the breast. Most of these tumors are benign, but some are cancerous. Angiosarcoma: This cancer that grows on the blood and lymph vessels in the breast."
What are the common warning signs and symptoms of breast cancer?," Lump in the breast or armpit discovered during bathing may be the first symptom of breast cancer Changes to the nipple and the surrounding area like nipple retraction and inverted nipple. Bloody discharge from nipple: If an individual notices blood stains on the bra, and if the secretions are unusual, they may need urgent medical attention.  Change in color and/or thickening of skin on the breast, dimpling or thickening of breast skin that resembles an orange rind is a warning sign of breast cancer. If the breast skin changes color, typically to a pink or reddish hue that covers more than half the breast, that may also be a warning sign. A non-healing sore anywhere on the breast, including the nipple: A red, scaly, flaky nipple, and any persistent skin change, including blood or fluid from the nipple with non-healing sore, may be a warning sign of breast cancer. Increased warmth in the breast Pain, itching or tenderness in the breast"
What are the treatment options for breast cancer?,"'Below are some common treatment options to combat breast cancer:' Lumpectomy is when the doctor removes the tumor while leaving the breast intact. Mastectomy is when the doctor surgically removes all the breast tissue including the tumor and connecting tissue and the lymph nodes. Chemotherapy is the most common cancer treatment, and it involves the use of anticancer drugs. These drugs interfere with the ability of the cells to reproduce. Radiation uses X-rays to treat cancer directly. Hormone and targeted therapy can be used when either genes or hormones play a part in the growth of cancer cells. The therapy targets a specific protein on the tumor cells."
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Diabetic neuropathy'' is a common complication of type 1 and ''type 2 diabetes''. ''Diabetic neuropathy'' can be extremely painful. It can also lead to life-threatening health conditions like foot ulcers, amputations, ''heart attacks'', ''digestion'' problems, and ''low blood sugar''. Neuropathy mainly occurs due to ''high blood sugar'' for a prolonged period.' "
What are the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms of ''diabetic neuropathy'' differ in different types of neuropathy, which include:''Peripheral neuropathy'': Symptoms include:''Autonomic neuropathy'': It affects the ''digestive system'', blood vessels, urinary system, and sex organs.

How is lung cancer diagnosed?,"'Doctors use various diagnostic procedures and tests to diagnose lung cancer. These include:' A history and physical examination of the patient. This may help in identifying symptoms or signs that may point to lung cancer.  The chest X-ray is usually the first test ordered in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Chest X-rays may reveal problematic areas in the lungs, but cannot confirm the presence of cancer. Computerized tomography (CT) scans may be performed on the chest, abdomen, and/or brain to examine for both metastatic and lung tumors.   A spiral CT scan can be done as an annual screening test in chronic tobacco smokers between ages 55 and 80. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are ordered when precise detail about a tumor's location is needed.  Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a specialized imaging technique that uses special (radioactive) drugs to produce a three-dimensional colored image of the tissues within the body. PET scans can check whether a tumor tissue is actively growing and map its location inside the organ. Bone scans are used to create images of bones on a computer screen or on film. Doctors may perform a bone scan to check if the lung cancer has spread to the bones. Sputum cytology:  The sputum of the patient is examined under a microscope to check if there are any malignant cells.   Bronchoscopy: This test involves visualizing the airways through a thin probe inserted through the nose or mouth.  A sample can be removed from the suspicious tissue to be examined in the laboratory. Needle biopsy: Needle is inserted into the chest to remove a small sample of your lung for examination under the microscope. Thoracentesis: This involves the drawing or aspiration of a sample of fluid from the chest with a thin needle . This fluid is examined and a diagnosis is made. Blood tests: While routine blood tests alone cannot diagnose lung cancer, they reveal other abnormalities that occur with lung cancer. Molecular testing: This is an advanced test to find out the genetic composition of a patient’s lung cancer. This helps in giving highly specialized medicines that target a specific protein on the tumor. Major surgical procedures: Surgical methods are the last option when all other tests fail to provide the correct diagnosis. "
What is the best treatment for lung cancer?,"'Treatment options for lung cancer may include surgery, ''radiation'', ''chemotherapy'', targeted therapy, immunotherapy, participation in ''clinical trials'', and/or palliative care.\xa0''Doctors can decide the best treatment for a patient depending upon on:\xa0' The type of lung cancer The stage of the lung cancer The overall health status of the patient"
How long can you live with lung cancer?,"'Doctors use lung ''cancer survival'' rates to predict the percentage of people who survive a certain type cancer for a specific amount of time. It is based on a subset of the population and does not predict the number of years a particular individual will actually survive. However, in a study conducted by Wao H et al, it was found that untreated lung cancer patients live on an average of 7.15 months.\xa0''The survival rates for lung cancer are as follows:' The lung cancer’s five-year survival rate (18.6%) is lower than many cancers of other organs, such as colorectal (64.5%), breast (89.6%), and prostate (98.2%). The five-year survival rate for lung cancer is 56% when the cancer is only present in the lung.  If the lung cancer has spread to other organs (metastasis), the five-year survival rate is only 5%. More than half of people with lung cancer die within one year of their diagnosis."
What is lupus?,"'Lupus'' is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue. It affects joints, skin, brain, ''lungs'', kidneys and blood vessels, leading to inflammation and tissue damage of the affected organs.' "
What are the four types of lupus?,'The four types of ''lupus'' are:' Lupus dermatitis: Lupus affecting the skin in the form of a rash. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): This type of lupus affects the internal organs and is the most serious type. Drug-induced lupus: This type of lupus occurs as a result of an overreaction to certain medications such as Apresoline (hydralazine) or quinidine and Pronestyl  (procainamide). It is similar to SLE. Neonatal lupus: Lupus affecting an infant as a result of passively acquiring antibodies from a mother with SLE.
How does a person get lupus?,"'The exact cause of SLE is unknown, however, risk factors that increase your chances of getting Lupus\xa0 Genetic and hormonal factors\xa0' Exposure to UV rays Microbial response Certain medications Silica dust Cigarette smoking Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight) Family history of SLE Female sex Chronic infections Use of estrogen in women undergoing menopause Vitamin D deficiency Pregnancy and breastfeeding have shown to decrease the risk of SLE. Women of childbearing ages (15-44 years) High-risk ethnic backgrounds such as African Americans, Asians, Hispanics and Caucasians. Low birth weight (<2,500 g) Preterm birth (birth that occurs before the 37th week of pregnancy) Exposure to pesticides during childhood"
What is usually the first sign of lupus?,"'Fatigue'', ''fever'', ''joint pain'' and weight changes are usually the first signs of lupus. Some adults may have a period of SLE symptoms known as flares, which may occur frequently, sometimes even years apart and resolve at other times—called remission. Other symptoms include:''Apart from the above symptoms, ''nausea'', ''indigestion'', ''abdominal pain'' and ''confusion'' may also be seen in some patients.' Sun sensitivity Oral ulcers Arthritis Seizure Blood cell and immunological abnormalities Loss of appetite Muscle aches Alopecia (hair loss) Facial rash (butterfly rash) Chest pain caused due to inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lung (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis) Raynaud’s phenomenon (poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure) Vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)"
What are the complications of Lupus?,'The complications that accompany SLE are as follows:' Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) Lupoid hepatitis (liver disease) Fibromyalgia (muscle pain and tenderness) Pancreatitis (inflammation in pancreas) Infections Coronary heart disease (damage or disease in the heart’s major artery) Blood clots Kidney failure
How is lupus treated?,"'There is no cure for SLE. Management of SLE depends on disease severity and disease manifestations.\xa0''Hydroxychloroquine'' is effective in the long-term treatment of SLE. Immunosuppressive medicines help to inhibit the activity of the immune system, which can also be useful in treating SLE.\xa0''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') and ''corticosteroids'' help to treat inflammation and ''pain'' in the muscles, joints and other tissues.' "
Can a person die from lupus?,"'Lupus along with other medical conditions can be a contributing cause of death. Mainly, secondary conditions such as kidney diseases, heart diseases can be contributing factors.' "
What does a lower-extremity amputation mean?,"'Lower-extremity amputation'' is the removal of a part/s of the lower limb. It is one of the oldest known surgeries.\xa0''Humans in the stone age have been known to survive amputations arising out of injuries, rituals, and punishments. Cave-wall hand imprints showing the loss of fingers or toes have been also found. Unearthed mummies have been found buried with cosmetic replacements for amputated limbs.''With advancements in the field of medical science and technology, surgical amputations with the postoperative prosthesis are typically performed after all other options have been exhausted. The goal is to preserve as much of the limb and surgical reconstruction that maintains the most functionality. Amputation is done when the removal of the diseased limb becomes necessary to eliminate toxins from the body and save the patient’s life.''The number of amputations in the United States is expected to increase from 1.6 million in 2005 to 3.6 million in 2050. Whatever the reason for performing an amputation, it should not be viewed as a failure of treatment. Amputation can be the treatment of choice for a severe injury, vascular diseases (e.g., ''deep vein thrombosis'' or ''DVT'') and tumors.\xa0''Having an amputation should not be considered a path that leads to physical restriction or dependence.\xa0 After the removal of a diseased limb and the application of an appropriate prosthesis, the person can resume an independent lifestyle.\xa0''A team of healthcare providers consisting of a surgeon, primary care physician, physical therapist, prosthetist, and counselor works with the patient. They teach the patient to lead an independent life by training them about how to walk with a prosthesis, apply and remove the prosthesis, care for the prosthesis, monitor the skin and the presence of any pressure points, walk on difficult terrain, and use the toilet at night.'

What are the levels of lower-extremity amputations?,"'The various levels of lower-extremity amputations are as follows:' Foot, including toes or partial foot Ankle disarticulation (at the ankle) Transtibial (below the knee) Knee disarticulation (at the knee) Transfemoral (above the knee) Hip disarticulation (at the hip)"
Who needs a lower-extremity amputation?,"'Amputation may be performed for diseased limbs and devastating lower-extremity injuries for which attempts to save and reconstruct may be lengthy, and emotionally and financially costly with an unacceptable result. The indications are as follows:' Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): A blood circulation disorder that causes the blood vessels in the limbs to narrow, block or spasm, it is one of the leading indications for limb amputation in the United States. Severe injuries (e.g., crush injury) Tumors Infections Birth defects"
What are the common complications of a lower extremity amputation?,'The common complications of a lower extremity amputation include the following:' Wound breakdown and skin problems Swelling Infections Joint contractures (a condition in which the joint becomes deformed and stiff leading to pain and loss of movement) Pain Phantom limb sensation (a sensation experienced by someone who has had a limb amputated that the limb is still there)
When are thoracic incisions performed?,"'A thoracic incision is a surgical cut made on the chest (thorax) to get access to the space between the ''lungs'' and chest wall.''Through a thoracic incision, the surgeon can get access to the organs in the chest (thoracic organs) such as the lungs, ''heart'', or food pipe (''esophagus''), the\xa0thoracic ''aorta'' (part of the aorta, the major blood vessel, in the chest) or the spine. The appropriate thoracic incision is the one that will provide the best exposure to the region of the chest being addressed in a given procedure.''Thoracic incisions are performed in patients undergoing surgeries for the following conditions:' Lung cancer Noncancerous lung masses Disorders of the heart Aortic aneurysm (ballooning or bulging of the aorta at certain weak areas in its wall) Aortic dissection/transection (tears in or rupture of the aorta) Tumors in the spine Tumors in the esophagus Chest injuries"
What are the main types of thoracic incisions?,"'There are various types of thoracic incisions depending upon the organ or structure in the chest that has to be operated upon. The surgeon decides which incision to make for the organ. An important guiding principle in giving a thoracic incision is the preservation of the chest wall function and appearance to the extent possible.''The various types of thoracic incisions are as follows:' Sternotomy: It is made over the breastbone (sternum). Different types of sternotomy incisions are:Median sternotomy: This incision is made in the midline along the length of the sternum. It is the incision of choice for most surgical procedures on the heart. It gives excellent exposure of the heart, covering of the heart (pericardium), great vessels, thymus, and lower part of the windpipe (trachea). This incision is quick to perform and less painful compared with a thoracotomy incision.Reoperative or repeat sternotomyPartial sternotomy Median sternotomy: This incision is made in the midline along the length of the sternum. It is the incision of choice for most surgical procedures on the heart. It gives excellent exposure of the heart, covering of the heart (pericardium), great vessels, thymus, and lower part of the windpipe (trachea). This incision is quick to perform and less painful compared with a thoracotomy incision. Reoperative or repeat sternotomy Partial sternotomy Thoracotomy: It is the most widely used for thoracic procedures. It is of four major types:In posterolateral thoracotomies, the incision runs toward the back and side of the chest.In anterolateral (anterior) thoracotomies, the incision runs toward the front and/or side of the chest.In axillary thoracotomies, the incision is made on the armpit (axilla).In muscle-sparing thoracotomies, incisions are spared or avoided on a muscle or muscle group in the chest. Its advantages are reduced postoperative pain, decreased narcotic usage and improved shoulder-girdle muscle strength.  In posterolateral thoracotomies, the incision runs toward the back and side of the chest. In anterolateral (anterior) thoracotomies, the incision runs toward the front and/or side of the chest. In axillary thoracotomies, the incision is made on the armpit (axilla). In muscle-sparing thoracotomies, incisions are spared or avoided on a muscle or muscle group in the chest. Its advantages are reduced postoperative pain, decreased narcotic usage and improved shoulder-girdle muscle strength.  Anterior mediastinoscopy: This incision is done to stage and diagnose advanced upper-lobe lung cancers.  Transverse thoracosternotomy: It involves a long horizontal incision made on the chest. This incision provides excellent wide exposure to both the lungs and great vessels, but it causes increased postoperative pain, frequently requires the patient to be on postoperative ventilatory support and carries a serious risk of breastbone malunion (improper joining of the surgically cut breastbone) and chest wall dysfunction. Thoracoabdominal incision: It provides wide exposure of the lower chest and upper abdomen and is suitable for surgeries on the esophagus, abdominal part of the aorta and spine. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): It is a procedure in which thoracoscope (a small tube) is inserted through a small incision between the ribs. A small camera is attached at the end of the tube which lets the surgeon observe the entire chest cavity without having to open the chest or spread the ribs."
What are the risks of thoracic incisions?,"'The complications of thoracic incisions vary with the type of incision made. Generally, the complications include' Pain Scarring Nonunion or malunion of the sternum Bleeding Infections Injury to muscles, nerves or blood vessels"
What is permanent contraception?,"'Permanent ''contraception'' methods are ways to permanently prevent ''pregnancy''. Permanent contraception involves a minor surgical procedure by which the man or the woman is sterilized.''It is possible to reverse surgical sterilization, but the reversal procedure is technically complicated and may not be successful. Reversal of a woman’s sterilization has a better success rate than a man’s sterilization reversal.' "
How do permanent contraception methods work?,"'Permanent contraception is possible for both men and women and are among the most effective ways to prevent pregnancy. Permanent contraception procedures work by altering the reproductive anatomy of a woman or a man.''Permanent contraception in a woman blocks the passage of the egg into the fallopian tube where ''fertilization'' takes place. There are no hormonal changes in the woman’s body, and no change in egg production. The woman’s body naturally absorbs the unused eggs.''The male surgical contraception procedure blocks a man’s vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the ejaculatory duct. The sperm is blocked from entering the semen and is absorbed by the body.' "
What are the methods of permanent contraception?,"'Several methods are in use for performing permanent contraception in a woman:''Permanent contraception can be performed immediately after ''childbirth'' (postpartum salpingectomy) with a small incision under the navel, or during a Caesarian delivery.''Permanent contraception surgery during the other period (interval partial salpingectomy) is performed under general anesthesia, using one of the following procedures:''Efficacy''The cumulative 10-year failure rate for permanent female contraception are as follows:''Advantages''Disadvantages''Vasectomy'' is a simple procedure performed under local anesthesia, with a small incision in the scrotal sac. The doctor severs the vas deferens and closes the severed ends with ''sutures'' or using heat from low voltage electric current.''After sterilization there may be remnant sperm in the ejaculatory duct. It requires 15-20 ejaculations after sterilization procedure for the semen to be completely free of sperm presence, which can be confirmed with a semen analysis.\xa0''Efficacy''Failure rate is approximately 0.1%.''Advantages''Disadvantages' Tubal occlusion: Application of devices such as rings, clips or bands to squeeze the tube shut and obstruct the egg passage.  Tubal ligation: The fallopian tubes are surgically severed and the ends are sutured to prevent the transit of the eggs. Electrocoagulation: A part of the fallopian tube is destroyed using a low-voltage bipolar electric current. The destroyed portion of the tube clots up and blocks the passage of the eggs. Essure system: The procedure involves the placement of a microinsert in the fallopian tubes using a tube (hysteroscope) inserted through the vagina directly into the tube. The woman has an imaging test after three months to check correct placement. The Essure contraception system was withdrawn from the US markets in December, 2018. The Essure system is undergoing further studies. Laparoscopy: A minor procedure performed with tiny surgical instruments inserted into several small incisions in the abdomen, using a flexible lighted tube with a camera (laparoscope). Laparotomy: A conventional open surgery, not much in use. Colpotomy: The fallopian tubes are accessed through an incision in the posterior vaginal wall.

Common birth defects,"'A birth defect is a health condition that is present since birth. ''Birth defects'' may change the shape or function of one or more parts of the body. They can cause problems in overall health. Below are the most common birth defects:''Congenital heart defects'' (CHD):'' This defect may affect different parts or functions of the ''heart''. Defects may include holes in the wall of the heart, a heart that beats too quickly or too slowly, valve defects that prevent blood from flowing smoothly, or misplaced blood vessels that prevent the heart and circulatory system from functioning efficiently. Causes include genetic and environmental factors or sometimes side effects of certain ''drugs''. Most heart defects can be corrected, or at least helped, by surgery, medicines, and devices such as pacemakers. There are ''prenatal tests'' that can detect many heart defects before birth. Medications and surgical interventions after birth have also improved the outlook for children with CHD significantly in the past 40 years.''Clubfoot: ''Clubfoot describes a range of foot and ankle abnormalities. The foot bones, ankle joint, and structures of the foot may be abnormal or tight, making it difficult to bring the foot into a normal position. Clubfoot is almost twice as likely to affect boys. Causes are yet to be established, but heredity and some environmental factors, such as ''smoking during pregnancy'"", are likely at the root of the defect. Without treatment, the poorly aligned foot and ankle can't move normally, resulting in an awkward gait and may even interfere with the growth of the entire leg.""'Down syndrome'': ''Down syndrome'' is a ''genetic disorder''; it is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome. Symptoms include mental retardation and facial and health abnormalities such as impaired ''hearing'', impaired vision, and heart defects. Mothers who are aged above 35 years are at a higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.\xa0Early intervention and special education may help ''babies'' with Down syndrome to grow up, attend school, and participate in a social life. Many patients live semi-independently in group homes, holding down jobs, and taking part in their communities.''Cerebral palsy'': ''Congenital ''cerebral palsy'' is a condition with abnormal brain movement and posture. It is caused by damage to the part of the brain that controls muscle movement.\xa0Cerebral palsy is generally not diagnosed until the child has reached 2 or 3 years.\xa0Symptoms include mental retardation, ''learning disabilities'', or problems with vision, hearing, or speech. While there is no cure for cerebral palsy, treatment options include physical therapy, speech therapy occupational therapy, drug therapies, and surgical procedures. Most children may significantly improve over time with proper treatment.''Spina bifida'': ''Spina bifida is caused by ''neural tube defects''. The neural tube is the part of the embryo that eventually develops into the brain and spinal cord. When something goes wrong in this process and the neural tube does not close properly, the spinal cord or vertebrae do not develop normally. Causes include genetic and environmental factors. A baby with the most severe form of spina bifida will usually require surgery within 48 hours of birth. Soon after surgery, physical therapy is initiated. Studies show that up to 70% of neural tube defects, including spina bifida, could be prevented if ''pregnant'' women consume adequate amounts of ''folic acid'', especially in the earliest ''stages of pregnancy''. ''Prenatal'' surgery to repair spina bifida birth defects is in the experimental phase.''Cleft lip'': ''This defect might look alarming, but it can typically be corrected shortly after birth. Essentially, a cleft lip is when the baby is born with an opening at the lip, and the same thing can happen on the roof of the mouth; once corrected, the baby may lead a normal life.''Sickle cell disease'' or ''sickle cell anemia'': T''his occurs when ''red blood cells'' do not carry enough oxygen throughout the body. This is often passed from generation to generation.''Fragile X syndrome'':'' This is a chromosomal defect that is generally observed in male babies. Symptoms include a long face, large ears, flat ''feet'', ''teeth'' clamped together, heart issues, or even slightly autistic symptoms.' "
What is contraception?,"'Contraception'', commonly known as ''birth control'', is the adoption of preventive measures to avoid ''pregnancy''. Contraception techniques prevent the sperm from fertilizing the egg (ovum) and forming a fetus in the uterus.''So-called “natural” methods rely on behavioral and scheduling changes in your sex life, predicated on exceptional self-control skills. For these reasons, behavioral methods of ''birth control'' are the least effective available, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.' "
What is the importance of contraception?,"'Voluntary birth control has become globally significant with the rapid increase in population. Contraception helps prevent the risk of unsafe abortions due to unwanted ''pregnancies''. Effective control over reproduction may also contribute to a woman’s physical and mental well-being, and her ability to pursue her personal goals.' "
What are the different types of contraception?,"'For centuries, people have tried various methods to avoid pregnancy after vaginal intercourse. For example, Egyptologists translated a vaginal pessary contraception recipe from 1850 BCE including crocodile dung and fermented dough. Contraception has evolved to be less dangerous and more effective since then, falling into five primary categories:' Natural methods: These involve behavioral adaptations and periodic abstinence. Mechanical barriers: The use of physical barriers such as condoms to prevent the sperm from reaching the ovum. Hormonal methods: This technique involves the use of hormones by the woman to:Prevent the release of egg from the ovary.Thicken the mucus around the cervix to prevent sperm entry.Thin the uterus lining (endometrium) preventing the fertilized egg’s attachment to it. Prevent the release of egg from the ovary. Thicken the mucus around the cervix to prevent sperm entry. Thin the uterus lining (endometrium) preventing the fertilized egg’s attachment to it. Intrauterine devices: Intrauterine devices are implanted inside the uterus and work by releasing small amounts of hormones or by triggering the immune system to make the environment hostile to the sperm and the fertilized egg. Permanent contraception: This method involves a minor surgical procedure toSever the fallopian tubes in women to prevent the mature eggs from reaching the uterus.Sever the vas deferens in men to prevent the sperm from getting into the semen. Sever the fallopian tubes in women to prevent the mature eggs from reaching the uterus. Sever the vas deferens in men to prevent the sperm from getting into the semen."
What are the natural contraception methods?,"'Natural contraception methods are perhaps the safest way of avoiding pregnancy, but involve periodic abstinence. It requires consistent self-control and some of the methods have a high failure rate. Advantages of natural contraception are:''There are three types of natural contraception:''Coitus interruptus'' is the technique of withdrawing the penis from the vagina before ejaculation.''Vaginal intercourse may not result in pregnancy for about six months after the birth of a child, while the mother breastfeeds the baby and is yet to start periods. This method of contraception requires:''Breastfeeding'' the baby in four-hour cycles during the day and six-hour cycles during the night.''Avoidance of other supplemental food and formula milk for the baby.''During lactation, the body naturally suppresses ''ovulation'' by reducing the levels of luteinizing hormone, which helps in egg maturation and release. The period of ovulation absence depends on the frequency and duration of breastfeeding, and the length of time after ''childbirth''.''Efficacy'': Failure rate is 0.5% with perfect use and 2% with typical use in the first 6 months after ''childbirth''.''Advantages'':''Disadvantages:''Natural ''family planning'' requires periodic abstinence from sexual intercourse during the woman’s ''fertile'' period, when ovulation occurs. The fertile period is calculated by three methods:''A combination of the above three methods may be required to predict the fertility period, after first recording about six menstrual cycles to calculate the approximate ovulation time.''Efficacy'': The failure rate in typical use is about 25%.''Advantages'': For certain couples, this may be the only method available for cultural or religious reasons.''Disadvantages'':' No need of any devices No costs No hormonal or surgical interference with the body Efficacy: Efficacy depends on the man’s capability to withdraw in time. Failure rates are approximately 4% in the first year with perfect use and 22% in typical use. Advantages:Can be practiced any time.Theoretical reduction of the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Can be practiced any time. Theoretical reduction of the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Disadvantages: It requires perfect awareness and enormous self-control. Uterus involution (return to normal size) is rapid. Suppresses menstruation. Helps with postpartum weight loss. Time of fertility return is uncertain. Frequent breastfeeding without other supplements may be difficult. This method cannot be used if the mother has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Calendar method: Ovulation usually occurs 12 to 16 days before the next period. The abstinence period is 18 to 11 days before the forthcoming period, based on the assumption that the ovum and sperm are viable for 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Cervical mucus method: This method is an attempt to quantify the cervical mucus discharge, which increases during ovulation. Symptothermal method: The woman’s basal temperature is relatively lower before the egg matures and rises 0.2-0.5 C after ovulation. Temperature rise after ovulation indicates the end of fertility period. Suitable only for women with regular and predictable cycles. Requires complete abstinence during ovulation."
What are the health benefits of drinking coffee?,"'While past studies have pointed out at the negative side of coffee, recent studies hint at its potential health benefits. The benefits are thought to be due to the antioxidants or anti-inflammatory agents present in coffee. These agents have been implicated in exerting disease-preventing effects on your body.''A daily cup of coffee may protect you against a host of problems, including:''You can even make use of your daily cup of coffee to make healthier choices. Coffee consumed with fat-free, low-fat milk or fortified ''soy'' beverage is one way to increase your daily calcium and ''vitamin D'' intake.' Parkinson's disease Dementia Type 2 diabetes Heart attack Stroke Liver disease (including liver cancer) Obesity (especially increased total body fat percentage)"
How can you break the coffee addiction?,"'With so many healthy reasons for consuming coffee, it does not sound wise to stop coffee completely. It is an ''addiction'' to that cup of joe that is the trouble maker. Here, addiction means you cannot stop yourself from consuming more than four cups in a day. And when that happens, it is time to take action to break the addiction. Here is what you can do:''Go slow.''Reduce the amount of coffee you consume in a day slowly. For example, instead of eight cups, take six cups first for a few days, then gradually shift to four cups a day. Do not stop drinking coffee all at once. Abrupt cessation of coffee in habitual coffee-drinkers might cause withdrawal symptoms, such as severe ''headache'' and restlessness.''Choose water as a substitute.\xa0''If your hand reaches out to the fifth cup of coffee, drink water instead. Water also naturally flushes caffeine from your body and prevents ''dehydration'' from coffee.''Switch to decaf.''Decaffeinated (decaf) coffee is the caffeine-free form of coffee. Try alternating between ''caffeinated'' coffee and decaf coffee throughout the day for over 2 to 3 weeks. You can then switch to decaf completely by gradually cutting caffeinated coffee. Such a stepwise reduction will help you successfully change your habit without causing withdrawal symptoms.' "
What is ADHD?,"'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' or ''ADHD'' is a medical condition that affects a person’s behavior leading to symptoms such:''It is one of the commonest neurodevelopmental (related to the growth and development of the brain) disorders seen in children. Although ''ADHD'' is first seen and diagnosed in children, it may continue in adulthood. The symptoms become more obvious when the child’s environment changes, for instance when they start going to school or when they change their city or school.\xa0''Parents of ''children with ADHD'' commonly report their child being inattentive, acting without thinking (impulsiveness) or being very active or restless. The symptoms may get better with age although many patients report experiencing the symptoms of ''ADHD'' such as ''anxiety'', inability to concentrate, and problems in sleeping well into adulthood.' Lack of attention Restlessness,  Hyperactivity and  Impulsiveness"
How is ADHD caused?,"'The exact cause of ADHD is not known. The research is underway to explore what causes ADHD. Studies have revealed the association of certain factors in causing ADHD that include:' Genetics Environment (exposure to certain toxins [e.g., lead] during pregnancy or at a young age) Brain injury Use of alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy Premature delivery (delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy) Low birth weight"
What are the different types of ADHD?,"'Depending upon the most predominant or strongest symptom experienced by a person, ADHD has three main types:''As the symptoms of ADHD in a person keep changing with time, the presentation may also change.' Predominantly inattentive presentation: In this type, the person is mainly troubled by a lack of attention and finds it difficult to organize or finish a task, pay attention to details, or follow instructions or conversations. The individual gets easily distracted or forgets the details of their daily routines. Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation: In this variety of ADHD, the individual becomes very talkative and fidgety. They find it hard to sit still for long making it difficult for them to do tasks such as doing their homework or having a meal. Parents of smaller children may find them running, jumping, or climbing all the time. Adults with this type of ADHD report feeling restless and impulsive. Impulsive individuals tend to interrupt others a lot, grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate times. They find it difficult to listen to directions or wait for their turn. An individual with impulsiveness may be more likely to get injured or have accidents.  Combined Presentation: When symptoms of the above two types of ADHD are equally present in the person, it is called the combined presentation of the disorder."
What is bad cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol (a type of fat or ''lipid'') moves in the body combined with proteins. This combination of cholesterol and proteins is called lipoproteins. The low-density lipoprotein or ''LDL cholesterol'' is called bad cholesterol. High levels of this cholesterol increase risk for heart diseases and ''stroke''.''When you have high levels of ''LDL cholesterol'' in the body, the ''LDL cholesterol'' can accumulate on the walls of the blood vessels forming a ‘plaque.’ The continuous cholesterol build-up or a plaque narrows the inside of the blood vessels with time. The narrowed blood vessel hampers the blood supply to the concerned organ. Thus, when the plaque is present in the heart, it can cause ''angina'' (''chest pain'') or a ''heart attack''. Plaque build-up in the brain can cause a ''stroke''.''Another type of cholesterol is HDL\xa0(high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. It is also called “good”\xa0cholesterol as it absorbs cholesterol and carries it back to the liver. The liver then removes the cholesterol from the body. ''HDL cholesterol'', thus, can lower your risk for heart diseases and ''stroke''.' "
How often should I get my cholesterol levels checked?,"'The frequency of getting your cholesterol levels tested depends on your age, presence of risk factors, and family history like a history of heart diseases, ''stroke'', ''diabetes'', or ''high cholesterol''.''The following provides general recommendations for various age groups.''People who are 19 years of age or younger should:''People who are age 20 years or older:' Get the first test done between ages 9 to 11 years Repeat the test every 5 years For children, who have a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke, the testing may start at 2 years of age Those between the age of 20 to 44 years should get tested every 5 years Women in the age group 45 to 54 years should get tested every 5 years Men in the age group 45 to 65 years should get their cholesterol levels checked every 1-2 years Women in the age group 55 to 65 years should get tested every 1-2 years"
What is epilepsy surgery?,"'Epilepsy surgery'' is a neurosurgical procedure to prevent or reduce the occurrence of epileptic ''seizures''. ''Epilepsy'' surgery involves removal or surgical alteration of the part of the brain which is the focal point for onset of ''seizures''.''Epileptic seizures are caused by sudden bursts of abnormal electrical activity in certain brain cells, which may spread to other parts of the brain. ''Epilepsy'' surgeries are performed to remove the brain tissue where these electrical signals originate, or disrupt the pathways by which they are transmitted.' "
How is epilepsy surgery performed?,"'Surgical procedures vary depending on the type of ''epilepsy'' syndrome and the focal point of seizures. A team composed of a neurosurgeon, ''neurologist'', neuropsychologist, neuroradiologist and anesthesiologist are involved in the evaluation of a patient and performance of an epilepsy surgery.\xa0''Certain minimally invasive procedures may be performed as outpatient procedures or with short hospital stays. Invasive epilepsy surgeries require general anesthesia and involve varying periods of hospitalization, depending on the type of surgery.''An accurate diagnosis of the exact ''seizure'' focus area is essential for a successful epilepsy surgery. Prior to the surgery, the patient undergoes several tests which may include:''All invasive procedures are performed with the patient under general anesthesia.''Prior to the procedure''During the procedure,''The surgeon''In some procedures which can be performed with a smaller opening, the surgeon drills a burr hole in the skull and closes it with sutures in the scalp.''The patient is weaned off anesthesia and monitored for a few hours in the recovery room.''invasive intracranial monitoring known as electrocorticography (ECOG) may be performed if noninvasive evaluation fails to find a conclusive diagnosis of seizure focus. The surgeon implants electrodes in the brain, guided by continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy).''The electrodes are connected with wires to an EEG device which maps and records seizure activities. The patient may be monitored for two to seven days. Surgery or other therapeutic procedures may follow based on the diagnosis.''Three types of electrodes are used for intracranial monitoring:''Neurostimulation procedures involve implantation of electrodes connected to a battery-operated electrical stimulation device, which is also implanted under a flap of skin, typically in the upper chest. The neurostimulator delivers small electric impulses that interrupt electrical communication in the brain and prevent seizures.''The types of neurostimulation include:''Invasive epilepsy surgeries involve removal of brain tissue or structural alteration of brain include the following:''Some newly developed procedures are minimally invasive, and may be performed as an outpatient procedure or with a very short hospital stay. These include:' Blood and urine tests to assess medical fitness for surgery Imaging tests such as:Skull radiographyCT scanMRI testPET scanSingle-photon emission tomography (SPECT)Magnetoencephalography/magnetic source imaging (MEG/MSI) Skull radiography CT scan MRI test PET scan Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) Magnetoencephalography/magnetic source imaging (MEG/MSI) Individually tailored neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive functions Intracarotid amobarbital (Wada) test to determine which brain hemisphere contains language and memory function Electroencephalography (EEG) and long-term video EEG (VEEG) monitoring to obtain data on frequency of seizures and seizure foci, in case there are more than one.

Reduce or stop antiepileptic drugs. Administer antibiotics. The patient’s hair on the operative area is shaved and the skin sterilized. The patient lies on their back or turned to one side depending on the type of surgical procedure. The anesthetic team administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions throughout the procedure and during recovery. Makes an incision in the scalp and retracts the scalp Cuts out a flap of bone in the skull in a procedure known as craniotomy. Opens and retracts the brain’s membrane (dura) to access the brain tissue. Performs the required surgical procedure. Closes the dura, fixes the flap of bone using surgical glue and sutures the incision close. Strip electrodes: Strip electrodes are strips of small metallic disks sheathed in silicon. The surgeon inserts the electrodes through a burr hole and places them on the surface of the brain. The leads from the electrodes are connected to an EEG device. Grid electrodes: Grid electrodes are arrays of electrodes which form a grid. Grid electrodes require a craniotomy and the surgeon sutures them to the dura. Depth electrodes: Depth electrodes can be inserted through a burr hole and are placed in deep parts of the brain, typically the amygdala or the hippocampus. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): The electrodes are implanted in the neck adjacent to the vagus nerve and the neurostimulator is implanted in the top of the chest. The wires connecting them are tunneled under the skin. Responsive neurostimulation device (RNS): The electrodes are implanted on the surface of the brain’s seizure focus region, and the neurostimulator is implanted under the scalp. Deep brain stimulation (DBS): The electrodes are implanted in the hippocampus or amygdala, and the stimulator is implanted in the upper chest. Focal resection: Removal of brain tissue from the largest part of the brain known as cerebrum, consisting of two halves (hemispheres). Each hemisphere contains four sections; frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Focal resection may be: Anteromedial temporal resection (AMTR): Removal of brain tissue from the anterior temporal lobe, the most common epilepsy origin point. Extratemporal resection: Removal of brain tissue from any of the three lobes other than the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy: Removal of lesions in the brain tissue. Corpus callosotomy: Severing of the corpus callosum, a band of nerve fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. Functional hemispherectomy: Removal of a minimal amount of brain tissue from one hemisphere as necessary, and disconnection of its communication with the rest of the brain. In a hemispherectomy an entire hemisphere of the brain is removed. Multiple subpial transection (MST): Fine, shallow cuts in the brain tissue to interrupt flow of seizure impulses in parts of the brain which have critical functions such as speech, memory, vision and movement, and are not safe to remove. Stereotactic radiosurgery: A procedure which delivers high doses of precisely focused radiation to destroy brain tissue in the seizure focus area. Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT): A procedure using laser to eliminate seizure-causing brain tissue."
What is the recovery time for epilepsy surgery?,"'Recovery time depends on the type of surgery performed. With minimally invasive procedures the patient usually can resume normal activities within a day or two. Invasive surgeries may require hospitalization of up to a week, and most patients resume normal activity in six to eight weeks.''Patients must continue taking antiepileptic drugs after surgery, though the doctor may reduce the dosage gradually if the patients remain seizure-free. It may take months for cognitive functions like attention span, memory and thinking to return to normal. Some patients may need therapy if they develop any neurofunctional deficits.' "
Can surgery cure epilepsy?,"'All patients may not find relief from seizures after an epilepsy surgery. Surgeries have been found to be effective in preventing seizures in approximately 60% of the patients. Some patients continue to have seizures, but with less frequency and intensity. Some may have no worthwhile benefit.' "
What are the risks of epilepsy surgery?,"'Epilepsy surgery is a major procedure involving a vital organ and has risks that any major surgery poses. Risks vary with individuals depending on the area of surgery and underlying conditions.

What is shoulder dystocia?,"'Shoulder dystocia refers to a condition where after the delivery of the fetus’s head, the fetus’s shoulder may get stuck inside the mother’s pelvis. In most cases, the child comes out normally; however, it may pose a severe threat to the mother and the child. Dystocia causes slow or difficult ''labor'' or birth. Shoulder dystocia affects 0.6-0.7% of women during deliveries.''Shoulder dystocia is a medical emergency because it may result in life-threatening fetus injury.' "
Who is at risk of getting shoulder dystocia?,"'Shoulder dystocia can affect any woman; however, women with certain risk factors are at an increased risk of getting shoulder dystocia. Risk factors include:''Some factors associated with ''labor'' and birth include:' Macrosomia: In this condition, the baby weighs more than eight pounds (4000 g). Macrosomia can increase the risk of shoulder dystocia. However, most of the fetuses with macrosomia are born safely. Sometimes, fetuses with a healthy weight have dystocia. Preexisting diabetes or gestational diabetes: Having diabetes before or during the pregnancy can result in macrosomia. Previous history of shoulder dystocia Being pregnant with multiple fetuses Being overweight or gaining too much weight during pregnancy Getting oxytocin for inducing labor Getting an epidural to help with pain during the labor Having a very short or very long second stage of labor (the second stage of labor involves pushing and delivering the child) Assisted vaginal birth (a method of labor where the physician uses tools like forceps or vacuum to pull the baby through the canal)"
How is shoulder dystocia treated?,'The physician treats shoulder dystocia in one of the following ways:' Episiotomy or a small cut over right or left of the vagina when the physician confronts shoulder dystocia. McRoberts maneuver: Press the woman’s thighs up tight against her belly Suprapubic pressure: Press on your lower belly just above the pubic bone. Reach up into the vagina to try to turn the baby. A C-section or other surgical procedures to release their shoulders. These are done only in severe cases of shoulder dystocia.
What is percutaneous vertebroplasty?,"'Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a procedure used to treat and stabilize vertebral (spinal) ''fractures''. The process involves using a type of imaging called fluoroscopy, which provides ''X-rays'' in real time, to enable a doctor to inject a concrete-like fast-setting polymer into the damaged vertebrae.\xa0''A procedure called kyphoplasty often accompanies vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty is the insertion and inflation of a balloon in the vertebrae before the cement delivery. This helps to repair loss of height in fractured vertebrae and restore alignment.\xa0''The doctor may use a SpineJack kyphoplasty system, which uses titanium implants in the bone that work together in the bone with the cement-like polymer to create a more stable outcome, reduce post-procedure ''pain'', and better restore vertebral body height.' "
What is percutaneous vertebroplasty used for?,"'Percutaneous vertebroplasty is used to:' Treat pain in vertebral (spinal) compression fracturesWomen have a 16% lifetime risk of getting a vertebral compression fracture, due to the higher risk of osteoporosis in women (men’s lifetime risk is 5%) Women have a 16% lifetime risk of getting a vertebral compression fracture, due to the higher risk of osteoporosis in women (men’s lifetime risk is 5%) Treat collapsed vertebrae from osteoporosis  Treat spinal damage due to certain cancers and spinal tumors Stabilize weakened vertebrae prior to surgery Help repair alignment of vertebrae due to kyphosis Pain from vertebral hemangioma"
How do doctors perform percutaneous vertebroplasty?,"'Before the vertebroplasty is performed, the doctor will formulate a plan to best treat the damaged vertebrae. This may include:\xa0''The actual vertebroplasty procedure may last between 30 minutes to two hours.\xa0' Medical history and physical exam CT scans X-rays MRI of the spine Blood tests  Complete blood count (CBC) Chemistry panel Coagulation panel (PT/PTT) Patient is placed in the prone position (face down) The area of the back around the damaged vertebrae is cleansed thoroughly with antiseptics to prevent infection Anesthesia is administered for conscious sedation  Local anesthesia (such as lidocaine with epinephrine) is placed in the back at the level of the damaged vertebrae using a needle X-rays are performed using fluoroscopy to ensure proper localization of the damaged vertebrae and to guide placement of the cement compound  Patients are put on bed rest for up to 2 hours Pain medications may be given Muscle relaxants may be given for muscle spasms Patients receive detailed follow-up instructions  Patients are usually discharged the same day with a family member or friend who can help them after the procedure. "
What are Risks and Complications of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty?,"'Complications from vertebroplasty are usually minimal and only occur in 1% to 10% of cases.\xa0''Possible complications may include:' Infection in the skin or vertebrae Worsening of spinal fracture, especially when the original fracture is due to cancer Damage to spinal cord or adjacent nerves Paralysis Allergic reaction to anesthetic or cement-like compound Bleeding Collapsed lung Cement migration – cement compound leaks into surrounding tissues or bloodstream"
How is dementia treated?,"'Treatment of dementia depends on its cause. For example, dementia that has developed due to vitamin deficiency can be treated with vitamin ''supplements'' and hence is reversible. Other causes of dementia such as ''depression'', thyroid problems can also be treated.\xa0''For progressive dementias, including '""Alzheimer's""' disease, no treatment can halt its progression, and research is still going on to find out the same. But, some medications may temporarily help relieve its symptoms such as ''memory loss'' and confusion. These are:''Patients should ask their doctor about which medicine can be used at the stage of dementia they are currently in.''Some of the non-drug approaches can be adopted by the patient’s family, friends, or caregivers. This helps improve the quality of life of patients with dementia. Some of the non-drug therapies include:' Donepezil (Aricept) Galantamine (Razadyne) Rivastigmine (Exelon) Memantine (Namenda) Monitoring the patient’s comfort  Being gentle in arguing or explaining certain facts Learning how to cope with the patient’s agitation Diverting the patient’s attention Creating a calm atmosphere Creating a safe and secure environment (such as Install safety switches throughout the home)  Helping the patient join a dementia support group"
Can dementia be prevented?,"'Some risk factors such as genes and age cannot be avoided. Research suggests that patients with dementia can follow a healthy lifestyle to reduce their risk of dementia. Suggestive healthy practices include:' Following a healthy diet Avoiding smoking Being physically active Doing mental activities (such as playing chess, solving crosswords) that stimulate cognitive abilities "
What are the seven stages of Lewy body dementia?,"'Lewy body dementia'' (LBD) or ''dementia with Lewy bodies'' (DLB) is associated with protein deposits in the brain that cause disruptions in the normal functioning of the brain. Diagnosing the disease is extremely tough because its symptoms may resemble other brain diseases. DLB often starts with difficulty moving your body. Within a year, patients may start to have thinking and memory problems that are similar to those in Alzheimer’s disease along with changes in behavior and ''hallucinations''. The seven stages of LBD are as follows' Stage one: Absolutely normal stageNo symptoms. Patients are absolutely normalMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain might show incidental findings during routine examinationsDaytime sleeping with hallucinations and mood fluctuations are noticed in some patients No symptoms.

How is Lewy body dementia treated?,"'There aren’t any ''drugs'' that may stop or reverse ''Lewy body dementia'' (LBD, and research is still ongoing. Medications to relieve symptoms include:' Acetyl cholinesterase inhibitors: These work by increasing the levels of a chemical called acetylcholine in the brain, which improve the ability of the brain cells to send signals to each otherCommon drugs include Aricept (donepezil), Exelon (rivastigmine) and Reminyl (galantamine).These may help improve hallucinations, confusion and sleepiness in some people.Common side effects include feeling and being sick, diarrhea, headaches, tiredness and muscle cramps.

Occupational therapy, speech therapy, physiotherapy, swallowing therapy, psychological therapies and relaxation techniques with increased social interaction may help patients."
Is Lewy body dementia a fatal disease?,"'Lewy body ''dementia'' (LBD) is usually a progressive fatal disease. It gets worse over time and that shortens lifespan. The average lifespan after diagnosis is between 8 and 12 years. However, this is highly variable, and some people may live much longer than this with proper care and symptomatic treatment.' "
What is a cesarean delivery?,"'Cesarean delivery is a surgery to deliver a baby through a surgical cut (incision) on the abdomen and uterus. Modern-day cesarean deliveries are generally safe. They may, however, have a higher risk of complications than a vaginal delivery. Having a cesarean delivery does not mean that future deliveries will necessarily be through cesarean delivery. Many women have delivered through vaginal birth after cesarean delivery or vaginal birth after cesarean delivery. However, there may be an increased risk in future pregnancies such as problems with the placenta or the need for future cesarean delivery. There may also be a risk of tearing of the womb or uterine rupture in future pregnancies, especially when a vaginal birth is attempted. The hospital stay and recovery are also shorter in vaginal deliveries compared with those in cesarean deliveries.''Nonetheless, cesarean deliveries are crucial to delivering a baby in situations that may pose a threat to the mother’s or baby’s health. The surgery is done by an obstetrician. Present-day cesarean deliveries are safer because of the advancements such as the preferred use of regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia and horizontal instead of a vertical incision on the uterus.' "
When is a cesarean delivery needed?,"'A cesarean delivery may be done as an emergency surgery or a scheduled or elective surgery.''Emergency cesarean delivery may be done when''Planned cesarean delivery may be done when' There is placental abruption (a condition in which the placenta separates too soon from the wall of the uterus). There is slowing or non-progression of the labor that does not improve with medications. There is fetal distress (the baby’s heart rate becomes abnormal because of reduced oxygen supply to the baby). There is compression or pinching of the umbilical cord that may affect the baby’s oxygen supply. There is umbilical cord prolapse (a condition in which the umbilical enters the birth canal before the baby). The baby’s head or body is very large to fit through the birth canal. The baby’s position in the uterus is breech (the feet or bottom first) or transverse (sideways). Some birth defects are present such as severe hydrocephalus (a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the brain). There are some problems with the placenta such as placenta previa (the placenta rests too low in the uterus and covers the cervix). The mother has some infections that may make a vaginal delivery risky for herself or the baby such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or an active case of genital herpes. There are multiple pregnancies (some cases). The mother previously had a uterine surgery or cesarean delivery (many women, however, have delivered through vaginal birth after cesarean delivery or vaginal birth after cesarean delivery)."
How is cryotherapy performed?,"'Cryotherapy is a treatment that uses a chemical called liquid nitrogen to destroy a lesion or ''cancer''. The liquid nitrogen is usually sprayed directly on the abnormal area until the area develops a small rim around it, which subsequently turns white (thawing). The procedure usually takes between a few seconds to minutes. Cryotherapy is usually performed for below conditions:' Cryotherapy can be used to kill off nerves that might be causing pain. A probe is inserted into the tissue next to the affected nerve. The temperature of the probe drops to effectively freeze the nerve. It is also used to treat abnormal cells in diseases like skin cancer; the doctor usually sprays or swabs liquid nitrogen at the affected area and freezes it. The nitrogen dissolves and freezes after the procedure. A dry crust may form over the wound, which may fall along with the dead cancer cells over the next few days or after a month. For cancers inside the body, a small probe is inserted (cryoprobe) to supply the liquid nitrogen. This can be done through the skin (percutaneously) or through a scope, depending on the position of cancer. This procedure may require general or local anesthesia. For kidney cancer, a thin, flexible tube called a laparoscope with a camera at its tip may be used to position the cryoprobe. Bronchoscopy may be needed for lung cancer and endoscopy for cancers in the food pipe to reach the tumors. Some cancers need to be frozen and thawed several times. Cryotherapy procedure is also used to slow down the effect of severe diseases by reducing the rate of cell growth and reproduction. Cryolipolysis is the freezing of fat cells to break them down so that they can be reabsorbed by the body. It’s a noninvasive way to remove fat cells and not damage other tissues in the body. In this procedure, the cold itself acts as an anesthetic so the patient may be awake for the entire procedure."
What is the outlook of cryotherapy?,"'Though it is not approved by FDA, doctors around the globe use cryotherapy as it boasts high success rates in permanently removing skin growths; even for aggressive lesions like squamous cell and basal cell cancers, studies have shown a cure rate of up to 98%. For certain types of growths, such as some forms of ''warts'"", repeat treatments over several weeks are necessary to prevent the growth's return. Successful cryotherapy avoids the need for alternative treatments, like surgery; however, the outlook remains controversial as studies are still going on about the treatment and its side effects."" "
What are the drugs that treat HIV?,"'Treatment for ''HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'') infections has advanced mightily in the decades since the global pandemic in the 1980s, but there is still no cure. That means people with the infection must stay on antiviral therapy for their entire lives to stave off ''AIDS'' (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). ''AIDS'' is the condition in which the ''HIV'' overwhelms the body’s immune system, leaving the infected person vulnerable to opportunistic bacteria, fungi, and ''cancers'' that eventually kill them.''There is no evidence people infected with ''HIV'' can currently be cured. In general, those who are treated for years and are repeatedly found to have no virus in their blood by standard viral load assays will experience a prompt rebound in the amount of virus when therapy is discontinued. Consequently, the decision to start therapy must balance the risks versus the benefits of treatment. The risks of therapy include the short- and long-term side effects of the ''drugs'', described in subsequent sections, as well as the possibility that the virus will become resistant to the therapy, which can limit options for future treatment. The risks of both of these problems are quite small with the treatment options currently available.''Still, it’s important to know the potential side effects of all the drugs you take, as well as potential ''drug interactions''. All of the NNRTIs (nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors), for example, are associated with important drug-''drug interactions'' so they must be used with caution in patients on other medications. The following is a list of the standard treatment medication classes used in managing ''HIV'':''This article will discuss some of the most common and most dangerous side effects in each drug class. This is by no means a comprehensive list. People should read the package information and discuss with their doctor or pharmacist each drug they are prescribed.' nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) protease inhibitors fusion inhibitors CCR5 antagonists integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and entry inhibitors"
What are the side effects of NRTIs?,"'Most NRTIs can cause mild ''nausea'' and ''loose stools''. In general, these symptoms resolve with time.''ZDV (''zidovudine'') has been associated with decreased production of blood cells by the bone marrow, most often causing ''anemia'', and occasionally ''hyperpigmentation'' (most often of the nails).''D4T (''stavudine'') can damage nerves and cause ''peripheral neuropathy'', a neurological condition with numbness and/or tingling of the ''feet'' and hands, and inflammation of the pancreas (''pancreatitis'') that causes ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and mid/upper ''abdominal pain''.''DDI (''didanosine'') also causes ''pancreatitis'' and, to a lesser extent, ''peripheral neuropathy''. Peripheral neuropathy can become permanent and painful, and pancreatitis can be life-threatening if therapy is not discontinued. The drug ddC also is associated with peripheral neuropathy, as well as oral ulcers.''ABC (''abacavir'') can cause a hypersensitivity reaction during the first two to six weeks of therapy in approximately 5% of individuals. The hypersensitivity reaction most often causes ''fever'' and other symptoms, such as muscle aches, ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', ''rash'', or ''cough''. The symptoms generally get worse with each dose of ABC and, if suspected, therapy must be discontinued and never restarted for fear of developing a life-threatening reaction. There is now a simple blood test (HLA-B*5701) that can be performed to determine whether a patient is at risk for developing the hypersensitivity reaction. If the test is positive, the patient should never receive this medication. There is also conflicting data stating that ''abacavir'' may or may not be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events.''TDF (''tenofovir'') is generally well tolerated although there may be rare kidney damage and may have a greater impact on reducing ''bone density'' than other agents. Both of these problems appear to be attenuated with the new formulation of ''tenofovir'' called TAF.''FTC (''emtricitabine'')is also well tolerated except for the occasional development of ''hyperpigmentation'', most often on the palms and soles. This hyperpigmentation occurs more frequently in people of color.''Although all NRTIs can be associated with lactic acidosis (a serious condition in which lactic acid accumulates in the blood), it may occur more often with some drugs, such as D4T. Although this complication of treatment is rare, it can be severe and life-threatening. Early symptoms of lactic acidosis are ''nausea'', ''fatigue'', and sometimes ''shortness of breath''. Lactic acidosis needs to be watched for and, if suspected, requires that therapy be discontinued until symptoms and laboratory test abnormalities resolve.''There has been a great deal of attention given to the more recently identified problem of ""''lipodystrophy''."" Individuals suffering from this syndrome can be categorized as having lipohypertrophy (fat accumulation) syndromes, such as the ""buffalo hump"" on the back of the neck, breast enlargement, or increased abdominal girth. Others primarily suffer from lipoatrophy with fat loss under the skin with complaints of prominent veins on the arms and legs, sunken cheeks, and decreased gluteal (buttock) size. These syndromes appear to be related to multiple factors, including, but not limited to, drug therapy. The NRTIs appear to be most closely linked to lipoatrophy, in particular D4T and to a lesser extent ZDV. In fact, some studies have suggested slow accumulation of fat in those who modify the NRTI component of their regimen. Some NRTIs also have been linked to elevation in ''lipid'' (fat) levels in the blood. While switching therapy is always a consideration in those experiencing potential drug-related toxicity, this should only be done under the careful supervision of an experienced ''HIV'' provider.' "
What are the side effects of NNRTIs?,"'The most common side effect associated with NNRTIs is a ''rash'', typically occurring during the first weeks of therapy. This is most common in individuals treated with NVP (''nevirapine''). In this case, the overall risk of ''rash'' is reduced if therapy is started as a single 200 mg NVP pill once per day during the first two weeks before increasing to the full dose of 200 mg twice per day. If the ''rash'' is mild, therapy usually can be continued if ''antihistamines'' are given, and if the rash resolves, treatment with the NNRTI can be continued. If the rash is severe, associated with ''liver'' inflammation or ''blisters'', changes in the mouth or around the eyes, or with high ''fevers'', therapy with the NNRTI usually needs to be discontinued. Decisions regarding continuing or stopping treatment need to be made with the primary care professional. In some patients, NVP can cause a ''severe allergic reaction'' characterized by ''fever'', rash, and severe ''liver'' inflammation. Recent data suggests that the groups at the greatest risk for the severe reaction are those with stronger immune systems, such as HIV-uninfected people given this treatment after an exposure to HIV, women with CD4+ T cells >250 cells per mm3, and men with CD4+ T cells >400 cells per mm3. There is also likely to be increased risk in ''pregnant'' women and individuals with other underlying liver diseases. Consequently, NVP probably should not be used in any of these groups, or if used, used with caution. In addition, whenever NVP is started, ''liver tests'' that are markers for liver inflammation should be monitored at regular intervals during the first several months of treatment.''Side effects associated with EFV (''efavirenz'') are mostly ''dizziness'', ''confusion'', ''fatigue'', and vivid dreams. These tend to be most prominent during the first weeks of therapy and then often decrease in severity. It is generally recommended that EFV be taken at bedtime so that the patient is asleep during the time ''dizziness'' and ''confusion'' may be most severe. It is also noteworthy that there may be an increased risk of ''depression'' associated with the use of this drug, and it should be used with caution in those with poorly managed ''depression''. Rash and liver inflammation can occur with both EFV and DLV (''delavirdine''), and these drugs may also be linked to abnormalities of ''lipids'' in the blood.''The most common side effect reported with the most recently approved NNRTI, ETR (''etravirine''), is rash and it was generally mild and rarely required that medications needed to be stopped. Side effects appear to be uncommon with RPV (rilpivirine) with some uncertainty as to whether it is associated with various neurologic symptoms.''All of the NNRTIs are associated with important drug-drug interactions so they must be used with caution in patients on other medications. There are numerous resources available to patients on these medications to make sure that they do not adversely interact with other HIV or non HIV-related drugs.' "
What are the side effects of protease inhibitors?,"'There are currently nine approved ''PIs'' that all have distinct toxicities. The most common side effects associated with these drugs are nausea and ''diarrhea'', which occur more often with some ''PIs'' than others. For example, ''diarrhea'' is more common with NFV (''nelfinavir'') than other PIs but can occur with any and all drugs in this class. Many of the drugs in this class also increase blood ''lipid'' levels, some more than others with ATV (''atazanavir'') and DRV (''darunavir'') appearing to have less effect on ''lipids'' than other drugs in the class. Other unique toxicities associated with various PIs are ''kidney stones'', kidney damage, and increases in blood ''bilirubin'' levels and potentially ''jaundice'' with IDV (''indinavir'') and ATV. Some of these drugs also have been associated with elevations in blood ''sugar'' levels and bleeding in hemophiliacs. Finally, little is known regarding the role these drugs may play in the development of ''lipodystrophy''. There is also some data suggesting that LPV/RTV (lopinavir/''ritonavir'') and DRV may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.''Most PIs are associated with important drug-drug interactions so they must be used with caution in patients on other medications. There are numerous resources available to patients on these medications to make sure that they do not adversely interact with other HIV or non HIV-related drugs.' "
What are the side effects of fusion inhibitors?,"'The only drug in this class is ''T-20'' (''enfuvirtide''), which is administered as a twice-daily subcutaneous injection. The most common side effects are redness and ''pain'' at the site of injection. Rarely, infection can occur at the injection site. There also are reports of generalized ''allergic'' reactions.' "
What are the side effects of CCR5 antagonists?,"'Although there were some early concerns of liver inflammation for drugs in this class, MVC (''maraviroc'') appeared to be well tolerated in ''clinical trials'' without any specific toxicities attributable to the drug. However, it is a new drug in a new class and the first to actually target the cell. For these reasons, longer follow-up from ''clinical trials'' and those followed in the clinic will be very important for assessing the overall safety of the drug. There are important drug-drug interactions with MVC, so it too must be used with caution in patients on other medications.' "
What are the side effects of integrase strand transfer inhibitors?,"'RAL (''raltegravir'') has not been strongly linked to any specific side effect in clinical trials. However, there have been some cases of muscle problems and of increasing ''depression'' that needs to be watched for when starting this or any new medications. EVG (elvitegravir) appears to be well tolerated when used as the fixed-dose combination of Stribild or Genvoya, with the anticipated effect on measures of kidney function and ''bone mineral density'' with Stribild and COBI component (cobicistat) of the regimen being associated with drug-drug interactions. DTG (dolutegravir) has been associated with mild ''headache'', ''insomnia'', and nausea in some patients and like COBI is associated with mild early decrease in measures of renal function that actually do not reflect true kidney damage.' "
What is Mirena?,"'Mirena is a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) that consists of progestin (''levonorgestrel'')—similar to a hormone produced by women. It prevents ''pregnancy'' by the following methods:''As Mirena is a hormonal IUD, there are chances of ''weight gain''. This is mainly due to the hormone progestin because it causes water retention and bloating that adds extra pounds.' Makes the cervical fluid thicker Interferes with sperm movement Reduces sperm survival Prevents the fertilization of an egg Changes the lining of the uterus to prevent the attachment of a fertilized egg Stops ovulation in some women"
Who should avoid using Mirena (IUDs)?,'People with the following conditions should avoid using Mirena:' Sexually transmitted diseases Pelvic infections Pregnancy Cervical cancer or uterine cancer Unexplainable vaginal bleeding Liver disease Breast cancer History of pelvic inflammatory diseases Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Leukemia Intravenous (IV) drug abuse Infected abortion in the past three months Allergy to levonorgestrel History of ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy implanted outside the uterus walls) in the past
What should I know about using Mirena?,'You should keep in mind about the following things while using Mirena:' It doesn’t prevent sexually transmitted diseases. There is a risk of ectopic pregnancy or infertility. You should inform your physician if you suspect pregnancy. There is a high possibility of pelvic inflammatory diseases. Irregular bleeding and spotting may be present during the first few weeks after insertion. The intrauterine device (IUD) may expel from or may perforate the uterus.
Does Mirena cause weight gain?,"'Mirena is a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD), and there are chances of weight gain. Weight gain is mainly due to the hormone progestin because it causes water retention and bloating.''Some lifestyle changes may be necessary to avoid weight gain, such as exercising regularly; eating healthy and performing other ''weight loss'' methods should curtail the risk of weight gain.' "
What are the side effects of vacuum delivery?,"'Vacuum-assisted birth is a method to assist the ''delivery of a baby'' using a vacuum device. The side effects include''Risks to the mother''Risks to baby''There is a higher risk of failure to deliver the baby with this method (alternative methods include Cesarean delivery or forceps).' Damage to the vagina and cervix if the cup is not attached to the baby’s head correctly. Women who undergo vacuum birth might experience pain and soreness if they have had a tear. Risk of infection to the mother. The baby will be left with a temporary lump on their head. Bleeding in the back of the eyes, which is relatively common in a newborn baby. There is a possibility of bleeding in the potential space between the skull and the scalp. Skull fracture It can cause newborn jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin). The baby may have bleeding inside the skull, which is a rare yet a serious risk of vacuum-assisted delivery. The suction applied to the baby’s head can damage the veins inside the skull, causing bleeding in the skull."
What is vacuum delivery?,"'Vacuum delivery is a type of assisted birth delivery also called ventouse-assisted delivery. In any ''pregnancy'', where bearing down or pushing efforts would be risky, the mother is exhausted or the ''heart'' rate of the fetus changes, then a vacuum-assisted delivery is advised. The procedure is usually done under anesthesia (epidural).' In this procedure, the doctor usually uses a vacuum device to assist the delivery of the baby. Vacuum extraction is done during the second stage of labor (pushing phase) when the baby is very close to being delivered. There is also a chance that the doctor may need to perform an episiotomy (a cut is made on the left side of the woman’s vaginal opening) to enlarge the vaginal opening for the placement of the vacuum. The doctor may place the vacuum extraction's plastic cup on thebaby's head. The doctor may use the vacuum pump to create suction, which may help guide the baby through the birth canal and prevent the baby's head from moving back up the birth canal in between contractions. The doctor will remove the cup and the mother can push the rest of the baby's body out."
What are the benefits of vacuum delivery?,'The benefits of vacuum delivery include' A vacuum device can rotate the baby if they’re in an abnormal position and can help rotate the baby’s head into a correct position. Women are less likely to experience maternal accidents compared to forceps and C-section. The force applied to the baby can be less than that of a forceps delivery and it leaves no mark on the face of the baby. The mother still takes an active role in the birth of her baby. The procedure requires less anesthesia and pain-relieving medications. There is less risk of maternal death.
What are the warning signs of a heart attack in a woman?,"'Heart disease'' is the number one cause of death among women in the United States, with one out of every three women dying from ''heart disease''.''The signs and ''symptoms of heart disease'' in women are different than those in men.''Common ''heart attack'' signs and symptoms in women include:' Chest pain or discomfort Chest pain is described as a squeezing or feeling of fullness in the chest, or an extremely uncomfortable sensation.

What does a mini heart attack feel like?,"'You must have often heard people saying something about a mini heart attack or mild heart attack. There is no such term as a “mini” heart attack in the medical dictionary, but it can be compared to a mild heart attack or a silent heart attack.''Mild heart attack\xa0''Silent heart attack\xa0' A partial block in your coronary artery that causes mild signs and symptoms of heart attack is called a mild heart attack. If your doctor tells you that you have had a mild heart attack, it probably means your heart is not damaged much and is working properly. A doctor discovers that you had a silent heart attack when he routinely examines you and orders an electrocardiogram. This heart attack might have occurred “silently” over months or years before without you even knowing. A silent heart attack does not exhibit chest pain and shortness of breath — the typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack. Women are more likely to have a “silent” heart attack as per an analysis published in JAMA Internal Medicine."
What are the 4 silent signs of a heart attack?,"'Many women think that the typical signs of a heart attack like crushing chest pain and shortness of breath can be easily recognized and cannot be missed. Anyone can experience these symptoms, but many women experience “silent” symptoms that may be missed.''The silent signs of a heart attack that may be missed by women include:''If a woman has been experiencing the above symptoms, she should visit the doctor right away to rule out the possibility of heart disease or heart attack that has been quietly giving signals.' Unusual fatigue. Women who feel fatigued due to a heart attack may think the fatigue might be due to juggling between typical work and household duties. Burning pain in the chest. Women tend to relate this to hyperacidity. Pain in upper back, shoulder, arms, neck, or jaw.  Sleep disturbances. Women who are at risk of heart disease, including those who are obese, may experience difficulty in getting good sleep, which may be a warning sign of a heart attack."
What should women do to prevent a heart attack?,'Women should schedule a visit with their doctor to know about their personal risks for heart disease.''Lifestyle modifications that may prevent heart attack in women include:' Quitting smoking Regular exercises to stay active Maintaining a healthy weight Following a healthy diet Keeping blood sugar under control Keeping blood pressure under control Lowering cholesterol levels
What are the causes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') is a common intestinal disorder that is characterized by ''abdominal pain'' and changes in bowel habits. Older terms for ''IBS'' include ''spastic colon'', irritable colon, and nervous colon.''The exact cause of ''irritable bowel syndrome'' is unknown. However, some factors which appear causative are:''Women in Western countries are two to three times more prone ''IBS'' than men. Hispanics, Asians, and Africans have a lesser prevalence of ''IBS'' than other ethnicities.' Intestinal muscle hyperactivity Decreased or increased intestinal motion Oversensitive nerves of the intestine Alterations in populations of gut microorganisms (microbiome) Intolerance to certain foods Being younger than 35 Being a woman in the Western world"
What foods trigger IBS attacks? ,"'Consumption of the following foods may exacerbate ''IBS symptoms'':' Intolerance to fatty foods leads to abdominal fullness and related symptoms Consuming milk and milk products may aggravate the symptoms Drinking carbonated beverages can lead to gas formation and eventually abdominal pain Sugar and sugar substitutes can cause excess burping, cramping and diarrhea. Intake of caffeine and legumes can worsen symptoms of abdominal discomfort and anxiety. Wheat products Onions Shallots Garlic Barley Cabbage Broccoli Pistachio Artichoke Chicory root Asparagus"
What are the symptoms and signs of IBS?,'The early signs and ''symptoms of IBS'' are ''abdominal pain'' and alterations in bowel habits. Abdominal ''pain'' may worsen after meals.

How is salivary gland cancer diagnosed?,"'The doctor would perform a complete physical exam of any swellings or lumps in the mouth, jaw, neck, and throat.\xa0' Radiological tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasound, or X-ray may be advised. The biopsy is a procedure performed to collect a sample of abnormal tissue using fine-needle aspiration or a core needle biopsy technique. The tissue is then sent to the lab for analysis by the pathologist to determine the type of cancer."
How is salivary gland cancer treated?,"'Treatment for salivary gland tumors is usually surgery with additional treatments, such as ''radiation therapy'' and ''chemotherapy''.' Surgery: Surgery for salivary gland tumors may involve the removal of a part of the affected salivary gland or the entire salivary gland, depending on the size of the tumor. The lymph nodes in the neck may be removed even before they are affected to reduce the risk of spread. After removal of the surgery, reconstructive surgery may be performed to repair the area and restore function to improve the ability to breathe, speak, chew, swallow, and move the face. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy involves using high-powered energy beams, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy involves using medications to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy isn't currently used as a standard treatment for salivary gland cancer. They are also beneficial in the case of metastasis. Supportive (palliative) care: Palliative care involves providing relief from pain and other symptoms due to a serious illness when it is not treatable."
What does anxiety mean?,"'We all get worried or scared in response to certain situations in our lives. On a clinical level, ''anxiety'' refers to the state of extreme worry, fear and panic the majority of your day.\xa0Trivial situations or even in the anticipation of situations that have not happened will trigger these feelings in someone with a clinical ''anxiety disorder''.''Anxiety'' has various causes.

What are the six types of anxiety disorders?,"'The six main types of anxiety disorders are:' Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): It is a long term disorder that makes a person inappropriately anxious in mundane situations. People with GAD are anxious most of the time and seldom remember when they last felt relaxed. They feel constantly worried, restless and find it hard to concentrate on work. Panic disorder: It manifests as sudden, intense fear associated with profuse sweating, restlessness, chest pain and a racing or pounding heartbeat (palpitations) often mimicking a heart attack.  People with panic disorder may experience anxiety or panic attacks which are extreme and intense periods of restlessness or fear that affect associated with a pounding heartbeat, sweating, trembling, sensations of choking or being unable to breathe, extreme nausea, dizziness and chest tightness or pain.  Social phobia or social anxiety: Feeling of overwhelming worry and self-consciousness about everyday social situations plague people with social anxiety. A typical variant is selective mutism, which may be often seen in kids who are confident in front of their family, but may not speak at all in school or other places. Though many people may feel anxious about speaking in public, social anxiety involves extreme and irrational fear and anxiousness of facing people. Separation anxiety: It happens when a loved one leaves. It is often seen in small children who feel scared or anxious when a parent leaves for work, for example. It can also affect adults who worry that something bad may happen to their loved ones when they are out of sight. People with separation anxiety fear being alone. They may even find it difficult to sleep when they are away from home or their loved ones. Trauma- and stressor-related disorders: They are related to the experience of a trauma or tragedy (e.g., unexpected death of a loved one, a car accident, or a violent incident like war or sexual assault) or stressor (e.g., divorce, beginning college, moving).Post-traumatic stress disorder is the commonest type of trauma and stressor-related disorders. Phobias: They are excessive fears about a specific situation or object. The fear or anxiety is markedly disproportional to the actual threat involved. Common phobias include agoraphobia (intense fear of being in open, crowded places), acrophobia (fear of heights) and claustrophobia (fear of enclosed places)."

People with a weakened immune system: People who have cancer People who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) People who are on some medicines, such as those to prevent rejection of the transplanted organs Smokers: It is not clear why people who smoke are more likely to get genital warts than people who do not. A child who has been just delivered by an infected mother: An infected mother can pass the virus to her baby during childbirth. "
How are genital warts diagnosed?,"'Genital warts are usually diagnosed after the doctor examines genital growths. However, because of awkwardness and embarrassment, patients do not consult their doctors for genital growths/problems. Getting diagnosed properly and seeking early treatment can make these patients be at peace.''After taking the medical history, including the patient’s sexual history and examining the genital growths, the diagnosis of genital warts becomes almost certain. To confirm their diagnosis, the doctor can order diagnostic tests that include:''Once the doctor confirms that the patient has genital warts, all of the patient’s sex partners should also be examined for the infection.' Tissue biopsy: The doctor removes the wart or a small part of it and sends for examination in a laboratory. It may be done by anoscopy or colposcopy. Anoscopy: A tube-like camera called an anoscope may be inserted into the anus to visualize warts beyond the visible skin. Colposcopy: A tube-like instrument called a colposcope is inserted into the vagina to visualize warts inside the vagina and cervix."
What is a genital herpes outbreak?,"'The first outbreak or “first episode” or “initial herpes” is the condition when blisters and other genital herpes symptoms show up. It usually starts about 2-20 days after a person gets infected with herpes. Sometimes, it may take a year for the outbreak to happen. The first herpes outbreak lasts about two to four weeks. Although the blisters go away, the virus stays in the body and can cause sores again. It’s common to get repeat outbreaks, especially during the first year of herpes. Patients might notice some warning signs a few hours or days before outbreaks flare-up. The first ''symptoms of herpes'' outbreak are worst and painful. Repeat outbreaks are usually shorter and less painful, and eventually, these outbreaks become negligible.' "
Can herpes be cured?,"'There is no cure for herpes. However, there are medicines that can prevent or shorten outbreaks. One of these anti-herpes medicines such as ''Valacyclovir'' can be taken daily, which can reduce the spread of infection. Suppressive therapy can provide coverage for individuals who have frequent outbreaks. During therapy, an individual with frequent outbreaks takes a small dose of anti-herpes medication every day. It has been proven that suppressive therapy can reduce the number of outbreaks by over 90%. Patients have taken suppressive therapy for long periods of time, but in most cases, patients can be weaned from it.''Herpes symptoms may be relieved by the below methods:' Taking a warm bath or bathing in lightly salted water or soaking in a warm sitz bath Keeping the genital area dry (moisture makes the sores last longer) Wearing soft, loose clothes Putting an ice pack on the sores Applying petroleum jelly to the affected areas Taking a pain reliever such as aspirin, Advil and Motrin (ibuprofen), or Tylenol (acetaminophen) Applying a cream or lotion to the urethra before urinating, such as one that contains lidocaine"
How can herpes be prevented?,"'Preventive methods of herpes include:' Avoiding sex while symptoms are present Washing the hands thoroughly, especially after touching the affected area, during an outbreak Using protection such as condoms when having sex Avoiding kissing and oral sex when there is a cold sore around the mouth Sunburns, injuries to the lips, or other infections can cause oral herpes flare-ups, so avoiding getting sunburned may prevent oral herpes."
How syphilis is usually treated?,"'The treatments of syphilis include:' Penicillin injection is considered as the treatment of choice for all stages of syphilis. A stat dose of benzathine or procaine penicillin may be required for infectious syphilis (primary, secondary, early latent). Large doses of benzathine or procaine penicillin are required for noninfectious syphilis (late latent) and neurosyphilis. Sometimes tetracyclines or cephalosporins can be used in patients who are allergic to penicillin. A pregnant woman who is allergic to penicillin should first be desensitized and then treated with penicillin anyway."
Can we prevent syphilis?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' for syphilis. Practicing hygiene and following a few tips may be helpful.' Having only one sexual partner (and ensuring that the person is monogamous too) Using condoms during sexual activity Avoiding alcohol and recreational drugs Screening all pregnant women for syphilis and, if detected it be treated with penicillin to prevent congenital syphilis."
What is the retina?,"'The retina is the innermost layer in the back of the eye and is the portion of the eye that receives light. It contains nerves and light-sensitive cells called rods and cones. Rods are responsible for vision at low light and cones are responsible for vision at daylight or bright light as well as color vision. The function of the\xa0retina\xa0is to receive light that passes through the ''lens'' and converts the light into neural signals, which are transmitted to the brain for visual recognition. The retina is crucial for vision.''Damage to the retina is called retinopathy. Retinopathy has many causes and leads to visual impairment.' "
What causes damage to the retina?,"'Retinopathy usually occurs due to other medical conditions affecting the blood vessels in the retina. Some common causes are:' Diabetes: The blood vessels start deteriorating in diabetes. Deteriorated blood vessels can become blocked or deformed and cause fluid accumulation and swelling in the retina, leading to decreased vision. The blood vessels can also become unstable and start bleeding. Bleeding can lead to irritation, scarring, and decreased vision. This takes years to develop and is also called diabetic retinopathy. Hypertension (high blood pressure): Damage to the retina due to hypertension is also called hypertensive retinopathy. Hypertension can cause bleeding in the blood vessels of the retina. There may not be any symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy in the early stages and it may be diagnosed during a routine eye exam. Serous retinopathy: This involves the build-up of serous fluid in the retina, leading to decreased vision. Serous retinopathy can occur due to certain medications like steroids or stress. Stress increases the level of steroid hormones in the body. Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP): This occurs when a baby is born prematurely or if the birth weight is low. The blood vessels in the retina are not matured. There may be no symptoms in the early stages but can ultimately lead to retinal detachment and blindness. Tumors: Tumors involving the retina such as retinoblastoma. Retinitis pigmentosa: An inherited disease that slowly degenerates the retina, causing loss of night and side vision. Retinal tears and retinal detachment: The vitreous fluid is a clear, gel-like substance that fills the large cavity of the eye, which is lined by the retina. At birth, this gel is attached to the retina, however, with increasing age, the gel separates from the retina and causes retinal tears and detachment. Usually, this occurs without any specific cause. Macular degeneration: The macula is an oval spot located near the center of the retina. In macular degeneration, the center of the retina begins to deteriorate. This causes blurring of vision or blind spot in the visual field. Other systemic medical conditions and infections:Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemiaInfections such as tuberculosis Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia Infections such as tuberculosis"
What are the symptoms of a damaged retina?," Dim vision Blurring of vision Flashes of light Peripheral shadows: shadows in the edges of the eyes Floaters: appearance of floating specks, cobwebs, or lines Black spots Distorted shapes Difficulty reading or performing tasks that require detailed vision like embroidery or painting Blind spots Decreased or loss of peripheral vision Sudden loss of vision"
How is retinal damage diagnosed?,"'Detailed history taking, along with specialized eye tests may be done, including:''Early retinal disease sometimes presents no symptoms and may be diagnosed only on routine eye exams. Blood and radiological investigations to identify underlying conditions that cause retinal damage may be required.' fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, Amsler grid vision test, ultrasound, CT and MRI."
Can a damaged retina be cured?,"'Early diagnosis and treatment can help stop the progression of the disease as well as loss of vision, and aid in vision restoration. The time taken for the vision to be restored depends on the severity of the disease.\xa0 There is a possibility that vision may never fully recover. There are several treatment options available to treat a damaged retina.''One or multiple treatments can be combined, including:' Laser surgery Photocoagulation abnormal blood vessels Cryopexy: Extreme cold therapy used to treat the retinal tears Injecting air or gas to treat retinal detachment Injecting medication into the eyes Vitrectomy: Surgery to remove the vitreous fluid Retinal prosthesis: This can help restore vision to those who have blindness. A small electrode chip is implanted in the retina that receives input from a video camera attached to a pair of eyeglasses Treatment of underlying medical conditions Diet and lifestyle modifications to improve retinal strength: A healthy diet rich in nutrients (especially vitamin A), adequate rest, and adequate hydration with management of physical and emotional stress Avoiding eye stress by taking breaks from the screen or while reading"
What is diverticulitis?,"'Diverticula'' are small, bulging pouches that form in the lining of the ''digestive system'' in some people. They are usually formed in the lower part of the ''large intestine''. The presence of diverticula is known as ''diverticulosis''. They are usually seen in people over the age of 40 and rarely cause issues. When one ''diverticulum'' or diverticula becomes inflamed or infected due to the accumulation of waste products and bacteria, the condition is called ''diverticulitis''. ''Diverticulitis'' can cause issues characterized by ''fever'', severe ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' and change in bowel habits. ''Diverticulitis'' may be mild and treated conservatively with ''diet'', medication and rest. It may be severe and recurring requiring surgery. ' "
What are the symptoms of a diverticulitis flare-up?,"'In many cases, ''diverticulosis'' does not cause any troublesome symptoms. The condition may go undiagnosed until a routine ''colonoscopy'' is done. When ''diverticulosis'' causes symptoms, it is called a diverticulitis attack or flare-up.\xa0One may have multiple, recurring episodes of flare-ups. The symptoms usually occur suddenly and may persist for days.''The most common signs and symptoms of a diverticulitis flare-up include' Sharp cramping pain over the lower abdomen, usually on the left side Nausea Vomiting Fever Chills Constipation or diarrhea Bloating Tenderness over the affected area of your abdomen"
What causes diverticulitis?,"'Some possible causes of and risk factors for diverticulitis are as follows' Genetics: Genetics may play an important role. Having family members who have diverticulitis increases the risk of this condition. Age: The risk of diverticulitis increases with age, usually over the age of 40.  Smoking: Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes and tobacco products can weaken the lining of the colon causing diverticulosis and, in-turn, diverticulitis. Dehydration: Dehydration affects digestion, leading to the accumulation of waste products and harmful bacteria in the colon. Medications: Some medications, such as long-term painkillers or steroids, can cause weakening or irritation of the colon.  Sedentary lifestyle: Regular exercise may reduce the risk of diverticulitis.  Obesity: Being overweight exerts increased pressure on the colon, increasing the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis.  Constipation: Chronic straining while passing stools increases the pressure on the wall of the colon."
What are the complications of diverticulitis?,"'Although complications are not common, around 25% of people with acute diverticulitis tend to develop complications, which may include' Abscess: Infection and accumulation of pus in the outpouching. Scarring: Inflammation in the area of swelling may heal with scarring, causing obstruction of the bowel.  Fistula: An abnormal connection between the bowel and another part is called a fistula. A fistula may also form between two parts of a bowel. Peritonitis: Peritonitis may occur if the diverticular pouch gets infected, swollen and ruptured, causing the intestinal contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention."
Can diverticulitis be treated?,"'Treatment depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms.''Mild or uncomplicated diverticulitis:'' If the symptoms are mild, diverticulitis may be treated conservatively on an outpatient basis at home. Treatment may include''Severe or complicated diverticulitis:'' A severe attack of diverticulitis may even require hospitalization. Treatment may include''Surgery:'' Surgery may be indicated in the following cases''There are two types of surgery' Antibiotics to treat infection Painkillers for swelling and pain A liquid diet until the symptoms improve after which solid food can be slowly included in the diet Plenty of rest Intravenous (IV) antibiotics Painkillers Drainage of an abscess, if it forms Liquid diet Having complications such as abscess, fistula or bowel obstruction or perforation of the bowel wall Having multiple, recurring episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis Having a weak immune system due to other conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or diabetes Primary bowel resection: Diseased segments of the intestine are removed (resection) and the ends of the healthy segments are reconnected (anastomosis). This is also called bowel resection and anastomosis. It may be performed as an open surgery or a laparoscopic (minimally invasive) procedure. Bowel resection with colostomy: If the inflammation is severe, it may not be possible to reconnect the colon and rectum. In such cases, a colostomy may be performed. Colostomy is making a stoma (an opening) in the abdominal wall. This opening is connected to the healthy part of the colon. The stoma is connected to a bag. Stools (bowel waste) pass through the opening and into the colostomy bag. Once the inflammation resolves, the colostomy may be reversed and the healthy segments of the bowel may be reconnected."
Can diverticulitis be prevented?,"'The following practices may help diverticulitis by promoting healthy bowel function' Exercising regularly Consuming a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in fiber Maintaining healthy weight Drinking plenty of fluids and remaining hydrated  Avoiding smoking and other tobacco products "
What is arachnoiditis?,"'The Arachnoid membrane is a delicate layer that covers the brain and spinal cord. ''Arachnoiditis'' is a term for swelling of the arachnoid layer that may affect the brain and cause clumping together of the nerves emerging out of the spinal cord.''It is characterized by ''pain'' in the back, legs, ''feet'', and arms and problems with controlling pee and bowel. Arachnoiditis can also affect a person’s vision and mobility. Although the symptoms may worsen with age and there is no complete cure, with appropriate treatment, it is possible to lead a normal and good quality life.' "
What are the types of arachnoiditis?,'Types of arachnoiditis include:' Adhesive arachnoiditis: This is the most severe and progressive type of arachnoiditis. The nerves of the spine get inflamed and stick together. Arachnoiditis ossificans: The arachnoid becomes calcified (turns hard). Cerebral arachnoiditis: The arachnoid membrane surrounding the brain gets inflamed. This causes severe headaches. Hereditary arachnoiditis: This is a rare type and occurs due to genetic defects in the meninges. Neoplastic arachnoiditis: This type of arachnoiditis occurs as a result of neoplasm (cancer). Optochiasmatic arachnoiditis: This type of arachnoiditis occurs from the optic nerve (the nerve behind the eye). It can cause decreased vision or complete vision loss.
What are the causes of arachnoiditis?,"'The cause of arachnoiditis may influence the ''type a'' person develops, as well as the outlook and treatment plan. The most common causes include:' Injury during spinal surgery Trauma to the spine Cancer in or around the spine Epidural anesthesia Myelography (a diagnostic procedure where a dye is injected into the spinal column) Chemicals injected into the spine Infections (viral or bacterial) Exposure of the brain to harmful chemicals Lumbar puncture Genetics (rare)"
How is arachnoiditis treated?,"'Treatment options depend on the severity of the condition. The doctor would design a treatment plan. Treatment options include:' Physical therapy: Exercise therapy can help strengthen the muscles and reduce pain. Massage therapy and water therapy can help reduce nerve pain temporarily. Painkillers: Painkillers include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids (to suppress inflammation), and narcotic pain medications such as opioids. Nerve stimulation: Treatments such as spinal cord stimulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) stimulate the nerves or spinal cord and may offer relief without medication.  Psychological support: Chronic pain can affect the quality of life, leading to depression that can be difficult; hence, obtaining psychological support can help cope with the condition."
What causes cryptosporidiosis?,"'Cryptosporidiosis is caused by Cryptosporidium (Crypto), which is most commonly found in water, food, and soil or on surfaces that have been contaminated with feces of humans or animals infected with the parasite. The parasite is found in all regions in the United States.''After getting into the body, Crypto goes on to stay in the gut of infected humans or animals. An infected body sheds Crypto parasites in their feces. Swallowing even 10 Crypto germs can cause the infection.' "
How does cryptosporidiosis spread?,"'Crypto can be spread by' Accidentally swallowing the water in swimming pools, lakes, and rivers contaminated with Crypto. Swallowing beverages contaminated with poop from infected humans or animals. Eating undercooked food that gets contaminated with Crypto. Drinking unpasteurized/raw apple cider or milk contaminated with Crypto. Touching the mouth with hands contaminated with Crypto. Touching diapers and playing toys of a child infected with Crypto. Exposure to poop from an infected person through oral–anal sex."
Who is at risk of cryptosporidiosis?,'Individuals who are at higher risk for cryptosporidiosis include''Cryptosporidiosis can become serious and life-threatening in a certain set of population groups. These include:' Children who attend childcare centers Childcare workers Parents of infected children Older adults International travelers Backpackers and campers who drink untreated water People who drink from untreated water sources Swimmers who accidentally swallow untreated water while swimming People who handle infected calves and sheep People who have anal sex with infected persons Children Pregnant women  People with a severely weakened immune system such as those With human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). With inherited diseases that affect the immune system. With cancer who are on immunosuppressive therapy. Who have undergone organ transplants and who take immunosuppressive drugs (drugs that suppress the immune system).
How is cryptosporidiosis diagnosed?,"'The disease is diagnosed by laboratory testing of ''stool'' samples specifically for the Crypto microbe. For this, the patient has to give three samples on three different days.' "
What is the treatment for cryptosporidiosis?,"'Treatment for cryptosporidiosis is usually simple and easy in people with a good immunity system. It involves''The infected patient should also avoid the following things that cause further dehydration:\xa0''Pregnant ladies, children, and patients with a weakened immune system may need aggressive therapy of intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent dehydration.'

What is Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease'' is an infection that is transmitted by ''ticks'' and is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. It is caused by infection with the spiral-shaped bacteria\xa0Borrelia burgdorferi or Borrelia mayonii (rarely) that resides in the stomach of the ticks.\xa0The infected ticks of the genus\xa0Ixodes, commonly called black-legged deer ticks, transmit this disease to humans via tick bites by regurgitating their stomach contents into skin.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0' "
What are the symptoms of Lyme disease in humans?,"'People who spend time outdoors, particularly in wooded, brushy, or grassy habitats, in areas where the disease is common, have a higher chance of ''tick bite'' and getting ''Lyme disease''.''Tick bites are frequently never felt. Only 25-30% of United States patients with early stages of the disease can recall the tick bite. The signs and ''symptoms of Lyme disease'' depend upon the three stages of the infection, which are:''The first two stages are part of the early infection, whereas persistent disease is considered a late infection.''Symptoms in stage-1 ''Lyme disease''This stage occurs one to 30 days after the tick bite and comprises of the following symptoms:''Symptoms of stage-2 Lyme disease''This stage is called the early disseminated Lyme disease and it usually develops three to 10 weeks after the tick bite. It is called ‘disseminated’ as the infection in this stage has spread from the skin to different sites in the body. The symptoms include:''Symptoms of stage-3 Lyme disease''Persistent Lyme disease occurs months to years after the initial infection. It can appear after an apparent symptom-free period. Prominent signs and symptoms at this stage are:' Localized Disseminated Persistent Rash: The typical Lyme disease rash is called erythema migrans.It occurs at an average of seven days after the tick bite, at or near the site of the bite.It appears reddish with a slightly clearer center forming a concentric ring of redness giving it a ‘bull’s eye’ appearance.The rash is warm to touch and may or may not be associated with itching or burning sensation.

This is a characteristic skin manifestation of this stage. It occurs on the hands, feet, knees, and elbows and gives a “cigarette paper” appearance to the skin. Joint pain and deformities Nerve pain Weakness or paralysis Difficulty in walking Seizures Bladder disturbances Hearing loss"
Can Lyme disease be treated?,"'Lyme disease is preventable, treatable, and curable. Appropriate treatment with antibiotics in the early stage of the disease gives the best results. The most used oral antibiotics for this disease are:''Injectable antibiotics are used in people with brain and ''heart'' involvement and include:' Doxycycline Amoxicillin Cefuroxime axetil Ceftriaxone Penicillin"
What are the complications of Lyme disease?,"'Patients with Lyme disease generally have an excellent recovery when they are treated early with appropriate antibiotic regimens. Lyme is a serious disease, however, and may cause the following complications:''Rarely, Lyme disease can lead to death, generally as a result of heart complications.' Improper or inadequate treatment, especially in adults, can lead to long-term bone and muscle problems and difficulties with memory, concentration, and fatigue.

What are the common causes of PID?,"'PID is a swelling of the pelvic organs caused by an infection spreading from the vagina and cervix to the uterus (womb), fallopian tubes, ovaries, and pelvic area. If severe, it may cause an ''abscess'' (collection of pus) inside the pelvis. PID is more common in young, sexually active women. The common causes of PID include:' Untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, are the most likely causes of PID. PID may also be caused by several less common infections that may or may not be sexually transmitted. Having more than one sex partner or having a sex partner who has multiple sex partners. Recurrent vaginal douching (Washing the vagina with water or a mixture of fluids to eliminate odors and clean the vagina. This can push bacteria into the reproductive organs and cause PID. Douching may also hide the signs of PID). Rarely PID may develop after a miscarriage or termination of pregnancy, after having a baby, or after a procedure such as insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) or coil. Women who have already had PID are at higher risk for another episode."
How is PID diagnosed?,"'The doctor may suspect PID based on patient symptoms or during a\xa0''pelvic exam''. The patient may have pain or tenderness when the doctor examines the cervix or uterus. Below are some other ways to diagnose or confirm PID:' Blood test Microscopic examination of samples from the vagina and cervix Pap test: This test involves microscopic examination of cells collected from the cervix that is used to detect changes that may be cancer or may lead to cancer and show noncancerous conditions, such as infection or inflammation. Ultrasound: A diagnostic imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the internal organs. Laparoscopy: A minor surgical procedure in which a laparoscope, a thin tube with a lens and a light, is inserted into an incision in the abdominal wall. Using the laparoscope to see into the pelvic area, the physician can determine the locations and extent of infection. Culdocentesis: A procedure in which a needle is inserted into the pelvic cavity through the vaginal wall to obtain a sample of the pus, which is later examined to confirm PID."
How is PID treated?,"'Treatment may include painkillers and antibiotics used to treat ''gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'', streptococci, and other gram-negative bacteria. Due to the difficulty in identifying organisms infecting the internal reproductive organs and more than one organism may be responsible for an episode of PID, PID is usually treated with at least two antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of infectious agents. These antibiotics can be given by mouth or by injection. The symptoms may go away before the infection is cured. Even if symptoms go away, the woman should finish taking all of the prescribed medicine. This will help prevent the infection from returning. Severe cases of PID or ''pregnant'' women may need to stay in the hospital and get antibiotics through a vein (intravenous). Sometimes, surgery may be needed to drain a pocket of infection or an abscess. Aggressive treatment of PID is recommended for women with ''HIV'', who may be more likely to require surgical intervention.' "
How do you get ovarian cancer?,"'There is no sure way to know if you will get ''ovarian cancer''. But, there are several factors that put you at risk. These include:' Having a close family member with a history of ovarian cancer Having a genetic mutation (abnormality) called BRCA1 or BRCA Having a gene connected with Lynch syndrome History of breast, uterine, or colon cancer Middle-age or older age Having an Eastern European or Ashkenazi Jewish background Having endometriosis (a condition in which tissue from the lining of the uterus grows elsewhere in the body). Nulliparity (describes a woman who has not given birth) Fertility treatments Being overweight has been linked to increased incidence of ovarian cancer. Being on hormone replacement therapy"
What are the stages of ovarian cancer?,"'After a woman is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, doctors will try to find out the cancer’s stage. This helps them to know about how far the cancer has spread so that they can treat it accordingly.\xa0''The stages of ovarian cancer range from stage I (1) through IV (4). The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread.\xa0' Stage 1: Cancer is limited to one or both ovaries.  Stage 2: Cancer has spread outside of ovaries but limited to the pelvis.  Stage 3: Cancer has spread outside of the pelvis, but limited to the abdomen, or lymph node involvement, but not including the inside of the liver and spleen Stage 4: Cancer has spread to the liver or outside of the abdomen like to lungs."
Can Ovarian Cancer Be Found Early?,"'Only about 20% of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an early stage. About 94% of patients live longer than 5 years after diagnosis when they find the cancer early.''Ovarian cancer can be found early by''Screening tests are used to detect cancer in people with no symptoms. There is not enough research yet that has found a screening test to accurately detect ovarian cancer at an early stage. However, doctors have been using tests such as transvaginal ''ultrasound'' (TVUS) and the ''CA-125'' blood test to gain some early insight into potential ovarian cancer.''TVUS (transvaginal ultrasound)'': A probe inserted into the vagina and images are cast on the sonography screen to check if there is an ovarian ''tumor''. The shortcoming of TVUS is that it cannot distinguish between a cancerous ovarian mass and a noncancerous ovarian mass.\xa0''CA-125 blood test'':\xa0 This test measures the amount of a protein called CA-125 in the blood. High CA-125 levels are suggestive of ovarian cancer. But, the problem with using this test for ovarian ''cancer screening'' is that an increased level of CA-125 is also found in other common conditions such as ''endometriosis'' and ''pelvic inflammatory disease''. Also, not everyone who has ovarian cancer has a high CA-125 level.\xa0''A ''CT Scan'' is further used to confirm the diagnosis of ovarian tumor in case of abnormal CA-125 level or abnormal TVUS.''Some organizations advocate the use of the tests, TVUS and CA-125 test to identify those women who have a high risk of ovarian cancer due to a hereditary genetic syndrome such as Lynch syndrome, BRCA gene mutations or a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer.\xa0''A ''Pap test'' or ''HPV'' (''human papillomavirus'') test'' is the most widely used screening test for ''cervical cancer'', but it is not a very effective test for ovarian cancer. Even if ovarian cancers are found through Pap tests, they usually are already at an advanced stage.' Regular checkup of women’s health: A regular pelvic examination can help detect ovarian cancers early by careful palpation (the doctor feels for abnormalities with their hands). Consulting a doctor in case of ovarian cancer symptoms: Prompt attention to symptoms may improve the chances of early diagnosis and successful treatment. "
What are the most common STDs in women?,"'Common ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (STDs) in women include''HPV'' is the most common STD in women, which is also the main cause of ''cervical cancer''. There are ''vaccines'' available against cervical ''cancer'' for ''prevention''.''Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital ''herpes'' are common STDs. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported STD in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 50% of new chlamydia and gonorrhea cases occur in women between the ages of 15 and 24. A total of 20 million new STD cases are reported every year in the United States alone and approximately 357 million new infections of ''syphilis'', chlamydia, gonorrhea, and ''trichomoniasis'' are reported every year worldwide.\xa0' Human papillomavirus (HPV) Gonorrhea Chlamydia Genital herpes Bacterial vaginosis"
How can you prevent yourself and your partner from STDs?,"'Everyone should take certain precautionary steps to avoid getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as follows' Regular testing: Get a Papanicolaou (PAP) smear test every three to five years. Vaccination: Ask the gynecologist about getting tested for any other STDs and whether human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination can be suggested. Protection during sex: Use of female condoms and dental dams can provide a certain level of protection. It can help to protect both a woman and her partner from STDs. Spermicides, birth control pills, and other forms of contraception may protect a woman against pregnancy but not from STDs. Communication: A woman should honestly communicate with the gynecologist and her partner about their sexual history."
What if you get STDs during pregnancy?,"'Because there are no symptoms of this infection, many women remain unaware of their infection. Therefore, the gynecologist may ask for a full ''sexually transmitted disease'' (STD) panel test at the beginning of a woman’s pregnancy.''These infections can be dangerous to a woman and her baby. It may pass on to the baby during pregnancy and result in ''birth defects''; therefore, a woman must seek treatment.''If a woman has any bacterial STD, then the gynecologist may prescribe antibiotics. If a woman has a viral STD, she may receive antivirals that are clinically tested as “SAFE” during pregnancy.' "
What if you contracted an STD during a sexual assault?,"'Sexual assault could be the direct cause of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in women. If a woman has been sexually assaulted, she must immediately see a gynecologist or doctor.''To prevent further infection, looking at a woman’s risk factors and medical history, the doctor/gynecologist may prescribe any of the following' The doctor may try to capture DNA and evaluate a woman’s injuries. The doctor also checks for any potential STD infection while examining a woman. Even if some time has passed since a sexual assault, a woman should still seek medical care. The doctor/gynecologist may discuss possibly reporting the event along with health-related problems. Antibiotics Hepatitis vaccine Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antiviral medication Follow-up with the doctor at the recommended time is important for effective treatment of STD infections."
What is trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis'' or Trich is a type of ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'') caused by a parasite, Trichomonas vaginalis. It is the commonest curable STD. The parasite can infect both men and women, however, the infection is more common in women than in men. ''Trichomoniasis'' is more common in older women. Almost 70% of infected people have no symptoms. The symptoms at times are very mild, especially in males, and go unnoticed.''The symptoms usually start from the third day to a month after getting the infection. The most common symptom in women is ''vaginitis'' or the inflammation and irritation of the vulva and vagina.' "
How do you get trichomoniasis?,"'You can get trichomoniasis by having unprotected sexual contact with a person who has the infection. The infection can spread when cum (semen), precum, and vaginal fluids come in contact with the penis, vulva, or vagina. The body part most infected with trichomoniasis in men is the inside of the penis (urethra). The infection can spread from the penis to the vagina or from the vagina to the penis. The infection can also spread through vulva-to-vulva contact. Trichomoniasis can also spread by sharing sex toys or touching the genitals if the hands have the infected fluids on them.''The parasite rarely infects other body parts, such as the hands, mouth, or anus. The infection does not spread through casual contacts, such as sharing food or ''drinks'', hugging, kissing, holding hands, ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', or toilet seats.''Around 70% of the infected people do not have any symptoms, but they can transmit the infection to others. Amongst those who get symptoms, the disappearance of symptoms does not mean the infection is gone. Getting tested and treated is the only way to get rid of trichomoniasis.' "
What are the symptoms of trichomoniasis in men?,"'Most men do not get any signs. Some may develop very mild symptoms, which may be ignored. The typical symptoms of trichomoniasis in men include:' Irritation or itching inside the penis Burning or pain after urination or ejaculation Discharge from the penis Frequent urge to pee"
How does the sense of smell work?,"'The sense of smell is a part of the chemosensory system. The ability to smell comes from specialized sensory cells called olfactory sensory neurons, which are usually connected directly to the brain. These cells are usually found inside the nose and have odor receptors. Once the neurons detect the molecules from outside, they send messages to the brain, which identifies the smell by creating a unique representation in the brain. These representations are registered by the brain as a particular smell.' "
What are the different types of smell disorders?,"'Different types of ''smell disorders'' are:''Diagnosis by a doctor is important to identify and treat the underlying cause of a potential smell disorder. If the problem is caused by medications, the doctor may change the medication. If there is an obstruction in the nose, which may be restricting the airflow, a patient might need surgery to remove them and restore the sense of smell. Usually, people recover their ability to smell when they recover from an illness, which was causing their inability to smell. Some people recover their sense of smell spontaneously for no obvious reason. If a smell disorder cannot be successfully treated, the patient might want to seek counseling to help them adjust.' Hyposmia: It is a reduced ability to sense odors. Anosmia: It is the complete inability to detect odors. Parosmia: It is a change in the normal perception of odors (when something that normally smells pleasant now smells foul). Phantosmia: It is the sensation of an odor that is not present."
What is Lyme disease?,"'Lyme disease'' is an infectious disease transmitted to humans via ''ticks''. The ticks transfer, during their bite, spiral-shaped bacteria known as spirochetes. Spirochetes may enter the blood after remaining localized in the skin. ''Lyme disease'' has the potential to affect multiple organs. Spirochetes can attack the skin, ''heart'', brain, spinal cord, joints, and eyes.''People spending time outdoors are at the highest risk of contracting this disease, especially in woody, bushy and grassy areas of the northeastern and mid-northern US.''Different species of spirochetes cause ''Lyme disease'' in humans:' Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and, less commonly, Borrelia mayoni in the upper midwestern US Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii found mainly in Europe and Asia"
What are the signs and symptoms in the three stages of Lyme disease?,"'The stages of ''Lyme disease'' can overlap with each other, and patients may not go through all three stages. The symptoms vary depending on the duration and location of the infection.''Early localized Lyme: ''This stage occurs within one to 30 days of the ''tick bite'' and is characterized by a bullseye ''rash'' at the site of a tick bite. This ''rash'' is the classic first sign of an infection.. During this stage, the infection has not spread throughout the body and is curable.''Prominent additional signs and symptoms at this stage are:''Early disseminated Lyme:'' This stage occurs several weeks or months after a tick bite. Bacteria has started to spread throughout the body. ''Flu-like symptoms'' are accompanied by:''Late disseminated Lyme:'' If Lyme disease is not treated effectively or left untreated in the first two stages, then it may progress to a chronic stage known as the late disseminated stage. This stage may occur months to years after a tick bite. Bacteria have spread throughout the body and patients develop chronic ''arthritis'' of one or a few joints and/or heart or nervous system symptoms. Some of the prominent signs and symptoms include:' Expanding rashes which appear as bull’s eye, with or without an itching or burning sensation Fatigue Muscle pain Joint pain Headache Chills Fever Neck stiffness Swollen lymph nodes Sore throat Joint pain Pain, weakness and numbness in hands and feet Inflammation of brain membranes (Meningitis) characterized by a headache, neck pain and eye discomfort due to light Mild confusional state, disturbances in memory, mood, sleep and concentration are typical characteristics of a brain disease known as encephalopathy Discoloration or swelling may be seen in some parts of the skin Fever Heart block Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Facial paralysis Multiple rashes The skin of the hands, feet, elbows, and knees appears like cigarette paper (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans) Knee joint pain is the most observed symptom Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord may lead to impaired coordination, partial paralysis, muscle weakness, complete paralysis, seizures, intellectual disability, hearing loss and dysfunction of the urinary bladder Skin disorders are characterized by inflammation, discoloration and shrinkage Irregular heart rhythm"
How can Lyme disease be treated?,"'Antibiotics are used to treat Lyme disease. Patients recover faster if treated in the early stages.''The medications used in the treatment of Lyme disease include:''In patients with mild residual ''joint swelling'', treatment with oral antibiotics is continued. For more serious disease of the heart, joints, and brain, intravenous antibiotics are given.' Doxycycline Amoxicillin Cefuroxime axetil"
What should I know about Lyme disease?," Lyme disease is rarely fatal if treated early and is curable. Awareness about Lyme disease is the best way to prevent this disease. Using repellants, inspecting ticks and avoiding ticks are some of the effective ways to prevent disease occurrence. While going to woody areas, wear fully covered and light-colored clothes to avoid ticks. Pets can easily contract this disease, so it is necessary to make them wear a tick collar. For more protection, spray the chemical permethrin on clothes and camping sites. Some people have complained about lingering symptoms, even after undergoing recommended treatment for Lyme disease, known as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). The common complaints, which persist for six months or more are:Hearing lossVertigoMood disturbancesDifficulty sleepingTingling sensation Hearing loss Vertigo Mood disturbances Difficulty sleeping Tingling sensation"
What is intestinal anastomosis?,"'An anastomosis is a medical term used to describe connection or opening between two organs or tissues. When a part of the small or ''large intestine'' is surgically removed due to a disease or condition, the two sections of the remaining part of the intestine are joined together (intestinal anastomosis) to re-establish the continuity of the intestine.\xa0' "
Why is intestinal anastomosis done?,"'The intestinal anastomosis is performed following the surgical removal of part of the intestine due to intestinal diseases ore ''cancers''. Removal of parts of the intestine may be necessary for the following conditions:''Intestinal resection and anastomosis are performed during the same procedure. The procedure may be done in adults and children.' Intestinal gangrene (tissue death due to loss of blood supply)  Malignancy (cancer) Benign tumors (e.g., intestinal polyps, intussusception, worm infestations with intestinal obstruction) Infections tuberculosis complicated with stricture or perforation) Perforations due to infection, ulcers or trauma  Damage to the intestine due to radiation therapy.  Complications with bleeding, stricture or perforation Inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease Scarring and adhesions causing the intestinal block Chronic constipation Birth defects of the intestine (e.g. Meckel’s diverticulum, cysts, Hirschsprung disease)"
When to avoid intestinal anastomosis,"'The intestinal anastomosis may not be feasible in conditions with a high risk of anastomotic leakage. In such cases, the surgeon may advise alternative techniques.\xa0''The intestinal anastomosis is avoided in patients with the following conditions:' Severe sepsis (widespread infection) Poor nutritional status  Cancer metastasis (widespread cancer cells) Questionable viability of the intestine Fecal contamination or infection in the abdomen Unhealthy and diseased intestine"
How is intestinal anastomosis performed?,"'The intestinal anastomosis is performed under anesthesia. After removal of the part of the small or large intestine, the remaining two sections are anastomosed using ''sutures'' or surgical staples.\xa0' "
What are the three types of intestinal anastomosis?,"'The surgeon decides on which surgical technique to perform the intestinal anastomosis based on the patient and the condition. The three types of intestinal anastomosis are::' Side-to-side anastomosis: In this technique, the sides of each part of the bowel are either sutured or stapled rather than the two ends.  End-to-end anastomosis: In this technique, the two open ends of the intestines are connected. End-to-side anastomosis: In this technique, the end of the intestine which is smaller is connected to the side of the larger section."
What are the complications of intestinal anastomosis?,"'Like any major surgery, there is a risk of complications during and after the anastomosis surgery. Some common complications are:' Bleeding Reaction to anesthesia  Localized blood clot and smaller blood clots which enter the blood vessels causing heart and lung complications. Damage to surrounding structures Infection Scarring and adhesions, causing intestinal narrowing and/or blockage Wound dehiscence (a condition where the cut made during a surgical procedure separates or ruptures after being stitched together) Anastomotic leak (intestinal contents may leak through the site of anastomosis) which may lead to systemic infection Altered bowel movements "
What is asthma?,"'Asthma'' is a long-term medical condition that causes ''breathing'' difficulties due to ''airway'' narrowing, airway swelling, and excessive ''mucus'' production in the airway.\xa0''An ''asthma attack'' is a reversible condition, but it may be severe. During an ''asthma'' attack, the muscles around the airways may tighten, and it becomes difficult for air to move into and out of the ''lungs''.\xa0''An ''asthma'' attack occurs when the symptoms become severe. Attacks can begin suddenly and range from mild to life threatening. ''Symptoms of asthma'' include:' Chest tightness Wheezing Breathlessness Coughing Weakness Dizziness"
What are the three types of asthma?,"'The three common types of asthma are as follows:''Other types of asthma include the following:' Nocturnal asthma: This is the most common type of asthma. Usually, the symptoms are more prominent at night. The patient may wake up coughing, wheezing, or with chest pains. Studies show that most deaths related to asthma occur at night. This may be because of increased exposure to allergens (asthma triggers), cooling of the airways, reclining position, or even hormone cycles at night. Sometimes, normal heartburn can trigger asthma symptoms at night. Doctors may recommend diet changes, eye drops, nasal decongestants, and saline nasal rinse regularly to wash out allergens. Exercise-induced asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: Physical exertion of patients during an exercise can trigger asthma in some cases. Coughing and wheezing are the most common symptoms of exercise-induced asthma. With exercise-induced asthma, airway narrowing is maximal at 5-20 minutes after the exercise begins, making it difficult to catch breath. The symptoms begin within a few minutes of exercise and peak or worsen a few minutes after stopping the exercise. Usually, an asthma inhaler (bronchodilator) is recommended by a doctor in this type of asthma.  Allergic asthma/seasonal asthma: Inhaling allergens is the most common trigger for inducing allergic asthma. Allergens may include dust mites, pet dander, pollen, or mold. Sometimes, allergic asthma may be due to patients’ occupation (paint, metal, or gas); hence, patients may require knowing the exact trigger and consult an allergist or immunologist. A few drugs (such as aspirin) may also cause asthma. Few patients may develop asthma only during the winter or cold season because cold may trigger asthma attacks. Anyone who has an allergy due to allergens, season, or occupation may require immunologist or allergist intervention. A preventive inhaler and reliever inhaler are recommended by the doctor for this type of asthma. Occupational asthma: This is common in carpenters, hairdressers, animal breeders, and farmers who are exposed to allergens at their workplace. Medication and counseling may be needed. Cough variant asthma: Severe coughing is the main feature of this asthma rather than wheezes. It may be triggered by infections or exercises."
What are the common treatment options for asthma?,"'Long-term control and ''prevention'' are key methods to stop asthma attacks before they start. Treatment usually involves recognizing and avoiding the triggers as much as possible.\xa0''There is currently no cure for asthma, but treatment can help control the symptoms, so patients may be able to live a normal, active life. The following are treatments commonly used for asthma.' Inhalers: This may relieve symptoms when they occur (reliever inhalers) and stop symptoms developing (preventer inhalers). Some people need an inhaler that does both (combination inhalers). The inhalers are generally beta-agonists such as salbutamol, salmeterol or a combination of beta-agonist and steroid. Tablets: Patients may also need to take tablets if using an inhaler alone is not helping control their symptoms.Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs): LTRAs are the main tablets used for asthma. They also come in the syrup and powder form.Theophylline: Theophylline may also be recommended if other treatments are not helping to control the symptoms.Steroid tablets: Steroid tablets may be recommended if patients are unable to take any of the above medications to control the symptoms. They may be given as an immediate treatment or every day or as a long-term treatment to prevent the symptoms. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs): LTRAs are the main tablets used for asthma. They also come in the syrup and powder form. Theophylline: Theophylline may also be recommended if other treatments are not helping to control the symptoms. Steroid tablets: Steroid tablets may be recommended if patients are unable to take any of the above medications to control the symptoms. They may be given as an immediate treatment or every day or as a long-term treatment to prevent the symptoms. Injections: For some people with severe asthma, an injection such as Fasenra (benralizumab), is given every few weeks to control the symptoms. These medicines are not suitable for everyone with asthma and can only be prescribed by an asthma specialist. Surgery: A procedure called bronchial thermoplasty may be offered as a treatment for severe asthma. It works well, and there are no serious concerns about its safety. Patients may be sedated by general anesthesia during a bronchial thermoplasty. The procedure involves passing a thin, flexible tube down the throat and into the lungs. Heat is then used on the muscles around the airways to help stop them narrowing and causing asthma symptoms. Breathing exercises: Some evidence suggests that breathing exercises can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people, but they should be used in addition to the prescribed medicine. "

How is insomnia treated?,"'Cognitive-behavioral therapy''Multiple therapies can be combined with/without medication. These include:''Sleep hygiene education''Addresses behaviors that are incompatible with sleep such as ''caffeine'' or alcohol use, environmental noise, inappropriate room temperature, and watching TV in bed.''Cognitive therapy and relaxation therapy''Stimulus-control therapy''Works by associating the bed with sleepiness instead of arousal.\xa0 Rules for this therapy include:''Sleep-restriction therapy''Medication to treat insomnia''Acupressure for insomnia''Devices''Diet'', ''exercise'', and lifestyle' Sleep hygiene education Cognitive therapy Relaxation therapy Stimulus-control therapy Sleep-restriction therapy Correct inaccurate beliefs about sleep Reduce fear and excessive worrying  Relaxation therapy: The patient is advised to recognize and control tension through a series of exercises that consist of first tensing and then systematically relaxing each muscle group. Guided imagery and meditation to focus on neutral or pleasant thoughts Use the bed only for sleeping and sexual activity (no reading, TV, eating, or working in bed). Go to bed only when sleepy. If unable to fall asleep in 15-20 minutes, get out of bed to do something relaxing until sleepy; this can be repeated as often as needed. Do not spend more time in bed than needed. Establish a standard wake-up time. Avoid daytime napping. Sleep-restriction therapy is based on the fact that excessive time in bed can lead to insomnia. Limiting the time spent in bed leads to more efficient sleep. Works by limiting time in bed to the patient’s estimated total sleep time (not less than five hours) and increasing it by 15-30 minutes for a given week period until the optimal sleep duration is achieved. Sedative-hypnotic drugs Sedating antidepressants Antihistamines Other drugs FDA-approved prescription devices can be used in patients with insomnia. Avoid caffeinated beverages in the late afternoon or evening. Avoid alcohol in the evening. Avoid large meals right before bedtime. Exercising in the late afternoon or early evening (six hours before bedtime) can promote sleep. "
Three types of learning disabilities,"'The most common types of ''learning disability'' include:''Dysgraphia:'' It is a condition in which an individual has difficulty in writing. The individual may have unusual or distorted writing. In most cases, the individual also finds it difficult to understand different sounds and words that are spoken.

What is sleep apnea?,"'Sleep apnea'' is a ''sleep'' disorder that can potentially lead to serious health complications. In ''sleep apnea'', the person may stop ''breathing'' for some time during ''sleep''. ''Snoring'' is often a common symptom of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can affect anyone, including children. It is more common in older men who are ''overweight''.' "
What are the complications of sleep apnea?,"'Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to serious complications such as' Cardiovascular problems: The sudden decrease in blood oxygen levels that occurs during OSA causes the release of substances in the body that increase blood pressure and strain the heart. This leads to high blood pressure (hypertension) and increases the risk of heart disease. The more severe the OSA, the higher the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), stroke and sudden death.  Excessive daytime fatigue and sleepiness: OSA leads to poor-quality sleep that causes daytime fatigue, mood changes and drowsiness. Patients may have difficulty concentrating. They may find themselves falling asleep while watching television or at work and even while doing important activities such as driving. This increases the risk of work-related and road traffic accidents. Children and young people with OSA may perform poorly in school and have poor attention, behavioral problems and fall asleep while studying or in class. Complications with medications and surgery: OSA is also a concern with certain medications like sedatives and narcotics and general anesthesia. These medications relax the upper airway and may worsen OSA. Sleep-deprived partners: Loud snoring can disrupt the sleep of another person sharing the room, leading to marital discord."
What are the three types of sleep apnea?,"'The three types of sleep apnea are' Obstructive sleep apnea: This is the most common type of sleep apnea. It occurs when the airway is floppy due to poor muscle tone in the throat. Central sleep apnea: With this type of sleep apnea, there is no blockage of the airway. It occurs because the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the respiratory muscles that control breathing. It occurs in patients who have underlying medical conditions, for example issues in the brain stem (a part of the brain) or due to overdoses of certain drugs. Mixed sleep apnea: This is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea."
What are the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea?,'Signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include' Loud snoring  Excessive daytime fatigue and sleepiness  Abrupt awakenings while sleeping accompanied by gasping or choking Waking up with a dry mouth or sore throat Morning headache Difficulty focusing during the day Mood changes such as depression or irritability High blood pressure Nighttime sweating Decreased sex drive 
What is a phobia?,"'A ''phobia'' is a strong, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. It is a type of\xa0 ''anxiety disorder''. A phobia is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic fear of an object, person, animal, activity, or situation. ''Phobias'' are diagnosable mental disorders. People with ''phobias'' try to avoid what they are afraid of. If they cannot, they may experience the following' Panic and fear Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Trembling A strong desire to get away"
What are the different groups of phobias?,"'What are the different groups of phobias?There are three main groups of phobias which include the following' Specific (simple) phobia: These are the most common type of phobias and focus on a specific object. Specific or simple phobias produce intense fear of a particular object or situation that is, in fact, relatively safe. People who suffer from specific phobias are aware that their fear is irrational, but the thought of facing the object or situation often brings on a panic attack or severe anxiety. Examples may include persistent fear of dogs, insects, or snakes; driving a car; heights; tunnels or bridges; thunderstorms; and/or flying. Social phobia: People with a social phobia are afraid of being in the company of other people. They fear being humiliated or embarrassed in front of other people. This problem may also be related to feelings of inferiority and low self-esteem and can drive a person to drop out of school, avoid making friends, and remain unemployed. Agoraphobia: People with agoraphobia are afraid of being in open spaces such as markets, bank queues, or bridges. In some cases, panic attacks can become so debilitating that the person may develop agoraphobia because they fear another panic attack. In extreme cases, a person with agoraphobia may be afraid to leave their house."
What are the top 10 phobias?,"'People may develop a phobia of almost anything. Additionally, as society changes, the list of potential phobias may change. For instance, nomophobia is the fear of being without a cell phone, computer, or technology. The top ten phobias are as follows' Claustrophobia: This is the fear of being in constricted, confined spaces. Zoophobia: This is an umbrella term that involves extreme fear of certain animals. Arachnophobia means fear of spiders. Ornithophobia is the fear of birds. Ophidiophobia is the fear of snakes and apiphobia means the fear of bees. Brontophobia: This is the fear of thunder and thunderstorms. Such people know that thunder cannot harm them, but they are still worried about going out during a thunderstorm. Acrophobia: This is the fear of heights. It is a dangerous condition that can affect a person even when they are climbing stairs or a ladder. The fear may be so extreme that the person may not be able to move and it may be difficult to rescue them. Aerophobia: This is the fear of flying. The person may have severe anxiety in a plane. This may be due to a bad flight-related experience in the past, such as extreme turbulence or even witnessing a crash on TV. Blood, injury and injection (BII) phobia: Injury phobias are generally phobias associated with fear of medical procedures. They may often be associated with fainting and hyperventilation. These include hemophobia (fear of blood) and trypanophobia (fear of receiving an injection). Odontiatophobia is the fear of visiting a dentist. Carcinophobia: This is the fear of developing cancer. Such people tend to correlate every new symptom with cancer. For example, every headache is a brain tumor. Emetophobia: This is the fear of vomiting. This makes a person unnaturally afraid of vomiting, especially in public.  Phasmophobia: This is the fear of ghosts and it is quite a common fear. Triskaidekaphobia: This is an extreme fear related to the number 13."
What are the treatment options for phobias?,"'Phobias are treatable and people who have them are nearly always aware of their disorder. This helps diagnosis a great deal. Phobias are treated with a combination of therapy and medications, which may include the following''Medication therapy may carry the risk of a few common side effects, which include ''nausea'', vomiting, ''dizziness'' and sometimes ''weight gain''. A doctor may prescribe the best medication with the least side effects depending on the type of phobia.' Behavioral therapy: Behavioral therapy is an umbrella term for the types of therapy that are used to treat mental health disorders. This form of therapy seeks to identify and help change potentially self-destructive or unhealthy behaviors. It functions on the idea that all behaviors are learned and that unhealthy behaviors can be changed. The focus of treatment is often on current problems and how to change them. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): The doctor, therapist or counselor helps the person with a phobia learn different ways of understanding and reacting to the source of their phobia. This can make coping easier. Most importantly, CBT can teach a person experiencing a phobia to control their own feelings and thoughts. Medications such as beta blockers, antidepressants and tranquilizers may help treat a phobiaBeta blockers: These can help reduce the physical signs of anxiety that can accompany a phobia.Antidepressants: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed for people with phobias. They affect serotonin levels in the brain and this can result in better moods.Tranquilizers: Benzodiazepines are an example of a tranquilizer that might be prescribed for a phobia. These may help reduce anxiety symptoms. Beta blockers: These can help reduce the physical signs of anxiety that can accompany a phobia.

What causes narcissist personality disorder?,"'What exactly causes a person to become a narcissist is not known. Like other mental disorders, the causes seem to be complex. The causes may be linked to the person’s upbringing, ''substance abuse'', genetics or some specific connections between their brain and thinking.' "
How is narcissist personality disorder diagnosed?,"'No specific laboratory tests are needed to diagnose NPD. The diagnosis of NPD is made by a ''mental health'' professional, such as a psychiatrist with the help of various guidelines available under the aegis of the American Psychiatric Association. The psychiatrist takes the person’s family history, personal history of any other psychiatric illness and asks questions to determine if the person has ''alcohol'' or ''drug addiction''. They might give a questionnaire to the person who needs to answer honestly. A family member or some other close one is typically involved in the whole process.' "
What is the treatment for narcissist personality disorder?,'A person with ''narcissistic personality disorder'' needs long-term therapy that requires consistent follow-ups with the mental health care professional. The treatment involves a combination of ''psychotherapy'' and medication management.''Options for psychotherapy include the following''Violent behavior of the person may necessitate hospital admission to avoid dangerous situations.''There are no psychiatric medications that are specially dedicated to treating NPD.

What is bipolar disorder?,"'Bipolar disorder'' (also called ''manic''-depressive illness or manic ''depression'') is a mental condition that causes unusual and extreme shifts in mood.\xa0''It is characterized by periods of deep, profound, and prolonged ''depression'' that alternate with periods of an excessively elevated or irritable mood known as ''mania''.''Bipolar disorder'' does not have a cure but with appropriate medical and psychological intervention, patients can better manage their symptoms and live a more normal life.' "
What triggers bipolar disorder?,"'First-degree relatives of people with ''bipolar disorder'' are approximately seven times more at risk.''Depletion of certain chemicals in the brain may cause bipolar disorder. This can occur due to hormonal imbalance, certain medication, or ''drug abuse'' like ''cocaine''.''Changes in the gray and white matter in the brain can lead to bipolar disorder.''Depression'' is the manifestation of losses (e.g., loss of self-esteem and the sense of worthlessness). Mania can occur as a defense mechanism against ''depression''.\xa0''Stressors such as:''Antidepressant'' treatment may trigger a patient into a manic episode.\xa0' pregnancy stress at work or relationships seasonal changes"
What are the different types of bipolar disorder?,"'There are three main types of bipolar disorder – bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymic disorder.\xa0''Bipolar I diagnosis involves having severe manic episodes that last at least seven days or require hospitalization. ''Depressive episodes'' are also seen and last for two weeks. There may be periods of normal ''moods'' between these two episodes.''Bipolar II involves a current or past major depressive episode lasting for at least two weeks. The person must also have had a current or past episode of ''hypomania''. Women have a higher risk than men to develop ''bipolar II disorder''.\xa0''Patients may experience ongoing bipolar symptoms that do not meet the full criteria for a bipolar I or bipolar II diagnosis.

It sucks the air into the lungs by expanding and contracting the chest through a device that wraps the chest.  This method of ventilation is hardly used nowadays.
How does noninvasive ventilation work?,'The most commonly used noninvasive ventilation is a positive-pressure type. It helps in delivering oxygen to your lungs through a mask fitted tightly around your face or head in the following way:' The ventilator pushes the oxygen from the oxygen cylinder into the patient’s airway via your face/head mask.  The settings of the ventilator are adjusted in such a way that they regularly blow air into the patient’s airway and stop.  This cycle gets repeated which helps the patient in inhaling oxygen in the body and expelling carbon dioxide out of the body.
How is noninvasive ventilation set up?,"'Your doctor might give you ''sedatives'' to help you drowsy or medicines to lower your ''anxiety''.' You will be positioned in a 30-90-degree angle upright in your bed. A face mask or head mask will be fitted on your entire face or head tightly. A strap will be connected to your face mask to maintain its position. The oxygen cylinder will be attached to the ventilator. Your face mask will be connected to the ventilator, which will be adjusted on an adequate pressure of oxygen by your doctor."
What are the complications of noninvasive ventilation?,'Most complications are mild and happen with long-term use. These include:''Other complications include:' Ulcers at the attachment of the face mask Eye irritation and pain Congestion of the nasal sinuses Bloating of stomach Aspiration (sucking of food into the lung) Hypotension (low blood pressure)
What is the importance of suturing?,"'The goal of suturing involves:''However, choosing the correct suturing technique and meticulous planning is essential for a desirable outcome. The removal of non-absorbable sutures at the right time is important to avoid suture shaped marks on the skin.'

What are the three types of sleep apnea?,"'During sleep, the brain usually sends signals to ''airway'' muscles to breathe. Depending on this function, sleep apnea is classified into three types:\xa0' Central sleep apnea (CSA): It occurs when the brain does not send the signal to the airway muscles to breathe and there is no muscular effort to take a breath.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): This occurs when the brain sends the signal to the muscles associated with breathing and they make an effort to take a breath, but the airway is obstructed and prevents an adequate flow of air. Mixed sleep apnea: This occurs when there is both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea."
What are the risk factors of sleep apnea?,"'Sleep apnea can affect anyone at any age, even children. Risk factors for sleep apnea include:' Male sex Overweight  Age over 40 years Having a family history of sleep apnea Having large tonsils, a large tongue, or a small jaw bone Having a large neck size (17 inches or greater in men and 16 inches or greater in women) Nasal obstruction due to a deviated septum, allergies, or sinus problems"
What are the complications of sleep apnea?,"'Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder if left untreated.

Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP machine): Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) was designed for people who do not tolerate the higher pressures of CPAP.  Auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure: The auto-titrating CPAP machine is a “smart” CPAP machine that makes pressure adjustments throughout the night. The goal of auto-titrating CPAP is to have the lowest possible pressure for each position or sleep level.  Nasal surgery Palate surgery  Upper airway stimulation therapy Tongue reduction surgery Maxillo-mandibular advancement Tracheostomy Weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery)"
What are the types of thyroid cancer?,"'Thyroid cancer'"" arises from the cells of the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck, just below Adam's apple. The thyroid gland produces hormones (chemicals) that regulate body weight, temperature, ""'blood pressure'' and ''heart'' rate.''Thyroid cancer'' is classified on the basis of the type of cells present in the ''tumor''. The treatment and prognosis depend on the type of thyroid ''cancer''.''Types of thyroid ''cancer'' include' Papillary thyroid cancer: This is the most common form of thyroid cancer. It arises from the cells in the thyroid gland that produce and store thyroid hormones (follicular cells). Papillary thyroid cancer occurs most commonly in people between the ages of 30 and 50, but it can occur at any age. Follicular thyroid cancer: Follicular thyroid cancer also arises from the follicular cells of the thyroid. It commonly presents in those over the age of 50. Hurthle cell cancer is a rare variant of follicular thyroid cancer and is more aggressive. Papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer are sometimes referred together as differentiated thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid cancer: Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare type of thyroid cancer that usually occurs in older patients over the age of 60. It is very aggressive and grows rapidly. It is very difficult to treat with a poor prognosis. Anaplastic thyroid cancer typically occurs in adults who are 60 years of age and older. Medullary thyroid cancer: Medullary thyroid cancer arises in the C cells in the thyroid gland. C cells produce a hormone called calcitonin. Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood may indicate medullary thyroid cancer at an early stage. Calcitonin levels also help to monitor treatment.  Other rare types: Though extremely rare, some types of cancer can arise in the thyroid, such as thyroid lymphoma (arises from the immune cells of the thyroid) or thyroid sarcoma (arises from the connective tissue cells in the thyroid)."
How is thyroid cancer treated?,"'The treatment may involve one or a combination of multiple treatment modalities, which depend on the extent and type of cancer.''The treatment options include' Surgery: It may involve removing all (total thyroidectomy) or most of the thyroid (near-total thyroidectomy). Removal of lymph nodes in the neck (lymph node dissection) may or may not be performed.  Thyroid hormone therapy: After thyroidectomy surgery, thyroid hormone medication needs to be taken for a lifetime to replace thyroid hormone levels. Radioactive iodine: Radioactive iodine treatment uses large doses of radioactive iodine and is usually used after surgery. It destroys the remaining thyroid tissue and microscopic thyroid cancer. Most of the radioactive iodine is excreted in the urine a few days after treatment.  External radiation therapy: This targets and selectively kills cancer cells and shrinks tumors using radiation.  Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a drug treatment given intravenously (IV) that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells.  Targeted drug therapy: Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormal proteins in cancer cells. The drugs block the abnormalities and can cause death of the cancer cells. Injecting alcohol into cancers: Alcohol ablation involves injecting small thyroid cancers with alcohol using radiological guidance which causes the thyroid cancer to shrink. Palliative (supportive) care: This is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other serious symptoms."
What causes thyroid cancer?,"'The exact cause of thyroid cancer is not known, but various factors increase the risk of thyroid cancer. The common risk factors include' Genetic predisposition and certain genetic syndromes, such as familial medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia, familial adenomatous polyposis and Cowden's syndrome History of breast cancer Female sex  Radiation exposure because of cancer treatment, occupation or its presence in the environment Age: Thyroid cancer is more common in those who are over the age of 40."
What are the warning signs of thyroid cancer?,'The common signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include' A swelling in the anterior part of the neck which is painless initially  Difficulty swallowing  Difficulty breathing due to compression of the trachea (windpipe)  Change in voice  Cough  Weight loss Palpitations 
How is thyroid cancer diagnosed?,"'The physician performs a complete clinical assessment. Complete blood analysis and radiological tests are performed (''ultrasound'', computed tomography [CT], ''magnetic resonance imaging'' [''MRI''] and radioactive iodide imaging). Genetic testing may be done if genetic syndromes are suspected. A biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis and identify the type of thyroid cancer. Biopsy is a minimally-invasive procedure that involves obtaining a small sample of thyroid tissue with the help of a needle and then studying it under the microscope.' "

Accompanied by dystonia (muscle spasm) and affects multiple body parts, such as hands, head, and occasionally, voice. Essential tremors are chronic, slow-progressive tremors that are 8-10 times more prevalent than Parkinson’s disease and mostly run in families (inherited). These tremors affect your hands and arms and disappear during sleep. Orthostatic (posture-related) tremors affect one or more parts of your body while standing, walking, or other movements causing exhaustion and pain. Dystonia (muscle spasm): Research states that the brain sends faulty signals to muscles causing painful muscle spasms and forces the body into twisting, repetitive movement, or abnormal postures."
How will your tremors be diagnosed?,"'Your doctor/''neurologist'' may examine you, evaluate your condition, and may order for' Brain scans, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), to eliminate any other condition. Blood samples to rule out thyroid or copper levels. DAT scans to distinguish between essential tremor and Parkinson’s tremor."
What are the treatment options?," Lifestyle changes: Avoiding substances that may cause tremors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and Amphetamines, may help to reduce shaking. Physical therapy: Physical exercises may help to improve muscle control, functioning, and strength and eventually may improve your living.

However, certain factors put people at an increased risk, which include' Weight: Most patients with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight. Medical conditions: Medical conditions that are associated with obesity, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and polycystic ovary syndrome, can also cause obstructive sleep apnea.  Narrow airway: The tonsils or adenoids (lymphoid tissue similar to the tonsils behind the nose) may become enlarged. This is common in children and sometimes in adults. This can obstruct airways. Tumors in the throat and nasal congestion or blockage can also obstruct the airway. Hypertension (high blood pressure): Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people with hypertension. Smoking: People who smoke are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea. Gender: Sleep apnea is more common in men. The risk of obstructive sleep apnea increases in women after menopause. A family history of sleep apnea: Having a family history of sleep apnea increases a person’s risk. Decreased muscle tone: Muscle tone decreases with age and lack of adequate physical activity causes the muscles around the upper airway to become floppy and it narrows the airway."

What body temperature is considered a fever?,"'A ''fever'' is defined as a body temperature that is higher than normal. The normal body temperature, however, varies slightly among different individuals. The average normal body temperature is 98.6°F (or 37°C).''Having a fever means the body’s immune system is fighting against infections. This is a good sign in most cases. If the fever is between 100.4 and 102°F, it is considered a low-grade fever. A low-grade fever may not require treatment in most cases. If the body temperature goes beyond 102°F, treatment is essential.' For adults, a fever is when the body temperature is higher than 100.4°F. For children, a fever is when their body temperature is more than 100.4°F (measured rectally), 99.5°F (measured orally) or 99°F (measured under the arm)."
When should one visit a doctor for the treatment of a fever?,"'A fever between 100.4 and 102°F is considered a low-grade fever. A low-grade fever may not require treatment in most cases. Treatment for a low-grade fever is needed if the fever occurs in very young infants (less than three months of age) or if it’s accompanied by serious symptoms such as ''confusion'' or inability to eat or drink without ''vomiting'' or stomach upset.''One must visit a doctor for fever management if''If a fever rises above 105°F (or 40.5°C) and does not come down with treatment, urgent medical help must be sought because it is a life-threatening emergency.'

A fever is accompanied by a rash. There is photophobia (intolerance to light). There are signs of dehydration such as less amount of urine, sunken eyes and absence of tears. The person gets seizures or any abnormal movements or becomes unresponsive."
What causes a fever?,"'The body has an internal thermostat that regulates body temperature, usually around 98.6°F, despite the changing temperature in the surroundings. Any infection or ''stress'' can “reset” the thermostat causing a fever. A fever does not mean a disease. It is rather a sign that the immune system is actively trying to fight an illness or infection. When someone has a fever, the body temperature increases, making it harder for bacteria or ''viruses'' to survive.''Some of the common causes of a fever are as follows' Common cold Flu Ear or throat infections  Bronchitis Urinary tract infections (UTI) Mononucleosis, which is a contagious illness that is most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and certain other infections. It is also called “the kissing disease” because it spreads easily through body fluids such as saliva.

How is a liver biopsy done?,"'There are several steps to a liver biopsy procedure:' Liver biopsy is usually done under local anesthesia.  The patient is asked to lie on their back, with their right elbow out to the side and right hand under the head. It is important that the patient remain as still as possible during the procedure.  An ultrasound is used to mark the location of the liver.  The doctor will clean an area on the upper abdomen, then make a small incision and insert a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis."
What are the other methods of liver biopsy?,"'Two other methods of liver biopsy include:\xa0' Laparoscopic biopsy: During a laparoscopic biopsy, a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the doctor watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver. Transverse biopsy: Transvenous biopsy may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample."
How painful is a liver biopsy?,"'Pain'' is the most common symptom observed after liver biopsy. It is usually experienced as a mild discomfort. Some patients may need narcotic ''pain'' medication, such as ''Tylenol'' (''acetaminophen'') with ''codeine''.' "
What are the common complications of liver biopsy?,'In most cases there are no complications from having a liver biopsy. A few individuals\xa0 may experience:' Internal bleeding Pain at the site Infections Leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder Pneumothorax (a serious complication where the needle pierces the lungs and cause breathlessness)
What are the common types of visual field tests?,"'The common types of visual field tests include:''It often takes two or three tests to get good enough reliable answers.' Confrontation exam: In this test, the doctor sits directly in front of the patient and asks them to cover one eye. They may need to look straight ahead and tell the doctor each time they see the doctor’s hand moves into view. Manual testing (tangent screen and Goldmann exams): In this test, the patient usually sits a short distance from a screen and focuses on a target at its center. They need to tell the doctor when they can see an object move into the peripheral vision and when it disappears. Automated perimetry: In this test, the patient may need to look at a screen with blinking lights on it, they may be asked to press a button each time when they see a blink. Each eye is tested separately. It assesses peripheral vision. Kinetic visual field testing: This test is like the automated perimeter test, but it uses moving lights instead of flashing lights. Electroretinography: This test measures the electrical signals of the light-sensitive cells (photoreceptors) in the retina to identify vision loss from certain retinal conditions. Frequency doubling perimetry: An optical illusion of black and white lines is used to detect vision loss. These lines will flicker at differing times and rates through the test. If you are unable to see the lines clearly throughout the test, you may have vision loss in parts of your visual field. Amsler grid: It is used for people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This test contains a pattern of straight lines in the form of a grid. You must look at a dot in the middle of the grid, if any areas that appear blurry, wavy, dark, or missing, it means loss of central vision."
What are the characteristics of swollen eyelids?,"'Individuals with swollen eyelids may also have puffy eyes, abnormal redness, and swelling of the eye and eyelids. If the patient has an infection, they might also present with ''fever''. An individual may or may not complain of ''pain''. Some serious cases of ''eyelid'' swelling can threaten the vision of the eye if medical attention is not provided.\xa0' "
What can cause a swollen eyelid?,"'Patients generally present with a swollen eyelid due to ''allergy'', infection, fluid accumulation, or sometimes severe eye injuries. Below are a few important conditions, which can usually cause a swollen eyelid:''Preseptal ''cellulitis'':\xa0''Orbital cellulitis:\xa0''Acute\xa0dacryocystitis:''Stye'' (external\xa0hordeolum):''Allergic contact dermatitis'':' It is an infection of the outer side of the eyelid.  Children and young adults are more affected by this. Patients present with swelling, pain, and redness of the eye with generalized body fever.  Recurrent preseptal cellulitis is possibly due to an underlying cause that has not been diagnosed or treated. It is an infection of the eyelid.   Children and young adults are more affected by this. Symptoms include swelling, pain, and redness of the eye with generalized body fever, abnormal displacement of the eye (proptosis), eye irritation with water oozing (chemosis), and decreased vision and paralysis of muscles within or surrounding the eye (ophthalmoplegia). It is a serious condition that can rapidly lead to dangerous complications and require urgent treatment.  It is an infection that obstructs the tears from flowing into the nose.  Often occurs in infants. The patient experiences abnormal redness (erythema), swelling, warmth, and pain/discomfort (tenderness) with or without pus discharge.  It is a medically urgent condition owing to the possibility of serious complications. It is a bacterial infection seen on the margin of the eyelid.  The patient experiences pus and swelling of the eyelid margin affecting the eyelashes and tear glands.  The typical presentation is a sudden and severe onset of a red, painful, swollen boil (furuncle), which usually resolves on its own but sometimes leaves a scar or a hard lump (hard chalazion).  It is a delayed allergic reaction by the body’s immune system (T-cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction) due to external allergens (paints, metals, flowers, etc.) in sensitive individuals. This is more common in adults.  The patient presents abnormal redness with patches and swelling of the skin. Sometimes fluid-filled boils are also seen with the patches.  Affected skin or wounds are commonly seen in the area of exposure to the allergen, most frequently on eyelids."
How is a swollen eyelid treated?,"'Eyelid swelling usually resolves on its own within a day or two. Initially, individuals can gently wash the eye and apply a ''cold'' or hot compress to it. Getting sufficient rest is usually advised in these cases. Pain can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' medications but if the swelling does not resolve, it is advised to approach a doctor for further treatment.\xa0''To treat a swollen eyelid, the doctor usually recommends:' Common antibiotic regimens include clindamycin, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir.  In adults as well as in children older than 1 year, outpatient treatment with a 7- to 10-day course of oral antibiotics may be initiated with close follow-up. If there is no response within 24-48 hours, therapy might be switched to intravenous antibiotics and the patient should be monitored. Children younger than 1 year, patients with impaired immunity, and those with evidence of toxicity or more severe infection should be admitted to the hospital for administration of intravenous antibiotics. Once improvement is noted, treatment can be switched to oral antibiotics with further monitoring."
What is fatigue?,"'Fatigue'' is a constant, lingering feeling of exhaustion. It may be severe enough to limit a person’s daily routine and productivity. ''Fatigue'' may be a normal response to a tiring routine, extreme physical activity, emotional ''stress'', boredom or lack of ''sleep''. If adequate rest does not make the ''fatigue'' go away or if the fatigue lasts for six months or longer, it is called severe or ''chronic fatigue syndrome''. Such fatigue may be due to other medical conditions. Common signs related to fatigue include' Weakness Constantly tired or exhausted Difficulty concentrating and/or difficulty starting and completing tasks Fainting or loss of consciousness (syncope) or near syncope Palpitations (rapid heartbeat) Dizziness or vertigo  Unexplained weight loss Generalized body aches and headaches"
What can cause fatigue?,"'Fatigue can also be caused by a number of factors working in combination. The causes that may trigger fatigue include''Apart from the aforementioned factors, below are few medical problems that may cause fatigue' Lifestyle-related causes: Alcohol, smoking, or drugs or lack of regular exercise can lead to feelings of fatigue. Lack of sleep and improper diet can also increase fatigue. Shift worker fatigue: Individuals who get up early for work (slight sleep phase delay) or those who work late (slight sleep phase advance) may have disturbed sleep. These people also have misalignment of the body clock. Such conditions are a common cause of fatigue, especially if the shifts alternate frequently. Workplace-related causes: Workplace stress is known to be the most common cause of fatigue. Emotional or psychiatric concerns: Fatigue is a common symptom of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression and grief. It may be accompanied by irritability and lack of motivation. Personal illness or injury, illnesses or injuries in the family, too many commitments (for example, working two jobs) or financial problems can cause fatigue. Medications: Antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, sedative medications, medication and drug withdrawal, antihistamines, steroids and some blood pressure medications may cause fatigue as a side effect. Myalgic encephalomylitis or chronic fatigue syndrome: This is a complex condition in which there is constant fatigue for at least six months with post-exertional exhaustion and poor-quality sleep. Other than these symptoms, the person has memory problems or other vague symptoms that get better when lying down (orthostatic intolerance). Infectious: Usually, infections are one of the main reasons for fatigue. Examples include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, tuberculosis, etc.  Metabolic/endocrine: Metabolic- or hormone-related changes are the common causes of fatigue, especially in women. Examples include pregnancy, thyroid problems, diabetes, electrolyte abnormalities, kidney disease, liver disease, etc. Heart and lung diseases: Heart and lung disease are some of the most common causes of fatigue in older people. Examples include heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, arrhythmias, pneumonia, etc.  Vitamin deficiencies: These include vitamin B12 deficiency, vitamin D deficiency, folic acid deficiency and iron deficiency. Allergies: Allergies are a common cause of severe fatigue. Allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and environmental and seasonal allergies are common examples that may cause severe fatigue. Other causes: These include cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, arthritis, systemic lupus, fibromyalgia, sleep apnea and obesity."
How is fatigue treated?,"'Lifestyle modifications can help a person relieve symptoms of fatigue. A few common modifications include' Avoiding alcohol, nicotine and drug use Getting enough undisturbed sleep each night, at least seven hours . A job change may be required if fatigue brought on by shifts becomes extreme. Eating a healthy and well-balanced diet Drinking plenty of water throughout the day Getting  regular exercise to keep the body fit Practicing Relaxation techniques such as yoga or meditation Maintaining a reasonable work and personal schedule Decreasing stressors in life by taking a break or a vacation or resolving relationship and financial problems Treating the underlying cause, if any Chronic fatigue syndrome not responding to the measures above may need medication. Modafinil and armodafinil are drugs available to improve wakefulness and make patients feel refreshed. These are reserved in extreme cases however and should not be used as the primary treatment for fatigue."
Does a person need medical attention for fatigue?,"'Not everyone needs medical attention to treat symptoms of fatigue. Simple lifestyle modification as elaborated above can relieve fatigue. However, in few conditions, medical attention may be required if any of the following are present' Confusion or dizziness Blurred vision Fever Little or no urine output or recent swelling and weight gain  Thoughts of harming onerself or of committing suicide Unintentional weight loss Constipation, dry skin and intolerance to cold Unable to sleep or sleep disturbances Severe and recurrent headaches Medication side effects"
What is infertility?,"'Infertility'' is the failure to conceive after unprotected intercourse, irrespective of the cause. Doctors would consider ''infertility'' as''Infertility affects approximately 10%-15% of reproductive-aged couples. The cause of infertility could be due to issues in one or both partners. In about one-third of ''infertile'' couples, the issue is with the male partner, whereas in a third of the couples, there is an issue with the women. In the rest of the cases, it could either be due to an issue with both partners or unknown causes.\xa0''For ''conception'' to occur, all the steps involved in ''ovulation'', sperm production, and ''fertilization'' have to take place correctly. There are several effective treatment options available for both men and women that can increase the chances of ''getting pregnant''.' The inability of a couple to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse without the use of contraception. This occurs in women younger than 35 years.  In women aged 35 years and older, it is the inability to conceive after six months of regular intercourse without the use of contraceptives"
What causes infertility in women?,"'Causes of female infertility in women include' Abnormalities in the cervix, uterus or fallopian tubes: Benign or malignant tumors of the cervix or uterus. This could prevent the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus. Inflammation of the fallopian tube can cause scarring, adhesions, and blockage of the tube, preventing the sperm from fertilizing the egg. One or both fallopian tubes may be affected. Surgeries involving the reproductive organs or pelvic areas can cause scarring and adhesions, which can affect fertilization or implantation of the fertilized egg. Benign or malignant tumors of the cervix or uterus. This could prevent the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus.  Inflammation of the fallopian tube can cause scarring, adhesions, and blockage of the tube, preventing the sperm from fertilizing the egg. One or both fallopian tubes may be affected.  Surgeries involving the reproductive organs or pelvic areas can cause scarring and adhesions, which can affect fertilization or implantation of the fertilized egg. Ovulation disorders: Hormonal disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid disease, and increased prolactin could affect the menstrual cycle and the release of the eggs from the ovary (ovulation). Several other factors such as excessive physical and emotional stress, eating disorders, obesity, smoking, drug abuse, excessive alcohol, age above 37 years, or tumors may affect ovulation.  Several other factors such as excessive physical and emotional stress, eating disorders, obesity, smoking, drug abuse, excessive alcohol, age above 37 years, or tumors may affect ovulation.  Endometriosis: A condition in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus and may affect the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestine, or other organs, affecting their function. Early menopause:  The ovaries stop working and menstruation ends before age 40 years. The cause is often unknown. It could be due to genetic factors, other underlying medical conditions, chemotherapy, or radiation.  Genetic disorders: Chromosomal abnormalities like Turner's syndrome can cause infertility. "
What causes infertility in men?,"'Causes of infertility in men:' Abnormalities in sperm production and/or function: Sperm production and/or mobility may be affected by several factors. They could be due to undescended testes, genetic disorders, hormonal disorders like diabetes, and thyroid disease. Infections like sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), cancer, cancer treatment, physical and emotional stress can also affect sperm production and mobility. Problems with sperm delivery: This could be due to damage or blockage in the reproductive organs due to genetic disorders, structural abnormalities, or infections. Sexual problems like premature ejaculation can also affect sperm delivery.  Environmental factors: Exposure to harmful chemicals, high temperature, smoking, and drug abuse can compromise fertility."
How is infertility diagnosed?,'The physician takes a detailed history and performs a physical assessment of both the partners. The physician would then advise some specialized laboratory and radiological tests for both partners.\xa0''Tests for women:''Tests for men:' Blood tests to study the level of reproductive hormones and other hormones affecting ovulation Imaging studies like hysterosalpingography and pelvic ultrasound may be done to evaluative the reproductive organs Genetic testing to rule out genetic disorders Hysteroscopy is a test that uses an endoscope inserted through the cervix to study the reproductive organs.  Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure in which a small incision is made in the abdomen through which a camera may be inserted to study the status of the reproductive organs. Semen analysis: To study the count and mobility of sperm Blood tests to study the levels of testosterone and other hormones affecting fertility Genetic testing to rule out genetic disorders  Testicular biopsy Radiological tests to evaluate structural abnormalities in the reproductive organs 
Can infertility be cured?,"'The treatment and chances of cure for infertility depend on the cause of infertility. There are several treatment options that can help overcome infertility, increase the chances of ''pregnancy'', and lead to pregnancy. Treatment options vary for men and women and maybe a single modal therapy or a combination of treatments planned by the doctor based on the condition.\xa0''Complications of fertility treatments:' Lifestyle modifications: This is usually the first line of management. This includes increasing the frequency and timing of sexual intercourse, healthy diet, management of physical and emotional stress. Stopping smoking, drug abuse, excessive alcohol consumption, medications that cause infertility will help increase the chances of getting pregnant. These measures can be applied to both men and women.  Medical management: Certain medications may improve sperm count or mobility in men and induce ovulation in women.   Surgical management: Surgery may be beneficial in patients who have reversible infertility. Surgery can be performed to correct structural abnormalities in men and women to restore fertility. Sperm retrieval: These techniques obtain sperm when ejaculation is a problem or when no sperm are present in the ejaculated fluid. They may also be used in cases in which assisted reproductive techniques are planned and sperm counts are low or otherwise abnormal. Intrauterine insemination (IUI). In IUI, healthy sperms from the male partner or a donor are introduced directly into the uterus during the female partner’s ovulation period. Artificial Reproductive Technology (ART): There are several ART techniques, of which in-vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most commonly performed procedure. IVF involves stimulating multiple eggs and retrieving them for fertilization with sperm from the male partner or donor, outside the body in a laboratory. The egg could also be a donor egg.  Surrogacy may be considered an option for some couples. Adoption may also be considered as an option by some families. Some fertility treatments increase the chances of multiple pregnancies, though many hopeful potential parents see this as a positive outcome.  Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: Overstimulation of the ovaries may cause the ovaries to become swollen and painful. Some invasive procedures may cause bleeding, infection and other complications "
Which foods make diarrhea go away faster?,"'Certain foods, particularly the bland ones, may help get rid of diarrhea faster. They also make up for the nutrient loss during diarrhea, aiding faster recovery. These foods are as follows:''Along with consuming the aforementioned foods, one must avoid foods that may make diarrhea worse. These include the following:' Bananas Apples White rice Toast Foods containing probiotics (the good bacteria that keep the gut healthy) such as yogurt, curd, kefir, and drinks containing fermented milk  Boiled or baked potatoes (peeled) Oatmeal Baked chicken or turkey (skin removed) Liquids containing salt and sugar such as over the counter oral rehydration solution White rice porridge Unseasoned crackers White bread Spicy foods Fried or fatty food such as chips, pastries, and bacon Caffeine-containing drinks such as coffee Soda Beans Raw vegetables such as cabbage Raw fruits and juices  Foods containing the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG)"
Why won’t my diarrhea go away?,"'Diarrhea is usually self-limiting and goes away in one to three days. If despite proper ''diet'' your diarrhea does not go away, it may be due to certain conditions:' Infection: Diarrhea due to certain bacteria or parasite infections usually does not go away without treatment. Even after the infection is cured, some people may have problems digesting certain foods such as milk and milk products and soy. This problem with digesting food may cause prolonged diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is a common condition after the infection. Post infectious lactose intolerance is due to gut damage due to the toxins of bacteria. In this condition, the affected person cannot digest lactose. Lactose is a carbohydrate seen in dairy products such as milk, cheese, and curd. It is commonly reported as repeated episodes of abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea. Fructose intolerance is another similar condition in which the affected individual gets diarrhea due to eating foods containing fructose (a type of sugar) such as honey, fruits, fruit juices, and soft drinks. Certain sugar-free candies and gums contain sugar alcohols (such as sorbitol, xylitol, and mannitol) as sweeteners, and they can cause diarrhea in some people. Celiac disease: It is a long-term condition, which results from an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Over time, the immune reaction damages the inner lining of the bowel leading to repeated episodes bloating and diarrhea. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): This includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, both of which cause long-term inflammation of the bowel. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): It is a long-term disorder that affects the large bowel. It causes symptoms such as cramps, abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation or both. Abdominal surgery: Surgery on the appendix, gallbladder, liver, pancreas, bowel, stomach, or spleen may cause long-term diarrhea. Long-term use of medications: Certain medications such as antibiotics can change the normal gut flora (the good bacteria). This decline in the good bacteria can increase the chances of infection with bacteria that can cause long-term or chronic diarrhea."
What is glaucoma?,"'Glaucoma is a group of ''eye conditions'' that damage the ''optic nerve'', which is essential for vision. This damage is caused by abnormally high pressure in the eye. It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults and is one of the leading causes of ''blindness'' in people aged over 60. Glaucoma may not have symptoms until the condition is at an advanced stage. The ''vision loss'"" due to glaucoma can't be recovered, hence, it's important to have regular eye check-ups for early diagnosis and treatment."" "
What causes glaucoma?,"'Glaucoma occurs because of optic nerve damage. The nerve gradually deteriorates, causing blind spots to develop in the visual field. The exact cause of this is unknown, but it is believed that the nerve damage usually occurs due to increased pressure in the eye.''Eye pressure increases due to the build-up of internal fluid (aqueous humor) that flows throughout the eyes. The fluid normally drains through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork at the angle where the ''iris'' (colored part of the eye) and ''cornea'' meet. If there is an overproduction of the fluid or the fluid does not drain properly, the fluid builds up causing increased eye pressure.' "
What are the symptoms of glaucoma?,"'The signs and symptoms depend on the type and stage of the condition:''Open-angle glaucoma:''Acute ''angle-closure glaucoma'':' Patchy blind spots in on the sides (peripheral) or central vision, usually in both eyes Tunnel vision occurs in the advanced stages Severe headache and eye pain Nausea and vomiting Blurring of vision Halos around lights Redness of eyes Seeing rainbows around light"
How is glaucoma treated?,"""The damage caused by glaucoma can't be reversed. Early treatment and regular follow-ups can help slow or prevent vision loss, especially in the early stages. Treatment options include:""'Prescription eye drops:''Oral medications:''Surgery and other therapies:''Treating acute angle-closure glaucoma:' Prostaglandins: These increase the drainage of the fluid in the eye (aqueous humor), resulting in decreased eye pressure. Beta-blockers: These reduce the production of fluid in the eye, resulting in decreased eye pressure. Alpha-adrenergic agonists: These reduce the production of eye fluid and increase the drainage of fluid. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: These reduce the production of fluid in the eye. Rho-kinase inhibitor: This suppresses the enzyme and rho kinase responsible for the fluid increase. Miotic or cholinergic agents: These increase the drainage of eye fluid. Oral medications, such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, may be prescribed. Laser therapy: Laser trabeculoplasty may be done for open-angle glaucoma. A small laser beam is used to open clogged channels in the trabecular meshwork. Trabeculectomy: A part of the trabecular meshwork is removed. Drainage tubes: A small tube/shunt is inserted in the eye to drain excess fluid and lower eye pressure. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS): This procedure reduces eye pressure, usually requires less postoperative care, and has less risk than trabeculectomy or installing a drainage device. They can be combined with cataract surgery. This is a medical emergency and usually will require both emergency medical and laser or other surgical procedures. Laser peripheral iridotomy is a procedure in which a small opening is created in the iris using a laser. This results in fluid drainage relieving eye pressure."
How to relieve back pain,"'Back pain'' or backache is a common type of ''pain'' that may affect any age group depending on the cause.''The most common ways to relieve ''back pain'' include:''Medications:''Injections:''Few common surgeries:''Rehabilitation:' Applying a cold compress to the painful area is effective. It is usually recommended to use ice therapy for a few days when suffering from back pain. Using ice wrapped in cloth for 10-15 minutes 2 times a day may help. Maintaining good posture is important. Slouching and bending over the keyboard all day may cause back pain. Using a proper chair with good back support while working and standing up every 30 minutes to stretch back muscle may help. Sleeping in a curled-up or fetal position with a pillow between the legs may help in relieving back pain. In the case of patients sleeping on their backs, it may be recommended to place a pillow or rolled towel under their knees to relieve the pain and pressure. Limiting physical activities for a few days may relieve back pain. However, the patient may need to be active and should not sleep for long periods because it may increase back stiffness. Resuming normal activities as soon as possible may ease the pain; bed rest is usually not recommended for back pain. In the case of women, they may need to avoid high heels. Eating healthy and nutrient-rich food may help in relieving and preventing back pain. As per research, deficiency of Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and Magnesium could be a reason for never-ending back pain. Foods that are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish) and antioxidants (colorful fruit and vegetables) can be included in the diet to help in pain relief. Stretching the body or back muscles before and after sleep may sometimes help in relieving and preventing back pain. Changing an old mattress. The average life span of a mattress is less than 10 years. As per research, people with back pain who sleep on medium-firm mattresses do better than those with firm beds. Staying positive and active by doing a few exercises that strengthen the core or abdominal muscles may help in a speedy recovery from lower back pain. Back massages may be beneficial to recover from back pain. A study found that people who took back massages for 10 weeks recovered sooner without many medical interventions. Using topical analgesic balms and taking over the counter pain relievers, such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol), Naproxen (Aleve), and Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), are the most effective ways to relieve back pain. Prescribed analgesics, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most effective way to relieve back pain. However, these may be used only for a short period because they are addictive, can aggravate depression, and have other side effects. Anticonvulsants are primarily used to treat seizures. Sometimes, they may be useful in treating people with back pain, especially if it is caused by sciatica. Antidepressants like Tricyclics, Serotonin, and Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are usually prescribed for chronic lower back pain by a physician. Epidural injections may be prescribed sometimes to patients with severe back pain. Trigger point injections may also relax knotted muscles (trigger points), which may have contributed to the back pain. An injection or a series of injections of a local anesthetic and often a corticosteroid drug are applied to the trigger point(s) to lessen or relieve pain. Radiofrequency ablation involves inserting a fine needle into the area causing the pain through which an electrode is passed and then, it is heated to destroy nerve fibers that carry pain signals to the brain. Spinal fusion: It permanently connects two vertebrae together using a bone graft. Artificial disc replacement: It is usually done for treating damaged discs. The procedure involves removing the disc and replacing it with a synthetic disc that helps restore height and movement between the vertebrae. Lumbar decompression: This procedure usually involves removing structures that are pressing on a nerve root either by microdiscectomy, where the protruding pieces of a herniated disc are removed under a microscopic view or by laminectomy, which is a more open type of surgery, where the facet joints may be trimmed to resolve disc problems. Kyphoplasty and Vertebroplasty: It involves the insertion of a balloon to expand a compressed vertebra, followed by the injection of bone cement into the vertebra. This procedure is usually done for compression fractures or osteoporosis. Interspinous spacers: These are small devices that are inserted into the spine to keep the spinal canal open and avoid pinching the nerves. It is used to treat people with spinal stenosis. A physical therapist or chiropractor may plan an exercise regime to prevent back pain. Developing an individualized exercise plan is essential to manage and prevent severe back pain. Patients may need core strengthening exercises for stretching and improving flexibility. This must be started only after consulting your specialist doctor."
Are cold sores contagious?,"'Cold sores are highly ''contagious''. They may spread from one person to another starting from the period a person feels symptoms, such as tingling and ''itching'', to the time the cold sore has healed completely (when the scab falls and skin has completely healed).' "
How do I get rid of cold sores?,"'Cold sore may go away without treatment within a week or two. You may consult a doctor to ease your symptoms and expedite the healing time.''If you get cold sores, the following tips can help you get rid of cold sores faster:''You must consult your GP if you have cold sores and:\xa0' Avoid triggers like stress, sunlight, wind, and exertion. Stay hydrated by taking plenty of fluids. Antiseptic mouthwashes may help if brushing teeth is painful. Avoid acidic or salty foods, such as fried and grilled foods, soda, meat, and sugary foods and drinks. Eat cool and soft foods. Do not rub the affected part while applying the cream, dab the cream gently instead. Wash your hands before and after applying cream on the sores. Avoid touching the sores. Use sunscreens and lip balms with SPF. Pain and fever can be treated with OTC (over the counter) painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. Avoid ibuprofen if you have asthma or stomach ulcers or you had them in the past. Aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years of age. Do not kiss anybody while you have a cold sore. Kissing babies while you have a cold sore may cause a dangerous condition called neonatal herpes. Do not share your creams, towels, cutlery, or cosmetics while you have a cold sore Antiviral creams, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, or penciclovir, may help to speed up healing. You may get the cold sore creams from the pharmacies over the counter without a prescription. Do not share your cold sore cream. These creams are most effective in the initial stages of the cold sore when you begin to feel a tingling or itching sensation. Creams may not be beneficial when frank rashes appear. You may need to apply the cream five times a day for five to six days. Antiviral tablets may be taken on a doctor’s prescription in severe cases. Cold sore patches contain a special gel, hydrocolloid. They can be placed over the cold sore to cover the sore area while it heals. They do not heal within 10 days. You are pregnant. You have compromised immunity due to diabetes, chemotherapy, or HIV."
What can trigger schizophrenia?,"'Schizophrenia'' usually shows its first signs in men in their late\xa0''teens'' or early 20s and women in their early 20s and 30s. It’s rare before adolescence. Men and women are equally affected. The period between when symptoms first start and before full psychosis is called the prodromal period. It may last for days to years and be difficult to identify because there’s usually no specific identifiable trigger.\xa0''Though the exact triggers and causes of ''schizophrenia'' aren’t known, several risk factors can contribute to ''schizophrenia'', including' Genetics (heredity): Positive family history increases the risk. Brain chemistry and circuits: People with schizophrenia may not be able to regulate brain chemicals called neurotransmitters that control certain pathways or ""circuits"" of nerve cells that affect thinking and behavior. Brain abnormality: Abnormalities in the brain structure may increase risk. Environment: Environmental factors like infections, exposure to toxins, drug abuse, and severe stress increase risk. "

ECT may help when medications are no longer effective."
What are the different types of breech baby?,"'A breech presentation may be of different types. These include:' Complete breech: In this breech position, the baby’s buttocks are down near the birth canal while its knees are bent so that the feet are near the buttocks. Frank breech: It is the commonest type of breech position. In this type of breech, the baby’s legs are stretched up so that the feet are near the head while the buttocks are the presenting part and come out first during the delivery. Footling breech: This means that the baby has one leg or both legs stretched out below the buttocks. Tone or both the legs are in place to come out first during delivery."
Can you naturally deliver a breech baby?,"'Some breech deliveries can occur through the vagina; however, many doctors prefer to deliver a breech baby by cesarean delivery. This is because there are several risks associated with the vaginal delivery of a breech baby. These risks include:' Distress to the baby during the labor Injuries to the baby during or after the delivery Injury to the mother The baby’s hip socket and thigh bone may get separated during the delivery There may be problems with the umbilical cord, such as compression or flattening of the umbilical, during delivery that can cause nerve and brain damage in the baby due to a lack of oxygen."
How will I know if I have a breech baby?,"'The general signs and symptoms of a breech pregnancy are not different from any other pregnancy. In advanced pregnancies, beyond 36 weeks, if you have a breech baby you may feel:''You must seek a doctor’s help to be sure if you have a breech. Your doctor may be able to tell you by examining your lower and upper belly. An examination through the vagina (per vagina or PV exam) may also let your doctor feel which part of your baby is closer to the birth canal. They may perform an ''ultrasound'' to be sure of your baby’s position inside the uterus.' The baby's head is pressing high up in your belly The baby’s kicks are being felt in your lower belly"
What are the symptoms of anemia?,"'Pallor or ''weakness'' is the main sign of anemia. A person may look pale or feels weak, more tired or ''cold''. This is because their organs do not receive adequate oxygen (Iron in hemoglobin is the oxygen carrier). The symptoms of anemia are:' Fatigue Shortness of breath  Feeling cold Weakness Dizziness Pale skin (Pallor) Dry or easily bruised skin Loss of appetite Headache Sore or inflamed tongue Hair fall Palpitations (a feeling of racing or pounding heartbeat)"
How do you fix anemia?,"'Anemia treatment depends upon the cause:''You must consult with your doctor if you think you may have anemia or you are at risk for anemia. They will determine and prescribe the best treatment options for you.' Iron-deficiency anemia: Your doctor will investigate the cause of iron-deficiency anemia through various tests. Nutritional deficiencies (low iron, B12, folic acid) are fixed through changes in diet or by taking supplements. If there is a problem with the absorption of vitamin B12, your doctor may prescribe B12 injections. Anemia due to chronic disease: If the anemia is due to a chronic condition such as chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism or chronic infections, treatment of the underlying medical condition will often improve the anemia. In certain conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases, the doctor may prescribe other medications such as erythropoietin injections. These medications stimulate the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Aplastic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when the bone marrow stops producing red blood cells. Certain medications and viral infections may cause this. Treatment for aplastic anemia may include blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant besides other therapy depending upon the root cause and severity of aplastic anemia. Hemolytic anemia: The cause for hemolysis can often be determined by special blood tests and by examining the red blood cells under a microscope. The treatment will depend upon the cause of anemia and may include removing the culprit medication, referral to a heart or vascular specialist, antibiotics or drugs that suppress the immune system."
What is a stye?,"'A ''stye'' (sometimes spelled as “''sty''”) is an infection of the oil glands that are along the edge of the eyelash.\xa0It is a red, painful bump that might appear like a ''pimple''.\xa0A ''stye'' can form either on or inside the ''eyelid'' near the edge of the eyelashes. An external ''stye'', the one appearing on the\xa0outside\xa0of the upper or lower eyelid, is more common than an internal stye that appears on the\xa0inside\xa0of the upper or lower eyelid.''The medical term for a stye is a hordeolum. A ''chalazion'' is also a bump-like swelling in the eyelid. But unlike a stye, a ''chalazion'' is not painful. It appears farther back on the eyelid and is not caused by infection; rather, it is caused by clogging of the opening of the oil-producing glands. Both the chalazion and stye can require similar treatment. However, a chalazion may take longer to heal than a stye.' "
Why do I get styes in my eye?,"'Several oil-producing glands are present on your eyelid to lubricate your eyes. Stye is caused when bacteria infect these glands and can occur without an identifiable initiating event. Several factors can put you at risk of getting a stye:' Lack of hygiene Sharing cosmetics Using cosmetics after their expiration dates Sleeping without removing eye makeup Touching your eyes without washing your hands Use of infected contact lenses: not properly disinfecting contact lenses, not washing hands before using contact lenses Hormonal changes Lack of minerals and vitamins in the diet Lack of sleep Stress Sharing clothes, face towels and spectacles/glasses with people who have styes Diabetes"
How do I get rid of a stye overnight?,"'You cannot get rid of a stye overnight.\xa0Styes often disappear on their own in a few days. Although it might be tempting, never try to pop a stye like a pimple. The golden rule is keep your hands away from the stye.''To reduce ''pain'' and swelling:''Also, follow these tips:' Soak a clean washcloth in warm water, wring out excess water, and apply to the eyelid. Do this for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Repeat three to five times a day. Gently wipe the eyelid with mild soap such as no-tears baby shampoo and water or eyelid wipes (available in drug stores). If the pain is severe, take over-the-counter painkillers. Never touch, squeeze, or pop a stye. Do not rub or touch the eyelid. Until the eye heals, do not wear makeup or contact lenses."
When to see a doctor for treatment of a stye?,'Medical treatment may be needed if the stye does not improve within 48 hours of self-care. Doctors may provide the following treatment:' Incision and drainage of the stye under local anesthesia. Antibiotic ointment. Antibiotic eye drops. Antibiotic pills if the infection involves the area surrounding the stye. Antibiotic pills may also be needed after incision and drainage of an internal stye. Steroid injection into the stye.
What are the symptoms of a stye in the eye?,"'Stye symptoms include the following:' An extremely painful red bump at the base of the eyelashes, along the edge of the eyelid Eyelid swelling The center of the bump may have a tiny pus spot Foreign body sensation (feeling like there is something in your eyes) Itching in the eyes Intolerance or sensitivity to light Increased tearing in the affected eye Crust formation in the affected eye Burning sensation Blurry vision Sticky discharge from the eye Pain on blinking"
How can I prevent getting a stye in my eye?," Wash your hands well, especially before touching your face and eyes. Wash your hands every time you wear or remove your contact lenses. Clean contact lenses before and after use with disinfectant and lens cleaning solution. If you use daily wear or other “limited use” lenses, discard them on the schedule recommended by your eye doctor. Remove contact lenses before sleep. Wash your face and remove makeup before going to bed. Do not use old or expired makeup. Do not share cosmetics with others. Eat a balanced diet. Do not share towels or clothes with someone who has a stye. Keep your blood sugar under control. Get a regular eye checkup."
What is alar rim retraction?,"'Alar rim retraction or elevation is a nasal deformity in which there is an undesirable elevation of the nostril margin, which results in excessive nostril show. This results in the creation of the abnormal shape. Alar retraction is difficult to assess. The alar rim is the skin along the sides of the nose, near the nostril. The surgical correction of alar retraction involves complex, unpredictable procedures.''Surgical correction is indicated in the following conditions:' To remove a nasal airway obstruction Patient’s desire for change in nasal shape Cosmetically unappealing deformities"
How to fix alar retraction?,"'Alar batten graft is effective to treat mild to moderate alar retraction whereas lateral crural strut grafts and alar extension are useful in a moderate to a severe state.''Alar batten graft is a type of cartilage graft placed along the sidewall to support the nose. The physician makes a marginal incision on the side of the nose. Next, the physician makes further dissection with a scissor in that area to loosen the attachment of tissues from the lower cartilage. A precisely sized pocket is made by creating a path down the upper border of the nostril (supra alar crease). The physician places a graft inside the pocket and closes the incision with ''stitches''.''The physician prefers the lateral crural graft for moderate to severe alar retractions. In this type of grafting, the physician uses grafts from the septal cartilage. For this, the physician makes an incision at the lateral crura. The physician creates a pocket by dissecting the tissue attached to the lateral crura. A precisely sized pocket is made to place the graft. Finally, the physician closes the incision with stitches.''For patients not wanting surgery, dermal fillers can fix alar retraction. Dermal fillers are a temporary correction procedure, where dermal fillers are injected to improve the shape of the alar rim. The results typically last for about 12 months.' "
What are the complications of surgery performed to fix alar retraction?,'The complications include:' Infection Postoperative bleeding
What are the signs and symptoms of a peritonsillar abscess?,'Peritonsillar abscess is generally preceded by a ''sore throat'' (tonsillitis) that worsens if left untreated. The signs and symptoms include:' Redness and swelling in the throat Painful/difficulty swallowing Trouble speaking Fever Chills Headache Swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the neck Swelling of the face Drooling Dehydration (pain makes the patient avoid eating food and drinking liquids) Hot potato voice (a voice that sounds as if the person is speaking with hot potatoes in their mouth) Halitosis (bad breath) Difficulty breathing
How is a peritonsillar abscess diagnosed?,"'Your doctor will ask you to open your mouth as widely as you can so that they can examine the inside of your mouth and throat. They can collect a sample of the pus from the abscess and send it to the laboratory to find out the bacteria that caused it.''The doctor can put a long, flexible tube-like camera with light (endoscope) for clear visualization of your ''tonsils'' and the surrounding structures.''To know the extent of the infection, your doctor may order an ''ultrasonography'' or ''computerized tomography'' (CT) scan of your neck region.' "
How is a peritonsillar abscess treated?,"'Antibiotics'': Your doctor will put you on antibiotics for 3-7 days. In mild cases, you can take them in the form of pills. If the infection is severe, your doctor will administer the antibiotics through your vein.''Drainage of abscess'': Peritonsillar abscesses that do not respond to antibiotic therapy need to be drained surgically. This procedure can be done in a doctor’s office or an operating room, depending on your health status. Your doctor may inject medication into your throat to numb the area or put you on sedating medicine that makes you ''sleep'' throughout the procedure. Next, they drain the abscess to remove all the pus and do sterile dressing of the area.''Tonsillectomy'': If tonsillitis or a peritonsillar abscess keeps recurring, your doctor may recommend your tonsils to be removed surgically. The surgery is known as tonsillectomy.' "
What are the complications of peritonsillar abscess?,'Treatment is generally successful at resolving the peritonsillar abscess and complications are rare.''Possible risks of a peritonsillar abscess include:' Recurrence (it can come back) Infection of the neck and chest wall Pneumonia Sepsis (a widespread infection that can result in organ failure) Airway obstruction
What does a bed bug bite look like?,"'The bite of a ''bed bug'' looks like a cluster of red spots. They are painless at the start but later may become reddish welts.''Below are a few common symptoms that distinguish bed ''bug bite'' from other ''insect bites'':''Bed bugs feed on humans and other warm-blooded hosts to survive and reproduce. They find a host by detecting carbon dioxide emitted from warm-blooded people or animals. They respond to warmth/moisture. To feed, they penetrate the skin of the host and inject a salivary fluid that contains a blood thinner to help them obtain blood.' The red spot may be much darker in the middle. Bites will eventually produce itchy red bumps and welts on the surface of the skin. The bites spots are itchy, and due to the scratching, you may get a bacterial infection. These bites may be often arranged in clusters or in a line which may indicate the path the bed bug took while it kept biting. Bed bug bites are normally located on the exposed areas, such as the face, arms, hands, and neck of individuals."
How does a bed bug bite affect an individual’s health?,"'Below are common health issues an individual may develop due to bed bugs.' Stress: Individuals may become stressed out or frustrated living in a bedbug-infested household. These bugs may spread quickly and may damage bed sheets and curtains apart from constant biting on the body. Living in a stressful environment for long periods of time can lead to a lot of emotional anxiety, which may then lead to health problems. Emotional anxiety may impact on our immune system and its ability to fight off antigens, making us more prone to all kinds of infections. Stress can also increase heart rate and blood pressure, as well as affect our digestive system. All these combined can increase the risk of catching harmful diseases. Infection: Bed bug bites can be very itchy, leading to the strong urge to scratch it until the itch goes away. Small open wounds from continuous scratching may lead to bacterial infection if left untreated. Allergic reaction to bites: As per research, 70% of the people could have allergic reactions due to continuous bites, which may sometimes lead to life-threatening situations. Disturbed sleep: Repeated exposure to bed bugs and numerous bites may lead to never-ending itch, and the thought of crawling bugs around is bound to keep anyone up all night. This may lead to fatigue, which in turn will affect efficiency in completing daily activities. Anemia: Serious infestation by bed bites can cause blood loss and cause anemia."
How to treat a bed bug bite?,"'Symptoms of bed ''bug bites'' may be relieved by the following measures:' Apply a steroidal anti-itch cream that contains Hydrocortisone, Cortisone, or topical anesthetic that contains Pramoxine for pain relief and Diphenhydramine for itch control. Use calamine lotion to dry out the rash. Take oral antihistamine allergy tablets and pain relievers like Ibuprofen to control the symptoms."
What is complex regional pain (CRPS) syndrome?,"'Complex regional pain syndrome''\xa0(CRPS), also called\xa0reflex sympathetic dystrophy\xa0(RSD), describes a group of painful conditions that are characterized by long-standing, continuous regional ''pain''.''Pain'' usually starts in the arm or leg and may spread to other body parts. This pain is continuous and intense that is out of proportion to the injury. Other symptoms may include color and temperature changes of the skin over the affected area, skin sensitivity, ''sweating'', and swelling. Those affected may have severe pain, swelling of the limbs, and reduced movements of the affected body parts. About 35% of the affected people report symptoms throughout their whole body.\xa0''CRPS is rare, and the exact cause is unknown. CRPS\xa0usually presents after an injury, a major surgery, a ''stroke'', or a ''heart'' attack.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome?,"'The signs and symptoms usually begin in one limb initially and eventually spread to the rest of the body. 35% of people with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) have symptoms throughout the body. Some of the changes are irreversible, whereas other symptoms may last for months or years. Signs and symptoms of\xa0CRPS\xa0include:' Constant throbbing pain or burning pain, usually in the arm, leg, hand, or foot Increased sensitivity to cold or touch Swelling of the affected area  Changes in skin color, ranging from white to red or blue Changes in skin texture, thinning or shiny appearance in the affected area Frequent changes in the skin temperature, alternating between sweaty and cold Muscle spasms and tremors Weakness and atrophy (muscle loss) Changes in hair and nail growth Joint stiffness and joint damage Limited range of movement Affected limb may become cold and pale"
What are the complications of complex regional pain syndrome?,"""If\xa0the complications of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) isn't diagnosed and treated early, the disease progresses, becomes debilitating, and leads to irreversible complications. These may include:"" Atrophy (tissue wasting): CRPS can cause the muscles, bones, and skin to weaken and deteriorate causing difficulty in moving the affected area. Contracture (muscle tightening): Patients experience contracture (tightening) of the muscles, leading the hands, fingers, feet, or toes to contract and remain in a fixed position. Muscle weakness: This is experienced in the affected areas."
Can complex regional pain syndrome be prevented?,"'These following might help you reduce the risk of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS):' Taking vitamin C after a fracture: Studies have shown that consuming high doses of vitamin C after a fracture, especially wrist fracture, may reduce the risk of CRPS. Early mobilization after a stroke: Research has suggested that people who are mobilized by being made to walk soon after a stroke may reduce the risk of CRPS. Timely rehabilitation or physiotherapy: This may help to reduce the risk of CRPS after fractures or injuries."
What is congestive heart failure?,"'Heart failure'' is a condition in which the ''heart'' is unable to pump blood to body tissues efficiently. ''Congestive heart failure'' is a chronic disease that progresses with time if left untreated. Heart failure can occur due to diseases of the heart, the blood vessels supplying oxygen and nutrients to the heart, or sometimes from factors outside the heart (extracardiac causes). A healthy lifestyle plays a role in the treatment and ''prevention'' of congestive heart failure.' "
What are the stages of congestive heart failure?,"'Based on the symptoms and the amount of effort required to provoke them, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) has divided degrees of heart failure\xa0into four classes:' Class I: Patients have no limitation of physical activity. Class II: Patients have a slight limitation of physical activity. Class III: Patients have marked limitations of physical activity. Class IV: Patients have symptoms even at rest and are unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort."
What causes congestive heart failure?,"'Several factors can cause congestive heart failure. They include:' Coronary artery disease (disease of the arteries that supply blood to the heart) High blood pressure Cardiomyopathy (disease of muscle of the heart) Valvular heart diseases (diseases of the valves present in the heart) Diabetes Diseases of the covering of the heart Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) Severe infections Anemia Thyroid disease Vitamin deficiencies Drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine Chronic diseases of the lungs Obesity Smoking Birth defects of the heart Kidney diseases Alcohol use"
What are the early signs of congestive heart failure?,"'The initial stage of congestive heart failure may not cause symptoms. As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more obvious and interfere with activity. Symptoms of heart failure include the following:' Breathlessness Difficulty in breathing on lying down Chest pain/heaviness Pounding, irregular or fast heartbeat (palpitations) Cough Fatigue Weakness Increased or decreased urine frequency Loss of appetite Weight loss Nausea Distended abdomen Pain abdomen Swelling especially of the feet and legs Pale or bluish skin Fainting Noisy breathing Weight gain Confusion Memory impairment Anxiety Headaches Sleep disturbances Bad dreams or nightmares"
What are the complications of heart failure?, Arrhythmia (disorders of heart rhythm) Kidney damage Liver damage Damage to heart valves Damage to heart muscles Fluid in the lungs Death
What is the life expectancy of a person with heart failure?,"'The prognosis after heart failure depends on many factors:''Although heart failure is a serious condition, it does not mean that the heart stops functioning altogether. With proper management, persons who have congestive heart failure can lead nearly normal lives, depending on its severity. Besides the required medical and surgical interventions, it is important to eat healthy, stay active as possible, and refrain from alcohol, ''smoking'', and ''drug abuse''. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost half of the patients with congestive heart failure live beyond five years.' Severity or stage of congestive heart failure Age of the patient Promptness and adequacy of treatment Lifestyle measures Genetics Presence of other diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure Addictions like smoking and alcohol"
What is Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome'' is a ''genetic disorder'' caused by abnormal cell division resulting in chromosomal abnormality. Abnormalities include an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This genetic abnormality leads to developmental and physical changes that are characteristic of ''Down syndrome''.''The severity of Down syndrome varies. Some cases may be mild, whereas others have severe mental disability and developmental retardation. They may also have systemic medical abnormalities, including ''heart'' and gastrointestinal (bowel) disorders. The lifespan of patients with Down syndrome has increased to more than 60 years, depending on the severity of health problems because of advancement in medical treatment options. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach involving doctors from several medical specialties, healthcare providers and special education teachers. Lifelong treatment is required to manage their medical and intellectual problems.' "
What causes Down syndrome?,"'Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes. In each pair, one chromosome comes from the mother and the other from the father. Sometimes, there is abnormal cell division involving the chromosome that results in Down syndrome. This abnormal cell division results in an extra partial or full chromosome 21, which is responsible for all the features associated with Down syndrome. Down syndrome is usually not ''inherited''. Abnormal cell division in the early stages of ''fetal development'' causes Down syndrome.''There are no known external or behavioral factors that cause Down syndrome.''There are three possible genetic variations that can cause Down syndrome''Risk factors: ''Certain factors increase the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. High-risk parents are usually advised to get genetic counselling' Trisomy 21: Trisomy 21 is the most common and is seen in 95% of the cases. The person is born with three copies of chromosome 21. This abnormality occurs during cell division during the development of the sperm or egg. Mosaic Down syndrome: This is rare. The person is born with only some abnormal cells with trisomy 21, whereas the rest are normal. Hence, the condition is called “mosaic” due to the mosaic pattern of normal and abnormal cells. This usually occurs due abnormal cell division after fertilization of the sperm and egg. Translocation Down syndrome: This form of Down syndrome occurs when a portion of chromosome 21 gets attached to another chromosome (translocation). This can occur before or during conception. Children with this condition are born with the usual two copies of chromosome 21 but have additional genetic material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome. Advancing maternal age: A woman's risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases after 35 years of age because older eggs have a high risk of abnormal cells and chromosomal division. However, most children with Down syndrome are usually born to women under 35 years of age because more births are observed among younger women. Being carriers of genetic translocation for Down syndrome: The child can inherit genetic translocation for Down syndrome from either parent. Having one child with Down syndrome: Having one child with Down syndrome can increase the risk of having another child with Down syndrome."
What are the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome?,"'People with Down syndrome have characteristic facial features including\xa0''Intellectual disabilities''Complications of Down syndrome' Small head Flattened face Short neck Small ears Upward slanting eyelids Protruding tongue Broad, short hands with a single crease in the palm Short fingers  Small hands and feet Short stature Poor muscle tone Excessive joint flexibility Brushfield's spots (small white spots on the iris, the colored portion of the eyes) Cognitive impairment Delayed speech and language  Poor memory Learning disabilities  Heart defects Gastrointestinal (GI) defects Decreased vision Dental problems Immune system disorders Seizures Sleep apnea (a type of sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts) Obesity Recurrent ear infections  Decreased hearing Spinal disorders Blood cancer Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease"
How is Down syndrome diagnosed?,"'Screening tests and diagnostic tests are usually recommended for all ''pregnant'' women, irrespective of age.''Screening tests during ''pregnancy'': ''They indicate the risk of carrying a baby with Down syndrome.\xa0''First trimester'' tests''Second trimester'' tests:'' Quad screen is the measurement of four pregnancy-associated substances, namely HCG, alpha-fetoprotein, inhibin A and estriol in the blood.''Diagnostic tests during pregnancy: ''They can confirm the diagnosis of Down syndrome.''Diagnosis in newborns: '""A preliminary diagnosis is based on the baby's appearance. The diagnosis can be confirmed by analyzing the chromosomes in the cells from a blood sample."" Blood tests: Abnormal levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels in the blood indicate a problem with the baby. Nuchal translucency test: An ultrasound is done to measure a particular area of the back of the baby's neck. In the presence of abnormalities, there is increased fluid collection in the neck. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): Cells are taken from the placenta and analyzed between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy. Amniocentesis: Amniotic fluid surrounds the fetus in the uterus. The fluid is aspirated from the mother's uterus using a needle. The cells in the amniotic fluid are analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities. This is usually performed after 15 weeks of pregnancy. "
What are the signs and symptoms of epiglottitis?,"'Symptoms in children:'' In children, signs and symptoms of epiglottitis may develop and worsen in a matter of hours, requiring immediate medical attention. Signs and symptoms include:''Symptoms in adults: ''In adults, the signs and symptoms may develop more slowly, over a few days.

A weak immune system: Medical conditions such as diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or medications such as corticosteroids increase the risk of epiglottitis. Lacking adequate vaccination: Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) vaccination is a routine vaccination given to all children. Delayed or skipped immunizations can increase the risk of Hib infection. Hib also causes other serious infections such as meningitis and pneumonia."
What are the complications of epiglottitis?,"'Epiglottitis can cause numerous complications, including:' Respiratory failure: The epiglottis gets inflamed and swollen causing narrowing of the airway or completely airway obstruction. This can lead to respiratory failure because the oxygen level in the blood significantly drops and the carbon dioxide level becomes dangerously high. Spread of infection: Infection that started in the epiglottitis can spread to other parts of the body, for example, pneumonia (infection of the lungs), meningitis (infection of the brain), and septicemia (bloodstream infection)."
What causes fragile X syndrome?,"'Fragile X syndrome'' (FXS) is a ''genetic disorder''. It is passed down from parents to their children. A genetic disorder means the genes of either parent are faulty.''A gene is the basic unit of transfer of characteristics from parents to children. Genes are present in the DNA inside the cells. A child gets one set of genes from each of their parents. The gene named FMR1 lies on the X chromosome. This gene makes a protein called FMR that helps nerve cells communicate with each other. A child needs this protein for normal brain development. In FXS, this protein is either absent, deficient or abnormal.''There is a 50 percent chance of passing these faulty FMR1 genes from women to their ''babies''. A father can only pass it to their daughters.''Therefore, boys are more likely to have FXS than girls and they have more severe symptoms because girls have two copies of the X chromosome. Even if one X chromosome has the gene defect, the other copy of the X chromosome can be fine and show no effect in most girls. Boys have only one copy each of X and Y chromosomes. If there are changes in the X chromosome, they will have symptoms of FXS.''However, some people show no symptoms despite inheriting fragile X genes. They are called carriers. These carriers can pass the gene change to their children.' "
What is fragile X syndrome?,"'Fragile X syndrome'' (FXS) is a genetic (hereditary) condition, meaning it runs in families and parents can pass it down to their children or grandchildren. Kids with FXS exhibit developmental delays, delayed milestones, poor intellect and mental retardation. Some may have ''tremors'' in their extremities and problems with balance. They may also have mood disorders and problems with balance and ''walking''. Both boys and girls can be born with FXS, but it is more common in boys.' "
What are the symptoms of fragile X syndrome?,"'It is very difficult to spot a kid with fragile X syndrome (FXS) when they’re very young. Some kids with FXS may behave very similar to those with ''autism spectrum disorder''. They mostly show symptoms of attention-deficit ''hyperactivity'' disorder (''ADHD'') or are hyperactive or even just active and have trouble paying attention.''If your child has FXS, they may''Younger children with FXS may not display any specific physical features of this syndrome. Many will begin to develop certain features at the onset of ''puberty'' that are typical of those with FXS. These features include a narrow face, a large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat ''feet'' and a prominent forehead. These physical signs become more obvious with age.''Often, it is milder in girls. While most boys with FXS have learning and developmental issues, girls usually do not have them.''Girls with FXS may sometimes have problems with ''getting pregnant'' when they grow up. They might also go into ''menopause'' earlier than usual.''This condition may cause health problems such as' Be either very social or withdraw from social interactions Show aggressive and self-destructive behavior (in boys) such as biting things Flap their hands unnecessarily Avoid eye contact Be shy Have language problems or delayed rapid or repetitive speech Have mild, undiagnosed or severe learning difficulties Have poor fine and gross motor skills Have trouble learning skills such as sitting, crawling or walking Show temper tantrums Have poor impulse control Have anxiety Show extreme sensitivity to light or sound Seizures Hearing problems Vision problems Heart problems"
How is a child diagnosed with fragile X syndrome?," Your doctor may ask about your family history regarding fragile X syndrome (FXS), autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or any learning difficulties and cognitive functional delays in the previous child. Your doctor may suggest a DNA blood test to check for FXS in your child."
Can fragile X syndrome be cured?,"'Because it is a genetic disorder, there is no medicine to cure fragile X syndrome (FXS). However, there are some treatments to help your child learn more easily and manage their behavior problems.''It is better if you start these treatments in the early stages of a child’s life. Work with your child’s doctor, teachers and therapists on a treatment program. Learn about FXS to support your child.'

How is GERD diagnosed?,"'The doctor can diagnose simple acid reflux by just taking your medical history and asking for medical complaints. Dietary modifications and a few simple medications are usually sufficient to relieve the condition. If these measures fail to provide relief, your doctor may ask you to get tested for GERD. Tests for GERD include:' Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy: A thin, flexible tube with a camera and a light source (endoscope) is inserted into the bowel through the mouth. This helps in visualizing the internal structure of the esophagus and stomach and look for any GERD-related changes. The doctor may cut a small piece from the esophagus or stomach (biopsy) and send it to the laboratory for examination. Upper GI series: You will be told to swallow a liquid (barium compound). X-rays of your esophagus and stomach will be taken as the liquid passes through these organs. Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring: These are 24-hour monitoring tests that measure the amount of food and acid reflux in your esophagus and check whether your symptoms are correlated with the reflux. Bravo wireless esophageal pH monitoring: This is a 48-hour test that measures how much acid and food is refluxed in 48 hours. Esophageal manometry: Your healthcare provider inserts a small flexible tube with sensors into your nose to enter your esophagus. The sensors present in the tube measure the strength of the muscles in different parts of your esophagus including the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)."
What causes headaches at the back of the head?,'Headaches'' in the back of the head can have a number of different causes; it might only be due to a minor injury or it can be a secondary symptom of other problems in the body. The type and location of the ''pain'' can play a crucial role in diagnosing the cause of ''headaches''. Severe and recurrent ''headaches'' always require medical attention from a doctor.\xa0' 
What are the different types of headaches occurring at the back of the head?,"'There are a number of different causes that can lead to ''headaches'' occurring at the back of the head. Below are a few types of these headaches:''Tension headaches''Migraine''Medication overuse or rebound ''headache''Occipital neuralgia''Exercise''-induced headaches' Tension headaches are the most common cause of pain in the back of the head. They can last for 30 minutes to seven days. Severe stress, fatigue, lack of sleep, skipping meals, poor body posture, or not drinking enough water may cause tension headaches. Patients usually feel tightening around the back or front of the head; pain may range from dull to severe.  Treatment includes painkillers, lifestyle modifications, massage, and sometimes relaxing techniques (e.g., meditation). However, frequent tension headaches need a doctor’s supervision for further treatment.  Migraine is a common type of recurring headache that often starts during childhood and increases in frequency with age. Migraine is most commonly seen in females. Symptoms include severe pain on one side of the head with nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance. Patients are usually sensitive to light, noise, or smell. Physical activity can make the pain worse. Pain may last for a few hours to several days. Causes usually include emotional or physical stress, environmental, and dietary changes. Sometimes medications (e.g., contraceptive pills) can induce a migraine headache. Treatment of migraine includes painkillers and resting in a darkened room. Lifestyle modifications, hormonal therapy, and anti-migraine drugs such as triptans are usually recommended by doctors to reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines.  Medication overuse headaches (MOH) may develop if a person uses too many painkillers.  Symptoms include persistent headaches with severe pain. Usually, headaches restart after stopping pain killers. Other symptoms include nausea, anxiety, irritability, tiredness, restlessness, concentrating difficulty, memory loss, and sometimes even depression. The best treatment is often to stop taking pain relief medication entirely. Headaches become worse at first but will quickly resolve. In more severe cases, people should see a doctor. An individual may need physical or behavioral therapy to break the habit of using pain relief medication. Occipital neuralgia is a rare but severe headache that tends to begin at the base of the neck and spreads up to the back of the head, then behind the ears. Usually occurs when there is damage or irritation of the occipital nerves, which run up the back of the neck to the base of the scalp. Underlying diseases, neck tension, or other unknown factors might cause nerve damage or irritation. Pain is usually severe with burning or shooting sensation; the pain remains on one side of the head but often worsens with neck movement. The patient would usually be sensitive to light. Possible causes include damage to the spine, tumors, nerve damage caused by diabetes, swelling of blood vessels, and rarely infection. Treatment options include applying heat packs, resting, massage, physical therapy, and taking painkillers, which can reduce swelling. Severe pain may require medications, such as oral muscle relaxants, nerve block injections, steroid injections, or local anesthesia. On rare occasions, surgery may be necessary to reduce pressure on the nerves or block pain impulses to this part of the body. Exercise-induced headaches occur as a result of stressed physical activity. Pain may start immediately after exercise. Symptoms include a heartbeat-like pain on both sides of the head, which can last from five minutes to two days. These headaches are usually isolated events and may also produce migraine-like symptoms. Causes include weightlifting, running, and sometimes sexual intercourse, or straining on the toilet. Treatment includes taking painkillers before exercise, avoiding stressful activities, eating and drinking healthy foods, and getting sufficient sleep. "
What are hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'', commonly called ''piles'', are swollen, inflamed veins around the anus or lower part of the rectum (the terminal part of the large bowel). ''Hemorrhoids'' are common in both men and women. It is estimated that one in 20 Americans have ''hemorrhoids''. They occur more commonly with age, and around 50% of the Americans over 50 years of age are affected.''Hemorrhoids may be felt as tiny lumps in and around the anus. They may often get better on their own within a few days, but some may need medications and even surgery to go away. Hemorrhoids are of two main types:' External hemorrhoids: They form under the skin around the anus. Internal hemorrhoids: They form in the lining of the anus and lower rectum."
What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids may cause the following symptoms:' Itching in and around the anus Hard, tender lumps felt at the bottom (anus) Anal pain, especially while sitting Bleeding from the rectum observed as bright red blood in the stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement A bulging or swelling may be felt through the anus in case of a prolapsed hemorrhoid (a hemorrhoid that has bulged or fallen through the anal opening)"
What are the medical treatments for hemorrhoids?,"'The symptoms of hemorrhoids may resolve with ''diet'' and lifestyle modifications. You must, however, seek immediate medical care if your symptoms do not go away in a week or you experience symptoms such as severe anal ''pain'' and bleeding from the rectum, discomfort or pain in the\xa0abdomen,\xa0''diarrhea'', or ''fever''. If home management for piles does not help, you may need to seek medical help.\xa0''Doctors may recommend one of the following medical procedures for the treatment. These procedures include cutting off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid, which makes it shrink and go away. The procedures include the following:\xa0' Rubber band ligation: In this procedure, the doctor places a special rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off the blood supply.  Sclerotherapy: It involves injecting a solution (sclerosant) into the internal hemorrhoid. Infrared photocoagulation: This procedure involves using a tool to direct infrared light at the internal hemorrhoid to shrink it.  Electrocoagulation: In this procedure, a doctor uses a special tool that sends an electric current into the internal hemorrhoid.  Hemorrhoidectomy: It is a surgical procedure to remove large external hemorrhoids and prolapsing internal hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that bulge out of the anus). Hemorrhoid stapling: In this procedure, the surgeon uses a special stapling tool to remove internal hemorrhoids and pull a prolapsing internal hemorrhoid back into the anus."
What is hepatitis?,"'Hepatitis'' is an inflammation of the ''liver''. It can occur due to a variety of factors, but the most common cause is a virus infection. ''Hepatitis'' can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) and can have fatal complications.''The liver is in the right upper part of the abdomen and serves several important functions:' The metabolization of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and drugs Storage of sugars, vitamins, and minerals Synthesis of certain proteins like albumin and blood clotting factors Production of bile for digestion of fats Activation of enzymes required for body functions"

Can viral hepatitis be cured?,'Acute hepatitis can be cured. Chronic hepatitis can be treated to prevent progression and complications. Some types of hepatitis can be prevented.' 
How can viral hepatitis be prevented?," A vaccine is available for hepatitis B. Because hepatitis E only occurs in the presence of hepatitis B, the vaccine prevents hepatitis E as well. Good personal hygiene. Avoid sharing needles, razors, toothbrush, and other personal items. Avoid touching blood. Avoid unprotected sexual intercourse. Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol. Avoid using recreational drugs."
How does HPV spread?,"'Human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'') is the most common viral infection that is transmitted through sexual activity.''Papillomaviruses are ''viruses'' that infect only humans. It is mainly a skin-borne disease. People can get an ''HPV'' infection by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone infected with the virus. People with HPV may not exhibit any symptoms for years after the initial infection.' "
What causes an HPV infection?,"'Some of the risk factors for human papillomavirus infection include:' Unsafe sex Tobacco use Ultraviolet radiation Folate deficiency Immune suppression Multiple sexual partners Prolonged oral contraceptives use High-risk ethnic backgrounds, such as African Americans Having other infections, such as HIV Early and multiple pregnancies"
Does HPV cause health problems?,"'HPV infections often resolve without treatment and do not cause any health problems.\xa0However, persisting infection can cause:' Warts: Small or large, raised or flat, cauliflower-shaped lesions, observed in the genital area (genital warts), anal area, mouth and feet. Cancer in the larynx and vocal cords. Warts in the feet. Cervical cancer: Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to HPV infection. It may take 15 to 20 years for cervical cancer to develop in otherwise healthy women."
How is HPV diagnosed?,'Women older than 30 years should have regular screenings. They may undergo the following tests to diagnose HPV:' Cervical Pap test: This test uses a sample of cells from the cervix to identify cervical cancer. HPV DNA typing: This test uses a sample of cells from the cervix to determine if it contains genetic material causing cancer. Acetic acid test: This test helps in diagnosing genital warts. Tissue biopsy: This test confirms an HPV infection.
How is HPV treated?,"'Therapies to treat HPV infection include:''Drug therapy:'' Medicines are applied topically.''Surgical therapy: ''When the patients have multiple warts over a large area, surgery is considered.''Children in the age group of nine to 14 receive an ''HPV vaccine'' for ''prevention''.''Lifestyle changes' Chemotherapy drugs: Podofilox, podophyllin Immune response modifier: Imiquimod and interferon alfa Cryosurgery: Cold nitrogen that destroys warts. Electrosurgery: High-frequency electric currents that destroy warts or tumors Surgical excision of warts with a scalpel and scissors. Carbon dioxide laser ablation: Carbon dioxide laser that destroys warts or tumors. Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspiration: Ultrasonic waves excise the tumors or warts. Mohs surgery: A surgical procedure that removes cancerous tissue. Avoid skin-to-skin contact and sexual contact with your partner after warts appear. Use safe sex by using latex condoms. Condoms, however, do not guarantee complete protection from HPV. Only have sex with someone who only has sex with you (monogamy). Eat foods that are rich in folic acid and vitamin B12."
Is HPV dangerous?,"'HPV infections often resolve without treatment and do not cause any health problems.\xa0A persistent HPV infection may lead to warts, cancer of the mouth and throat, and cervical cancer.\xa0Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to HPV infection.' "
What is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic ''cardiovascular disease'', affecting at least one out of 200 people.\xa0HCM affects all age groups, from newborns to the elderly.\xa0It is a genetic condition that causes heart muscle tissue to become abnormally thick.' When the heart muscle grows thick, its chambers get narrow and thus, accommodate less blood. The thickening can make it harder for blood to leave the heart, forcing the heart to work harder to pump the blood. It also can make it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood. Usually, in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the muscle of the heart’s left ventricle is thicker than normal, or the wall between the two ventricles (septum) becomes enlarged and blocks the blood flow from the left ventricle. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may cause an arrhythmia, a disturbance in the heart’s rate or rhythm. In addition, people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are susceptible to endocarditis, an infection of the lining of the heart."
What are the signs and symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"'Many people do not experience any symptoms until the condition is advanced. People may not have any symptoms prior to sudden death. All the below symptoms may become more prominent after eating, especially after a large meal' Shortness of breath Chest pain Dizziness Lightheadedness or fainting Palpitations (awareness of one’s heartbeat) Lack of energy Swelling of legs and feet (the sign of failing heart) Syncope (fainting) Abnormal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation)"
What are the treatment options for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"'Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is usually treated with:''Medications:''Procedures:''Lifestyle modifications:' Beta-blockers lower blood pressure and heart rate, reducing the heart workload. These are metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL), propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL), or atenolol (Tenormin). Calcium channel blockers, verapamil (Verelan, Calan SR,) or diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac), which dilate (open) the blood vessels by increasing blood flow to the heart. Antiarrhythmic drugs, which help to correct an abnormal heart rate or rhythm. These include amiodarone (Pacerone) or disopyramide (Norpace). Diuretics, which reduce fluid retention, is a common symptom of heart failure. Anticoagulants, which inhibit blood clot formation by preventing the clumping of platelets in the blood, e.g., warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or apixaban (Eliquis). Alcohol septal ablation: Also known as septal alcohol ablation. It is a minimally invasive procedure that shrinks abnormal tissue and improves blood flow throughout the body. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): It is a device implanted below the collarbone that monitors the heart’s rhythm. When it detects an abnormal rhythm, it delivers an electrical impulse or shock to the heart to correct it. Septal myectomy: It is a surgical procedure to remove overgrown heart muscle and improve blood flow through the heart. Do not smoke. Eat heart-healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meats, and low-fat or non-fat dairy foods. Limit sodium, sugars, and alcohol. Drink plenty of fluids (unless the doctor has told to limit your fluid intake). Be active with minimal exercises Stay at a healthy weight. Lose weight if you need to. Manage other health conditions, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Get checkups as often as per the doctor’s recommendation."
What is the outlook of the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"'Ongoing research offers a more optimistic outlook; it’s now increasingly being viewed as a treatable disease that can allow patients to enjoy a normal life expectancy and good quality of life. However, people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at higher risk of sudden death, especially at a young age. If you have a first-degree relative, a parent, sibling, or child, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, genetic testing\xa0or regular ECGs may be required. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy occurs in men and women with equal distribution across all races.\xa0Females tend to be more symptomatic causing more disability and present at a younger age some people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may not have symptoms and may have a normal lifespan. Others may get worse slowly or quickly. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a well-known cause of sudden death in athletes. Almost half of the deaths due to this condition happen during or just after some type of physical activity. The condition is progressive and eventually, all patients will develop symptoms.' "
What is hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in front of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, body temperature, ''heart'' rate, and the ''digestive system''. A decrease in the levels of the thyroid hormone causes several body functions to slow down. Hypothyroidism affects women more than men. It can begin at any age but commonly affects middle-aged women. It may be diagnosed during a routine blood work or after symptoms begin. Sometimes, hypothyroidism starts after pregnancy.''There are several safe and effective treatment options for hypothyroidism. The treatment mainly involves supplementation with synthetic thyroid hormones to increase the hormone levels to normal.' "
Who can get hypothyroidism?,"'Anyone can develop hypothyroidism, but the risk is high in those:' That are female. Aged above 60 years. With a positive family history of thyroid disease. Having other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease. With a treatment history of radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medications. With a history of radiation therapy to the head, neck, or upper chest. With a previous thyroid surgery (partial thyroidectomy). Who are pregnant or recently delivered a baby."
What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism signs and symptoms in adults may include the following:''Signs and symptoms in ''babies'' include the following:''Signs and symptoms in children and young adults include the following:''In general, children and ''teens'' who develop hypothyroidism have the same signs and symptoms as adults do, but in addition, they may also present with' Tiredness and weakness  Increased sensitivity to cold Constipation Dry and itchy skin Weight gain Change in voice Muscle pain and stiffness Pain, stiffness, or swelling of the joints Heavy menstrual flow or irregular menstrual periods Thinning of the hair Thinning of the eyebrows Decreased heart rate Depression Poor memory Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) Yellow skin and eyes (prolonged jaundice of birth) A large, protruding tongue Difficulty breathing and feeding Hoarse cry Pot belly Poor muscle tone Excessive sleepiness Delayed milestones Physical and mental retardation in untreated infants Poor physical and mental development. A short height. Delayed development of permanent teeth. Delayed puberty."
What is Kleine Levin syndrome?,"'Kleine Levin syndrome (KLS) is a\xa0rare neurological disorder\xa0characterized by episodes of the excessive need for ''sleep'' that occur weeks or months apart. It is more common in young boys. During episodes, sufferers often require more than 15 hours of sleep per day, hence it is also called ''sleeping beauty syndrome''. The disorder may occur in younger children as well as adults. At the onset of an episode, the person becomes progressively drowsy and sleeps for most of the day and night, at times waking only to eat or use the bathroom. Each episode lasts days, weeks, or even months during which time all usual daily activities cease. People are unable to care for themselves or attend school or work. In between episodes, people with KLS seem to be in perfect health with no evidence of behavioral or physical dysfunction. Episodes of KLS may continue for ten years or more. Other common signs and symptoms include:' Altered behavior Reduced understanding of the world People experiencing KLS may consume any available food, even foods they may typically not eat, sometimes leading to weight gain after episodes They may be typical to be irritable or confused. They seem to lack emotion or entirely seem to ""not care"" (apathy) Easily become disoriented to the time and location Hallucinations or feelings of losing touch with reality, feeling like they are living a dream Sensitive to light and noise Two-thirds of people experiencing KLS are observed to have communication disturbances, such as being too tired to communicate, having difficulty finding words, or having slurred speech. Around 50% of people with KLS exhibit abnormally increased sex drive and maybe observed engaging in disinhibited or inappropriate behaviors, such as fondling oneself, lack of concern with body exposure, or unwanted sexual advances."
Is Kleine Levin Syndrome a treatable condition?,"'There is no definitive treatment for Kleine Levin syndrome (KLS), the only way is to wait and watch as symptoms may subside slowly. However, a few treatments are used in case symptoms are worsening.' Stimulant pills, including Amphetamines, Methylphenidate, and Modafinil, are used to treat sleepiness but may increase irritability and will not improve cognitive abnormalities. Lithium therapy: In some cases, lithium and/or carbamazepine may be prescribed for managing KLS. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, there are cases where lithium therapy has been effective in preventing further KLS episodes. Antiepileptic medications: Some individuals have experienced an improvement in symptoms while taking phenytoin, a medication used to treat seizures. Due to the similarities between KLS and other mood-related disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers are sometimes prescribed with varying results and levels of effectiveness."
What is the outlook of patients with Kleine Levin Syndrome?,"'The condition spontaneously resolves. There is usually a decrease in episodes’ intensity and frequency over a period of 8 to 12 years. The patient is considered to be cured if no symptoms are observed for the previous 6 years. Usually, young or old patients and those who experience hypersexuality tend to have a more severe course. Patients who initially have frequent attacks generally see the disease cease earlier than others.' "
What is lichen sclerosus?,"'Lichen sclerosus'' or LS is a long-term (chronic) skin condition. It can affect the skin on any part of the body; however, it often affects the genital or anal areas. LS makes the skin thin, whitened, and wrinkled. It can cause a ''rash'', ''itching'', scarring, and ''pain''.''LS can affect people of any age or gender; however, it is most common in postmenopausal women. The most common sites in women are near the clitoris, on the labia (the inner and outer genital lips), and in the anal region. LS can cause a condition called ''lichen simplex chronicus'' in women. In this condition, the woman’s vulva (the outer part of the vagina) is involved. This happens when the skin in and around the vulva becomes thicker from constant ''itching'' and scratching.''LS most commonly affects the glans penis (the rounded head or tip of the penis) and foreskin. In around 15-20% of the affected people, LS lesions occur on other skin surfaces, such as the thighs, breasts, wrists, shoulders, neck, and even inside the mouth.' "
What happens if lichen sclerosus is left untreated?,"'Lichen sclerosus (LS) can usually be managed with treatment. When left untreated, LS can lead to serious effects. Lesions on the genitals can cause severe ''pain'' during sex. The affected person may become emotional or bothered about having a condition in their genital area. Persistent irritation and scratching associated with lichen simplex chronicus can lead to bacterial skin infections. This can lead to permanent ''scars''. LS can increase the risk of skin and vulvar ''cancers''. Thus, you must consult your doctor and get treatment for LS.' "
What is a migraine?,"'A ''migraine'' is a complex disorder that involves episodes of recurrent and severe ''headaches''. A ''migraine headache'' is usually on one side and may be associated with visual or sensory symptoms, collectively called aura. The aura may occur before, during or after a ''headache''.''An episode of a ''migraine'' can be very painful, lasting for hours, making day-to-day activities difficult until the episode is resolved. Women are more likely to suffer from ''migraines'' than men.' "
What does a migraine feel like?,"'Migraines'' are not felt the same way by everyone. The usual symptoms of a migraine are:''The typical features of a ''migraine aura'' are:' A severe, throbbing headache that increases with movement. Pain is usually limited to one side of the head, around the forehead and around the eyes. However, it can be felt anywhere around the head or neck. Pain builds up between one to two hours, progressively increasing and becoming more diffuse. A migraine headache can last for four hours to three days. Nausea occurs in 80% of the cases. Almost half of the people with a migraine complain of vomiting. Loss of appetite. Light-headedness. Sensitivity or discomfort to light and sound. Aura can occur before, during or after the onset of a headache. An aura can also occur independently, with no relation to the headache. An aura usually builds up over five to 20 minutes and lasts less than an hour. Most commonly, visual symptoms occur during the aura. The person may report seeing flashes of light, colorful or bright shapes, shimmering spots, or loss of vision. Hearing various kinds of sound. Difficulty talking. Weakness or numbness of the face or one side of the body."
What is the main cause of migraines?,"'The exact cause of migraines remains a mystery. However, several factors are associated with migraines. Some of the factors are:''Other factors causing migraine events are:' Migraines happen due to changes in the blood supply to the brain accompanied by inflammation, according to the neurovascular theory. Migraines may be due to changes in the level of a chemical in the brain called serotonin. Low levels of serotonin cause the vessels that supply blood to the brain to swell up. This leads to pain and other symptoms of a migraine. Genes also play a role in causing migraines. Around 70% of migraine patients report their parents, grandparents or siblings suffer from migraines. The higher occurrence of migraines in women suggests the role of hormones in causing migraines. Stress Excessive or insufficient sleep Medications (e.g., contraceptives) Smoking Exposure to bright or fluorescent lighting Strong odors (e.g., perfumes, colognes, petroleum distillates) Head injury Weather changes Motion sickness Cold stimulus (e.g., ice cream headaches) Lack of exercise Fasting or skipping meals Red wine Certain foods and food additives (e.g., caffeine, artificial sweeteners, monosodium glutamate (MSG), citrus fruits, aged cheese, meats with nitrites)"
Are migraines dangerous?,"'A migraine is a long-term condition that can interfere with day-to-day activities but is typically not otherwise dangerous to organs. However, some studies have shown that, although rare, migraines can cause ''strokes'' in people, especially in women. Patients are completely symptom-free between attacks. Patients with migraines have even reported being migraine-free for years.''The frequency and severity of migraine attacks tend to decline with age. Around one-third of migraine sufferers stop having migraine attacks after around 15 years.' "
What is a migraine?,"'A ''migraine'' is a chronic ''headache'' characterized by repeated, intense, throbbing ''pain'' either on one side or both sides of the head. Most people with ''migraines'' feel ''pain'' in one eye, ear, or the temples.\xa0''About 25% of people with ''migraines'' experience aura. An aura is a ''migraine''-specific symptom (usually tingling of arms, seeing flashes of light, or zigzag lines) that precede the migraine or accompanies it.''Migraines can occur at any time of the day, although in many cases they start in the morning. The pain may last for a few hours or up to one to two days. The frequency of a migraine attack varies from individual to individual. In some, it may occur once or twice a week, whereas, in others, it may occur once or twice a year. Migraine significantly diminishes a person’s quality of life.\xa0''Migraine is the third most prevalent disease and affects about one billion people worldwide.\xa0' "
What causes migraines?,"'The exact cause of migraines is unknown. Researchers think that migraine occurs because of an increase in the level of neurotransmitters, chemicals that send messages among the brain cells, in the brain.\xa0''This increase in neurotransmitters is believed to create overactive nerve cells, which in turn send signals to the trigeminal nerve that is responsible for the sensation in the head and face. Activation of the trigeminal nerve leads to the release of a set of chemicals that cause the blood vessels to swell and pain.''People with migraines react to a variety of factors and events, known as triggers. A combination of triggers may set off an attack.\xa0''Some common triggers include:' Genetics Hormones Medications Stress Foods and drinks that trigger migraines include:Aged cheeseAlcoholFood additives (nitrates and monosodium glutamate or MSG)Caffeinated beverages Aged cheese Alcohol Food additives (nitrates and monosodium glutamate or MSG) Caffeinated beverages Weather changes Feeling very tired Skipping meals Changes in sleeping pattern"
What causes migraines in women?,"'Migraine is most commonly seen in women. Every three out of four women are affected by migraines.\xa0''Some of the most common triggers affecting women are:' Changes in hormonal levels or birth control pills Lack of sleep or too much sleep Skipped meals Bright lights, loud noises, or strong odors Anxiety Red wine Sleeping pills"
What are the types of migraines?,"'The two forms of migraine are migraine with aura and migraine without aura.\xa0''Migraine with aura: The person might observe the aura symptoms below 10 to 30 minutes before an attack or even accompanying the ''headache''.''Migraine without aura: The person does not have an aura but has all typical symptoms of an attack.''The symptoms of a migraine attack are:' Seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spots Numbness or tingling in the face or hands Altered sense of smell, taste, or touch Feeling mentally “fuzzy” Throbbing headache, which gets worse after physical activity Sensitivity to light, noise, and smell Nausea and vomiting Loss of appetite Feeling warm or cold Fatigue Dizziness Pale skin Blurred vision Diarrhea Confusion Impairment in language"
How are migraine headaches treated?,"'There is no cure for migraine ''headaches''. Medications along with some alternative therapies can treat or even prevent a migraine attack.''Medications commonly used in the treatment of migraines are:''Alternative therapies useful in treating migraine attack are''Some lifestyle changes that can help prevent the attack include:' Triptans are the main group of medications used to manage migraines Imitrex (sumatriptan) as a shot or nasal spray. Good if you often get a stomach ache or throw up when you have migraines.  Frova (frovatriptan) and Amerge (naratriptan) stay in your body for a long time, which would be helpful if your migraine tends to last a while. Pain relief medicines: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as paracetamol and naproxen have shown to be particularly effective. Nausea medicines: Medications such as domperidone and ondansetron. Some antidepressants, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers can help prevent the attack. Biofeedback: This technique involves recognizing the stressful situations that could trigger an attack. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): This technique involves sending a pulse of magnetic energy to the specific regions of the brain to stop or reduce pain. Staying hydrated Maintaining a healthy diet Exercising regularly but avoid exertion Keeping a track of all the triggers Taking preventive medicines to avoid migraine headaches around the time of periods Eating at regular intervals Reducing stress Avoiding foods that cause attacks Rubbing or applying the pressure to the spot where you feel pain Placing a cold cloth on the head during a headache"
What is myoclonic epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy'' is a neurological disorder that causes recurrent ''seizures''. Myoclonic ''epilepsy'' is a type of ''epilepsy'' characterized by brief ''seizures'' with rapid, uncontrolled muscle jerks. Myoclonic seizures do not cause ''loss of consciousness'' and usually last just a second or two, but a cluster of seizures can occur in a short period.''Epileptic syndromes that cause myoclonic seizures usually begin in early childhood, and last throughout life, though milder forms may improve with adulthood. Myoclonic epilepsy can occur in isolation, or as part of a mixed, generalized epilepsy syndrome.' "
What causes myoclonic seizures in babies?,"'Myoclonic seizures are the result of a sudden burst of abnormal electrical discharge in the brain’s nerve cells (neurons), which leads to involuntary muscle contractions. Infantile myoclonic epilepsy is primarily caused by genetic abnormalities in the brain, though the cause is not always identifiable. Causes of childhood myoclonic seizures include the following:''Mutations in the SCN1A gene have been identified to be the cause in 80% cases of Dravet syndrome, a rare, drug resistant infantile myoclonic ''seizure'' disorder.''Infantile myoclonic seizures occur in neurological disorders that include:' Brain malformations Inborn metabolism errors Neurogenetic mutations Early infantile epileptic encephalopathies: These are brain disorders which includeEarly myoclonic encephalopathyEarly infantile epileptic encephalopathy.

Myoclonic epilepsy occurring as part of a mixed generalized epilepsy syndrome: This includesDoose syndrome (myoclonic-atonic epilepsy)Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy [SMEI])Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Doose syndrome (myoclonic-atonic epilepsy) Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy [SMEI]) Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Nonprogressive myoclonic epilepsies: This group of disorders includeBenign neonatal myoclonic epilepsyFamilial myoclonic epilepsyAutosomal dominant cortical myoclonus and epilepsy Benign neonatal myoclonic epilepsy Familial myoclonic epilepsy Autosomal dominant cortical myoclonus and epilepsy Progressive myoclonic epilepsies: In these myoclonic epilepsies, seizures occur with certain stimuli or actions, because of underlying neurodegenerative disorders which includeUnverricht-Lundborg diseaseLafora body diseaseMyoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF)Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosesSialidosisDentate-rubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)Alpers syndrome (POLG1 mutations) Unverricht-Lundborg disease Lafora body disease Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses Sialidosis Dentate-rubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) Alpers syndrome (POLG1 mutations)"
What are the symptoms of myoclonic seizures?,"'Myoclonic seizures usually occur on awakening and some may be caused by external stimuli such as flashing lights (photic stimuli). Symptoms of myoclonic seizures include the following:''Seizures are more frequent and get prolonged in severe forms of myoclonic epilepsy, which are also associated with other forms of generalized seizures, as in the case of Dravet syndrome. Symptoms of Dravet syndrome may range from mild to severe and include:''In epilepsies such as Doose syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, children may have drop seizures which cause sudden loss of muscle strength, making them collapse. Cognitive development may also be delayed or impaired.' Involuntary abrupt muscle jerks in one or both arms and legs, which typically occur several times a day. Head nodding Abrupt abduction of arms Twitches in eyelids and facial muscles Irregular movements in the fingers which make patients drop things or appear clumsy. Convulsive seizures that begin before 15 months of ageSeizures are prolonged and involve half of the bodySubsequent seizures may involve the opposite half of the bodyTemperature changes, like exiting a warm bath, can bring on a seizureMyoclonus status epilepticus, a medical emergency condition of continuous seizure, may happen often in children with Dravet, especially before age five Seizures are prolonged and involve half of the body Subsequent seizures may involve the opposite half of the body Temperature changes, like exiting a warm bath, can bring on a seizure Myoclonus status epilepticus, a medical emergency condition of continuous seizure, may happen often in children with Dravet, especially before age five Developmental cognitive and physical delays resulting from seizures Changes in eating and appetite Crouched gait and compromised balance as the child grows older"
How is myoclonic epilepsy diagnosed?,"'Correct diagnosis of the seizure origin is of prime importance, because seizures can also occur due to many conditions other than epilepsy. Ascertaining if different types of ''seizure disorders'' are co-occurring, and identification of the distinct epilepsy syndrome are essential to formulate the appropriate treatment.''Diagnostic tests include:' Physical examination, or videotaping by caregivers when direct observation is not possible due to the unpredictable nature of the illness Electroencephalography (EEG) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) EEG video monitoring Lumbar puncture to identify mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders Genetic testing for SCN1A to establish Dravet syndrome, or other genetic mutations in select cases"
Can myoclonic epilepsy be cured?,"'There is no cure for myoclonic epilepsy but antiepileptic ''drugs'' (AEDs) can prevent the occurrence of seizures. Many patients with benign forms of myoclonic epilepsy respond well to treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Severe forms of myoclonic epilepsies are refractory and more difficult to treat, and may require a combination of management therapies.' "
What is the treatment for myoclonic epilepsy?,"'The mainstays of myoclonic epilepsy are antiepileptic and anticonvulsant medications. Antiepileptic drugs prevent seizures by inhibiting neurotransmission of chemical signals between neurons, and the resultant electrical discharge.''Lifestyle and dietary modifications may also help in managing the condition. Epilepsy surgeries may be an option in a few select cases.''Antiepileptic drugs may be administered alone (monotherapy) or combination therapy. FDA-approved antiepileptic drugs include:''Other antiepileptic medications that are used in controlling seizures but may worsen seizures in some cases include:''Other medications that have been tried but have not shown conclusive benefits include:''Dietary and lifestyle modifications may be of benefit, particularly in children with refractory epilepsy:' Valproic acid (Depakote, Depakene, Depacon, Stavzor): An anticonvulsant used as first-line treatment.

Clobazam (Onfi): A benzodiazepine class of drug for adjunctive treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome associated seizures in children two years of older. Stiripentol (Diacomit): An anticonvulsant medication used with clobazam for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in children aged two years or older. Clonazepam (Klonopin): A benzodiazepine useful in immediate control of seizures but may lose efficacy rapidly. Ethosuximide (Zarontin): An anticonvulsant used as an adjunct if valproic acid is not effective as a monotherapy. Cannabidiol (Epidiolex): A purified form of cannabidiol derived from the cannabis plant, approved for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), or tuberous sclerosis complex in children aged one year or older.Doctors don’t know how it works, but cannabidiol consistently showed a 35% to 40% drop in the number of seizures for the Epidiolex groups in several international, controlled clinical trials.

Pediatrician and maybe a nutritionist should be consulted before starting a child on this diet. Particular attention must be paid to prevent dehydration with this diet. Protection from injury: Taking routine seizure precautions prevents injuries during seizures. A helmet may be protective in children with drop seizures, as they may fall and injure themselves. Long-term monitoring: Regular consultations with a pediatric neurologist, along with EEGs to evaluate the patient’s response to treatment is important for effective long-term epilepsy management."
What is the prognosis for myoclonic epilepsy?,"'Children with mild forms of myoclonic epilepsy often respond well to treatment and may even outgrow their epilepsy in adulthood. Prognosis is grave for children with severe forms of epilepsies such as Dravet syndrome.''Dravet syndrome can lead to cognitive disability that ranges from mild to profound. Muscle ''spasticity'' appears to worsen during adolescence leading to a crouch gait. Most patients with Dravet are reliant on caretakers throughout their lives, though the severity of symptoms may vary. Up to 20% of infants with Dravet do not survive to adulthood.' "
What are the symptoms of nausea?,"'Nausea may occur alone or may be accompanied by certain symptoms. Nausea accompanied by symptoms may indicate an underlying medical condition:' Nausea with abdominal pain indicates diseases that involve structural alterations (e.g. cholelithiasis). Abdominal tenderness with nausea suggests bowel obstruction. Vomiting of blood-like material may indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Heartburn with nausea signals gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Early morning nausea or vomiting is typical of the early stages of pregnancy. Headache with nausea indicates migraine. Vomitus with sediments indicates an intestinal blockage. Nausea with rapid involuntary eye movements signals vestibular neuritis. Nausea with tooth enamel erosion, fine hair, and hardening of the skin in the upper portion of palms signals bulimia."

What is polycystic ovary syndrome?,"'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a medical condition that causes imbalances in the reproductive hormones in women.\xa0''Ovaries are almond-shaped organs that are part of the reproductive system in women. They make an egg that is released every month during the ''menstrual cycle''. Hormonal imbalance in PCOS affects the ovaries. Thus, in PCOS, the egg may not develop or may not be released normally.' "
What are the symptoms of PCOS?,"'Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often develop the following symptoms:' Irregular periods or absence of periods Hirsutism (excess hair on face and body) Acne Thinning of scalp hair Difficulty in conceiving or inability to conceive Weight gain or difficulty in losing weight Darkening of the skin, especially along the neck creases, in the groin, and under the breasts Skin tags (small excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area)"
Can PCOS be cured?,"'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) cannot be cured. It is a lifelong condition that extends even beyond the reproductive years. A combination of lifestyle modifications and medicines may help to manage the hormonal imbalance and symptoms in women with PCOS. If you have PCOS, you must consult your doctor to manage the disease through a healthy diet, physical activity, ''weight loss'' (if you are overweight), and medications.' "
What is periodic limb muscle disorder?,"'Periodic limb movement disorder'' or PLMD is a medical condition in which a person’s limbs, legs, and sometimes arms move repetitively and uncontrollably during sleep. Most of the people who suffer from this condition are unaware of these abnormal movements occurring during sleep. The movements often occur as jerking or flexing movements of the legs. The episodes of PLMD may last for several minutes to a few hours during which the uncontrollable movements keep occurring at intervals of 20-40 seconds. The movements disturb a person’s sleep and may lead to a lack of sleep or daytime sleepiness and ''fatigue''. Recent studies have revealed that PLMD may be linked to subtle ''breathing'' problems. People with PLMD may also have health conditions such as ''anemia'' (low ''hemoglobin'' or RBCs in the blood), ''diabetes'', kidney diseases, and other ''sleep disorders'' such as ''narcolepsy''.' "

What is peripheral neuropathy?,"'The nervous system has two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The brain and spinal cord are part of the CNS. The nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body are called the PNS. Any damage to these nerves, due to disease, injury, ''drugs'', or toxins, is called ''peripheral neuropathy''. Peripheral neuropathy can affect many nerves (polyneuropathy), a single nerve (mononeuropathy), or a nerve group.\xa0' "
What are the early signs of peripheral neuropathy? ,"'The ''symptoms of peripheral neuropathy'' depend upon the type of nerve affected—nerves of muscle function (motor nerves), nerves of sensation (sensory nerves), or nerves of the involuntary nervous system (autonomic nerves, such as those innervating the ''heart'' and bowels).''Usually, neuropathies affect all three types of nerve fibers in varying degrees.\xa0''The 24 symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy include:' Motor nerves regulate the movement of all muscles under your conscious control (muscles used for walking, holding objects, or speaking). Sensory nerves help you feel your environment (feeling of a light touch, heat, cold, or pain).  Autonomic nerves control activities that you do not have conscious control of such as heartbeat, breathing, digesting food, and sweating. Inability to feel touch and vibration sensations through your hands and feet. You feel like you are wearing some invisible “gloves” or “stockings.” Severe stabbing or shooting pain Tingling “pins and needles” sensation or electric shock-like pain Inability to feel pain  Inability to tell whether an object is hot or cold Trouble grasping or picking up objects Frequent tripping or stumbling while walking Balance problems Increased sensitivity to cold or heat Burning sensation  Extraordinary pain in response to touch or pressure Loss of muscle fat Muscle weakness Trouble swallowing Trouble passing urine Constipation or diarrhea Loss of bowel and bladder control Dizziness or fainting Excessive or no sweating Palpitations or a sense of the racing, pounding heartbeat Sexual disturbances Breathing problems Vision problems Weakness"

Immune suppressing or modulating treatment  Complementary treatment: acupuncture, lipoic acid, meditation/yoga, biofeedback, and herbal therapy."
What is ringworm?,"'Ringworm is a fungal infection affecting the skin. It may occur anywhere, but the skin folds and sweaty areas are more commonly affected. It is characterized by a red, circular ''rash'' with central clearing and ''itching'' that can be intense. The condition is called ringworm because of the ring-like appearance of the ''rash''. The infection is usually limited to the skin. Rarely, the deeper layers of the skin may be affected causing complications. Most cases of ringworm resolve with appropriate treatment in about two weeks. Treatment in individuals with a compromised immune system due to conditions such as ''human immunodeficiency virus''/''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''HIV/AIDS'') and ''diabetes'' may be difficult.' "
Risk factors for ringworm infection,"'The following factors can increase the risk of ringworm infection:' Hot and humid climate Contact with an infected person, animals, objects, soil, or other surfaces Use of public gyms and public showers and playing contact sports  Sharing clothing, towels, or bedding with an infected person Wearing tight or nonbreathable clothing Wearing wet, damp, or sweat-drenched clothes for a long time  Having a weak immune system"
What are the signs and symptoms of ringworm?,"'Signs and symptoms of ringworm may include:' A scaly ring-shaped, red rash with red raised bumps and central clearing usually occurring over the buttocks, trunk, legs, and arms Rash may increase in size and can be multiple in number  Itching over the rash Rash may also appear as a round, flat patch of itchy skin"
How is ringworm treated?,"'Ringworm infections usually heal in about two weeks with conservative treatments. Treatment options include:' Over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal creams, ointment, or lotions such as clotrimazole and antifungal powders can be applied to the affected area three times a day. Prescription-strength antifungal lotions, creams, or ointments may be advised by the doctor if OTC products don’t help. Antifungal creams and ointments containing anti-inflammatory medication such as steroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammations and itching. Antifungal pills may be prescribed for severe cases, resistant to other forms of treatment. Antihistamine pills may be advised to help reduce itching. Maintaining hygiene by keeping the affected area clean is important. The affected area can be cleaned using a simple over the counter antiseptic soap and water. The area should be dried because moisture can worsen the condition by promoting fungal growth. Cleansing with soap and water should be done before applying other treatments."
How to prevent ringworm?,"'Preventing ringworm is difficult because it is highly contagious and spreads through direct contact unknowingly. The following steps can help reduce the risk of ringworm infections:' Maintain overall hygiene by regular washing of hands with an antiseptic handwash or using a sanitizer and showering after playing sports, using the pool, or gym Stay cool and dry and avoiding excessive sweating Wear light breathable clothing Avoid wearing wet, damp, or sweaty clothes and shoes for a long period of time Wear washed and well-dried clothes and socks every time Wear flip flops or any footwear in public showers and public spaces such as the beach Maintain hygiene of pets by appropriate grooming methods Avoid touching animals that may be infected Avoid sharing of personal items such as clothing, towels, hairbrushes, sports gear, utensils, or other personal items"
How is shoulder dystocia treated?,"'After doctors diagnose shoulder dystocia, they usually perform any of the techniques given below to allow for successful vaginal delivery:' Episiotomy: A cut is made from the vagina extending towards the anus to increase the vaginal opening for an easier delivery. McRoberts maneuver: The mother is asked to bend the knee and pull the thighs over the stomach. Suprapubic pressure: Doctors manipulate your lower abdomen externally at the pubes and apply pressure over the shoulder of the baby in a downward direction to rotate the baby’s shoulder. Internal rotation: The doctors may first perform an episiotomy to gain entry into the vagina. They will then insert their two fingers of one hand into the vagina and rotate the baby’s shoulder internally. At the same time, the doctors may apply pressure over the abdomen with their other hand. Remove the other arm from the birth canal: The doctor removes one hand from the vaginal canal to facilitate the delivery. Roll the patient: You will be asked to roll to all fours-position (resembling the standing of an animal). This will allow the gravitational force to pull the baby in a way that helps free the baby’s stuck shoulders."
What are the complications of shoulder dystocia?,"'The mother and her baby may suffer from the complications of shoulder dystocia and the procedures to relieve it.''The possible risks in the baby include:''Possible risks in the mother are:''Most of these complications, if they happen, are short-term, and doctors can minimize or treat them successfully.' Injury to the nerves (brachial plexus) that sends signals from your spinal cord to your shoulder, arm, and hand Collar-bone fracture Fracture of the long bone (humerus) in the arm Lack of oxygen (hypoxia) and brain damage to the baby Postpartum hemorrhage (excessive bleeding from the vagina, uterus, or cervix after delivery) Vaginal tears Injury to the bladder and rectum"
Can shoulder dystocia be prevented?,"'In most instances, shoulder dystocia cannot be prevented because it is an unexpected complication of vaginal delivery. If you have ''diabetes'' or have developed ''diabetes'' during pregnancy, your doctor will recommend a planned cesarean delivery. This will reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia that happens only during vaginal delivery.' "
Who is considered an alcoholic?,"'The term ''alcohol'' use disorder (AUD) refers to a condition in which a person has a strong and compulsive desire to consume alcohol despite the presence of negative consequences or impact on their life. The term alcoholic was previously used for a person with such a condition, but because it carries a negative or discriminatory message, the terms alcoholic and ''alcoholism'' are not used anymore.\xa0''According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a person can be diagnosed as suffering from AUD if they meet any two of the following criteria within the same 12-month period:' Spending a lot of time obtaining, using, and recovering from the effects of alcohol. Cravings or a strong desire to use alcohol. Being unable to cut down on alcohol use despite a desire to do so. Continuing to abuse alcohol despite negative interpersonal or social problems that are likely due to alcohol use. Using alcohol in physically dangerous situations (such as driving or operating machinery). Drinking more or for a longer time than originally intended. Continuing to abuse alcohol despite the presence of a psychological or physical problem that is probably due to alcohol use. Being unable to fulfill major obligations at home, work, or school due to alcohol use. Giving up previously enjoyed social, occupational, or recreational activities due to alcohol use. Having a tolerance (i.e., needing to drink increasingly large or more frequent amounts of alcohol to achieve the desired effect). Developing symptoms of withdrawal when efforts are made to stop using alcohol."
What causes someone to be an alcoholic?,"'The exact reason for someone to get an alcohol use disorder (AUD) is not completely understood. Researchers suggest that chronic alcohol consumption affects the brain of a person to the extent that they become physically, emotionally, and mentally dependent upon alcohol. There are several factors that put people at risk, including:' Psychological disorders like depression and anxiety Low self-esteem   Lack of belonging or feeling out of place Childhood history of mental, physical, or sexual abuse Having the first alcoholic drink at an early age (between 11 and 14 years).  Family history of AUD Peer pressure Personal losses or failures Proximity to alcohol retail stores or bars: Researchers suggest that people who live closer to alcohol establishments tend to have a more positive view of drinking and are more likely to participate in the activity."
How many alcoholic drinks a day are considered safe?,"'The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020 suggests that drinking up to one standard drink per day for women and up to two standard ''drinks'' per day for men can be considered as a safe or moderate level of drinking.\xa0In the US, a standard drink contains approximately 14 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol, which is typically found in the following:' Five ounces of wine (12 percent alcohol content). Eight ounces of malt liquor (7 percent alcohol content). Twelve ounces of beer (5 percent alcohol content). One and a half ounces or a “shot” of 80-proof (40 percent alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., vodka, whiskey, gin, rum)."
What causes Tourette syndrome?,"'The exact cause of ''Tourette syndrome'"" isn't known. It is likely to be caused by an interplay between genetic and environmental factors such as certain infections.""'Recent research on ''Tourette syndrome'' has found problems in certain brain regions and neurotransmitters (''dopamine'', serotonin and norepinephrine) that transmit messages between the nerve cells. These abnormalities may be responsible for the symptoms in Tourette syndrome.''Certain factors that put you at a risk of Tourette syndrome include' Having a family history of Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders Male sex (men are about three to four times more likely than women to develop Tourette syndrome)"
What is Tourette syndrome?,"'Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by brief, repetitive, intermittent, involuntary actions known as ''tics''. Tics that involve movement are referred to as motor tics and those that involve sounds are referred to as vocal tics. Motor tics usually show up before vocal tics do.''It is estimated that one out of every 160 children between the ages of 5 to17 years old in the United States is affected by Tourette syndrome. The average onset of symptoms is between the ages of three and nine years.' "
How is Tourette syndrome diagnosed?,"'For doctors to diagnose Tourette syndrome, you should have both motor and vocal tics for at least one year. There is typically no need for any investigations to arrive at the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. In rare cases, the doctor may order for imaging studies, such as ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') or ''computerized tomography'' (CT) and ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG'') studies that may help them rule out other conditions when symptoms are confusing.' "
Can you get rid of Tourette syndrome?,"'The disorder does not get worse over time and the condition improves in the late ''teens'' and early 20s in many patients. Symptoms may disappear in some people.\xa0 Others may not need medications to suppress tics. The majority of people with Tourette syndrome require no treatment for tic suppression unless the symptoms interfere with functioning.''Tourette syndrome is generally lifelong and chronic and has no cure. You cannot get rid of it. However, you can get rid of its symptoms and various treatment options can help you to effectively deal with them.' Neuroleptics: These drugs are used to treat psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. The most effective ones in Tourette syndrome are haloperidol and pimozide. Alpha-adrenergic agonists: These drugs used primarily to treat hypertension, for example clonidine and guanfacine, are useful to suppress tics. Stimulant medications: For attention-deficit hypersensitivity disorder (ADHD) that occurs in patients with Tourette syndrome, stimulant medications such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are helpful. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline have helped in dealing with the obsessive compulsive disorder that accompanies Tourette syndrome. Behavioral treatments: Among these, awareness training and competing response training have been used as supportive therapy to reduce tics."
What is vault prolapse?,"'The pelvis is the area between the hip bones and it harbors the pelvic organs, which include the uterus, cervix and vagina (parts of the reproductive system); ''intestines'' and the rectum (parts of the ''digestive system''); and the urinary bladder and urethra (parts of the genitourinary system). Any of these organs can sag or slip downwards (prolapse) when their supporting muscles and surrounding fibers become weak, torn or stretched. The vault prolapse can occur in women who underwent surgery for the removal of the uterus (''hysterectomy''). The vaginal vault in the inner expanded part of the vagina forms the roof of the vaginal canal. During vault prolapse, the vaginal vault drops down into the vaginal canal. A vault prolapse may be accompanied by the bulging of the small bowel against the vaginal wall (enterocele). Other types of prolapse that can occur through the vagina are' Uterine prolapse: This refers to the prolapse of the uterus and cervix (neck of the uterus) down into the vagina. In severe cases, the prolapsed parts may come out through the vaginal opening. Cystocele: In this condition, the bladder bulges into the vagina. Rectocele: In this condition, the rectum (the last part of the large bowel) bulges into the vagina."
What causes a vault prolapse?,"'Over one-third of the women in the United States have experienced some form of pelvic prolapse in their lives. Vault prolapse can occur whenever the supporting structures in the pelvis become weak, torn or stretched. The causes include' Vaginal birth, especially multiple childbirths Delivery of a large baby (weighing more than 9 pounds) Surgery like hysterectomy (uterus removal) Radiation therapy in the pelvic area Menopause Lifting heavyweights Aging Extreme physical activity Being overweight Long-term constipation or straining during bowel movements Long-term cough Genetic reasons (having a family history of pelvic organ prolapse)"
What are the symptoms of vault prolapse?,"'The symptoms of vault prolapse may vary, depending on the severity of the prolapse and the presence of another pelvic prolapse like an enterocele. In early or mild cases, there may not be any noticeable symptoms.''The symptoms may include' A feeling of fullness or heaviness in the vaginal area Presence of pain or discomfort in the pelvic area, which becomes worse while standing, coughing, straining or lifting weights Lower back pain Feeling a mass bulging inside or outside of the vaginal canal, which may cause discomfort during walking Bleeding through the vagina Inability to control urine (incontinence) Urinary tract infection (UTI) Difficulty in having bowel movements Discomfort during sexual intercourse Problems inserting a tampon"
How is vault prolapse treated?,"'The treatment for vault prolapse depends on many factors, such as''In early or mild cases, the doctor may advise watchful waiting or observation. They may prescribe nonsurgical treatments, such as''In severe cases of vault prolapse, surgery may be done. Surgery options include' Severity of prolapse Symptoms The patient’s age The general health of the patient Presence of any other health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease Kegel exercise (exercises for strengthening pelvic muscles): To do  these exercises, the woman needs to tighten her pelvic muscles as if she is trying to hold back urine. This position has to be held for a few seconds. The entire process of tightening and releasing the muscles must be repeated about 10 times. This can be done up to four times a day. Vaginal pessary: This is a small doughnut-shaped device made of plastic or rubber. It is inserted inside the vagina. A vaginal pessary provides support to the pelvic structures. Vaginal vault suspension: In this procedure, the vagina is attached (fixed) to the ligaments inside the pelvis that used to hold it up. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy: This is a minimally-invasive surgery that is done through small incisions in the abdomen. It involves strengthening the pelvic floor. During surgery, a surgical mesh is attached from the vagina to the tailbone (sacrum)."
What is vertigo?,"'Vertigo is a symptom that is characterized by a false sensation of spinning of the head or of surrounding objects when they are not. Patients feel giddy or dizzy and lose balance. This may be associated with\xa0''nausea'',\xa0''vomiting'', ''sweating'', or difficulties in ''walking''.' "
What do you do when you have vertigo?,"'The following is advised when there is a sudden episode of vertigo:' Sitting or lying down immediately and resting in a cool place till the vertigo disappears. This prevents the risk of losing balance and serious injury. One may use a cane, walker, or handrail for support. Those with frequent episodes of giddiness may fix handrails at home, and the elderly can keep a walking stick or walker handy. Avoiding sudden movements of the head and neck and sudden changes in positions Avoiding driving or doing any dangerous activities such as operating heavy machinery till the vertigo completely resolves Avoiding consuming caffeine, alcohol, or smoking because they can worsen giddiness Drinking fluids and remaining hydrated, which can help improve giddiness Removing tripping hazards such as rugs on the floor, low tables, etc. from the house to lower the risk of fall in those who have frequent episodes of vertigo Taking over-the-counter antivertigo medications such as Antivert (meclizine) or antihistamines; painkillers may be taken if there is associated headache."
How is vertigo treated?,"'Treatment for vertigo depends on the cause. In some cases, vertigo may resolve without any treatment and never recur due to the ability of the brain to adapt. In other cases, treatment options include:' Vestibular rehabilitation: This is a type of physical therapy, wherein the patient is taught certain exercises to help strengthen their inner ear system. Canalith repositioning maneuvers: These are specific maneuvers performed by a healthcare professional, where movements are done to dislodge calcium deposits out of the inner ear canal. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to suppress the inner ear or improve blood flow in the inner ear. Medications to relieve associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, or motion sickness may be administered. Antibiotics would be prescribed in cases of infection or inflammation. Steroids may be needed to suppress inflammations and reduce swelling. In Meniere's disease, diuretics (pills that reduce fluid in the ear) may be prescribed to reduce pressure due to fluid accumulation. Surgery: In severe cases, when the vertigo does not resolve with medication and other conservative measures, surgery may be required."
How to prevent vertigo?,"'There are various ways to prevent vertigo such as:' Doing activities that improve balance, such as vestibular rehabilitation exercises, yoga, or Tai chi Staying hydrated by drinking at least eight glasses of water a day Sleeping for at least seven hours and avoiding stressful situations Eating a healthy diet that consists of vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins  Reducing salt content in food Taking medications as prescribed"
What are the seven most common causes of vomiting?,"'Vomiting'' is a reflex directed by the brain toward the ''intestines'' to reverse their peristaltic movements to force the contents of the stomach out through the mouth. It is usually a symptom of an underlying disease. Excessive ''vomiting'' may dehydrate a person and make them weak, which can turn out to be life-threatening for an individual. There are many causes of vomiting. The most common reasons include the following''Below are few more common causes of vomiting' Gastroenteritis/stomach flu: This is one of the most common causes of vomiting. It is a condition in which viruses, bacteria and parasites cause inflammation in the lining of the stomach. It usually spreads by coming into contact with an infected person or with contaminated food or water. Food poisoning: In food poisoning, the body tries to eliminate a toxic substance by vomiting. Food poisoning occurs by consuming unhygienic food  or eating dairy products that have been left out of the refrigerator for too long. It also spreads via cooking and eating utensils that haven’t been properly cleaned.  Pregnancy/morning sickness: Vomiting is the most common symptom in pregnant women. Morning sickness usually begins during the first month of pregnancy and ends between weeks 14 and 16, but some women experience it for the entire gestation period. This type of vomiting may be caused by rapid hormonal changes taking place in the body, such as increasing estrogen levels. Motion sickness: Motion sickness is common and may occur when traveling by car, train, airplane and boat. This problem can happen to anyone but tends to happen more frequently to children and pregnant women. This happens when the brain receives conflicting signals from the eyes, inner ear and sensory receptors, causing irritable symptoms leading to vomiting. Indigestion: Indigestion is one of the most common causes of vomiting seen in all age groups. It is a feeling of burning or discomfort in the upper abdomen caused by overeating or eating high-fat foods or spicy foods rather quickly. Individuals may also complain of heartburn.  Medications: Vomiting is usually a common side effect of many different types of medications, which include antibiotics, over-the-counter medications, antidepressants and sometimes even cancer drugs. Stress and anxiety: A few people develop vomiting as a symptom of excess stress or anxiety. The body produces a higher amount of stress chemicals such as adrenaline and cortisol as part of the fight-or-flight response. This triggered response may interfere with the gastrointestinal tract to cause nausea and vomiting. Infection: Vomiting is known to be the most common symptom of any type of infection in the body. It is the body’s response to flush out waste during an infection.  Migraine: Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms of migraines. Migraines are severe headaches caused by abnormal brain activity that can be triggered by numerous factors, including loud noises, bright lights, perfumes, cigarette smoke, dairy foods and foods that contain MSG. Alcohol poisoning: Recurrent vomiting is a known symptom when a person consumes a lethal dose of alcohol. It may sometimes lead to a fatal condition if not treated appropriately. Gastrointestinal diseases: Diseases such as pancreatitis, gallbladder disease and irritable bowel syndrome may cause severe vomiting that can dehydrate an individual. "
What are the common ways to treat vomiting?,"'Treatment for vomiting varies depending on the underlying cause' Patients may need to drink fluids with electrolytes to stay hydrated. In severe cases, patients may be admitted to a hospital for intravenous fluids. In case of food poisoning, patients may be advised to eat bland crackers, dry toast or white rice to soothe the stomach. Over-the-counter medications such as Pepto-Bismol or Imodium can also help with vomiting due to food poisoning and a stomach bug. Treatment for vomiting caused by motion sickness includes medicines classified as H1 blockers such as Dramamine. Sometimes, carbonated beverages and fresh air might also provide relief. Apart from these measures, patients need sufficient rest and may sometimes be required to not to eat for hours. Such patients may be placed on clear fluids or intravenous fluids.  If the infection causes vomiting, it may go away within three to seven days and patients may be given antibiotics and electrolyte fluids.  In case of indigestion, patients may take antacids and make a few lifestyle changes to reduce vomiting episodes. Practicing deep breathing exercises and calming techniques may help relieve symptoms of stress. Eating a healthy diet containing foods prepared with safe food handling techniques and  exercising regularly  may help relieve the underlying causes of vomiting."
What are the signs and symptoms of shingles?,"'Shingles'' typically occurs over one side of the face or body. The common signs and symptoms may include' Pain (usually the first symptom in shingles and can vary in intensity) Burning sensation, numbness, tingling or itching Raised red rash, which usually appears a few days after the pain Multiple blisters which appear in a stripe or a cluster patternThe blisters contain fluid and they break open with crusting The blisters contain fluid and they break open with crusting Fever, chills, fatigue and body ache Headache Photophobia (sensitivity to light; especially if rash is around the forehead) Fatigue"
How does shingles rash appear?,"'The typical red shingles rash and blisters follow pain, ''itching'' and tingling. The rash is usually limited to one side of the face and body.\xa0' Rash and shingles blisters appear on one side of the face, extending to the scalp and ear. If the rash involves the ear, it can lead to hearing loss, imbalance and weakness of the facial muscles. Shingles rash on the scalp causes pain while combing and bald patches.  Shingles can occur in the mouth, which is usually very painful, causing pain while eating and change in taste. Rash and blisters appear around the eye, over the eyelids, once side of the forehead, extending to the tip of the nose.  Patients complain of burning or throbbing in the eye, with watering of eyes, swelling and blurred vision. The pain may be present after the rash disappears due to nerve damage, but improves eventually. Without treatment, shingles of the eye and forehead can lead to corneal damage and vision loss. Rashes and blistering appear over one side of the waist and the back in a stripe pattern, extending up to the lower back.  Shingles rash and blisters over the buttocks, usually on one side. "
How is shingles treated?,"'Treatment is most effective when begun within 72 hours of the appearance of rash. Antiviral drugs (''Acyclovir'', ''Valacyclovir'' etc) can help you recover faster and reduce the risk of complications.\xa0''Shingles rash and blisters can cause severe pain that ''over-the-counter'' pain medication cannot control.\xa0''Treatment of pain includes:''Prevention'': ''Vaccines'' are available against ''varicella'' zoster virus to prevent chickenpox and shingles.'

Cayenne pepper effects,"'Cayenne has been in use for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been used both as a culinary spice and a food preservative and has added health benefits.''Benefits of cayenne pepper:''Side effects:' Capsaicin, derived from the peppers, is believed to be effective on various forms of rhinitis by reducing nasal hypersensitivity response to various allergens. In a study conducted on 42 patients with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, an intranasal solution of capsaicin and eucalyptol (added to reduce the burning sensation that some patients experience with capsaicin) was used two times a day for 15 days, and this was compared with placebo (no drug). There was a statistical improvement in nasal congestion, sinus pain and pressure, and headache. Antioxidant: Cayenne pepper contains large amounts of vitamin A, which helps in maintaining good health, healthy skin, and proper brain function. Vitamin A fights swelling caused by free radicals and is vital for good health. Cayenne pepper also contains vitamin E, which is another super antioxidant that slows the aging process and keeps bodily organs healthy. Vitamin E plays a significant role in balancing hormones, repairing damaged skin, and maintaining healthy cholesterol levels. Allergy prevention: High doses of beta carotene, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory capabilities in cayenne pepper can prevent allergies by breaking up and eliminating mucus caused by congestion. With its high vitamin C content, cayenne pepper also provides protection against the common cold. Weight loss: It is a metabolism booster. This means that regular intake in small amounts helps to burn more calories. It also eases inflammation from allergies and food sensitivities that cause bloating and digestive problems. A study showed that people who ate a breakfast containing capsaicin burned 51% more calories in the hours after breakfast than those who didn’t consume it. Another study showed that people taking capsaicin supplements ate 10% less during the day because they felt fuller for longer and thus ate fewer calories. It is also thought that capsaicin reduces the production of the hunger hormone ghrelin, although this has yet to be confirmed.  Blood pressure: As per researchers, capsaicin in cayenne pepper could reduce hypertension (high blood pressure) by relaxing the blood vessels. Cancer: Some studies have reported that cayenne pepper may help the body cells fight many types of cancer, including prostate, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. This however needs more evidence. Heart attacks: Cayenne may help prevent myocardial infarction (heart attacks) by promoting blood flowing effectively through the circulatory system. It has a mild blood-thinning action, which may be helpful in people with cholesterol problems. However, it is not a replacement for your blood thinners and cholesterol medications. Nerve and joint pain: Cayenne powder applied locally reduces the amount of substance P, a chemical that sends pain signals to the brain. Reduction or removal of this chemical stops pain signals from reaching the brain and relieves pain. Studies show that cayenne pepper can relieve pain from rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain from fibromyalgia, migraines, diabetic neuropathy in the legs and feet, injuries to the lower back, and osteoarthritis. Digestive system: Cayenne pepper aids the digestive system to work efficiently by inhibiting enzyme production. Researchers have proven that capsaicin stimulates alkali and mucous secretions, preventing and curing gastric ulcers. Capsaicin in cayenne pepper also stimulates the salivary glands to produce saliva, which aids digestion and keeps bad breath at bay. Psoriasis: Using cayenne pepper cream as a topical agent may help treat moderate and severe psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that presents itself as inflamed, scaly patches on the skin caused when the skin cells replicate too rapidly. Anti-fungal properties: CAY-1 is a substance found in cayenne pepper. It is known to attack the cell walls of the fungus. This property may help to fight against fungal infections of the skin and mucous membrane (the inner lining of the mouth and gut). Cayenne pepper may interfere with some medicines. It is advisable to consult your doctor before taking cayenne supplements. Cayenne may interfere with blood-thinning medicines such as warfarin, aspirin, naproxen, or ibuprofen. For this reason, doctors usually recommend their patients to stop taking cayenne pepper in any form at least two weeks before and two weeks after the surgery. Theophylline is a bronchodilator that treats asthma and other lung conditions, and capsicum annum found in cayenne pepper can increase the amount of theophylline the body can absorb. If you are taking theophylline, speak to your physician before adding cayenne pepper or foods containing capsicum annum to your diet. Excessive amounts of cayenne pepper can irritate the inner lining of the stomach causing gastritis and even stomach ulcers. Therefore, people with ulcers are advised to limit consumption.  When taken as a supplement while pregnant, cayenne pepper can lead to heartburn or vomiting. Existing acid reflux can worsen as well. Breastfeeding mothers are also advised against taking cayenne pepper supplements because these can have an effect on the infant."
What are the types of primary headaches? ,"'Primary ''headaches'' are the ones that happen in the absence of other medical conditions. The headache itself is the main problem, and it often comes in the form of attacks or episodes.''There are three most common types of primary ''headaches''. They are''1. ''Tension headache''2. ''Migraine headache''3. ''Cluster headache' This is also called muscle contraction or stress headaches. This is the most common headache that makes up 90% of all headaches. It can affect up to 78% of Americans at some point in their life. You feel tight pressure all over your head, sometimes in your neck and shoulder, and soreness in your temples. These headaches are usually due to stress, anxiety, excessive worry, or tiredness. This affects nearly 15% of American adults. This typically lasts between 4 and 72 hours. It is uncommon to have more than one attack of migraine in a day. Migraine pain can vary in location; it can develop on just one side of the head, behind the eye, in the back or front of the head, or felt throughout the head. The headache is often more severe on one side of the head. The episodes of migraines are usually triggered by hormonal fluctuations, physical activities, noise, or sudden exposure to bright light. Nausea, vomiting, visual, and auditory disturbances may accompany a migraine headache. Things like lying down and switching off the lights or going in a darker room usually relieve a migraine headache. You are more likely to get a migraine if you have close relatives suffering from it. The least common type of headaches, affecting less than 1 in 1,000 people. These are sudden, very painful headaches on one side of your head. A cluster headache lasts about 30 to 90 minutes. You can have eight such clusters/attacks in a single day. Cluster headaches involve only one side of the head, which is typically the temple or around the eye. Usually, signs and symptoms, such as eye redness, tearing, or nasal congestion, develop on the side of the face where the headache is located. Triggering factors include lack of sleep or irregular sleep, alcohol (especially red wine), and smoking. Head injury and family history make you more likely to get cluster headaches."

Who is an endocrinologist?,"'An endocrinologist is a specialist doctor who treats imbalances of hormones or the endocrine system of the body. An endocrinologist is trained for almost two to three years in endocrinology after completing four years of medical schooling and three years of post-graduation in internal medicine.''Hormones are secreted by the endocrine glands of the body. Different hormones have different actions. Each hormone acts on a specific body part. They help in the growth and development of the body and regulate various bodily functions. Some hormones help in your growth and development, some help in regulating your ''blood pressure'' and temperature, and others help a woman to conceive or become ''pregnant''.''Hormones play an indirect yet crucial role in your''Endocrinology is a branch of the medical field that deals with diseases related to hormones and the glands that secrete them (endocrine glands).

Pituitary gland: A pea-sized gland located at the base of your brain that controls all the other hormones. Adrenal glands: A pair of glands, one on each side of the abdomen, located on the top of your kidneys. They exert control on your blood pressure, metabolism, stress response, and sex hormones. Parathyroid glands: Four small glands in your neck that control the level of calcium in your blood. Hypothalamus: A small gland located at the base of your brain that controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst. Ovaries: Reproductive glands (gonads) in females that contain eggs. Testes: Reproductive glands (gonads) in males that contain sperms. Pineal gland: A gland found near the center of the brain that may be linked to sleep patterns. Thymus: A gland in the upper part of your chest that helps in the development of the body’s immune system during the early stages of your life."

Who may qualify for a liver transplant?,"'Never will a race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual orientation have any part in deciding if a patient is a transplant candidate. Liver transplant is major surgery; hence, a patient should meet certain criteria that include:''Indications for liver transplantation are as follows:' A patient’s quality of life may be improved with a liver transplant. The patient should not have other diseases that cannot be treated or are not too sick to likely survive the transplant surgery. All other medical or surgical treatment options either have not worked or are not a good choice for the patient. The patient and support systems (family and friends) understand and accept the risks of having a liver transplant. The patient’s support systems are fully committed to and compliant with what is needed before and after the transplant to make the transplant a success. This would include access to funding for the transplant procedure, post-transplant medicines, and other healthcare costs. The social worker and patient financial liaison may be able to help find other ways to pay for their care. The patient has an acute (sudden) onset of liver failure. The patient has had cirrhosis (liver disease) for a long time. The patient has a liver disease that will lead to death or hurt their quality of life. The patient had treatments that did not work (and others are not expected to work).

Hug benefits,"'As per researchers, even hugging for a few seconds may increase feel-good hormones like ''oxytocin''. This is also associated with ''stress'' chemicals like cortisol to drop, which in turn helps lower the ''blood pressure''. A simple hug has a way of making us comfortable and warm. Hugging has been shown to not only affect our ''happiness'' but also affect our health by positively influencing our cognitive and emotional capacities, as well as physical markers, such as blood pressure and ''heart'' rate. Below are a few common benefits:' Good for our heart: As per the research conducted in North Carolina, the heartbeat of the participants who received hugs was lower than those who did not receive any hugs. A decrease in heart rate will help in lowering the risk of heart diseases and high blood pressure. Mindfulness: Hugs make us more mindful and aware of the current situation. Being present in the moment brings us happiness. Hugging is similar to meditation (which also makes us more mindful and aware). Immunity: Hugging may also boost immunity. The emotion, warm physical contact, and the slight pressure on the sternum stimulate the thymus, which is a gland that balances and regulates the white blood cell production in the body. White blood cells keep our body disease-free. Mood: Serotonin is important for our mood and is released when someone embraces us. The increased levels of serotonin elevate our mood and we become happy instantly. Blood pressure: Hugging triggers the release of hormones that help lower your blood pressure. The touch of our loved one on the skin sends signals to the brain and it lowers the blood pressure. Stress: Hugging will help us relax because it reduces the stress hormone called cortisol. A warm hug from a friend or a loved one can give us peace and calmness. Muscles: Hugging also helps in regenerating muscles because it increases the level of oxytocin in our body. Oxytocin also called the cuddle or hug hormone, plays a key role in muscle regeneration. Oxytocin also reduces stress, improves the immune system, and lowers the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and anger. Fear: According to a study, touch and hugs lowered the worry of mortality (death). It makes us feel safe. The study revealed that hugging alleviates the existential fear of a person. Self-esteem: The physical contact during a hug not only makes us feel safe and loved but also boosts our self-esteem. All the hugs we received from our parents, lover, and friends make us more self-confident and happier. Improves relationships: Whether it’s due to the oxytocin or the body closeness, hugging improves relationships with people. By building trust, we may be creating a sense of security and boosting self-esteem and self-worth. Hugging also improves people’s communication and tends to make them get along better. After all, hugging reduces anger and improves relationships. An abundance of research has shown that skin-to-skin contact like a hug between a mother and newborn yields important physical and psychological benefits for the child, including:Reduced cryingImproved sleepSense of body ownershipReduced anxietyCorrect production of growth hormone, leading to correct physical developmentIncreased empathy for others as they grow up Reduced crying Improved sleep Sense of body ownership Reduced anxiety Correct production of growth hormone, leading to correct physical development Increased empathy for others as they grow up"

What is skin cancer?,"'Skin cancer'' is the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the skin. ''Skin cancer'' usually arises on skin exposed to the sun, such as the face, lips, ears, ''scalp'', neck, chest, arms and hands and on the legs especially in women. Though more common in lighter skin tones, ''skin cancer'' affects people of all skin tones.''There are three major types of ''skin cancer'':\xa0''Each type of skin ''cancer'' has a different pathology and presentation.' Basal cell carcinoma,  Squamous cell carcinoma and  Melanoma. "
What is malignant melanoma?,"'Malignant melanoma'' is a one of the subtypes of skin ''cancer''. All ''skin cancers'' have the potential to be locally invasive and spread to other parts of the body. ''Malignant'' ''melanoma'' is a highly aggressive\xa0skin ''cancer''\xa0that tends to spread to other parts of the body.\xa0Non-melanoma skin ''cancers'' are comparatively less aggressive. Self-examination of the skin for suspicious changes, changes in existing ''moles'', non-healing inflammation, ulcers or other abnormalities can help detect skin cancer at its earliest stages. Early detection of skin cancer gives you the greatest chance for successful skin cancer treatment.' "
What do the early signs of melanoma look like?,"'Melanoma in its early stages may presents as:''Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body. It may arise from an existing mole that becomes cancerous or from normal skin. Melanoma tends to occur on the face or the trunk in men. In women, it tends to occur on the legs. Melanoma can also occur in areas not exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect all skin tones but more common in lighter skin tones.' A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or texture or bleeds Large brownish patch or spot A small lesion with an irregular border with areas that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black Pain, itching or burning of the mole"
What causes malignant melanoma?,"'There are various factors that may increase the risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer:' Lighter skin tones:  Having less pigment (melanin) in the skin provides less protection from damaging UV radiation, hence higher risk of skin cancers. People with light skin, red hair, blue eyes, and/or a tendency to freckle are all at higher risk for melanoma development. History of sunburns: Having had one or multiple blistering sunburns during childhood or as an adult increases the risk of skin cancer as an adult.  Excessive sun exposure: Spending considerable time under the sun, living in sunny climates or high altitudes increases the risk of skin cancer.  exposure to tanning lamps and beds also increases the risk of skin cancer. Tanning is basically the skin’s response to the injury caused by excessive UV radiation exposure. Moles: Having many moles or abnormally shaped moles called dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of skin cancer. More than 100 moles in adults and 50 moles in a child are risk factors. Precancerous skin lesions: Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can develop into skin cancer.  precancerous skin lesions usually appear as rough, scaly patches that range in color from brown to pink.  Family history: positive family history increases the risk of skin cancer  History of skin cancer: If a person develops skin cancer once, there is a risk of it recurring Weak immune system: A weak immune system means you have a higher risk developing skin cancer.  Exposure to radiation: Exposure to radiation for cancer treatment or in the environment or occupation increases risk of skin cancer.  Exposure to toxins: Exposure to toxic substances, such as arsenic, can increase the risk of skin cancer."
How to prevent melanoma,"'Most skin cancers, including melanoma are preventable. The following protective measures can help prevent skin cancer:\xa0\xa0' Avoiding the sun during the hottest part of the day, which is typically 11 AM to 4 PM.  Applying sunscreen throughout the year. Sunscreens don't usually filter out all harmful UV radiation, especially radiation that can lead to melanoma but they are essential in providing overall protection from the sun.  A broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 should be used all year around and reapplied as required. Sunscreen is to be applied on all days including winter and cloudy days. It is advised to apply sunscreen over all exposed skin of the body and face, including the lips and ears. Special sunscreen is needed while swimming in the pools and beaches. Wearing protective clothing can provide protection against the sun and harmful UV radiation. Sunglasses are essential to protect the eyes and skin around the eyes, such as the eyelids, against UVB radiation. Avoid tanning beds because they emit UV rays that cause skin cancer. Consuming sun-sensitizing medications such as certain antibiotics or isotretinoin for acne can increase skin sensitivity to sun.  Self examination of the skin regularly is important for diagnosis and treatment. Any new skin changes or changes in existing skin growths, patches or moles should be reported to a physician as soon as possible "
What is a humerus fracture?,"'The humerus is the upper arm bone situated between the\xa0elbow and the shoulder. Humerus fractures account for a remarkably small proportion of total bone fractures. The causes may include:''Accident or severe injury is the main cause of humerus fractures.\xa0Most injuries result from a direct impact to the body, such as during a fall or motor vehicle crash.\xa0Older adults may experience humerus fractures from relatively minor falls due to less bone strength and bone degradation.''Signs and symptoms:''Different types of humerus fractures include:''The doctor may diagnose a fractured humerus by:''The recovery process is different for everyone, depending on the severity of the injury and the treatment you received. Most fractures heal in about 4 to 6 weeks, but severe injuries may take longer to heal.' A direct blow or bending force applied to the middle of the humerus Falling onto an outstretched arm Violent muscle contraction in sports, such as weightlifting Patients usually present with considerable pain and swelling following a humeral fracture. Shortening of the arm is apparent with significant displacement of the bones. It may be very difficult for an individual to move their upper arm. If the nerves are also affected, they may experience unusual sensations and weakness in the hand and wrist. A grinding sensation when the shoulder is moved Deformity Occasionally bleeding (open fracture) Proximal humerus fractures occur near the shoulder. Midshaft fractures are located in the middle of the bone. Distal humerus fractures are located near the elbow joint and are more common in children than in adults. Examining the arm Taking an X-ray of the affected arm In rare cases, more sophisticated imagery, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan is used to provide a more detailed view."
Who can be a birth companion?,"'A birth companion is someone who the mother in labor trusts and who''A birth companion can be' Helps her to prepare for the baby’s birth. Will be with her during childbirth. Supports her. Comforts her. Helps her to be calm. Speak up for her rights, when she cannot. Mother’s partner/spouse/husband. Father of the baby. A family member or relative. Friend. Doula (nonmedical trained personnel who support the woman during labor)."
How can you help the mother after birth?,"'Ways to help:' Encourage the mother to keep the baby on her chest and maintain skin to skin contact immediately after childbirth to help bonding and breastfeeding. Offer drinks and food to the mother as she is likely to be exhausted and dehydrated following labor. Ask the mother whether she needs help to go to the washroom. Encourage the mother to breastfeed positively. The milk for the first 2-3 days after childbirth is greyish and watery (known as, colostrum). It is useful for the baby to fight against infections."
How can you help if things do not go as planned?,"'If the mother needs a cesarean delivery''If the baby dies (''stillbirth''), then' Encourage her and praise her as much as possible when she is feeling disappointed. Talk about her feelings and anxieties. Ask her whether she wants you to be with her during the operation if it is allowed. Help the mother to deal with this very difficult situation by supporting her emotionally. Suggest the mother spend some time with the baby in private. Help the mother find the doctor to answer her questions about medical conditions. Help her to call her close relatives like a partner or mother to support her in their time of grief."
What is a blood clot?,"'Normally, blood clotting is a natural mechanism of the body that prevents excessive blood loss when a blood vessel is injured. Platelets, proteins, and blood cells in the blood aggregate together to form the ''blood clot''.''However, clots that form inside the vessels without an obvious injury are not normal and may be dangerous. ''Blood clots'' are semi-solid masses of blood that may be immobile (thrombosis) and impede blood flow or dislodge to other parts of the body (embolism).\xa0 Abnormal clots can be formed in arteries or veins. Depending on their location, this can result in tissue damage (clot in an artery) or ''pain'' and swelling (clot in a vein).\xa0 ''Deep vein thrombosis'' is a clot in a major vein of the extremities, pelvis, and other areas. Deep ''vein clots'', if dislodged, can travel through veins through the ''lungs'' to the arteries in the lungs. This is referred to as a ''pulmonary embolism'' and can be deadly. Blood clots can also lead to a ''heart attack'' or ''stroke''.' "
What does a blood clot feel like?,"'A ''blood clot'' itself may not be something that you directly feel. However, the signs and symptoms of blood clots vary depending on their location.''Get medical help immediately, once you notice these symptoms.'

What puts you at risk for blood clots?,'The risk factors vary for clots forming in the artery (arterial clots) and the clots forming in the veins (venous clots). Each risk factor initiates clotting differently.''Some of the major risk factors in developing blood clots are:' Pregnancy Prolonged inactivity Smoking Obesity Certain types of cancer Oral contraceptives Trauma Age over 60 years Family history of blood clots High cholesterol levels Long-standing inflammatory diseases High blood pressure Certain surgeries
How are blood clots detected?,"'Tests to evaluate patients for blood clots include:''In addition to the above tests, other tests may also be performed to rule out any underlying conditions.' Venous ultrasound Doppler ultrasound MR angiography Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, head and neck Cerebral angiography D-Dimer test Chest X-ray Pulmonary angiogram Duplex ultrasound"
How are blood clots dissolved?,'The blood clots can be dissolved using the following:''Catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy is considered for arterial clots. Blood thinners and other medications can be used for venous clots.' Blood thinners (Anticoagulants): Prevent the formation of clots. Thrombolytics: Medication that helps in dissolving the clots. Catheter-directed thrombolysis: A procedure in which a catheter is used to deliver the clot-dissolving medicine at the site. Thrombectomy: Surgical removal of clots.
What precautions should be taken if you have blood clots?,"'Some of the dos and don’ts to follow are:' Avoid getting injured. Avoid foods such as kale, spinach, brussels sprouts, chard, green tea, alcohol and cranberry juice when you are taking blood-thinning medications. Avoid long hours of inactivity. Exercises, such as walking or swimming, may help healing of the clots. Avoid taking any medicines without the consent of the physician as some drugs may serious interact with blood clot medications. Use compression stockings. Take breaks while going for a long drive. Keep your weight under control. Talk to others if you feel depressed or anxious. Be careful during pregnancy."
Can blood clots kill?,"'Blood clots in arteries of the vital organs may lead to serious consequences, including death. Blood clots take weeks to months to resolve.' "
Who is a cardiologist?,"'A cardiologist is a doctor with special training in diagnosing, treating, and preventing the diseases of the ''heart'' and blood vessels. Cardiologists obtain extensive education and training. This includes four years of medical school and three years of training in general internal medicine. After the training in general internal medicine, they spend three or more years in specialized training. Following 10 or more years of education and training, a cardiologist must pass a rigorous two-day exam given by the American Board of Internal Medicine. The exam tests their knowledge, judgment, and the ability to provide superior care.' "
What does a cardiologist do?,"'A cardiologist specializes in finding, preventing and treating the diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular diseases).

With stress, the body may slow down the passage of food through the ''digestive system''Food allergies'' and intolerance'': Intolerance or ''allergies'' to certain foods may also cause colon spasm.\xa0 Foods or ingredients that may cause intolerance or ''allergies'' include:' shellfish peanuts egg dairy products gluten-rich foods such as wheat, soya, etc. monosodium glutamate caffeine"
How to treat colon spasm?,"'Treatment depends on the causes of the colon spasm and may vary. In general, making a ''diet'' or lifestyle changes may ease the discomfort of the colon spasm that include:''The physician may also recommend certain medications to relieve colonic spasm, which include:' Including more of fibers in the diet Probiotic ingestion Following a special diet plan known as the FODMAP diet Avoiding wheat or dairy products Including a low-fat diet Getting adequate sleep Avoiding stress  Increasing physical activity Antispasmodics Antidepressants Pain killers Oral contraceptives or hormone medications in the case of endometriosis Antibiotics to treat intestinal bacterial overgrowth"
How to prepare before colposcopy?,"'You should schedule your colposcopy appointment only before or after your periods (never when you are menstruating).''You just need to take a few simple precautions for 2 days before the colposcopy procedure:''Also, let your doctor know''Certain conditions, such as acute cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix), can cause extreme ''pain'' during colposcopy. Hence, the doctor will treat these conditions before going for the procedure.' Do not have sex (vaginal intercourse) Do not use tampons Do not use vaginal creams Do not take an over the counter pain medication If you are pregnant If you are on any blood-thinning medications (Aspirin, Heparin, Warfarin)"
How is a colposcopy performed?,"""Colposcopy is usually done at a doctor's office or clinic, and it typically takes 10 to 20 minutes.""'Usually, the procedure is not very painful, so it may not need any pain medication or anesthesia. Comfort-wise, it is usually similar to a ''Pap test''.''You are asked to lie on your back with your ''feet'' supported on the sides in the same way when you have a Pap test or a ''pelvic exam''.''The doctor will then insert a special instrument (speculum) into your vagina that helps in expanding (dilating) the vaginal opening.''A long tube with a camera (colposcope) is mounted just near to your vulva in such a way that it lights the entire path from inside the vagina up to the cervix. This allows the doctor to visualize your vagina, vulva, and cervix. The doctor then clears the area of ''mucus'' or other discharge.''The doctor may apply a solution containing acetic acid or vinegar to your cervix, which may cause a mild burning sensation. This solution highlights the abnormal regions in and around the cervix.''If the doctor finds suspicious areas in the vagina, vulva, or the cervix, they remove a small piece (biopsy) and send it to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. The biopsy results show if the abnormality is due to inflammation, infection, or is ''precancerous''.' "
What to expect after a colposcopy?,"'It is normal to see some vaginal ''spotting'' (slight bleeding) for the next 2 days and cramping for a few hours after colposcopy. If the doctor has performed a biopsy, you may additionally''You can use a pad to soak the bloody discharge. However, do not use tampons and ''douching'' for a few days or until your doctor gives a nod.''This is a minor procedure, and the recovery period is very short. You can resume all your routine activities right from the same day as the colposcopy. If you also had a biopsy during colposcopy, you just need to avoid vaginal intercourse for a few days to a week (or until your doctor instructs you to).''A colposcopy is not used to get rid of ''HPV'' since it is just a simple procedure to diagnose conditions, such as ''cervical cancer''.' Feel pain at the vagina or vulva for 2 days Get a brown or black discharge from your vagina"
When to call the doctor after the colposcopy?,"'Usually, colposcopy is a relatively safe procedure with minimal risks. However, you should call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms:' Heavy vaginal bleeding (more than you experience during your periods) Severe lower abdominal pain Fever Chills"
How long does it take to get the results of a colposcopy?,"'Usually, the doctor or nurse will tell you the results of the colposcopy right away, but to get the results of the biopsy, you will have to wait for 1-2 weeks.''If the biopsy shows precancerous changes, the doctor will ask you to repeat the Pap test at regular intervals. These changes may go away on their own. If they do not, your doctor will refer you to a gynecological oncologist, who is a doctor specialized in treating ''cancers'' of the women’s reproductive system. To treat the precancerous lesions, the gynecological oncologist will discuss various options. Amongst which the most common ones are' Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): This procedure uses an electric current to remove the abnormal area. Cone biopsy/conization: The removal of the area that contains abnormal or precancerous cells. Hysterectomy: The removal of the entire uterus in severe cases."

What is diverticulitis?,"'Diverticula'' are small, bulging pouches that are formed in the lower part of the ''large intestine''. They are found in only some individuals and are mostly asymptomatic. The presence of diverticula is known as ''diverticulosis''. They are usually seen in individuals aged above 40 years. When one ''diverticulum'' or diverticula becomes inflamed or infected due to the accumulation of waste products and bacteria, the condition is called ''diverticulitis''. Diverticulitis can cause ''fever'', severe ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'', and changes in bowel habits. Diverticulitis may be mild and treated conservatively with ''diet'', medication, and rest; it may be severe and recurring requiring surgery.' "
What are the risk factors for diverticulitis?,"'Certain factors that may increase the risk of diverticulitis are as follows:' Genetics: Genetics may play an important role. Having family members who have diverticulitis increases the risk of this condition. Age: The risk of diverticulitis increases with age, usually over 40 years.  Smoking: Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes and tobacco products can weaken the lining of the colon, causing diverticulosis and in turn diverticulitis. Dehydration: Dehydration affects digestion causing the accumulation of waste products and harmful bacteria in the colon.  Medications: Some medications such as long-term painkillers or steroids can cause weakening or irritation of the colon.  Sedentary lifestyle: Regular exercise may reduce the risk of diverticulitis.  Obesity: Being overweight exerts increased pressure on the colon, increasing the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis.  Constipation: Chronic straining while passing stools increases the pressure on the wall of the colon."
What are the complications of diverticulitis?,"'Although complications are not common, around 25% of individuals with acute diverticulitis tend to develop the following:' Abscess: It is the accumulation of pus in the out-pouching. Scarring: Inflammation of the swelling may heal with scarring, causing obstruction of the bowel.  Fistula: Fistula is an abnormal connection between different sections of the bowel and or the bowel to other organs. Peritonitis: Peritonitis may occur if the pouch gets infected, inflamed, and ruptured, causing the intestinal contents to spill into the abdominal cavity. This is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention."
How is diverticulitis treated?,"'Treatment depends on the severity of the signs and symptoms.''Mild or uncomplicated diverticulitis'': If the symptoms are mild, diverticulitis may be treated conservatively on an outpatient basis at home. Treatment may include:''Severe or complicated diverticulitis:'' A severe attack of diverticulitis may even require hospitalization. Treatment may include:''Surgery:'' Surgery may be indicated in the following cases:''There are two main types of surgery:' Antibiotics to treat the infection A liquid diet until the symptoms improve, after which solid food can be slowly started Plenty of rest  Intravenous (IV) antibiotics Painkillers Drainage of abscess Liquid diet  Having complication such as abscess, fistula, or bowel obstruction or perforation of the bowel wall Having multiple, recurring episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis A weak immune system due to other conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or diabetes Primary bowel resection: Diseased segments of the intestine are removed (resection), and ends of the healthy segments are reconnected (anastomosis). This is also called bowel resection and anastomosis. It may be performed as an open surgery or a laparoscopic (a minimally invasive) procedure. Bowel resection with colostomy: If the inflammation is severe, it may not be possible to reconnect the colon and rectum; in such cases, a colostomy may be performed. A colostomy is a stoma (an opening) made in the abdominal wall, which is connected to the healthy part of the colon. Stools (bowel waste) pass through the opening and into the colostomy bag. Once the inflammation resolves, the colostomy may be reversed, and the healthy segments of the bowel may be reconnected."
Can diverticulitis be prevented?,"'The following may help prevent diverticulitis by promoting healthy bowel function:' Regular exercise A healthy, balanced diet that is rich in fiber  Drink plenty of fluids and remaining hydrated  Avoid smoking and other tobacco products "
What is fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by widespread pain in the body. It may be accompanied by ''tiredness'', sleep disturbances, memory problems, and ''depressed'' ''moods''. Some people may also experience ''frequent urination''. Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men. Many patients with fibromyalgia may also have other associated conditions such as tension ''headaches'', temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') disorders, ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''anxiety'', or ''depression''.''Fibromyalgia is a disorder that may affect you on a long-term basis. You must discuss with your doctor the various treatment options. Timely and proper treatment can help reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life.' "
What causes fibromyalgia?,"'The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but various factors are found to play a role in fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is believed to be caused by chemical imbalance in the brain. Due to this chemical imbalance, the brain interprets even “touch” or “poke” as pain.\xa0''The causes of fibromyalgia are as follows:' Genetics: Fibromyalgia has been found to run in families. There may be certain genetic mutations that increase the risk of this disorder. Infections: Certain systemic illnesses may trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. Physical or emotional trauma: Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by acute psychological stress or physical trauma such as an accident, death of a loved one, and breakdown of a relationship. Chemical transmitters: Individuals with fibromyalgia have low levels of certain chemicals in the body. These chemicals include the hormone serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine. This causes pains at various body sites."
What are the risk factors for fibromyalgia?,"'Risk factors for fibromyalgia are as follows:' Female sex: Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men. Family history: A positive family history increases the risk. Other disorders: Other conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus can increase the risk."
How is fibromyalgia treated?,"'Treatment options for fibromyalgia are as follows:' Painkillers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen), and prescription painkillers can help reduce symptoms. Narcotics are not usually used because they can lead to dependence and may worsen the pain over time. Antidepressants: Antidepressants such as Cymbalta (duloxetine) or Savella (milnacipran) and muscle relaxants may be prescribed to help reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Antiseizure medication: Medications used to treat epilepsy may be useful in reducing certain types of pain.  Physical therapy: A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility, and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. Occupational therapy: An occupational therapist can help you adjust your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. Stress management: Managing physical and emotional stress is essential in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Stress management techniques such as deep-breathing exercises, yoga, or meditation can help. Seeking help from a professional therapist may be required. Adequate sleep: Because fatigue is one of the characteristic presentations of fibromyalgia, sufficient rest and practicing good sleep hygiene are essential. Exercise and diet: Initially, exercise can increase pain, but exercising regularly reduces pain gradually. Exercises may include walking, swimming, biking, water aerobics, yoga, or dance. A physical therapist can help develop an exercise regimen. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and limiting caffeine intake are important in the management of fibromyalgia. Lifestyle modification: Do not make any sudden changes in your lifestyle. Always start the medications with the lowest possible dose."
What happens if you go untreated for fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia is typically not life threatening but can affect your quality of life. Pain, fatigue, and lack of sleep that occur in fibromyalgia can impair the ability to function at home or at work. Patients may also feel frustrated due to their condition, and this can lead to ''anxiety'' or ''depression''. With appropriate treatment, these complications can be managed.' "
What is a heel stick?,'Heel stick is the most common and minimally invasive method to draw capillary blood from an infant for medical testing. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels which carry blood to the tissues and connect arteries to the veins. A sharp device known as a lancet is used to prick the baby’s heel to obtain blood samples.' 
What does a heel stick test for?,"'Heel stick blood samples are used for tests such as:''Newborn screening is one of the primary reasons for a heel stick. Newborn screening is a state-mandated program in the US, though efforts are underway to develop a national newborn screening program.''A screening heel stick is usually performed within 48 hours after a child’s birth or as soon as possible. Early detection of any genetic disorders can help with effective treatment or even ''prevention'' of disease in certain cases. More than 95% of American newborn ''babies'' undergo screening for up to 50 genetic disorders which include:' Complete blood counts Liver function tests Toxicologic tests Bedside glucose monitoring Blood gas analysis Newborn screening tests Phenylketonuria: A metabolic disorder Sickle cell disease: Red blood cell disorder Hypothyroidism: Underactive thyroid Cystic fibrosis: A disease that affects lungs and the digestive system"
At what age do you stop doing heel sticks?,"'The heel stick method can be used until a baby is four to seven months old, when babies are normally able to place their toes in their mouth. Heel sticks must not be done once the babies start bearing any amount of weight on their ''feet''.' "
Why is blood taken from a baby’s heel?,"'The heel is a viable source of blood whenever capillary blood is acceptable as a sample for testing. A heel stick is a simple and safe way to draw blood in newborns in situations that include the following:' Only a small blood sample is required for testing. Multiple and frequent blood tests are required. Other sources, like a venous or umbilical catheter, are not already available."
When is a heel stick not done?,'A heel stick is not performed in the following situations:' If the baby’s sampling area in the heel has anyInjuryAnomalyInfectionEdema Injury Anomaly Infection Edema If blood volume required for testing is relatively larger Certain types of blood tests such asCoagulation testsBlood culturesChromosomal analysesImmunoglobulins and titers Coagulation tests Blood cultures Chromosomal analyses Immunoglobulins and titers
What is the correct site for an infant heel puncture?,"'The safest sites for an infant heel puncture are the edges of the heel on the inside (medial) and outside (lateral). The curve in the back of the heel should not be used for a heel stick in order to prevent injury to the calcaneus bone, which is close to the skin in the posterior heel. Previous puncture sites must also be avoided.' "
How do you do a newborn heel stick?,'A pediatrician or a nurse trained in pediatric care performs the heel stick in a newborn infant.''Anesthesia is not required but the doctor makes the baby comfortable with:''The doctor' Swaddling Reduced ambient light and noise Oral sucrose administered with a filler or a pacifier dipped in sugar solution The doctor may apply a heel warmer to warm the heel for five minutes before the procedure. Cleans the heel stick site with an antiseptic solution Holds the heel between their thumb and forefinger Applies light pressure on the heel Places the lancet on the appropriate spot and activates it Applies mild pressure to squeeze out a blood drop Wipes away the first drop as it can contain some of the antiseptic solution and interfere with the test results Collects the blood in a collection tube Blots blood drops in filter paper used for testing Applies pressure to stop bleeding Places a bandage over the heel stick site
What is the most serious complication of an infant heel stick?,'Complications can mostly be avoided by employing proper care during a heel stick. Improper heel stick technique can cause damage to the calcaneus bone and soft tissue. Other potential complications include:' Pain Infection leading toCellulitisAbscessOsteomyelitis Cellulitis Abscess Osteomyelitis Scarring An incision that is too deep Inaccurate results

What does a narcoleptic attack feel like?,"'Narcolepsy'' is a neurological ''sleep'' disorder that affects your ability to get good quality ''sleep''. Because of the condition, you will feel excessively sleepy or tired during the daytime even with a full night’s sleep.\xa0''If you suffer from ''narcolepsy'', you may experience attacks in which you can fall asleep in the middle of any activity. This can be dangerous while driving or operating heavy machines. These attacks are known as “narcoleptic sleep attacks.” In between sleep attacks, you have normal levels of alertness, particularly if you are doing activities that keep you alert.''Other symptoms of a narcoleptic attack include the following:' Cataplexy: Sudden loss of muscle tone that makes you unable to move Hallucinations: Unreal sensations that are perceived as real Sleep paralysis: Total paralysis just before falling asleep or just after waking up"
What triggers a narcoleptic attack?,"'Narcolepsy has been identified as a hereditary condition, meaning you can get narcolepsy if your parents or grandparents had narcolepsy.\xa0''Some researchers have also identified it to be an autoimmune condition (your immune system attacks your healthy cells). In narcolepsy, the immune system destroys certain brain cells that produce a hormone called hypocretin. Hypocretin plays a certain role in regulating your sleep and brain functions. However, the details of its actions are not yet fully understood.\xa0''Researchers are now beginning to identify what might trigger an autoimmune attack on hypocretin and give rise to a narcoleptic attack. Narcoleptic attacks most commonly start appearing in the late spring and early summer and after an infection with a microbe known as ''streptococcus''.''Sudden loss of muscle tone in narcolepsy is often triggered by emotions such as laughter, fear, anger, excitement, or ''stress''.' "
Do narcoleptics sleep well at night?,'About half of people with narcolepsy have trouble sleeping through the night. You may wake up frequently (fragmented sleep) and have difficulty falling back to sleep.''Sleep may be disturbed by' Insomnia (a sleep disorder that makes it difficult for you to fall asleep) Sleep apnea (cessation of breathing during sleep) Acting out while dreaming Restless leg syndrome (a condition in which there is a severe urge to keep moving the legs)
Do narcoleptics dream more?,"'Generally, with narcolepsy, you experience longer, more complicated, more negative and more vivid dreams than people without narcolepsy. You may also experience ''nightmares'' frequently, and may not be able to understand if that was a dream or a real-life experience.\xa0' "
What is the peak expiratory flow rate measurement test?,"'A peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is also called peak expiratory flow. It is a simple test that measures a person’s maximum speed of expiration/''exhalation''. It helps assess the status of the airways and ''lungs''. The test is performed using a small, hand-held device that measures the speed of airflow through the bronchi. A patient can perform the test at home or in an outpatient setup.''During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes (bronchi) that open into the lungs. Within the lungs, the bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. The end of bronchioles open into little air sacs called alveoli that aid in gaseous exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels, through which the exchange of gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide take place.' "
Why is the peak expiratory flow rate measurement test done?,"'Indications for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) measurement are as follows:''Long-term daily PEFR monitoring or home peak flow rate assessment is performed during exacerbations for patients with:''In managing chronic asthma, long-term daily PEFR monitoring may assist with the following measures:' Monitoring of asthma Monitoring effects of air pollutants of the respiratory system Monitoring of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) moderate or severe persistent asthma. a history of severe exacerbations. poor perception of airflow obstruction and worsening asthma. a preference for peak flow rate monitoring rather than the use of a symptom-based asthma action plan. Detecting early changes in asthma that may require therapy Evaluating responsiveness to changes in therapy Giving a quantitative measurement of improvement Identifying temporal relations between environmental and occupational exposures and bronchospasm"
When is a peak expiratory flow rate measurement test not done?,"'The use of a peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) during acute asthma exacerbations is controversial. Patients who have a history of poor compliance need to have a ''caregiver'' or healthcare professional to monitor the patient. Children and young adults are also found to have poor compliance and or perform the test wrong. Moreover, there are no major contraindications for PEFR.' "
What are the complications of face blindness?,'Face blindness can lead to the following complications:' Depression  Social anxiety Social withdrawal  Lack of confidence  Difficulty building and maintain relationships Difficulty following characters in movies or TV shows
What causes face blindness?,"'Researchers believe that face blindness may be caused by\xa0abnormalities or damage of a fold in the brain called the right fusiform gyrus. The right fusiform gyrus plays an important role in the coordination of the neural systems that is responsible for facial memory and perception.''Face blindness can occur following a ''stroke'', ''trauma'' to the brain, or neurodegenerative diseases. Some people may be born with face blindness (congenital disorder) as it can run in families.' "
How is face blindness diagnosed?,'The diagnosis of face blindness is mainly clinical. The ''neurologist'' may advise some tests to confirm the diagnosis such as Benton Facial Recognition Test (BFRT) and Warrington Recognition Memory of Faces (RMF). ''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') of the brain can help diagnose areas of damage in the brain.' 
How is face blindness treated?,"'There is no cure for face blindness. Treatment of face blindness is mainly supportive and developing coping mechanisms to help manage the condition better. Some may need psychological support and medication to manage ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' that may be associated with the condition.''Some coping mechanisms include:''Coping mechanisms for children with face blindness:' Patients can learn to focus on other visual or verbal characteristics of a person, such as the color and pattern of the hair, their height, or their voice. Patients can observe certain mannerisms of people such as walking style. Asking the child to wait for the parents or caregiver to wave or hold a sign when the child is being picked or when in a crowd. Advising children not to approach anybody in a crowd without any visual clues. Teaching the child to study and remember features such as the hair type or color, the height of a person, and their voice. Teaching the child to observe people’s mannerisms. Educating family, friends, teachers, caregivers, and anyone in close association with the child about the condition. Parents can write their phone number on the child’s hand or pin it to their shirt, in case the child gets lost. Patiently educating the child about the condition. A professional child psychologist can help the child cope with the condition and the associated social and psychological complications."
What is a pretrichial brow lift?,"'A pretrichial brow lift is a surgical procedure to correct the loss of soft tissue elasticity in the upper third of the face. The pretrichial brow lift is usually performed by ''plastic'' surgeons.''Excess sagging skin around the forehead causing drooping of the brows and wrinkling of the forehead is removed. Underlying muscle and tissue are repositioned, creating a more refreshed, youthful appearance in the upper third of the face.''A pretrichial brow lift can also be combined with a ''facelift''.' "
Why do people seek a pretrichial brow lift?,"'Aesthetically, the face is divided into three equal parts, of which the forehead (from the top of the eyebrow to the anterior hairline) occupies the upper third. In males, this area averages 7 cm. In females, it averages 5 cm.''The male eyebrow is less arched than the female eyebrow. The top of the eyebrow lies approximately 2.5 cm from the mid pupil.\xa0 With ''aging'', these parameters may shift. A lesser distance denotes eyebrow drooping (''ptosis''). Loss of forehead skin elasticity from genetics, solar damage, and gravity causes eyebrow and upper ''eyelid'' drooping.''Aging'' also causes depletion of the subcutaneous fat with deterioration of the subjacent skull bone. This leads to forehead wrinkling.' "
Why is pretrichial brow lift surgery done?,"'Patients may seek this surgery to correct:' A tired, surprised, worried, or annoyed appearance Aged appearance Drooping (ptosis) of the eyebrows Wrinkling of the forehead"
Who should not seek a pretrichial brow lift?, General systemic conditions (such as diabetes) and bleeding disorders. People with an inability to completely close the eyes (lagophthalmos). Psychosocial deficiency. Unrealistic expectations (must be dealt with preoperatively).
How is the pretrichial brow lift performed?," The patient must discontinue use of aspirin and similar medications at least two weeks prior to surgery and for two weeks postoperatively. The position of the hairline, eyebrow, and upper eyelids is carefully noted manually, locating the eyebrow position and observing the effect on the upper eyelid. The sites of forehead wrinkles are recorded. The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia. Shaving is not necessary. Incision follows 2 mm behind the hairline, helping induce hair growth through the incision. Incision is extended if a facelift is performed at the same time. Entire flap is advanced toward the back of the head and the excess trimmed to close without tension. The incision in the scalp skin is closed with sutures, and staples are used in the hair-bearing region. A light pressure dressing is applied. Painkillers may be given if necessary. Follow-up:The wound is examined on the first postoperative day.Stitches are removed on the fifth postoperative day.Staples may be removed on the 10th postoperative day. The wound is examined on the first postoperative day. Stitches are removed on the fifth postoperative day. Staples may be removed on the 10th postoperative day."
What are the complications of pretrichial brow lift surgery?,"'Though rare, complications can occur. Contact your surgeon, if you encounter any of the following complications:' Blood clot (hematoma) formation Swelling Infection Facial nerve impairment Sensory nerve impairment: numbness around the incision tends to resolve in 3 to 6 months Loss of hair (alopecia): Alopecia may be temporary or permanent. Inability to close the eyelids completely Unsightly scarring Contour irregularities"
What does a pseudotumor cerebri headache feel like?,"'Pseudotumor cerebri'' '""occurs when intracranial pressure (pressure within the skull) increases. The cause is usually unknown. Hence, it's also called idiopathic (unknown cause) ""'intracranial hypertension''. The condition is characterized by ''headaches'', which is also the first symptom of ''pseudotumor cerebri''.' "
What causes pseudotumor cerebri?,"'The exact cause of pseudotumor cerebri is unknown. The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by the cerebrospinal fluid, which acts as a cushion, protecting the brain and skull from injury. The cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the brain and gets absorbed into the bloodstream at a rate that maintains the pressure in the brain. Sometimes, the rate of production of the cerebrospinal fluid is higher than that of absorption due to problems in the absorption process. This causes accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid that increases the intracranial pressure, resulting in pseudotumor cerebri.''Risk factors for pseudotumor cerebri: ''The following factors may increase the risk of pseudotumor cerebri' Obesity: Women who are obese and of childbearing age are at higher risk. Medications: Substances that may increase intracranial pressure includeGrowth hormoneTetracyclineExcess vitamin A Growth hormone Tetracycline Excess vitamin A Medical conditions: Certain conditions and diseases increase the risk of pseudotumor cerebri and intracranial hypertension including LupusAnemiaBlood-clotting disordersAddison’s diseaseKidney diseasePolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)Sleep apnea Lupus Anemia Blood-clotting disorders Addison’s disease Kidney disease Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Sleep apnea"
What are the signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri?,"'Symptoms that may resolve with treatment can recur months or years later. Some common signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri might include' Frequent episodes of severe headaches that may originate from the back of the head or behind the eyes A whooshing sound in your head or inside the ears that correlates with the heartbeat Nausea and vomiting Giddiness  Difficulty in peripheral vision  Double vision Blurring of vision  Seeing light flashes Episodes of blindness in one or both eyes and eventually permanent loss of vision  Brief episodes of blindness, lasting a few seconds and affecting one or both eyes Neck, shoulder or back pain Underactive parathyroid glands"
How is pseudotumor cerebri diagnosed?,"'The doctor would obtain a detailed history, perform a clinical assessment and advise certain tests that would help diagnose pseudotumor cerebri.' Eye exams: If pseudotumor cerebri is suspected, an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) performs specific tests to test the field of vision and examine the retina and optic nerve. Radiological imaging of the brain: The doctor would advise a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out other causes that present similarly to pseudotumor cerebri, such as brain tumors or blood clots in the brain. Lumbar puncture: A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid is removed with a needle inserted in between two vertebrae of the spine in the lower back to measure the pressure inside the skull and analyze the spinal fluid. "
How is pseudotumor cerebri treated?,"'Treatment of pseudotumor cerebri is necessary to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of eyesight, which is the main complication of the condition. Treatment involves mediations, lifestyle modifications and, in some cases, surgery.''Medications''Surgery''Lifestyle modifications:''\xa0Lifestyle modifications include maintaining an ideal body mass index (''BMI'') (below 25) by exercising regularly and eating healthy. A low-sodium weight-loss ''diet'' may be advised for patients with obesity. ''Weight loss'' of even 10 to 15 percent may result in improvement of symptoms.' Glaucoma drugs: These medications are mild diuretics that reduce the production of cerebrospinal fluid and reduce symptoms. Other diuretics: Other diuretics may be advised to reduce fluid accumulation by increasing urine output. Migraine medications: These reduce the intensity and frequency of headaches that occur in pseudotumor cerebri. Optic nerve decompression: In this procedure, a surgeon makes a small window in the membrane that surrounds the optic nerve, called the nerve sheath, allowing the excess cerebrospinal fluid to drain out. Spinal fluid shunt: The doctor inserts a shunt (a long, thin tube) into the brain or lower spine. The tubing is then placed under the skin of the abdomen, where the shunt drains the excess fluid, hence maintaining intracranial pressure. Venous sinus stenting: A stent is placed in one of the larger veins in the head to increase the blood blow in the brain, helping the cerebrospinal fluid circulate, drain and get absorbed better."
Who is at a risk of scratches?,"'Scratches can affect anyone. They are one of the commonest types of superficial injuries. Some people, however, may be at a higher risk of scratches. They include:' People with occupations involving working with rough surfaces such as concrete, unfinished wood, thorny plants, and sandpaper Children People involved in playing sports such as basketball, volleyball, and soccer People with medical conditions that affect skin sensations such as advanced diabetes and leprosy People with pets"
How to take care of a scratch wound?,"'Scratch wounds often resolve on their own. If you get a scratch ''wound'', you should' Wash the scratch wound thoroughly with soap and water. You may keep the wound under running water for several minutes. Pat dry the wound with a clean towel; do not rub. Apply pressure if you need to stop bleeding from the wound. Most scratch wounds do not cause any serious bleeding. Apply antimicrobial cream or ointment such as povidone-iodine. Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or clean cloth.

What are the nutritional value and health benefits of starfruit?,"'Star fruits are also a rich source of natural antioxidants, such as ''Vitamin C'' and gallic acid. Other antioxidants present are magnesium, potassium, phosphorous, as well as β-carotene. Antioxidants play a vital role in fighting off oxidative ''stress'' (oxidative ''stress'' is responsible for the development of various diseases, including ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', and ''cancer'').''Antioxidants like iron, zinc, and manganese in star fruits help in strengthening the immune system.''High amounts of fibers in star fruits aid in controlling blood glucose concentration. They also exert ''cholesterol''-reducing effects by enhancing the removal of cholesterol, ''lipid'', and bile acid through bowel movements. This helps in lowering the risks of ''heart'' diseases.''Usually, when consuming star fruit juice, often the ''fiber''-rich residual parts of fruits are excluded from the beverage. Hence, it is recommended to consume the fruit juice together with the fibers (called a smoothie). As per research, star fruits may have the following properties:' Anti-inflammatory (beneficial in treating skin diseases, such as eczema) Antimicrobial Antiulcer Antitumor"
Does eating star fruits cause health problems?,"'Due to their high oxalate content, eating starfruit can cause negative (toxic) effects in people who have kidney diseases. Various other substances are found in star fruits that may be detrimental to health in people with kidney diseases. It also contains a toxic substance called neurotoxin that can affect the brain and cause neurological disorders. People with healthy kidneys can process and pass this toxin out from their bodies. However, for those with ''kidney disease'', this process is hampered. The toxin stays in the body and can cause serious illnesses, such as star fruit poisoning. The toxic effect can even become life-threatening.''The symptoms of starfruit poisoning include:''If you have any kidney disorder, ask your doctor before consuming star fruits.'

Why is amniocentesis done?,"'Amniocentesis can be done to test for the following:''Amniocentesis is highly indicated in the following cases:' Genetic testing: Testing the amniotic fluid can help diagnose genetic disorders such as Down syndrome, spina bifida, or cystic fibrosis. Amniocentesis to test for genetic abnormalities is usually performed in the second trimester after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Fetal lung maturity testing: Testing the maturity of the fetal lung can help determine whether a baby's lungs are mature enough for birth. Amniocentesis to determine the baby’s lung maturity is usually performed later in the course of pregnancy between 32 and 39 weeks. Diagnosis of fetal infections: Amniotic fluid testing can be done to evaluate the baby for infection or other illness. As a treatment procedure: Amniocentesis may be done as a treatment procedure for conditions such as polydraminos. Polyhydraminos is a condition in which there is an excess accumulation of the amniotic fluid during pregnancy. Amniocentesis may be done to drain excess amniotic fluid from the uterus. Paternity testing: Fetal cells in the amniotic fluid can be analyzed for DNA paternity testing. Positive results from a prenatal screening test indicate the possibility of abnormalities. Amniocentesis is done to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. Having another child with a genetic abnormality Babies born to women aged 35 years and older have a higher risk of chromosomal conditions such as Down syndrome. Your healthcare provider might suggest amniocentesis to rule out these conditions.  You have a family history of a specific genetic condition or you or your partner is a known carrier of a genetic condition Abnormal ultrasound findings during routine examinations during pregnancy"
When should amniocentesis not be done?,"'Amniocentesis is usually not advised in the following cases:''Similarly, the above infections can be transmitted to the baby during amniocentesis.' An active infection in the mother Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) Hepatitis B or C infections"
How is amniocentesis performed?,"'During the procedure: '""The patient is made to lie on the back and an\xa0ultrasound is usually done prior to amniocentesis to determine the baby's exact location in the uterus. The abdomen is cleaned with an antiseptic. Anesthesia is usually not used, but most women experience mild or no discomfort during the procedure. A long and thin needle is inserted through the abdomen and into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. A small amount of amniotic fluid is aspirated into a syringe, and the needle is removed. The fluid is then sent to the lab for analysis.""'After the procedure: ''The patient may be required to stay in the clinic or hospital for a few hours to monitor the baby’s vitals after the procedure. Some patients may experience mild cramping or pelvic discomfort, which usually resolves. Patients can resume normal activities after the procedure, but ''exercise'' and sexual activity should be avoided for two or three days.' "
What are the complications of amniocentesis?,"'Amniocentesis carries various risks including:' Leaking amniotic fluid: Although rare, the amniotic fluid leaks through the vagina after amniocentesis, but usually, only a small amount is lost and stops within a week. Miscarriage: There is a small risk of miscarriage in second-trimester amniocentesis. The risk of miscarriage is higher following amniocentesis when it’s done before 15 weeks of pregnancy. Rh sensitization: During amniocentesis, the baby's blood cells may enter the mother's bloodstream. If there is an Rh-negative or Rh-positive blood group mismatch between the mother and baby, it can cause serious complications. Infection: Uterine infection can occur following amniocentesis. Infection transmission: Infections in the mother such as hepatitis B or C, toxoplasmosis, and sexually transmitted diseases can transmit to the baby during the procedure. Needle injury: Because the needle is long (but thin), it could injure the baby if they move an arm or a leg, but these injuries are rarely serious."
What is an echocardiogram?,'An ''echocardiogram'' (''EKG'') is a painless test that uses ''ultrasound'' to show the structure and function of the ''heart'' muscle. The ultrasound waves create pictures of the heart so the doctor can diagnose any abnormalities of the heart.' 
What does an echocardiogram test for?,"'An\xa0echocardiogram\xa0checks how the heart’s chambers and valves pump blood through the heart. It also helps in monitoring the heart’s rhythm and blood flow.''EKG helps the doctor\xa0diagnose various\xa0heart conditions. A doctor may order an echocardiogram to:' Diagnose heart problems, such as an enlarged heart or thick ventricles Monitor heart valves after medical or surgical treatments  Identify heart defects that are present at birth Locate blood clots or tumors"
What are the different types of echocardiogram tests?,"'The types of echocardiogram include the following tests.' This is the standard test like an X-ray but without the radiation. Specialists use the same technology to check a baby’s health before birth.  A technician places a hand-held device called a transducer on the chest. It sends high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) that bounce off your heart, creating images and sounds.  Changes in the sound waves, called Doppler signals, can show the direction and speed of blood moving through the heart.  The test takes about 40 minutes.  For this test, a swallowing tube is used that can get a closer and clearer picture of the heart. The patient may get a mild sedative to relax.  A member of the medical team will pass the ultrasound probe into the mouth. It won’t affect breathing.  Once the probe is in place, it will take pictures of your heart.  The test takes about 10 to 30 minutes. Then the probe is taken out.  Nurses will monitor the patient for 20 to 30 minutes afterward. The patient can have this test while exercising on a treadmill or stationary bicycle.  It shows the motion of the heart’s walls and pumping action when it’s working hard. It can also show a lack of blood flow that might not appear on other heart tests.  For this procedure, an EKG electrode is placed on the chest. Heart activity, pulse, and blood pressure are monitored.  The medical team may slowly raise the intensity of the bicycle or treadmill. In the meantime, they’ll watch the EKG monitor for changes and ask the patient about any symptoms.  The patient will exercise until they can’t do it anymore.  The team will monitor vital signs until they’re back to normal.  The appointment takes about an hour, but the test itself usually takes less than 15 minutes. This is another form of stress echocardiogram. But instead of exercising, the patient gets a drug called dobutamine that makes the heart feel like it’s working hard.  This test checks the heart and valves when a patient can’t exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike.  The test monitors heart activity and figures out the risk of heart disease and how well any cardiac treatments are working.  EKG electrodes are placed on the chest.  Dobutamine is administered through the intravenous (IV) line.  Patients may experience a warm, flushed feeling and sometimes a headache.  The appointment may take about an hour, but the IV usually lasts about 15 minutes. The patient may be kept in the waiting room until any symptoms have gone away. During this test, the transducer is sent up the heart blood vessels through a long narrow tube from the thigh region.  It gives more detailed information about blockage inside blood vessels.  EKG electrodes are placed on the chest; the patient is given a sedative to relax and also to numb the thigh region to make a small cut.  A long, narrow tube is sent through the small cut to the arteries of the heart.  The tube has a wire with an ultrasound tip inside that takes pictures of the artery.  The test takes about an hour.  A tight bandage is placed on the thigh region to prevent bleeding.  The patient may lie flat with a straight leg for three to six hours. They might have to stay in the hospital overnight."
What is an exercise stress test?,"'An exercise stress test (treadmill test/exercise test/stress test) helps your doctor to find how well your heart works during physical activity. As exercise makes your heart work harder and pump faster, an exercise stress test may reveal problems with blood flow within your heart. It involves ''walking'' on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike till you achieve a particular heart rate and monitoring of your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and breathing during these activities. Sometimes, you may receive a drug that imitates the effects of exercise and the parameters may be measured.''As your body works harder during the test, it requires more oxygen; therefore, your heart must pump more blood. This test may predict and determine if the blood supply in the arteries that supply your heart is reduced. Additionally, this test is performed to determine what intensity and what type of exercise or physical activity is appropriate for you. Your electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, and blood pressure are monitored throughout.''There are different types of this test:' Exercise stress test or exercise electrocardiogram Treadmill test Graded exercise test Stress electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG)"
How should you prepare for the exercise stress test?," Avoid eating or drinking anything except water for four hours before your test. Avoid drinking coffee for 12 hours before the test. Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes and walking shoes with rubber soles or sport shoes. Do not take certain heart medications on the day of your test unless your doctor/cardiologist advises you, especially beta-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, and atenolol) If you use an inhaler for your breathing, carry it during the test. If you have any questions or doubts about your medications, ask your doctor/cardiologist (heart specialist). Do not stop taking any of your prescribed drugs without consulting with your doctor/cardiologist. Inform your doctor if you are consuming any over-the-counter medicines, herbal products, or vitamins. Your doctor may inform you to stop taking them before the test. "
What happens during the exercise stress test?,"'Before the test:''A technician will gently clean 10 small areas on your chest and place small, sticky patches (electrodes). These patches will be attached to an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor that charts your heart’s electrical activity during the test.''The equipment used during these tests are as follows:''During the test:''When you are hooked up to an EKG machine, a doctor or trained technician will ask you to run typically on a treadmill. This allows your doctor to monitor your heart rate and ECG changes. The test may take 20-30 minutes depending upon the heart rate you are required to achieve during the test. The target heart rate depends on your age and weight. As you run, every three minutes, the slope and speed of the treadmill increases gradually. You have to run until you achieve the target or you feel fatigued, breathlessness or ''chest pain''.''You will be' An electrocardiography (ECG) machine to record your heartbeat and heart waves Wires or electrodes hooked up to your chest, arms, or shoulders and connected to the ECG machine A mouthpiece attached at the end that measures the air you breathe out Hooked up to an EKG machine to monitor your heart. Informed to walk slowly in place on a treadmill. Then the speed will be increased for a faster pace. It tilts so you feel like you are walking up a small hill. Asked to breathe into a tube for a couple of minutes. Informed that you can stop the test at any time you need to. Asked to sit or lie down after slowing down for a few minutes, and your heart rate and blood pressure will be checked."
Is there any risk?,"'Healthy people who take this test are at very little or no risk. It’s about the same as if they walk fast or jogs up on a hill. However, a medical professional should be present to monitor you during the test, in case something unusual happens.' "
What is eye infection?,"'Eye infection is a condition in which a virus, bacteria or any other microbial agents may infect the eye. This can cause ''itching'' around the eyes, or the eyes may turn pink. The infection can affect the following parts of the eye:' Eyelid Cornea (a clear surface that covers outside of the iris) Conjunctiva (a thin, moist area that covers the inside of the eyelids and outer part of the eye)"
What are some common eye infections?,"'Some common eye infections include:' Conjunctivitis: Commonly known as “pinkeye,” it’s the infection of the conjunctiva. Beside bacteria or viruses, pinkeye may also be caused by an allergic reaction or irritants. It can give a pink shade to the eye as the blood vessels beneath the white of the eye (sclera) dilate in response to inflammation. Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea caused by bacteria, viruses, or waterborne parasites. It is common in people using contact lenses. Stye occurs as a painful, red bump under the eyelid or at the base of the eyelashes. Bacteria infect the oil glands in the eyelid or eyelashes to produce a stye. Styes, sometimes spelled “sty,” are largely harmless and not contagious. Fungal eye infections: Infections that occur due to fungal organisms are rare but serious. Fungal infections usually occur after an eye injury, or from using unclean contact lenses. Uveitis: It is the inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, called the uvea. Viruses like herpes or autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus can cause uveitis. Blepharitis: It is the inflammation of the base of the eyelashes caused by the bacteria."
What are the symptoms of eye infections?,'The symptoms may be present in one or both the eyes. The patient may experience the following symptoms in and around the eye:' Eye pain Persistent itching Pricking sensation Sensitivity to light Watery eyes Chronic redness Discomfort Blurring vision Constant watering Irritation Dryness
What does an eye infection look like?,"'An eye infection may bring about the following changes in the eye:' A pink tint in the whites of the eye Swollen red or purple eyelids Crusty lashes or lids Discharge of fluids which may be yellow, green or clear"
What are the complications of eye infections?,"'The complications of an eye infection include:''If left untreated, these conditions can result in:' Orbital cellulitis is the infection of the tissues surrounding the eyeball. This may be a consequence of rubbing or popping a stye. Dacryocystitis: Inflammation and blockage of the eye’s tear drainage system. Corneal ulcer: Blister on the eye. Damage to retina (visual nerve tissue in the eye) Formation of scars Vision loss Blindness Meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain)"
What is IBS?,"'IBS'' or ''irritable bowel syndrome'' is a medical condition affecting the large bowel. \xa0It is a type of functional bowel or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. This means that although it causes disturbing symptoms, it does not cause any structural damage to the bowel. Functional GI disorders are caused by problems with how the brain and\xa0gut\xa0work together (brain-gut interaction). Thus, a faulty brain-gut interaction in some people with IBS may cause the food to move too slowly or too quickly through the gut. This causes changes in bowel movements. IBS refers to a group of symptoms occurring together, including repeated ''pain'' in the abdomen, cramping, bloating, and changes in the bowel movements, which may be ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', or both. The typical feature of IBS is that these symptoms occur without any visible signs of damage or disease in the gut. IBS can cause a huge amount of discomfort, however, it does not damage the ''intestines''.''IBS is a long term or chronic disorder. The ''symptoms of IBS'' may come and go. It is a common condition affecting about twice as many women as men. IBS is most often reported in people younger than 45 years of age. The exact cause of IBS is not known. The condition does not have any specific test for diagnosing it. Tests may be done to exclude other conditions such as Crohn’s disease, ''ulcerative colitis'', and certain ''cancers''. Most cases of IBS are effectively managed with ''diet'', ''stress management'', ''probiotics'', and medicine.' "
What are the different types of IBS?,"'Based on different patterns of changes in the bowel movements or the presence of abnormal bowel movements, IBS is of three types. Certain diets or medications may work for one type of IBS but not for the other or may make other types worse. People with IBS often have normal bowel movements on some days and abnormal bowel movements on other days.\xa0''The three types of IBS are:''IBS with ''constipation'' (IBS-C)'': It is also called constipation-predominant IBS. It presents with the following symptoms on days when the person has at least one abnormal bowel movement:''IBS with ''diarrhea'' (''IBS-D'')'': It is also known as diarrhea-predominant IBS. In ''IBS-D'', on days when the person has at least one abnormal bowel movement:''IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS-M)'': It is also called alternating type IBS or IBS-A. In this type of IBS, on days when there is at least one abnormal bowel movement:' more than a quarter of the stools are hard or lumpy less than a quarter of the stools are loose or watery more than a quarter of the stools are loose or watery and less than a quarter of the stools are hard or lumpy more than a quarter of the stools are hard or lumpy and more than a quarter of the stools are loose or watery"
What does an MS attack feel like?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is an autoimmune disorder in which your own antibodies (autoantibodies) start attacking and destroying the nerve cells of your body. This disease affects the central nervous system, which is responsible for various functions including, balance, and coordination.\xa0''MS'' is a progressive neurological condition that waxes and wanes, i.e., the symptoms keep occurring at certain intervals. The symptom-free periods are known as remissions and when the symptoms return, the recurrence is referred to as an attack, exacerbation, or relapse.''The main feature of ''MS'' is symptomatic episodes that reappear after several months or years.''During an MS attack, you may experience some symptoms you have had before getting worse, or some new symptoms appear.''These can include:' Sensory loss: Tingling and numbness are seen in the fingers and toes. This is the earliest symptom. Muscle related symptoms: cramps and tightness in the muscles Fatigue Dizziness A triad of abnormal speech, abnormal eye movement, and hand tremor Problems with balance and coordination Visual disturbances An uncontrollable urge to pee, bladder incontinence Bowel incontinence Trigeminal neuralgia: face pain Pain Intolerance to heat"
How does multiple sclerosis begin? ,"'The brain sends signals to various organs of the body through nerve fibers. These nerve fibers are enveloped in a fatty cover known as the myelin sheath.\xa0''MS starts developing when your immune system attacks the myelin sheath and destroys it. The process is known as ''demyelination'' results in damaging the nerve cell and, subsequently, the functioning of the nervous system gets disturbed.''What exactly triggers the immune system in MS is unknown. But it has been observed that many of the MS attacks happen after stressful events. Scientists have also speculated the role of multiple factors, including genetic factors and environmental factors in the development of MS.\xa0' "
What are the four stages of MS?,"'While doctors cannot predict how MS goes through various stages, they have identified four basic MS disease courses (also called types or phenotypes) as follows:' Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS): CIS is the first attack of neurologic symptoms of MS. People who experience the first attack of MS may or may not progress to the full spectrum of MS. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS): This is the most common disease course and is diagnosed in 85% of MS patients. Attacks (relapses or exacerbations) are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions) with no apparent progression. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS): Initially, SPMS has remissions and relapses as in RRMS. Some people with RRMS will eventually experience worsening of the disease and progress to SPMS. Primary progressive MS (PPMS): From the beginning, this disease course progresses without apparent remissions or relapses."
Is depression a side effect of MS?,"'Getting diagnosed with MS can make you ''depressed''. While physical symptoms include losing balance and coordination while doing daily activities and ''memory loss'', they may also lower your confidence and make you feel down.\xa0''Depression'' can be one of the symptoms of MS. This ''depression'' is due to damage to the nerve cells of your brain that control your mental state.''Depression'' in MS can be a side effect of the medications for MS such as ''interferon''. It is important to discuss with your doctor if you are feeling depressed so that he can modify your treatment and refer you to a counselor.' "
What anxiety can do to your body?,"'Anxiety'' may affect people differently. It has a varied effect on the mind and the body because of the release of certain hormones and other chemicals in the body.\xa0''It increases a person’s chances of suffering from other medical conditions, such as ''heart'' diseases, raised ''blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'' ''obesity'', ''depression'' and ''diabetes''. ''Anxiety'' may also cause ''sleep'' disturbances and poor work performance.''Anxiety'' causes a rise in ''stress'' hormones and other responses along with a heightened inflammation affecting the whole body.''Anxiety'' may cause the following symptoms:' Fear or uneasiness Inability to focus Muscle stiffness Dry mouth Rumination (thinking over bad experiences repeatedly) Sweating Pounding or thumping heartbeat (palpitations) Stomach discomfort   Dizzyness Restlessness, inability to stay calm and still Pins and needles sensations Aches and pains such as headaches, backaches Difficulty in breathing or rapid breathing Feeling choked Hot flushes Sleeping problems Grinding teeth, especially in sleep Nausea  Frequent need to go to the toilet Constipation Changes in sex drive"
What exactly is anxiety?,"'We all get worried or scared in response to certain situations in our lives. Anxiety, however, refers to the state of being extremely worried or afraid most of the time or feeling constant panic. This may happen in response to trivial situations or even in the anticipation of situations that have not happened. Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental illnesses. They include ''panic attacks'', ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'') and ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'').\xa0''\xa0Anxiety often negatively affects a person’s performance at work and school. People with anxiety may also have problems in maintaining ''healthy relationships''. Around 40 million adult Americans suffer from anxiety disorders each year. Fortunately, there are many effective therapies to help control anxiety disorders.' "
What are the different types of anxiety?,"'Anxiety disorders are of the following types:' Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): It is a long-term disorder that makes a person anxious over several situations and issues. People with GAD are anxious most of the time and seldom remember when they last felt relaxed. Panic disorder: It manifests as sudden, intense fear associated with profuse sweating, restlessness, chest pain and a racing or pounding heartbeat (palpitations) often mimicking a heart attack.  Social phobia or social anxiety: It involves a feeling of overwhelming worry and self-consciousness about everyday social situations. A typical variant is selective mutism which may be often seen in kids who are confident in front of their family but may not speak at all in school or other places. Separation anxiety: It happens when a loved one goes away. It is often seen in small kids who feel scared or anxious when a loved one leaves. It can also affect adults who typically worry that something bad may happen to their loved ones when they are out of sight. Medication-induced anxiety disorder: Certain medications or drug abuse may cause anxiety during their use or withdrawal phase.  Certain phobias such as agoraphobia (intense fear of being in a place where it seems hard to escape or get help if an emergency occurs such as crowded places), acrophobia (fear of heights)."
Can birth control be used for long term?,"'Long-term contraceptives are recommended only if the doctor prescribed it. Many long-term birth control methods contain hormones. This can cause problems depending on a person’s medical history, age and overall health. Oral contraceptive pills should not be taken for more than five years without a break. Doctors may advise some people to avoid using certain types of birth control. If a ''birth control pill'' causes side effects, people can discuss with doctor and change pills until they find one that works for them.' "
At what age should women stop taking birth control?,"'Women usually should stop using birth control at the age of 55 years. It is not advisable to take pills continuously for five years without a break. Doctors recommend using a barrier method of ''contraception'', such as condoms, to avoid getting\xa0sexually transmitted infections after the age of 50 years.\xa0' "
What is the difference between permanent and emergency birth control?,"'Permanent contraception:\xa0''Emergency contraception'':' Tubal ligation (for women) and vasectomies (for men) are relatively surgical procedures intended to make pregnancy impossible.  They’re almost 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. If individual is very sure about not to have children in the future, they’re a great option to consider. Recovery time from these procedures usually takes only a few days. The sexual function of the patient and partners is not impacted. Reversing a tubal ligation or vasectomy is possible, but there isn’t any guarantee that fertility will return. If a patient has intercourse without using birth control or condom tears during sex, it is advisable to consider emergency contraception. Two types of emergency birth control are available: morning-after pills and IUCD (which doubles as emergency contraception). One type of pill often called “Plan B” is available from most pharmacies without a prescription; it can prevent pregnancy up to three days after sex. The more effective pill often called “Ella” does need a prescription and can prevent pregnancy up to five days after sex.  Copper intrauterine device also requires patient to see a doctor, but they’re almost 100% effective when inserted within five days of intercourse."
What is the best form of birth control?,"'What\'s ""best"" among\xa0birth control methods\xa0differs from person to person. What is right for a person may not be right for others. And individual needs may also change over time.\xa0' The only 100% assured method to avoid pregnancy is to not have penetrative sex or any sexual activity where sperm can reach into the vagina. This is called abstinence. Condoms with any type of birth control are considered the most effective way to avoid pregnancy and also offer protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). No birth control method is perfect. Using condoms with another type of birth control (like the implant, intrauterine device or pill) gives backup protection in case either method fails. Condom lowers the chances of getting all kinds of STDs, like HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes."
What are the common symptoms of colon cancer?,"'Typically, symptoms do not show up in the early stages of the disease. Apart from blood in poop or ''rectal bleeding'', patients with colon ''cancer'' or ''rectal cancer'' may experience other symptoms including:' Change in bowel habits: Frequent episodes of diarrhea or constipation may indicate problem in the intestine. Sometimes, patients may not be able to empty the bowels or poop may be narrower than usual.  Abdominal pain or bloating: Stomach bloating, distention, cramps or pain in the abdominal or bowel region can be symptoms of colon or rectal cancer.  Unexplained weight loss: Sudden loss of weight due to changes in bowel habits is one of the symptoms of colon cancer. Loss of appetite and weakness: Unexplained weight loss and loss of appetite for any reason is a cause for concern and needs to be checked. Anemia: Frequent loss of blood through anus and poop may make the patient anemic. Any newly diagnosed anemia in a person older than 60 years must be investigated further."
How is colon cancer treated at different stages?,"'Treatment for colon cancer is based largely on the\xa0extent of cancer:' Stage 0: In this stage, colon cancers have not grown beyond the inner lining of the colon. Surgery is performed to take out the tumor only. In most cases, this can be done by removing the polyp or taking out the area with cancer through colonoscopy (local excision through a diagnostic tube). Stage I: In stage I, colon cancers may have grown deeper into the layers of the colon wall, but they have not spread outside the colon wall or into the nearby lymph nodes. If cancer in the polyp is of high grade, more extensive surgery might be recommended. Patient might also be advised to have more surgeries if the polyp cannot be removed completely or if the tumor has seeded to multiple sites locally. Surgery to remove the section of colon that has cancer and nearby lymph nodes is the standard treatment.  Stage II: In stage II, colon cancers might have grown through the wall of the colon and invaded into nearby tissues, but they may have not spread to the lymph nodes. Surgery to remove the section of the colon containing cancer (partial colectomy) along with nearby lymph nodes may be the only treatment needed. Sometimes, doctor may also recommend adjuvant chemotherapy (chemo after surgery) if cancer has a higher risk of coming back.  Stage III: In stage III, colon cancers may have spread to nearby lymph nodes, but they have not yet spread to other parts of the body. Surgery to remove the section of the colon with cancer (partial colectomy) along with nearby lymph nodes, followed by adjuvant chemo, is the standard treatment for this stage. Radiation therapy and/or chemo may be options for people who aren’t healthy enough for surgery. Stage IV: Stage IV colon cancers may have spread from the colon to distant organs and tissues. Colon cancer most often spreads to the liver, but it can also spread to other organs like the lungs and sometimes brain or to distant lymph nodes. In most cases, surgery is unlikely to cure these cancers. But if there are only a few small areas of cancer spread (metastases) in the liver or lungs and they can be removed along with the colon cancer, surgery may help patient live longer. Chemotherapy is also typically given before and/or after surgery to shrink the size of tumor and slow down the recurrence chances."
What does culdocentesis mean?,"'Culdocentesis is the puncture and aspiration (withdrawal) of fluid from the pouch of Douglas or rectouterine pouch. The pouch of Douglas or rectouterine pouch is formed between the part of the gut and the uterus. The procedure involves the introduction of a needle through the vaginal wall into the pouch of Douglas. Blood, pus and other fluids in the abdominal ''cavity'' collect in the pouch because of its dependent location and gravity. It may be examined to diagnose diseases of the abdomen.''Culdocentesis used to be a valuable procedure for the diagnosis of ''ectopic pregnancy''. However, due to the development and easy access to ''ultrasound'' (USG), culdocentesis is rarely performed.''An ''ectopic pregnancy''\xa0occurs when the fertilized egg or embryo implants and grows outside the uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube (the tube that carries the eggs from the ovaries to the uterus). This\xa0is called a\xa0''tubal pregnancy''. The results of culdocentesis may sometimes be deceptive, resulting in unwarranted reassurance or unnecessary treatment.' "
When is culdocentesis done?,"'Although culdocentesis is rarely performed now due to the widespread availability of ultrasound, the procedure is performed' To diagnose suspected or ruptured ectopic pregnancy if the patient is unstable and ultrasonography or laparoscopy is not readily available. To diagnose hemoperitoneum (bleeding into the peritoneal cavity) after blunt trauma to the abdomen or abdominal surgery. For the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cysts. For the diagnosis and drainage of pus in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). For the diagnosis and treatment of ascites (fluid accumulation of abdominal cavity)."
When should culdocentesis not be done?,"'Culdocentesis may be contraindicated in the following conditions' Pelvic tumors, including the ovaries Abscesses in the pelvis Anatomical deformities of the uterus, such as the retroverted uterus Bleeding disorders Prepubescent women because the prepubescent vagina is smaller and it would be difficult to perform the procedure through a small vagina A noncooperative or anxious patient"
How is culdocentesis performed?,"'Prior to culdocentesis, the patient is asked to stand or sit up straight for some time so the peritoneal fluid can pool in the pouch. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. Local anesthetic, usually ''lidocaine'', is injected into the vaginal lining. A vaginal speculum is inserted into the vagina to widen it. A spinal needle is inserted through the vagina into the pouch of Douglas. The fluid is aspirated and the physical appearance is studied and sent for testing. Postprocedural ''pain'' can be managed with painkillers and antibiotics may be prescribed.' "
What are the complications of culdocentesis?,"'Though rare, some possible complications of culdocentesis include' Rupture of abscess in the pelvis causing the spread of infection Puncture of the bowel or pelvis Bleeding from the puncture site or due to injury to major pelvic blood vessels Puncture of malignant ovarian cysts, causing the spread of cancer throughout the abdominal cavity Rupture of a tubal pregnancy (implantation of the fertilized egg in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus) Injury to intrauterine pregnancy due to the needle"
What does gastritis feel like?,"'Usually, individuals with ''gastritis'' complain of episodes of gnawing, piercing ''pain'' in the stomach. This ''pain'' may either worsen or get better when eating or ''vomiting''. People with gastritis may have uncomfortable feelings in their upper stomach just below the breastbone and above the ''belly button''. Apart from pain and discomfort, patients also complain of the symptoms below\xa0''In severe cases of gastritis, patients may also complain of chest pains, ''shortness of breath'', ''weakness'', or inability to tolerate any foods or liquids by the mouth along with high grade ''fever''. Severe gastritis requires immediate medical attention.' Nausea and vomiting Stomach bloating Indigestion Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night Hiccups Loss of appetite Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material Black, tarry poop Severe hiccups"
What is the difference between gastritis and gastroenteritis?,"'Most people confuse gastritis with ''gastroenteritis''. However, they are different conditions.' Gastroenteritis is inflammation (irritation) of the stomach and intestines,which is definitely caused by an infection. Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining which is specifically and not always caused by an infection."
What is gastritis?,"'Gastritis is a condition in which the lining of the stomach becomes red and swollen due to various causes. The lining of the stomach produces acid and other substances that help break down the nutrients in food. The stomach lining also produces ''mucus'' to protect the stomach from the acid it produces. During gastritis, this lining becomes impaired and cannot protect the stomach from the acid it produces. This damages the stomach cells and may lead to ulcers and bleeding. Gastritis is a common condition with a wide range of causes. For most people, gastritis may not be serious and improves quickly if treated. However, untreated gastritis may last for years.' "
What causes gastritis?,"'The causes of gastritis include the following' Regular intake of spicy food may irritate the stomach lining. Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacteria that lives in the mucus lining of the stomach; without treatment, the infection can lead to ulcers and stomach cancer. Bile reflux is a backflow of digestive juices called bile into the stomach from the bile tract that connects to the liver and gallbladder. Excessive use of cocaine or alcohol Smoking Regularly taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen or other painkillers Stressful event (such as a bad injury, critical illness, or intentional or accidental ingestion of toxins or poisons or major surgery) An autoimmune reaction-when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own cells and tissues (in this case, the stomach lining) Pernicious anemia is a form of anemia that occurs when the stomach can’t digest vitamin B-12 and can irritate the stomach lining."
How is gastritis treated?,"'The treatment goal with gastritis is to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach to relieve symptoms, allowing the stomach lining to heal and to tackle any underlying cause.''Medications''Diet'' and lifestyle changes' Antacids: These over-the-counter medicines neutralize the acid in the stomach, which can provide rapid pain relief. Histamine 2 (H2) blockers: These medicines reduce acid production allowing the stomach lining to heal. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): These medicines reduce acid production even more effectively than H2 blockers (such as omeprazole). If gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia, B12 vitamin shots may be given. For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, the doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid blocking drug (used for heartburn). Avoid hot spicy, acidic or fried foods and eliminate irritating foods from the diet such as lactose from dairy or gluten from wheat. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid or cut down on alcohol and quit smoking. Manage stress."
What are the possible complications of gastritis?,'Severe gastritis hurts the stomach lining. It may also increase the risk of other health problems. These include the following' Peptic ulcer disease: This causes painful sores in the upper digestive tract. Gastric polyps: These are small masses of cells that form on the inside lining of the stomach.  Stomach cancer: They can be aggressive or nonaggressive. Gastritis due to H. pylori infection increases the risk of stomach cancer. Atrophic gastritis: This can happen if gastritis is caused by H. pylori bacteria or by an autoimmune disorder. Atrophic gastritis destroys the stomach lining cells that make digestive juices. This increases the risk of getting stomach cancer. It can also cause low levels of certain vitamins in the blood.
What does green stool mean?,"'The normal color of the ''stool'' is brown, although green or greenish ''stool'' is also considered normal.

The person should refrain from oral sex. The person should not share personal items such as cups, towels, and lip balms. If there is tingling, burning, itching, or pain in the area of the body where the person had a herpes sore, they should keep that area from coming in contact with others directly or through articles such as towels or cosmetics. Not to have sex with healthy (uninfected) partners until the sores clear up Use a latex condom to reduce the risk of spreading the virus If a woman is pregnant and she or her partner is having genital herpes, they need to inform the doctor. The pregnant lady might need to take medicines so that she does not pass the virus to her baby."
What does it mean to be a pathological liar?,"'Pathological lying is often a warning sign of ''antisocial personality disorder'' (commonly known as a psychopath). A pathological liar is usually considered manipulative, selfish and cunning. They lie incessantly to get their way and do so with little awareness or guilt. It could be that they lie to avoid something traumatic that happened in their lives, such as abuse. The condition may often be genetic in origin. They use lies to protect themselves when a situation goes bad. Below are a few common features of a pathological liar''Reasons''Common traits of pathological liar include''Common signs and symptoms include''Treatment''The success of the treatment depends upon whether the person agrees that they are a pathological liar. The treatment options may include''The treatment options may sometimes be used in combination, depending on the underlying psychiatric condition.' Pathological liars lie as a response to any stimuli. These people are excellent liars because they lie constantly and make up stories so unnecessarily and often that it becomes extremely difficult to distinguish the truth from false statements. They are nearly impossible to catch in the act. Their lie is usually goal oriented (i.e., focused, one tells lies to get their way).  Pathological liars have little regard or respect for the rights and feelings of others. They often have no conscience or guilt. Pathological liars base their lives around deceit and may deeply hurt their victims. Studies show that pathological liars have more white matter in the prefrontal area of their brains. In general, white matter is linked to faster connections, greater verbal fluidity, and faster thought processing. People with more white matter also have problems with empathy and little activity in the areas of the brain related to emotion. They often lie as a coping mechanism developed in early childhood and it is often associated with some other type of mental health disorder, which may include abuse, antisocial personality disorder (APD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD). Pathological liars are driven by definite, typically identifiable motives, such as bolstering their ego or self-esteem, seeking sympathy, justifying feelings of guilt or living out a fantasy. All pathological liars have a purpose, such as to bolster their own personality or to tell something interesting and an ego motive is always present. They all lie about something they wish to possess or be. Pathological liars know how to be confident while lying and use their pathological lying trait as a defense mechanism (e.g. they fix their gaze upon you rather than looking away). Their stories are fantastically outlandish. They are always the hero or the victim. They really believe it. They don’t need a reason to lie. Their stories may change. They don’t like to be doubted. They lie to gain something and exaggerate things. They keep on changing their stories. They live in a false sense of reality. If confronted, they act defensive and never admit that they are liars and they hold no value for truth. Psychotherapy Repeated counseling Antipsychotic medications Family support goes a long way in overcoming this habit too, along with the treatment."
Is anorexia dangerous?,"'Long-term (chronic) untreated anorexia can lead to serious health problems.

Is polyamory a mental illness?,"'No, it is an alternate way of life. Polyamory is neither a ''mental illness'' nor a personality disorder. A study was conducted with around 1093 polyamorous individuals measuring the various criteria like need fulfillment, relationship satisfaction, and commitment for two ongoing romantic relationships. The individuals reported high levels of need fulfillment and satisfaction in the relationships with both partners. The findings suggest that polyamorous relationships are relatively independent of one another, which means the relationship dynamics with each partner are different. This study provides initial evidence that polyamory may be a viable and fulfilling alternative way of conducting intimate relationships, subject to cultural taboos. The relationship a couple is currently in maybe a committed one or even a marital one. However, in the relationship, the person who gets involved with another person does not involve marriage.''Another misperception is that polyamorous relationships are strictly casual, such as swinging relationships or open marriage. Many people think that polyamory is only for lust. People in swinging relationships are there only to experience sexual pleasure with no emphasis on the intimate, emotional part. On the contrary, many people involved in polyamory cite reasons, such as more intimate conversation and emotional fulfillment.''Polyamory does not mean there is cheating. It’s based on mutual consent and awareness. There are group discussions to minimize jealousies involved in maintaining polyamorous lives. People involved in polyamory have made an arrangement in which there is a commitment but no secrecy about the relationship with other people.''People involved in polyamory are the ones who do not want to stay in the conventional system of a committed single relationship or marriage. They want to push the limits of their experiences in every aspect of their life, including relationships because they often feel it is unfair to expect the fulfillment of all monetary, emotional, and physical needs from one partner.''People in polyamorous relationships have been facing discrimination for a long time due to the lack of social acceptance and associated social stigma. They were not entitled to any rights that are generally available to married couples. However, gradually, it seems positive changes are on the horizon. Recently, Somerville, Massachusetts, became the first city in the United States to extend domestic partnership rights to people who claimed to be practicing polyamory. The city now permits access to the polyamorous people to enjoy similar rights as the married people. These rights are property inheritance, shared health insurance coverage, ''nursing'' home visits, and family-only hospital.' "
Do polyamorous people experience satisfying lives?,"'Polyamorous people are seen to find greater ''happiness'' in their lives after taking the plunge into polyamory. They consider their lives more exciting, and their sex life more satisfying.''It is hard to say which is one is the best amongst the two, staying in a monogamous relationship or exploring the polyamorous aspect. The decision depends on the person’s as well as their current partner’s or spouse’s preferences. The person must discuss with them if they also want the same thing from their life. The topic of polyamory may be a sensitive one to the partner/spouse and needs to be brought up gradually and patiently.' "

What is a shoulder dislocation?,"'Your shoulder is a ''ball-and-socket joint'' where the head of the humerus (ball) fits into the glenoid ''cavity'' (socket) of the scapula bone. When the humerus slips out of the glenoid ''cavity'', the condition is known as a shoulder dislocation.''Compared with other joints in the body, the shoulder is extremely mobile. You can turn and move your upper arm in almost all directions. However, this also makes the shoulder most vulnerable to dislocations.''Shoulder dislocations are the most common joint dislocations observed in the emergency department and make up for more than 50% of all dislocations observed in hospitals.' "
What causes a shoulder dislocation?,"'Almost all shoulder dislocations are caused by ''trauma''. Such trauma can happen while falling onto your shoulder, especially on a hard surface or being hit in the shoulder by a heavy object. In young patients, shoulder dislocations happen most commonly due to sports such as football, basketball, and volleyball.''Occasionally, the cause of shoulder dislocation can be laxity of ligaments that hold the shoulder joint. Loose ligaments may dislocate the shoulder with even simple activities such as raising an arm or rolling over in bed. This is commonly observed in older adults and in people who have a pre-existing condition of loose ligaments in the whole body.' "
Is a dislocated shoulder serious?,"'A shoulder dislocation puts you in extreme ''pain''; your shoulder swells and looks deformed. This is a serious condition and needs to be treated right away.''In severe injuries of a shoulder dislocation, the tissue and nerves around the shoulder joint may get damaged.''If you keep dislocating your shoulder, you could end up with chronic instability, ''weakness'', and numbness.''If there is associated bone damage, you may have to undergo a bone transfer surgery.' "
What does it mean to reduce a shoulder dislocation?,"'If you get a shoulder dislocation, your doctor will reposition your shoulder through a process called “reducing a shoulder.” If he performs this procedure manually, without opening your shoulder, it is known as a closed reduction of a shoulder dislocation.''Various methods may be used to achieve this goal. These include:''As per your condition and the doctor’s experience, your doctor will decide the most appropriate method of a shoulder reduction for you.''When a ligament, tendon, or nerve around your shoulder gets damaged during a shoulder dislocation, your surgeon may perform surgery to repair the torn or damaged structures and reduce the shoulder. This procedure is known as an open reduction of shoulder dislocation.' To reduce the dislocation, your doctor may give you medications to relieve your pain and relax your shoulder muscles throughout the procedure. Weights may be tied to your arms to extend the tightened muscles. Then the doctor will pull your humerus gently and carefully against these muscles until the humerus returns in its socket. Scapular manipulation Hennepin maneuver (external rotation) Traction-counter traction Stimson technique Milch technique Axillary traction Spaso technique"
What is done after the reduction of a shoulder dislocation?, An X-ray of your shoulder will be taken to confirm the success of the reduction procedure. You will rest your arm in a sling for one to four weeks. Your shoulder needs adequate rest for its healing. You can ice the sore area three to four times a day. You will need a physical therapy program to strengthen your arm muscles and restore the normal functioning of your shoulder. You will have regular follow-up with your doctor to know the stability of your shoulder and the necessary precautions.
How long does it take to recover from a dislocated shoulder?," How quickly you recover depends on how serious your shoulder injury is. A dislocated shoulder usually takes three to four months to heal completely after the procedure. You can usually resume most of your normal activities within two weeks. You should avoid heavy lifting and sports for six weeks to three months. If you have also got broken bones in your arm, you may have to wear your sling for up to six weeks, and recovery will take longer."
What is jackfruit?,"'Jackfruit is a spikey, green-colored fruit native to India and some parts of Southeast Asia. It contains rich yellow pods that have a ''fiber''-like texture when raw and they become sweeter and softer when ripe. Raw jackfruit is sought by vegans as a meat substitute for its fiber-like texture. For this reason, it is labeled as jackfruit meat. Both the pods and the seeds of jackfruit are edible. Roasted seeds have a nutty flavor and may be used in breads, hummus and other foods.''Although it is an exotic fruit, jackfruit is available in the US mainly in canned form. Canning is a process of cleaning, shelling and deseeding the fruit and packing it in airtight cans and heating them to pasteurize the contents. Canning increases the shelf life of a food item. Both ripe and unripe jackfruit pods may be available in canned forms.' "
What does jackfruit meat taste like?,"'Typical jackfruit meat consists of the unripe jackfruit pod. It is tasteless and it has a fibrous texture. You can cook it by boiling it, grilling it or including it in a curry dish. Jackfruit meat takes on the flavor of the spices that it is cooked with. Given its fibrous texture, unripe jackfruit is used in veggie patties, vegan burgers and vegan tortillas as a chicken substitute.''Ripe jackfruit tastes sweet. The overripe fruit has a strong fruity odor and a sweet, almost pungent, taste. The taste of jackfruit is described as the flavor of apples and bananas mixed together.''Jackfruit seeds may be boiled or roasted. Seeds have a milky taste. Roasted seeds taste nutty and can be used in breads or puddings or simply snacked on.' "
What are the health benefits of eating jackfruit?,"'A 3.5 ounce portion\xa0 of jackfruit contains only 94 calories. It is rich in ''vitamin C'', ''niacin'', riboflavin, vitamin B6 and ''folic acid''. It is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium as well. Ripe jackfruit is an excellent source of polyphenols like carotenoids, flavonoids, volatile acids sterols and tannins. Polyphenols are compounds with beneficial effects on ''blood pressure'', blood sugars, ''aging'' and blood vessels. Polyphenols offer protection against ''aging'' and they help maintain the health of the skin and eyes. They also have anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties.''Table 1. The Composition of a Typical Jackfruit' "
Can jackfruit consumption cause any harm?,"'Eating jackfruit in large quantities may cause unwanted fluctuation in blood ''sugar'' levels. The ''glycemic index'' of jackfruit (ability to raise post-consumption blood ''sugar'' levels) is 63, which is moderately high.''A few people have oral ''allergy'' syndrome (OAS), a form of ''food allergy'' to jackfruit. This is more common in people who have a history of ''pollen'' ''allergy''. Patients typically report ''itching'' and/or mild swelling of the mouth and throat immediately following ingestion of uncooked, canned, ripe or raw jackfruit.''Given that the fruit has a high amount of potassium, caution is advised in patients with advanced ''kidney disease''.'

What is lead poisoning?,"'Lead poisoning is caused by the accumulation of lead in the body. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Small children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can cause ''seizures'', unconsciousness and even death.''Lead circulates and reaches the brain, ''liver'', kidney and bones. It accumulates in the ''teeth'' and bones over time. During ''pregnancy'', if there’s a high lead content in the bones, the fetus may be affected.''Lead exposure at any level is harmful, which can be prevented.' "
What are the sources and routes of lead exposure?,"'People can be exposed to lead through environmental and occupational sources, which may include''People spending time in firing ranges are at an increased risk of exposure due to lead bullets.

What are the complications of lead poisoning in children?,'Children are four to five times more likely to absorb lead. They are at the highest risk of lead poisoning because it affects physical and mental development. Exposure to low levels of lead can cause damage over time in small children. The biggest damage it causes is irreversible damage to brain development. The warning signs in children include''In newborns' Developmental delay Learning difficulties Loss of appetite Irritability Weight loss Abdominal pain Vomiting Hearing loss Constipation Seizures Laziness and fatigue Eating things that aren’t edible Premature birth Significantly low birth weight Slow growth
How can you keep yourself and your family safe from lead?,'The following tips may help to prevent lead poisoning' Eat or drink in a lead-free area. Use wipes or lead-removal products to clean hands before eating food. Shower and change clothes immediately after working around lead-based products. Work in well-ventilated areas. Clean dusty surfaces to prevent the accumulation of lead particles.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of lip augmentation?,"'The advantages of lip augmentation include:''The disadvantages of lip augmentation include:' Lip injections done with fillers are temporary. While this might seem like a con, if an individual does not like the look of fuller lips, it will fade away over the course of several months. Hyaluronic acid-based fillers can also be dissolved with hyaluronidase injections to reverse a bad result or avert a potential complication. It gives the instant effect of an increased lip volume with any augmentation option. Lip augmentation isn’t limited to increasing the size of thin lips; it can also improve the lip structure and correct imbalances. All types of lip augmentations can be done under local anesthetic (or just a numbing cream, in the case of injectable fillers). Patients can be discharged home on the same day because the procedure lasts less than 30 or 45 minutes. Fillers can be done gradually, over a couple of appointments, to slowly build-up to the desired lip shape. The cost of temporary fillers can add up quickly, and patients may further need touch-up treatments every four months to maintain their results. Fat transfer to the lips isn’t as long-lasting as in other areas. At least 30-60% of the fat transferred to the face is permanent, but in the lips, it’s a little less because of all the movement. Silicone implants may look and feel unnatural if they’re too large. Any kind of lip augmentation procedure can trigger a cold-sore flare. If patients are prone to cold sores, doctors may need to recommend preventive meds in advance.  In a few scenarios, the doctor could overdo it looking like a trout pout, which may be ridiculous in appearance. In inexperienced hands, patients may end up with asymmetrical, unshapely lips or lumps and bumps. Other risks of lip augmentation include tissue loss from injecting into a blood vessel, infection, scarring, or severe swelling and bruising."
What is the outlook of a lip augmentation procedure?,"'As per research, the success rate of a lip augmentation procedure is usually 68-75%. Patients may also recover within a week without complications. However, the outlook and success rate of a lip augmentation procedure may depend on the below factors:' Age of patients The medical condition of patients Experience of the cosmetic surgeon/doctor Type of the procedure performed"
What is mediastinoscopy and FNA? ,"'When the cause of mediastinal lymphadenopathy is uncertain, the doctor may order a procedure known as\xa0mediastinoscopy\xa0with biopsy. The procedure is performed in a hospital under general anesthesia.''Fine needle aspiration (FNA):'' It is a less-invasive procedure in which a long needle is inserted through the chest ''cavity'' into the lymph node to extract cells for further diagnosis.' In this, a small surgical cut is made just above the sternum or breastbone. A fiber-optic instrument called a mediastinoscope is then inserted through the incision and passed into the mid-part of the chest to obtain a sample of one or several lymph nodes.  The results are usually ready within five to seven days."
What is the role of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in lymphoma?,"'Lymphomas'' are a type of ''cancer'' that begins in the white blood cells called lymphocytes (part of your immune system that protects from germs). ''Lymphoma'' is further divided into '""Hodgkin's lymphoma"""" (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy occurs in over 85% of people with HL, whereas it occurs in only 45% of people with NHL."" "
How is mediastinal lymphadenopathy treated?,"'Most ''enlarged lymph nodes'' are caused by an infectious process.' Doctors initially treat mediastinal lymphadenopathy with antibiotics. If malignancy is suspected due to symptoms such as persistent fevers or weight loss, a biopsy may be considered."
Why is a mediastinal lymphadenopathy biopsy performed?,'A mediastinal lymph node biopsy can help doctors to' Determine if lung cancer has metastasized. Structure an appropriate treatment plan. Diagnose certain conditions such as tuberculosis or other lung diseases.
Is a mediastinal lymphadenopathy biopsy safe?,"'Mediastinal lymph biopsies are often performed using non-invasive techniques, which pose fewer risks to the patient. However, any surgical procedure comes with at least minor risks. The risks associated with mediastinal lymph node biopsy include:''The benefits include:''Patients who experience no complications immediately after surgery are typically allowed to return home a few hours after the procedure. The doctor may give instructions on how to clean the site of the cut to prevent infection.' Puncture of certain organs and/or structures such as the esophagus, blood vessels, or trachea that can lead to bleeding Infection Pneumothorax (a collapsed lung) Anesthesia complications such as vomiting and dizziness A shorter hospital stay after surgery Smaller incisions compared with those in open surgical techniques Less postoperative pain Earlier return to daily activities compared with that in open surgical techniques"
What is patchouli oil?,"'The word patchouli is derived from an old Indian language, Tamil. The word means ‘green leaf.’ Patchouli oil is derived from the plant Pogostemon cablin that belongs to the mint family. The plant is native to tropical Asian countries, such as India, China, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The oil can be extracted from the leaves (both fresh and dried) and the stem of the Patchouli plant. Patchouli oil comes in the category of essential oils, which means during the process of harvesting this oil the chemicals that give the essence or distinct odor and flavor to the plant are retained. The main constituent of the patchouli oil is the substance called ‘patchoulol.’ Patchoulol is now also being manufactured synthetically in labs for commercial use.' "
What is patchouli oil used for?,"'Patchouli oil has been in use for thousands of years, but it gained tremendous popularity because of its use by the hippies in the 1960s and 1970s. The oil has been in use for treating several conditions ranging from ''headaches'', bellyaches, and ''scars''. There is, however, a lack of evidence for the use of patchouli oil for medical conditions. Still, many people use the oil for various purposes, such as:''There is a lack of scientific evidence for using patchouli oil for the treatment of medical conditions. It is, thus, advisable to not use the oil without consulting your healthcare provider. ''Pregnant'' or lactating women and people with underlying medical conditions must particularly refrain from using the oil without consulting their doctor.

Potassium plays an important role in the following body functions," Maintenance of salt and water balance in the body: The body is made 60% water. 40% of the water is present inside cells - intracellular fluid (ICF). The rest of the water is present outside the cells in extracellular space and between cells. This fluid is also called extracellular fluid (ECF). The balance between the fluid inside and outside the cells is necessary to maintain the cell shape. This is regulated by potassium and sodium. Potassium is the main electrolyte in the cells, sodium is the main electrolyte in the extra-cellular space. Imbalance in the electrolyte levels causes the cells to shrink or swell and burst. This can result in organ damage. Maintenance of the nervous system and muscles: The nervous system relays messages between your brain and body via the nerves. The function of nerves and muscles is dependent on potassium and calcium ions. In case of potassium deficiency, the nerves supplying the limbs may not function, causing paralysis like symptoms. Regulation of muscle contractions including the heart: The nervous system to controls the muscle contractions. Nerve signals are generated when the sodium enter the cells while the potassium exit the cells. Both low and high potassium levels can affect nerve signals creating irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that can be life threatening. The muscles of the gut are also affected when potassium levels are low, causing ballooning of the intestines."
Health benefits of potassium,'Consuming a potassium-rich ''diet'' is linked to many impressive health benefits.' Reduction of blood pressure: By eliminating excess sodium (excess sodium increases blood pressure) Reduced the risk of stroke Prevention of Osteoporosis: osteoporosis is a condition where the bone is porous and easily fractures due to low calcium levels. Potassium reduces the elimination of excess calcium in the body.  Prevention of Kidney Stones: potassium helps of lower calcium levels in the urine. Reduction of fluid Retention: Potassium can reduce fluid retention in the body by increasing urine production.

These include the severity of the disease, The structures in the abdomen and pelvis, the age of the patient, and the presence of any underlying conditions. The surgeon needs to explore these for proper treatment.''The surgery is typically done under general anesthesia (you ''sleep'' during the procedure). The surgery generally takes 1-2 hours to complete. You will have to stay in the hospital for a few days to prevent complications. There may be a urinary catheter for several days or weeks after the procedure.' An abdominal approach where the surgeon makes a cut on the abdomen (lower belly) for the procedure. The incision may be a vertical or horizontal bikini line incision. A vaginal approach that involves the removal of the uterus and other structures through the vagina A laparoscopic or minimally invasive approach involves very small incisions on the abdomen and the use of a laparoscope (a thin, flexible instrument with a camera and a light source)."
What does the conization of cervix mean?,"'The cervix is the mouth of the uterus that opens further into the vagina. Conization or cone biopsy of the cervix is a surgical procedure in which a small cone-shaped or cylindrical wedge of tissue is removed from the cervix (mouth of the uterus). It is regarded as an extensive form of ''cervical biopsy'' (a procedure in which a small piece of abnormal tissue is removed from the cervix and sent for lab examination). The removed tissue is sent for lab examination to check for signs of any disease. Conization may be done for the diagnosis of ''cancer of the cervix'' or to treat certain medical conditions involving the cervix. The wedge removed contains abnormal tissue along with a margin of healthy tissue. This suggests that most abnormal tissue is removed from the cervix.''The wedge of tissue may be removed using a scalpel (''cold'' knife conization), a laser knife or a thin wire loop heated by an electric current (''loop electrosurgical excision procedure'' or ''LEEP''). Cold knife conization gives the cleanest biopsy margins for further lab study. It is, however, associated with more bleeding than laser or LEEP. Cold knife conization usually requires general anesthesia. Laser conization generally takes longer. It can even ''burn'' the margins of the specimen, which may interfere with the lab examination. LEEP procedures are better as they are rapid, preserve the margins for lab evaluation and cause minimal bleeding. A LEEP procedure can be performed in the doctor’s office or other outpatient settings.' "
How is conization of the cervix performed?," A conization procedure, especially LEEP conization, is usually done in the doctor’s office or other outpatient settings. The patient can generally go home on the same day. The doctor will explain the risks associated with the procedure to the patient. They will take their detailed medical history, do a physical examination and order tests as needed.  The patient will be asked to take off their clothes below the waist and cover themselves with a drape. The patient lies on their back on the examination table with their feet raised and supported by footrests or stirrups (lithotomy position). The doctor administers anesthesia (general, regional or local). IV painkillers may be given to reduce pain. The doctor will then insert a lubricated tool called a speculum into the patient’s vagina to gently spread the vaginal walls and examine the cervix. A wedge of tissue (cone biopsy) is collected from the cervix and sent for lab examination. After completing the procedure, the patient is observed in the recovery room before they are allowed to go home. They may need some help to go back home."
What are the risks of conization of the cervix?,"'The risks associated with the conization procedure are''Apart from the risks for the patient, laser conization may cause certain risks for the health provider as well. Laser conization and LEEP generate smoke, which may be dangerous for the operator to inhale. This is because the smoke may contain ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'') particles. The use of smoke evacuators is essential and wearing a mask during the procedure is recommended.'

What is methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)?,"""The term MTHFR stands for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. MTHFR is an enzyme that breaks down the amino acids' ""'homocysteine'' and folate. Homocysteine is an amino acid that works to maintain the body’s cells. Folate is one of the B-''vitamins'' needed to make red and white blood cells in the bone marrow. Folate also converts carbohydrates into energy and produces DNA and RNA. Each plays an important role in the body’s daily functions and both are important.' "
What does the MTHFR gene mutation cause?,"'There are two common MTHFR mutations, known as C677T and A1298C. Having one copy of C677T or one copy of A1298C is not associated with health risks. Likewise, having two copies of A1298C is not associated with significant health risks. However, people with two copies of the C677T mutation, as well as people who have one copy of both the mutations, have increased health risks.\xa0''Once genetically mutated, MTHFR may not be able to function normally. In turn, homocysteine levels and folate levels may be elevated or unbalanced, disturbing the body functions.' "

What is the spleen?,'The spleen is an oval-shaped organ that sits under the rib cage on the left-hand side of the body. It is the size of a human fist. The function of spleen is to make new ''red blood cells'' and destroy old cells. It plays an important role- in the body’s defense against infection. The spleen contains two main regions of tissue called white pulp and red pulp.' Red pulp: Contains cavities filled with blood and tissues containing red blood cells and white blood cells. White pulp: This mostly consists of white blood cells (T cells and B cells) that have a role in immunity.
What does the spleen do?  ,"'The role of spleen in the body includes' Blood filter: The spleen's main function is to act as a filter for the blood. It recognizes and removes old, malformed or damaged red blood cells. When blood flows into the spleen, it performs ""quality control""; blood cells may need to pass through a maze of narrow passages. Healthy blood cells simply pass through the spleen and continue to circulate throughout the bloodstream. Blood cells that can't pass the test will be broken down in the spleen by special cells called macrophages. Defence system: The spleen also plays an important part in the body’s immune system. It can recognize and destroy specific bacteria (Hemophilus, Nisseria) that have a capsule. Economical function: The spleen recycles the useful components like iron from the old cells. It stores iron in the form of ferritin or bilirubin, and eventually returns the iron to the bone marrow, where hemoglobin is made. Hemoglobin is an important protein in the blood that transports oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Reserve system: The spleen is a backup for storing blood. The blood vessels in the spleen are able to get wider or narrower, depending on the body's needs. When vessels are expanded, the spleen can actually hold up to a cup of reserve blood. If for any reason the body needs some extra blood (during severe injury), the spleen may respond by releasing that reserve blood back into the system. Production: The spleen also produces compounds called opsonins that help with immune function. Help during development: Before the birth of a baby, the spleen works to produce the baby's red blood cells. It gradually stops this before the birth and the bone marrow takes over."
Can a person live without a spleen?,"'Yes, it is possible to live without a spleen. However, its absence may make a person susceptible to serious infections.\xa0''One of the functions of the spleen is to fight off certain bacteria like\xa0''Streptococcus''\xa0pneumoniae,'' ''Neisseria meningitidis ''and ''Hemophilus influenzae''. Removal of the spleen lowers a person’s resistance to these infections. Ideally, people must be vaccinated against these bacteria about two weeks before a planned operation or up to two weeks after emergency spleen removal. The doctor may recommend other\xa0''vaccines'' as well.' "
What happens if the spleen is removed?,"'Usually when the spleen is removed, other organs such the ''liver'' can take up most of the functions of the spleen (like destruction of old blood cells). The spleen plays an important role in the protection from certain bacteria. Overwhelming post-splenectomy infections (OPSI) is the term for serious infections that may arise after spleen removal. Children\xa0 under the age of five and those who have had their spleen removed in the past two years are at a highest risk for developing these infections.''Children whose spleen has been removed often need to take antibiotics every day to prevent these infections. Adults usually do not need daily antibiotics unless they become sick or there is a chance that they could become sick. People who have had their spleen removed should carry antibiotics with them in case they plan on traveling out of the country. They should start taking antibiotics as soon as they feel sick. People who have had their spleen removed should ask their doctor about getting required ''vaccinations'' and ''flu'' shots.' "
What is rapid sequence intubation (RSI)?,'Rapid sequence ''intubation'' (RSI) is the administration of a strong anesthetic agent followed by a rapidly acting paralytic agent (all within one minute) to make the patient unconscious. It is performed when the patient may not be fasting and is therefore at a high risk of aspiration (entry of gastric contents into the airways).\xa0''The goal of the technique is intubation without difficulty. Maintaining oxygenation throughout the process is mandatory.' 
When is rapid sequence intubation necessary?,"'Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the fastest and most effective means of controlling the emergency ''airway''. RSI is particularly useful in life-threatening situations or illnesses requiring immediate airway control. Below are common conditions in which the RSI technique is used:\xa0' Patients who have difficulty maintaining the airway due to upper airway swelling, infection, life-threatening injury, or anaphylaxis (allergy that causes breathing problems) Patients who have decreased consciousness Patients who have loss of airway reflexes and are at risk of aspirating gastric contents Patients who need intubation but are difficult to intubate due to weakness and severe respiratory diseases such as asthma or lung diseases Patients whose breathing mechanism is malfunctioned (air or fluid in the lungs, respiratory distress situations, or cyanide poisoning) Patients who have deteriorated medical conditions (such as uncooperative patients, patients with a stab wound to the neck with severe bleeding, patients who are in shock, patients with fracture of the spine, etc.)"
How is rapid sequence intubation performed?,"'Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is usually performed in critical conditions. Below are common steps:' During RSI, the patient may be positioned appropriately depending on their condition for pre-oxygenation and intubation. Usually, the supine position is adopted (lying face upwards).  Preoxygenation is done (100% oxygen is administered via a mask for three minutes). Preoxygenation is immediately followed by the anesthesia-inducing drug and paralytic drug. Once the drugs take effect, the patient is immediately intubated. Proper intubation is confirmed by the ET-CO2 monitor. Chest X-ray is often obtained when prolonged intubation is anticipated (for example, in the intensive care unit following an intubation for head injury). Ongoing sedation may be provided, and if required, a long-acting muscle relaxant may be administered."
What drugs are used in rapid sequence intubation?,"'Drugs used in rapid sequence intubation (RSI) are as follows:''Potent anesthetic agents include the following:\xa0''Muscle relaxants or paralytic agents include the following:\xa0''In patients who are under shock, no adjuncts may be required. However, in systemically well patients or patients at a risk of severe ''hypertension'' during induction, pharmacological adjuncts are used.' Potent anesthetic agent Muscle relaxants or paralytic agents Pharmacological adjuncts Propofol: It is used for patients who have unstable vital signs. Ketamine: It is used in prehospital settings and in unstable patients. Etomidate: It is used to suppress adrenaline effects on patients.  Thiopentone: It has the most rapid onset of action. Midazolam: It is most suitable in patients who are already having decreased consciousness. Suxamethonium (succinylcholine): It is the most common muscle relaxant used in RSI. Rocuronium: It takes effect within 45-60 seconds.  Pharmacological adjuncts include the following: Fentanyl Alfentanil Remifentanil Lidocaine (lignocaine)"
What is hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism is a condition where low levels of thyroid hormones affect various body parts. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped endocrine gland (a gland that secretes a substance called a hormone into the bloodstream). It is normally located in the front of the neck. It produces the thyroid hormones, which are released into the blood and then carried to various tissues in the body. Thyroid hormones are needed for the body to use energy, maintain body temperature, and keep the brain, heart, muscles, and other organs working properly. Hypothyroidism is a medical condition in which the thyroid gland becomes underactive. The gland is not able to make enough ''thyroid hormone'' to keep the body functioning normally. Lab investigations show that people with hypothyroidism have ''low thyroid hormone'' levels in their blood. Some of the common causes of this condition are autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto’s ''thyroiditis'', viral infection of the thyroid gland, surgical removal of the thyroid, and ''radiation'' treatment. Hypothyroidism is a common condition affecting around 4.6% of the US population aged 12 years and older.\xa0' "
Does menopause put you at a risk of hypothyroidism?,"'Women are more likely to get hypothyroidism after ''menopause'' than earlier in life. Hypothyroidism is a common condition affecting around 4.6% of the US population aged 12 years and older. It is particularly common in women aged above 60 years. Hypothyroidism, however, can affect people of all genders, ages, and ethnic backgrounds.\xa0' "
Where is the frontal lobe?,"'The brain is made up of four types of lobes: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. Each lobe serves different functions.''The frontal lobe is the largest lobe of the brain. It extends from the front of the brain to almost halfway toward the back of the brain.' "
What is the function of the frontal lobe?,"'The frontal lobe in conjunction with the other lobes of the brain plays a vital role in controlling inhibitions. The important functions of the frontal lobe include:''Social and emotional reactions:''Cognitive skills:''The frontal lobe also plays a role in linguistic, artistic, and creative skills.'""The back of the frontal lobe controls the body's voluntary physical movements. The left side controls movements of the right side of the body, while the right motor strip controls movements of the left side of the body."" Decision-making Self-control Emotional regulation Maintaining concentration and alertness High-level thinking Problem-solving Planning Judgment Conversation"
What happens when the frontal lobe is damaged?,"'Since the frontal lobe is involved in executing a variety of functions, a multitude of symptoms can occur if it gets damaged. These symptoms may include one or more of the following:' Changes in personality Impairment of problem-solving skills Difficulty in planning things Decreased ability to retain information Impaired judgment Inappropriate behavior Decline in creativity Depression Noticeable changes in behavior Lack of motivation Inability to maintain focus (or low attention span) Impulsive behavior Hemiparesis/hemiplegia (weakness on one side of the body) A tendency to fall (or difficulty in maintaining balance) Decreased sensations of taste or smell"
What causes damage to the frontal lobe?,'Factors that cause damage to the frontal lobe include:' Head injury (that impacts the frontal lobe) Infection of the frontal lobe or abscess in the area Tumors in the frontal lobe Stroke Parkinson’s disease Alzheimer’s disease Huntington disease Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis HIV Dementia
How is frontal lobe damage diagnosed?,"'Doctors use computed tomography (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scans of the brain to confirm the diagnosis of frontal lobe damage. They look for specific features, such as infection, ''tumor'', shrinking of the brain (brain atrophy), or any associated degenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease.''A complete neurological examination is also performed that involves testing motor skills, language and speech skills, social behavior, impulse control, memory, and problem-solving skills.' "
What is the treatment of frontal lobe damage?,'Medical treatment depends entirely on the type and cause of frontal lobe damage. The prescribed medications can be used to treat the infection or ''stroke'' and surgery to remove the tumor. Medicines are also available to control the specific symptoms of frontal lobe damage.''Physical and occupational therapy is frequently needed if there is the involvement of motor skill impairment (as in ''paralysis'').''Speech therapy may also help patients manage symptoms associated with speaking.' 
What exactly does a psychotherapist do?,"'A psychotherapist ''or therapist\xa0is a trained professional who assists people with various ''mental health'' conditions such as ''stress'', ''depression'', ''anxiety'', ''insomnia'', ''addiction'', ''bipolar disorder'', negative behavior patterns, ''bipolar disorder'', ''schizophrenia'' and other debilitating feelings. ''Psychotherapy'' ''is also called talk therapy and can help treat challenges and symptoms associated with mental health and emotional conditions by helping\xa0a person understand their repressed feelings, hence equipping them to face new challenges both in the present and future. Psychotherapists are nonjudgmental and compassionate. They are specifically trained to carefully listen and analyze the psychological needs of their patients and help them accordingly.''Psychotherapy is\xa0similar to counselling and the two can overlap. Psychotherapy is deeper and addresses the underlying causes of the problems, as well as helps the person solve them. There are different licenses held by professionals who practice psychotherapy, including social workers, licensed professional counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists and mental health nurse practitioners. Although each of them may have different approaches in treating psychological difficulties, many mental health conditions may involve a team of various mental health professionals. This is especially true for more serious conditions such as addiction, ''schizophrenia'', ''bipolar disorder'' and major depressive disorder with ''suicidal'' tendencies. In many cases, based on the mental health condition, patients require psychotherapy and medication. Healthy lifestyle improvements, such as regular ''exercise'', adequate rest and other specific activities recommended by the psychotherapist also play an important role in the recovery process and overall well-being.''In general, psychotherapists act as a guide toward helping their patients understand their condition and feelings, cope with daily life and manage their mental health to be able to function normally. This includes maintaining relationships and performing adequately at work or school, thus improving their quality of life. The time taken for patients to feel better varies based on their primary diagnosis, their support system and the patients themselves. Some patients feel better after a few sessions, whereas some may need years or lifelong sessions of psychotherapy to manage their mental health. To see positive results, patients ultimately need to understand they have a problem, recognize the need for change and follow the treatment plan advised by the specialist. About 75% of people who have undergone psychotherapy have been shown to benefit from it.''Psychotherapy and medication: In many cases, based on the mental health condition, patients require psychotherapy and medication. For many mental health disorders, medication has proven to be more useful than psychotherapy. In other cases, patients benefit more from a combination of medication and psychotherapy than from either one alone.' "
How are psychotherapy sessions conducted?,"'Psychotherapy may be conducted for an individual, a family, a couple or in a group setting for both children and adults. The number of sessions, frequency and duration of sessions are determined by the psychotherapist based on patients’ conditions and their progress. Sessions may be once a week or several times a week. It may be short-term (a few sessions) to deal with immediate issues or long-term (months to years) to deal with longstanding and complex issues.\xa0' "
What are the types of psychotherapy?,"'There are several different types of psychotherapy. The psychotherapist would advise the appropriate therapy or a combination of various therapies for an individual based on their condition. Psychotherapy may be used in combination with medication and/or other therapies.' Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps people identify and change thinking traps (thinking and behavior patterns that could be harmful and/or ineffective), replacing them with beneficial thoughts and functional behaviors. It can help a person understand their current problems and how to solve them by learning and practicing and new skills. CBT may be used in various disorders, such as stress, anxiety, insomnia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and eating disorders. Dialectical behavior therapy: This is a type of CBT that helps regulate emotions. It is usually used to treat people with long-term suicidal thoughts and those with borderline personality disorder, eating disorders or PTSD. Patients are taught new skills to help take responsibility and change unhealthy or disruptive behavior patterns. It usually involves both individual and group therapy. Interpersonal therapy (IPT): IPT is a short-term treatment. It helps patients understand their underlying interpersonal issues such as unresolved grief, changes in social life or work and relationship conflicts that could be troublesome. It can help people develop healthy ways to express emotions, improve communication and solve conflicts. Psychodynamic therapy: This therapy is based on the concept that behavior and mental health is influenced by past childhood experiences and inappropriate repetitive thoughts or feelings that the patient is not conscious of. Patients are helped by addressing these issues, improving self-awareness and changing old patterns. Psychoanalysis: This is a more intensive type of psychodynamic therapy. Sessions are typically conducted at more frequent intervals than other therapies (three or more sessions a week). Supportive therapy: The psychotherapist guides and encourages patients to develop their own resources by helping them improve self-esteem, reduce anxiety, improve coping mechanisms and improve social and community functioning. Supportive psychotherapy helps patients deal with underlying issues associated with their mental health conditions that would help them manage their mental health on their own for the rest of their lives."
Who is an optometrist?,'An optometrist is a health professional who does primary health care for the eye. Optometrists examine the eyes to diagnose any problems in vision and prescribe corrective lenses for them. Optometrists have done a four-year professional program after college to get a Doctor of Optometry degree. They may also get additional clinical training or a specialty fellowship after the optometry degree.\xa0' 
What are the various kinds of eye doctors?,'Healthcare professionals who specialize in ''eye care'' are mainly divided into three categories:' Ophthalmologist Optometrist Optician
What functions does an optometrist have?,"'Optometrists have several roles related to the primary care of the eye. These include:' Performing eye examination and vision tests. Treating conditions such as: nearsightednessfarsightednessastigmatism (an eye defect in which there is a distorted curving of the eyeball or lens) nearsightedness farsightedness astigmatism (an eye defect in which there is a distorted curving of the eyeball or lens) Prescribing and fitting eyeglasses and contact lenses. Providing low-vision aids and vision therapy. Detecting diseases, injuries and disorders of the eyes."
What training and functions does an ophthalmologist have?,"'An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor specialized in the medical and surgical care of the eyes. Ophthalmologists have completed medical school and subsequently do an internship for a year and residency for three years. They may sometimes additionally do a one- to two-year fellowship.\xa0''Ophthalmologists offer a spectrum of eye health services which include:' Vision services, including eye exams. Medical eye care for conditions like glaucoma, and chemical burns. Surgical eye care for trauma, crossed eyes, cataracts, glaucoma, and other problems. Diagnosis and treatment of eye conditions associated with other diseases, including cancers of the eye, diabetes or arthritis. Plastic surgery to raise droopy eyelids or smooth out wrinkles."
What functions does an optician have?,"'Opticians are not eye doctors and they cannot examine the eyes. Qualifications include a one to two-year degree, certificate, or diploma. Their roles include:' Checking lens prescriptions. Filling prescriptions given by an eye doctor. Providing, adjusting, and repairing glasses, frames, and contact lenses. Taking measurements of the face to fit corrective lenses. Helping decide which type of lenses and frames will work best, functionally and aesthetically. Ordering and checking products, including contacts and eyeglass lenses."
Should I visit an optometrist or an ophthalmologist?,"'If you want to get a routine checkup of your eyes,\xa0you can see either an optometrist or ophthalmologist.''If you believe you have an eye problem like ''cataract'' or\xa0glaucoma, or a health condition like\xa0''diabetes'' that may compromise your vision, an ophthalmologist may be best. Ophthalmologists have advanced medical training that qualifies them to evaluate and treat these conditions.' "
How often should I get my eye examination done?,"'We all can benefit by eye examination on a routine basis. If you don’t have any diagnosed vision problems and don’t notice any symptoms, follow the general rules below:''Apart from routine visits, you need to go to the eye doctor in the following situations:' Young adults: Once in your 20s and twice in your 30s. Adults: At age 40 with regular follow-ups, depending on your health. Adults 65 and above: Every one to two years. Children: At birth, six months, three years, and before entering grade school. Schools may also perform routine eye exams. Presence of health conditions or a family history of vision problems. Any change in vision. Eye pain. Eye irritation such as redness and itching. Presence of other diseases, such as diabetes."
What exactly is a tumor?,"'A ''tumor'' is an abnormal growth of cells, which serves no purpose in the body. A tumor develops when cells divide too quickly and without control. Tumors can vary in size, from a tiny swelling to a large lump. Tumors can appear almost anywhere in the body.' "
What are the different types of tumors?,"'There are three types of tumors, but it is not always clear how a tumor will develop in the future. Some non-cancerous tumors can become cancerous. So, it is best to monitor any abnormal growths.''Three different types of tumors are:''Benign tumors''Premalignant'' tumors''Malignant'' tumors' These are not cancerous. They cannot spread or grow, or they do so very slowly. If removed, they do not usually return. In these tumors, the cells are not yet cancerous, but they have the potential to become cancerous. If removed, they may or may not return. Malignant tumors are cancerous. They are parasitic to the body and gradually compete with healthy cells for nutrition and blood supply. The cells can grow and spread to other parts of the body. These types are very dangerous as they may return after surgery."
What are the risk factors for developing a tumor?,"'The risk factors for developing a tumor usually depend on the location of the tumor.''Below are few common risk factors of developing tumors:' Genetics: Genes are the strongest risk factor for developing a tumor. Various gene mutations (TP53) are implicated in tumor formation. Family history: Close family history is a common risk factor for developing a tumor. Lifestyle: Smoking, consuming alcohol, consuming a high amount of red meat, being overweight, and having limited physical activity, are the most common risk factors for developing tumors. Age: Most tumors are associated with aging; the ability of cells to prevent and recover from defects weakens with age. Exposure to radiation is considered one of the most harmful risk factors for developing a tumor. Gender: Men are at more risk of developing tumors than women because of lifestyle risk factors. Reproduction and hormones: Late reproductive age, late and early menopause, hormonal therapy, and prolonged use of birth control pills, are a few risk factors for developing breast tumors in women. Cosmetics: Intentional and unintentional exposure to chemicals in cosmetics like deodorants, powders and hair dyes increases the risk of developing tumors. Infection: Some viral and bacterial infections increase the risk of cancer (e.g. Hepatitis B and HPV). The most studied virus family that causes cancer are papilloma viruses (the human papilloma virus, also known as HPV), implicated in cervical cancer; these viruses may also cause other cancers, such as pharyngeal cancer. The bacteria Helicobacter pylori increases the risk of gastric cancer. Severe liver infections (hepatitis B and C virus infections) are associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.  Work related and environmental exposure: Depending on the type of occupation and location of work an individual may develop cancer."
Can a tumor kill you?,"'Most benign and few premalignant tumors do not kill a person. Large, non-cancerous tumors may cause pressure on surrounding skins and can cause ''pain'' or numbness. Cancerous tumors however have a high death rate depending on the age when the diagnosis was confirmed. Highly cancerous tumors\xa0may eventually cause death. Usually, the survival rate of cancerous tumors depends on the tumor’s location. For example, ''brain tumors''\xa0can\xa0spread (high grade) and come back despite treatment. Usually, the survival rate of the patient depends on how\xa0an individual\xa0responds to treatment.' "
How do you prevent a tumor from growing?,"'Early detection of a lump or tumor is important to determine what will be the treatment.\xa0 Visit your health professional immediately to exam what is the lump or tumor type and determine the treatment plan to prevent from the risks and complications.''Prevention'' tips to reduce the chances of getting a tumor:' Quit smoking and don’t consume alcohol. Eat a healthy diet, like fruits and leafy vegetables. Maintain a healthy weight and being physically active. Reduce exposure to sun. Getting vaccinated from infection causes virus and bacteria development, and has potential to cause cancers in the body. Practicing safe sex. Staying away from recreational drugs. Getting regular medical check-ups."
What is Obamacare?,"'Obamacare'' is the'' Patient Protection and ''Affordable Care Act'' (''ACA'') ''implemented by the ex-president, Barack Obama, in 2010. The goal was to reform healthcare in the United States and the way healthcare is being delivered. Before the ACA/Obamacare, insurance companies would have several terms and conditions like excluding people with pre-existing diseases. Because of this, people with chronic, pre-existing diseases had really high health expenses. They would have to go without health insurance or settle for a policy that did not cover a pre-existing disease. This put a lot of the financial burden on the patient because patients could not afford regular doctor visits, tests and treatments. Due to this, patients often required emergency medical care. The ACA/Obamacare implemented some rules for the insurance companies to follow. Insurance companies could no longer turn down patients based on pre-existing diseases, such as ''diabetes''. This significantly reduced healthcare expenses for the patients. Obamacare allows people with pre-existing conditions to have health insurance and cover the costs for these conditions. This helps people to afford preventive care, reduces hospital visits and slows the increase in healthcare costs.' "
How does Obamacare work?,"'The main goal was to slow the rapidly increasing cost of healthcare by making health insurance more available and affordable to those who need it the most. The act also says that everyone is required to have health insurance for at least 9 out of 12 months in a year or they face a tax penalty. Obamacare also helps those who cannot afford to buy a health insurance plan.''There are several different insurance plans and the terms and conditions of these plans vary. The insurance plans are divided into four ""metal tiers,"" starting from bronze to platinum. Each category varies in price and the cost-sharing percentages (the amount covered by the insurance and the amount paid by the patient). Bronze plans are the cheapest and cover 60 percent of the medical costs whereas platinum plans are the most expensive and cover 90 percent of the medical costs.''Obamacare also aims to make health insurance more affordable by subsidizing the cost for lower-income groups below the federal poverty level. Medicaid was\xa0extended to those who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Although,\xa0as of 2020, 14 states have chosen not to expand Medicaid, limiting accessibility for their residents. The 14 states are' Georgia Kansas Alabama Florida Mississippi Missouri Texas Wisconsin Oklahoma South Carolina North Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Wyoming"
Essential services covered in Obamacare,"'Under the ACA, insurance plans are required to allow parents to include their children in their insurance plans up to age 26. The following essential services must be provided' Preventive and wellness visits Ambulatory patient serviced Chronic disease management Pregnancy and maternity care Newborn care Pediatric (child) care Mental and behavioral health care Services and devices to treat injuries, disabilities or chronic conditions Laboratory tests Prescription medication Outpatient care (clinic visits) Emergency room services Hospitalization"
What exactly is Tourette's syndrome?,"'Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is a lifelong neurological disorder that starts more commonly during childhood between five and 10 years of age. Unlike degenerative diseases, people with TS live a ''longer life''. They display normal intelligence.''People affected with TS display rapid, repetitive movements and words together known as ''tics'' over which they have no control. Typically, TS tics are triggered by ''stress'' and relaxation relieves them for a while. They are misunderstood as signs of nervousness.\xa0''The exact cause of TS is not known, but research points to the possibility of a combination of genetic (transmitted from parents to their offspring) and external (environmental) factors in the development of TS.' "
What types of tics are seen in Tourette’s syndrome?,"'Based on the nature (simple or complex) of the actions, tics in Tourette’s syndrome (TS) are of two types.''Simple tics'': ''These involve a limited number of muscle groups and can be motor or vocal. Examples are''Complex tics'':'' These involve complex, coordinated movements of several muscle groups. These can also be motor or vocal. Examples include''People with TS may have several combinations of the above symptoms. They may have tics that are restricted to one part of the body or those that cover all regions of the body.''The symptoms of TS may not be consistent throughout the day or over months. They may intensify and decrease suddenly throughout the day or within a span of three to four months. They may become worse as the child steps into adulthood.' Eye blinking Head twisting Facial movements Shoulder shrugging Nose twitching Throat clearing Grunting Sniffing Tongue clicking Jumping Twirling about Jerking of upper or lower limbs Foot stomping Pulling at clothing Hitting or biting oneself Uttering inappropriate words Repeating one’s or other people’s words"
How do doctors diagnose Tourette’s syndrome?,"'Doctors do not rely on any tests such as blood tests or imaging studies such as ''X-rays'', computed tomography scan or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' to diagnose Tourette’s syndrome (TS). Only the history, nature and duration of tics (minimum one year) is necessary to arrive at the diagnosis of TS.''Diagnostic criteria for TS (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, 307.23) are as follows' Both multiple limbs and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time during the illness, though not necessarily together. The tics occur many times a day (usually in bouts) nearly every day or in breaks throughout a period of more than a year. In this period, there was never a tic-free period of more than three consecutive months. The onset is before the age of 18 years old. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., caffeine) or a general medical condition (e.g., Huntington disease or postviral encephalitis)."
What are the other health concerns in Tourette’s syndrome?,"'People with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) may suffer from additional behavioral disorders that include''Obsessive-compulsive disorder'': ''This is a behavioral condition in which there is a constant urge to repeat things unnecessarily. Examples include frequent, unnecessary hand washing and checking the stove repeatedly to see if it has been turned off.\xa0''Attention deficit'' and/or ''hyperactivity'' disorder: ''This disorder is characterized by the inability to concentrate on the task at hand leading to poor performances in school or work. The affected people may suffer from additional problems such as ''depression'', ''anxiety'', ''social phobia'', ''sleeping problems'', inability to read and write (''dyslexia'') and aggressive behavior.' "
How is Tourette’s syndrome treated?,"'Treatment with ''drugs'' is only indicated if the symptoms cause severe distress. Supportive treatments (behavioral therapy) can help affected people to manage their day-to-day problems. These are safe and show long-lasting effects. The majority of people with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) require no treatment for tic suppression unless the symptoms interfere with functioning. ''Chlorpromazine'', ''haloperidol'', ''fluphenazine'', ''pimozide'', ''risperidone'', ''olanzapine'' and ''ziprasidone'' have shown to reduce tics by 50 to 80 percent, but people may need to discontinue them due to severe adverse effects.''Habit reversal therapy is a good approach to manage symptoms. It is comprised of\xa0 behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques and monitoring.' "
What foods are bad for urinary retention?,"'Urinary retention'' is a condition in which you cannot empty your bladder completely. While no direct connection exists between ''diet'' and ''urinary retention'', certain foods may aggravate urinary retention' Acidic and spicy foods: A few people complain of bladder issues with acidic and spicy foods. Acidic foods include citrus fruits and their juices, pineapple, vinegar, tomatoes and tomato products. Spicy foods include hot peppers, curry, chili sauce and powder, etc. Cuisines like Mexican, Thai and Indian are usually spicy. Artificial sweeteners: Some people feel discomfort and pressure in the lower abdominal area when they consume artificial sweeteners, such as Saccharin, Aspartame, and Acesulfame K. Constipation: Constipation may cause urinary retention. Processed foods, such as white bread, sweets, hot dogs, french fries and fast food, may cause constipation. Skipping meals may also increase the risk of constipation and one should avoid missing meals when they have urinary retention. Caffeinated foods and drinks: As a diuretic, caffeine may aggravate symptoms associated with urinary retention, such as urgency. Caffeine is present in a variety of different foods and beverages, including chocolate, coffee and tea. An individual may need to limit caffeine intake to avoid urinary retention."
What foods should be eaten to keep the bladder healthy?,"'An individual with a sensitive bladder may need to keep a diary of foods that may trigger urinary problems and foods that can keep their bladder healthy. Below are a few common food options for patients with a sensitive bladder' Bananas: Bananas are great as snacks and may also be used as toppings for cereals or in smoothies. Potatoes: Any type of potatoes are good for bladder health. Nuts: Almonds, cashews and peanuts are bladder friendly. They are also healthy snacks and rich in protein. Eggs: These are rich in protein and are considered a common beneficial food for many bladder conditions. Whole grains: Quinoa, rice and oats are just a few examples of whole grains. They come in many varieties and are generally good for health. Green beans: Green beans are healthy for people with a sensitive bladder. Winter squash: These include acorn, butternut and spaghetti squash. They may be added to the bladder diet. Lean proteins: Low-fat beef, pork, chicken, turkey and fish can be eaten, especially when baked, steamed or broiled. They are unlikely to bother the bladder. Pears: Pears are a good source of fiber and they are bladder friendly. Coconut water: Packed with electrolytes, coconut water is a well-known remedy for many problems affecting the urinary tract. It also has mild diuretic properties, promoting urinary output. Pineapple juice: 100% pure pineapple juice has similar qualities to coconut water and can be a great alternative. Carrot juice: When consumed regularly, carrot juice can help control urinary retention. Besides being healthy for you, it can also help relieve the burning sensation felt each time you empty your bladder."
What are the common symptoms of urinary retention?,"'Symptoms of chronic urinary retention are' The bladder does not empty completely Difficulty initiating urination Slow, weak or interrupted urinary stream Having to urinate multiple times to empty the bladder Dribbling of urine after completion of urination Urinary urgency or frequency Leakage of urine Recurrent urinary tract infections"
Should I be worried about urinary retention?,"'Urinary retention affects people of all ages and occurs in both sexes. However, it is most common in older men who have an ''enlarged prostate'' gland. It develops slowly over time. You may not notice it until you are unable to urinate. This causes swelling and discomfort in your bladder. It is a condition that is diagnosed in millions of adults due to various causes, but it doesn’t have to control your life. If you’re struggling from one or more of the symptoms of urinary retention, you may need to visit a ''urologist''. Diagnosis is important in case of urinary retention as treatment starts with identifying an underlying medical cause.' "
How do you permanently treat gout?,"'Gout'' is a life-long disease that needs constant monitoring and ''diet'' modifications. The disease is managed by a combination of medications and lifestyle changes to prevent the flares and minimize the complications. To manage ''gout'', your doctor may recommend the following:''Medical treatment:''Self-management:' Management of flare-ups: the pain of a flare-up may be managed by taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, steroids, and the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine. Preventing future gout flares: To manage symptoms and prevent future flares you need to make healthy changes in your diet and lifestyle. These include maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, eating less purine-rich food such as red meat or organ meat, and including more non-sugary fluids, fruits and vegetables in your diet. If you are taking certain medications such as diuretics, your doctor may ask you to change to other alternatives. Prevent complications such as tophi and kidney stones: Tophi are hard deposits of uric acid under the skin. Stones and tophi may form because of long term high levels of uric acid. As a preventive measure for kidney stones and tophi, doctors may prescribe preventive therapy to lower uric acid levels in the blood. This includes medicines like allopurinol, febuxostat and pegloticase. Eat a healthy diet: Include plenty of fluids, fresh fruits and vegetables. Cut down on foods that may cause a gout flare. Foods high in purines (like red meat, organ meat and seafood) are to be avoided. Limit your alcohol intake, especially beer and hard liquor. Get educated with self-management skills: Self-management education classes help people with arthritis and other chronic conditions, including gout, understand how the disease affects their lives and what all they can do to improve the quality of life and live productively.  Stay physically active: Regular exercise helps control the physical and emotional aspects of the disease. Exercise also helps to reduce the risk of other conditions such as heart diseases and diabetes. According to the experts, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity.  Go for regular follow up with your doctor: Regular check-ups and following recommended treatment plan are crucial in controlling gout. Lose weight: You must lose weight if you are overweight or obese. Maintaining a healthy weight helps relieve gout symptoms and slows the disease progression.  Take care of your joints: Protect your joints from injuries during physical activities and avoid over-exertion during exercise. "
Foods to avoid with gout,"'People with gout can have a moderate intake of lean meats such as chicken and turkey. They must, however, avoid organ meats such as ''liver'' and kidney as they have higher levels of purines, which can cause gout flares. They should also avoid seafood such as shrimp, mussels, anchovies, sardines and lobster as it tends to contain a higher amount of purines.''Other foods to be avoided in gout include:' Beer and grain liquors such as vodka and whiskey Red meat including lamb and pork Food products containing a high amount of fructose (a type of sugar) such as soda and some juices, cereal, ice cream, candy and junk food"
Which foods may protect us from cancers?,"'Including more of vegetables and fruits in the ''diet'' can protect us from cancer:' Vegetables: Raw vegetables or salads such as tomatoes, leafy green vegetables, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels, and sprouts. Diet: A diet is considered healthy if an individual is consuming foods high in dietary fiber, such as grains and cereals. Fruits: Citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and limes are considered good for health and have cancer-fighting ability. "
What foods should you avoid if you have G6PD deficiency?,"'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (G6PDD) is a genetic (hereditary) disorder. Therefore, you cannot prevent it. However, you can prevent the more serious G6PDD symptoms by avoiding certain foods.''You should be cautious about the consumption of food colored with a reddish orange agent (1-phenylazo-2-naphthol-6-sulphonic acid), which is even banned in many countries.''You should also avoid certain ''drugs'' that may trigger G6PDD, including\xa0' Consumption of fava beans Consumption of food cross-contaminated with fava beans  Aniline dyes Any antimalarial medication such as Aralen (Chloroquine) Use of naphthalene (mothballs) High doses of aspirin  Any quinidine drug such as amitriptyline Any sulfa drugs such as Dapsone, Lasix (furosemide), Sulamyd (sulfacetamide), Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole) and sulfanilamide Antibiotics such asAny quinolones such as Cipro (ciprofloxacin) and Levaquin (levofloxacin)Any nitrofurans such as Furadantin (nitrofurantoin) Any quinolones such as Cipro (ciprofloxacin) and Levaquin (levofloxacin) Any nitrofurans such as Furadantin (nitrofurantoin) Other products such asAcetylphenylhydrazineBeta-NaphtholChloramphenicolDimercaprolDiabeta (Glyburide)HennaMentholMethylene Blue (a dye)PenicillaminePhenazopyridinePhenylhydrazineProbenecidToluidine blue (a dye) Acetylphenylhydrazine Beta-Naphthol Chloramphenicol Dimercaprol Diabeta (Glyburide) Henna Menthol Methylene Blue (a dye) Penicillamine Phenazopyridine Phenylhydrazine Probenecid Toluidine blue (a dye)"
What does G6PD deficiency mean?,"'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G-6-PD) is an enzyme (a catalyst that regulates chemical reactions in the body) that is essential for assuring a normal lifespan for ''red blood cells'' and oxidative processes (chemical reactions that damage vital molecules in our cells).''G6PD deficiency'' (also known as favism or G6PDD) is hereditary, meaning it is passed down in families. It is caused by an abnormality in the activity of red blood cell enzymes. This enzyme deficiency may provoke the sudden destruction of red blood cells and lead to hemolytic ''anemia'' with ''jaundice''. This may be triggered by consuming fava beans, certain legumes and medicines.' "
How do you get G6PD deficiency?,"'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G-6-PD) deficiency (G6PDD) is a sex-linked trait, which means that the structure of the G6PD enzyme is carried by the X chromosome (an encoded hereditary material in the egg cells or womens’ reproductive cells). Therefore, this disorder is transmitted through the faulty genes of mothers (who are usually healthy carriers) to their son (or daughter who again becomes another healthy carrier ). Hence, men are more likely to suffer from this disorder than women.''There are more than 400 genes (units of heredity) that may cause this deficiency disorder. This disorder is most commonly seen in African countries (20 percent of the population is affected), around the Mediterranean (four to -30 percent of the population is affected) and Southeast Asia. More than 400 million people worldwide and about one in 10 African American men in the United States is affected by this disorder.''G6PD deficiency'' (G6PDD) can be determined by a simple blood test carried out at specialized genetic laboratories. To check ''hemolysis'', your doctor may order' A complete blood cell count to evaluate your overall health Lactate dehydrogenase enzyme levels to check for tissue damage Serum haptoglobin levels to check red blood cell destruction A urine analysis to check for blood cells in the urine Bilirubin levels to check for the yellowish waste product in the blood Urinary hemosiderin to check for excessive red blood cell destruction Peripheral blood smear to check for hemoglobin damage"
What is the problem and what can go wrong?,"'If glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G-6-PD) enzyme is not available in your body, strong chemical products or toxins will not be neutralized and they may damage the hemoglobin (a protein that transports oxygen in the blood) inside the red blood cells.\xa0''If toxins or chemicals build up in your body, it may cause breakdown of red blood cells and destroy them, which is known as hemolysis. This process may reduce the level of hemoglobin and red blood cells in your body, which is known as ''anemia''.''Most individuals are asymptomatic. However, this hemolysis may make you severely ''anemic'', which sometimes occurs very quickly. You may get''Some infants may also be affected by jaundice due to G6PD deficiency (G6PDD), which is quite risky.''Your risk of hemolysis and severe anemia may increase if you have G6PDD with infectious diseases such as''Sometimes, it may lead to hemolytic crisis due to rapid breakdown of red blood cells in your body. This may require hospitalization and immediate ''blood transfusion''.'

Can G6PD be cured?,"'Yes. Fortunately, once you remove and avoid the foods and medicines that are triggering these symptoms in you, hemolysis usually stops within a short period of time.\xa0''Your doctor will provide a detailed list of medicines and substances that may trigger hemolysis that you should avoid.\xa0''If you have mild deficiency symptoms, then transfusion is usually not recommended. In case of a severe hemolytic crisis, your doctor will give you a blood transfusion of either whole blood or packed cells. In areas where glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD or G-6-PD) deficiency (G6PDD) is very common, the doctor will avoid giving G6PD-deficient blood to patients.' "
What is atrial fibrillation?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' (''AFib'') occurs when the two smaller, upper chambers of the ''heart'' (the atria) beat irregularly instead of rhythmically. This abnormal condition can allow ''blood clots'' to form inside the heart and later travel to the brain and cause a ''stroke''.\xa0''Also, it often causes an unpleasant sensation of the heart racing or pounding along with ''shortness of breath'' and ''weakness''.\xa0''Patients may take medications prescribed by their doctor to reduce the risk of blood clots or to regulate their heartbeat. Usually, a doctor may suggest dietary and lifestyle changes to reduce the complications of AFib.\xa0' "
What foods trigger atrial fibrillation?,"'Eating certain foods could trigger ''atrial fibrillation'' (AFib) in some patients. Patients respond differently to foods and other triggers, so it is important to keep a track of what may cause episodes of AFib. For this reason, it may be helpful to create your own AFib ''diet'' plan and discuss it with the physician. Below are a few common foods that can trigger AFib.' High sugar foods: Consuming high sugar food can lead to obesity and high blood pressure as well. High blood pressure can trigger AFib episodes. Artificial sweeteners can be just as bad as or even worse than traditional sugar. It is usually recommended to slowly eliminate them from the diet.  Caffeine: Caffeine can be a trigger for some people when it comes to AFib. Too much caffeine could increase the heart rate, which in turn might trigger AFib. Caffeine use for AFib patients has been controversial; some doctors always recommended strict abstinence. However, a recent study showed that coffee was possibly beneficial for AFib patients. Usually, a cup of coffee a day, as long as it does not appear to trigger any AFib episodes, is always okay. Limited consumption of coffee or tea is a healthier option than any soda. Alcohol: Alcohol has been a strong trigger for AFib, and alcohol induced AFib is called holiday heart syndrome. It refers to significant AFib episodes that usually happened around a holiday associated with binge drinking. However, for some people, even moderate drinking can lead to AFib episodes. Strict reduction in alcohol consumption can reduce the triggers of AFib.  Foods with high sodium: Processed lunch meats may trigger AFib episodes. Eating one slice of processed lunch meat could serve up more than 1,000 mg of sodium. Excess salt in the diet can increase blood pressure. Increased blood pressure might trigger an AFib episode. Too much dietary salt makes managing symptoms challenging and may increase the chances of causing a stroke. Saturated foods such as pizza, canned soups, bread, fried foods, etc. may be avoided to reduce the chances of AFib. Tyramine: This amino acid is commonly found in aged cheeses such as cheddar, parmesan, and gorgonzola, as well as pepperoni, salami, soybean, and snow peas. Tyramine can increase blood pressure and can trigger an AFib episode. Eliminating tyramine containing foods can improve the patient’s condition. Gluten: It is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It’s found most commonly in bread, pasta, condiments, and many packaged foods. For people who may be gluten-intolerant or have a wheat allergy, the body might respond to gluten or wheat consumption by causing inflammation in the body. The inflammation can then make the patient more susceptible to AFib symptoms. Grapefruit: Few compounds in grapefruit can cause the concentration of AFib medications in the bloodstream to spike. For example, if a patient takes an anticoagulant, such as Coumadin (Warfarin), eating grapefruit can make blood thinner than normal and put the patient at risk for bleeding. If patients take medications for arrhythmia, grapefruit can interfere with how they work to regulate the heart rhythm.  Cranberry juice: Patients may need to avoid cranberry juice if they are on anticoagulant medications. Like grapefruit, cranberry juice can increase the amount of Warfarin circulating in the system and put the patient at risk for bleeding. Any type of fruit juice can increase blood sugar levels. It’s best to eat whole fruit instead of drinking juice. Asparagus and leafy green vegetables: Patients on anticoagulants may need to avoid eating or drinking foods or beverages that contain high levels of vitamin K, a nutrient that aids in blood clotting. Common sources of vitamin K in the diet include dark, leafy greens (collards, kale and spinach), certain vegetables (broccoli, asparagus and Brussels sprouts), and green tea. Doctors usually let the patients know if vitamin K or high-fiber foods make a good choice for their heart’s health."
Why is amniotomy done?,"'Amniotomy is done to:''The procedure is done when the cervix (neck of the uterus) is thin and dilated and the head of the baby has moved down into the pelvis (engaged).''Amniotomy should not be done if there is:' Induce the contractions of the uterus for facilitating vaginal delivery Assist in internal fetal monitoring to know the well-being of the fetus Augment or speed-up the process of labor Known or suspected abnormality called vasa previa (a condition in which blood vessels within the placenta or the umbilical cord are trapped between the fetus and the opening to the birth canal) Presence of any contraindications to vaginal delivery, such as placental abruption (a condition in which the placenta separates too soon from the wall of the uterus), persistent fetal distress, cephalopelvic disproportion (the baby's head or body is very large to fit through the birth canal) Unengaged head or other presenting part of the fetus (this may be overcome by using a controlled amniotomy or the application of fundal or suprapubic pressure)"
What are the complications of an amniotomy?,"'Amniotomy is often a safe and painless procedure. There may be some complications of this procedure, such as:' Cord prolapse: It is the most common complication of amniotomy. Cord prolapse is a condition in which the umbilical cord enters the birth canal before the baby. It usually occurs when there is a sudden and rapid outflow of the amniotic fluid. Infections: Opening the bag of water may increase the risk of infections, such as chorioamnionitis (acute inflammation of the fetal membranes and the placenta). Cord compression: The compression or pinching of the umbilical cord may affect the baby’s oxygen supply. Injuries: There may be a risk of injury to the mother or the baby. Minor injury to the fetal scalp may occur if the head was close to the membranes when the amniotomy was done."
What happens when a person stops smoking?,"'During the first hour:''In the first hour, the ''heart'' rate and blood pressure initially drop and then return to normal.''After 12 hours:''Cigarette smoking'' generates many toxins including carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is fatal in high doses because it prevents the delivery of oxygen to the blood and body tissues. After just 12 hours of cessation of ''cigarette smoking'', the excess carbon monoxide is out of the system, and the oxygen levels increase.''After 24 hours:''After 24 hours of no smoking, the risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke'' begins to decrease.''Smoking increases blood pressure. After 24 hours, blood pressure begins to start normalizing.

What happens during a fistulotomy?,"'A fistulotomy is a surgical procedure that opens and drains the fistula, so that the area can heal. It also closes the infected tract. It is usually done as an outpatient procedure, so an overnight stay in the hospital usually is not needed.\xa0If the fistula is not deep or large, fistulotomy may be done in the doctor’s office under local anesthesia. In this situation, the procedure may take about an hour. For larger or deeper fistulas, it may be done in the hospital under general anesthesia.''During the fistulotomy, a cut will be made at the site of the fistula. The fistula is opened surgically to remove the infected area with pus or other fluids. In many cases, ''stitches'' are used during a fistulotomy. If stitches aren’t used, the ''wound'' would be left open and either packed or covered with gauze.' "
What are the potential complications after a fistulotomy?,"'Potential complications after fistulotomy include:' Anesthesia complications, like headache and drowsiness Post-surgical pain Fever Potential loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence) Bleeding Recurrence of fistula with pus"
What are the care instructions after a fistulotomy?,"'The surgeon usually provides instructions after the procedure, which may be based on the size of the fistula. A patient may need to follow these instructions after the procedure:' It is important to keep the area clean. Changing the dressing as needed at regular intervals. Some fistulas that are left open may need to be packed with gauze and this gauze will need to be changed often to keep the area clean. In the case of anal fistulas, sitz baths (in which a person sits hip-deep in the water to bathe) might also be recommended during the healing process. There may be medications prescribed such as pain medications, stool softeners or fiber supplements. Antibiotics may also be given. ? There may be a few follow-up appointments with the doctor to check the healing process."
What is the success rate of a fistulotomy?,"'A fistula is a serious and unpleasant condition and, if left untreated, can lead to long-term complications. The success rate of a fistulotomy varies, based on several factors. However, according to the\xa0American Society of ''Colorectal'' Surgeons, it can be as high as 92% to 97% for treating anal fistulas. Treating a fistula with surgery can be effective, but it is important to follow instructions after the procedure carefully, and to see the doctor right away if any complications arise.' "
How is a video EEG performed?,"'A video ''EEG'' (electroencephalograph) monitoring is a diagnostic procedure using EEG and video recordings simultaneously in order to monitor ''seizure'' activity.\xa0 A video EEG monitoring is usually performed in a hospital because it is performed for a prolonged period. The duration of the video EEG monitoring depends on the frequency of the ''seizures''.\xa0''The EEG and video recordings can be viewed simultaneously on an EEG monitor. Computer detection software is used to identify abnormal brain activity in the EEG data, greatly reducing the quantity of raw data to be studied. The registered technician analyzes and compiles the data. An epileptologist uses the findings from the video EEG monitoring to diagnose and formulate a course of treatment.' Frequent episodes: outpatient procedure lasting up to eight hours of daytime monitoring, optimally when the patient is sleep deprived. Infrequent episodes: hospitalization for a longer period of monitoring that may last several days. The patient must wash their hair thoroughly and avoid using oil or hairspray. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. The doctor may reduce or discontinue any antiepileptic drugs the patient takes in order to increase the chances of a seizure episode during the monitoring period. A registered EEG technician glues to the patient’s scalp, electrodes that have conductive gel on them. The electrodes are covered with a cap or gauze dressing. The electrodes are connected to an EEG unit with a cord, or a wireless system may be used. The technician checks to make sure the electrodes are functioning properly. The room will have a wall-mounted camera that continuously records the patient’s activity. The camera may be covered or put off when privacy is required. Most patients are free to move about on their own or with assistance, depending on their condition. A few patients may require some kind of restraint in bed. This is for their own safety, since activity during a seizure may be unpredictable, especially if antiepileptic drugs are withdrawn. Patients are encouraged to carry on normal daily activities including activities that are likely to trigger a seizure. A parent or a family member is usually present with the patient. The patient is provided with a buzzer that can be activated by the attendant at the onset of a seizure episode or if assistance is required. Certain techniques may be undertaken to induce a seizure episode during the monitoring, since its occurrence is essential for diagnosis and effective treatment. The patient will be informed prior to use of such techniques. The duration of video EEG monitoring will depend on seizure occurrence and adequate collection of seizure-related data."
What are the limitations and risks of a video EEG?,"'Video EEG monitoring is a powerful diagnostic tool, but it has certain limitations:' Errors in EEG interpretation can occur, leading to misdiagnosis. Certain types of partial seizures may not show activity in EEG. Results of the video EEG may fail to provide a conclusive diagnosis. Withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs or techniques to induce seizure pose potential risks to the patient that include the following:Uncontrollable seizure activity lasting up to 30 minutes (status epilepticus)Injuries and fracture from seizure-related trauma and fallsPsychosis resulting from seizure episodes (postictal psychosis) Uncontrollable seizure activity lasting up to 30 minutes (status epilepticus) Injuries and fracture from seizure-related trauma and falls Psychosis resulting from seizure episodes (postictal psychosis)"
What happens if a Bartholin abscess bursts?,"'If a Bartholin ''abscess'' bursts, it may resolve on its own in a few days without treatment. However, it is advisable to visit the doctor to avoid the spread of the infection. Your doctor will usually advise you to soak the labia in warm water (sitz bath) and prescribe you antibiotics and ''pain'' medications.' "
What is a Bartholin abscess?,"'Bartholin abscess is a pocket of pus that builds up over the Bartholin glands in females. The Bartholin glands are two pea-sized glands, each located on each side of the vaginal lips (labia) near the vaginal opening. These glands secrete slimy fluid, known as ''mucus'', which helps lubricate the vaginal region.''The blockage of mucus can result in an abscess known as Bartholin abscess. The abscess can be infected or not infected. The infection is caused by bacteria, such as ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and ''E. coli''. These are the microbes that are usually responsible for infections of the skin and urinary tract.' "
What causes Bartholin abscess?,"'Bartholin abscess is a common problem in women. It affects nearly three out of every 100 women. It can happen in any woman and its cause may be unknown. Some may be caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as chlamydial infection or ''gonorrhea''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Bartholin abscess?,"'A Bartholin ''cyst'' (fluid-filled swelling) can turn into an abscess or an abscess can develop on its own. The abscess grows very quickly, typically over 2 to 4 days.''If you have a Bartholin abscess, you can feel a tiny bump near your vagina. However, it can grow as large as a hen’s egg (until 8 cm) and cause extreme discomfort.''Bartholin abscess is usually''A large, severely infected Bartholin abscess can' Red in color Swollen Feels warm onto the touch Is painful (tender) to the touch Hurt when you walk, sit or indulge in sport activities Make sexual intercourse painful for you Cause fever"
How is Bartholin abscess diagnosed?,"'Bartholin abscess is a relatively easy diagnosis because doctors can diagnose it just by looking at it and asking about your complaints and medical history.''Sometimes, the doctors may take a sample of the abscess and send it to the laboratory to get it examined under a microscope. This is done if they want to know what kind of microbes have caused the abscess so that they can start the right antibiotic course. In women older than 40, a biopsy (cutting a small piece of the labia or vagina) may be done to check whether the abscess is due to ''cancer'' of the Bartholin gland.' "
What is the treatment for Bartholin abscess?,"'Treatments for a Bartholin abscess aim to drain the pus completely. To achieve this aim, doctors usually use one of two techniques. These minor surgical procedures can be performed right away during a visit to the doctor’s office.''Your doctor may put you on antibiotics before calling you for any of the procedures. If the abscess does not drain adequately, antibiotics may be continued after the procedure. To reduce the ''pain'', your doctor may give you analgesics.''You may have to restrict sex for a few weeks until the abscess drains completely. Your doctor may advise you to take a sitz bath, sitting in a tub of warm water for 10 to 20 minutes four to five times a day for a few days.''If the Bartholin abscess keeps recurring, the doctor may recommend going for either laser treatment or surgery to remove the entire Bartholin gland.' Insertion of a word catheter: The doctor gives an injection of an anesthetic medication near the Bartholin abscess located over the labia. This numbs the region around the abscess. Next, the doctor makes a small cut (incision) into and inserts a tiny tube known as a word catheter into the abscess. The tube is left there for 4 to 6 weeks and is usually removed during the next visit. Marsupialization: This procedure involves making a small incision into the abscess and stitching its corners so that an opening is created. The opening allows the abscess to drain for a few days."
What are common causes of and risk factors for arrhythmia?,'Arrhythmia may occur due to various reasons ranging from genetic condition to medication side effects and an unhealthy lifestyle. The most common causes include:\xa0''The most common risk factors include:' Extreme fright or stress Excessive exercise Caffeine Nicotine Hormonal changes Heart attack  Scarring of the heart as a result of a previous heart attack Blocked blood vessels in the aortic region High blood pressure and an imbalance in the body’s blood sugar and salt levels Thyroid diseases Excessive consumption of alcohol A high-fat diet Certain over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs or supplements Drug abuse High cholesterol Obesity Improper sleep patterns Advancing age: People over the age of 60 years are at risk of arrhythmia. Congenital heart defects (since birth) Known family history Previous heart attacks or surgeries: Damage to the heart can weaken the muscle and affect its electrical system.
How is arrhythmia usually treated?,"'Not all arrhythmias are dangerous or life-threatening. Sometimes, the heart is perfectly healthy, but its regular rhythm is interrupted by emotional ''stress'' or physical activity levels. Treatments may be considered if a patient is having recurrent episodes:' Diagnose and treat the underlying causes: These include diagnosing and treating diabetes, hypertension, or heart diseases. Medications: Antiarrhythmic and anticoagulants drugs may be considered to stabilize the heart rhythm. Pacemaker: It is a small electronic device that electrically stimulates the heart to maintain an appropriate heart rhythm if the heart rhythm is too slow. Implantable cardiac defibrillator: This device monitors and corrects the heart rhythm if it is dangerous. Defibrillation: It resets the heart rhythm by sending mild electrical currents to the heart. Electrical cardioversion: A mild electrical shock restores a normal heart rhythm while the patient is under anesthesia. Catheter ablation: A catheter with an electrode on the end is inserted into the body and directed to the heart, where it gently burns and inactivates the areas responsible for abnormal signals in the atria. Surgery: It removes or inactivates the malfunctioning area(s) of the heart. Lifestyle changes: These include managing stress, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, eating healthy foods, being physically active, managing blood pressure and cholesterol, and maintaining a healthy body weight."
What can be the outlook of patients with arrhythmia?,"'Having arrhythmia can increase your risk of ''stroke'', ''cardiac arrest'', and heart attack. For this reason, patients should be sure to control any factors that may put them at further risk. The outlook for a patient who has arrhythmia depends on several factors including age, type, and severity of it. Even serious arrhythmia often has successful treatment. Most people who have an irregular heartbeat live normal, healthy lives if treated appropriately.' "
What is hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland is unable to produce sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located in front of the neck. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, body temperature, heart rate, and the ''digestive system''. A decrease in the levels of the thyroid hormone causes several body functions to slow down. Hypothyroidism tends to affect women more than men. It can begin at any age, but commonly, it affects middle-aged women. Sometimes, hypothyroidism develops after ''pregnancy''. A thyroid problem may be diagnosed during blood tests or after symptoms begin.''There are several treatment options for hypothyroidism that are safe and effective.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'The signs and ''symptoms of hypothyroidism'' in adults may include:''The signs and symptoms in babies include:''The signs and symptoms in children and young adults are the same as adults, but in addition, they may also present with:' Tiredness and weakness Increased sensitivity to cold Constipation Dry and itchy skin Weight gain Change in voice Muscle pain and stiffness Heavy menstrual flow or irregular menstrual periods Thinning of the hair Thinning of the eyebrows Decreased heart rate Depression Poor memory Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) Yellow skin and eyes (prolonged jaundice of birth) A large, protruding tongue Difficulty breathing and feeding Hoarse cry Poor muscle tone (a protruding tummy) Excessive sleepiness Physical and mental retardation in untreated infants Delayed milestone development Poor physical and mental development Short height Delayed development of permanent teeth Delayed puberty"
What causes hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce sufficient thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism may occur due to the following:' Autoimmune disease: Autoimmune disease (when the body’s immune system attacks its own cells) of the thyroid is also known as Hashimoto thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism treatment: Overtreatment of hyperthyroidism (production of excessive thyroid hormone) can lower thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid surgery: Removing all or a large portion of your thyroid gland. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy used to treat cancer in the head and neck region can damage the thyroid gland. Medications: Certain medications used in other conditions, such as lithium for psychiatric disorders, can affect the thyroid gland. Congenital disease: Being born with a defective thyroid gland or no thyroid gland. Pituitary disorder: The pituitary gland produces thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone. Pregnancy: Antibodies against the thyroid gland may develop during or after pregnancy (postpartum hypothyroidism). Iodine deficiency: Iodine is a mineral required in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Certain places are devoid of iodine in the soil. These regions are called goiter belts. Iodine deficiency in the foods in this region makes people prone to hypothyroidism."
How is hypothyroidism treated?,"'Standard treatment for hypothyroidism involves thyroid hormone tablets to achieve normal TSH levels. This is achieved by the daily administration of synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is an oral medication, and the dose is adjusted by the physician based on the hormone levels in the blood. Most cases require lifelong treatment but testing at regular intervals is advised because the hormone levels in the blood fluctuate and the dosage needs to be changed accordingly.''A balanced ''diet'', using iodized table salt in food, and regular ''exercise'' are recommended along with the medical treatment.' "
What is melanoma skin cancer?,"'Melanoma, also called ''malignant melanoma'' or cutaneous (relating to the skin) melanoma, is a type of ''skin cancer''. It develops when there is an uncontrolled growth of the cells that give the skin its tan or brown color (melanocytes). Usually, the melanoma tumors are brown or black since most melanoma cells can make ''melanin''. Some melanomas, however, do not make melanin. Such melanoma tumors can appear pink, tan, or even white.''Melanoma can occur on the skin of any part of the body. They usually start developing on the chest and back (the trunk) in men and on the legs in women. Melanomas also commonly occur on the neck and face. The less common sites for melanomas include the\xa0eyes, mouth, genitals, and anal area. Although melanomas are far less common than the other types of ''skin cancers'', they are more dangerous since they spread rapidly to other parts of the body (''metastasis''). Thus, they need to be diagnosed and treated at early stages.' "
What is meant by a sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma?,"'Melanomas are rapidly spreading tumors. The first lymph node that a melanoma travels to is called the sentinel lymph node. A ''sentinel lymph node biopsy'' is a type of surgery in which a few lymph nodes nearest to the melanoma are removed and examined for the presence of melanoma cells. It is a minimally invasive surgery with a low risk of side effects. Sentinel lymph node biopsy or SLNB helps the doctor know about the stage of melanoma to plan appropriate treatment for the patient. It also helps the doctor to know the patient’s chances of recovery (prognosis).''During a sentinel lymph node biopsy:''If the sentinel lymph node biopsy detects ''cancer'' cells, the surgeon removes all local lymph nodes or destroys them with ''radiation therapy'' or do both, the surgery as well as ''radiation'' therapy.' A dye or a tracer material is injected into the site of the tumor or mass that help stain the sentinel nodes during the procedure. The stained path from the tumor to the sentinel lymph nodes is mapped using an instrument that detects the tracer. The surgeon removes the sentinel lymph nodes and sends them for lab examination."
Why is sentinel node biopsy done?,"'Sentinel node biopsy is recommended for people with certain types of cancer that have a high risk of spreading to the lymphatic system and then to the rest of the body.''Sentinel node biopsy is routinely performed for people diagnosed with the following cancers:''Sentinel node biopsy may be performed for other types of cancer, such as:' Breast cancer Melanoma Head and neck cancer Thyroid cancer Colon cancer Esophageal cancer Lung cancer Stomach cancer"
How is sentinel node biopsy performed?,"'Before the procedure:''The doctor would advise routine laboratory and radiological tests to assess the general health status of the patient and their ''fitness'' for surgery. The first step of the sentinel node biopsy procedure is to locate the sentinel nodes by one of the following techniques:''During the procedure:''The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes a small incision (cut) in the area over the lymph nodes. The blue dye or the radioactive solution injected before the procedure is the guide that helps the surgeon identify the sentinel nodes. There are usually one to five sentinel nodes and typically, all are removed. The sentinel nodes are sent to a pathologist to study under a microscope for signs of cancer.''After the procedure:''Most patients are discharged the same day after the procedure. Patients can return to their daily activities in 1-2 days or longer depending on their situation. Other specific activities may be resumed after consulting with the doctor. If the sentinel node biopsy was performed as a part of more extensive surgery to remove primary cancer, the hospital stay and recovery time would be longer.' Radioactive solution: A weak radioactive solution is injected near the tumor that drains into the lymphatic system and travels to the sentinel nodes. This is usually done a few hours prior or the day before the sentinel node biopsy procedure. Blue dye: The doctor injects a safe, non-reactive blue dye near the tumor before the procedure, which drains into the lymphatic system and sentinel nodes, staining them blue."
What are the complications of sentinel node biopsy?,"'Sentinel node biopsy is generally a safe procedure. However, like any surgery, there is a risk of complications, including:' Bleeding Pain Swelling and bruising Infection Allergic reaction to the dye Reaction to anesthesia Lymphedema (lymph vessels don’t drain fluid adequately causing fluid accumulation and swelling)"
What is syphilis?,"'Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum. Syphilis is a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD''). Syphilis can also be transmitted from the mother to unborn baby. Occasionally, the bacteria can enter your body through minor ''cuts'' or abrasions on the skin or mucous membranes. Syphilis is ''contagious'' during its primary and secondary stages and rarely in the early periods of the tertiary (latent) stage. After the initial infection, the bacteria may remain inactive (dormant) in the body many years, even decades before becoming active. Syphilis can be completely cured in the initial stages. Without treatment, syphilis can lead to life-threatening complications and permanently damage the heart, brain, and other organs.''The following factors increase the risk of acquiring syphilis:' Unprotected sexual intercourse  Multiple sexual partners Men having sex with men (MSM) Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) infection "
What are the signs and symptoms of syphilis?,"'Syphilis progresses in stages, and the presentation varies at each stage. The signs and symptoms of syphilis at every stage of syphilis are as follows:' Primary syphilis: Syphilis begins with a small, shallow, painless sore, also called a chancre, around three weeks after exposure. The sore can occur anywhere over the body but is common in the mouth and genitals. It may sometimes be hidden within the rectum or vagina. Most patients usually develop only one chancre, and some people develop many. Chancres usually heal on their own six weeks. Secondary syphilis: Few weeks after the chancre heals, a rash appears, starting on the trunk and spreads to the rest of the body including the palms and soles. There is usually no pain or itching. Wart-like sores can occur in the mouth or genitals. Patients also have hair loss, muscle pain, fever, throat pain, and enlarged lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms may disappear after a few weeks or may appear on and off up to a year. Latent syphilis: If patients are not treated for syphilis, the disease enters the latent (hidden) stage. During the latent stage, patients usually do not have any symptoms, and this can last for many years. Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease can progress to the tertiary stage. Tertiary syphilis: Tertiary syphilis is also known as the late stage of syphilis. Around 15-30% of patients that go untreated develop complications of syphilis called tertiary syphilis. The disease may permanently damage the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints that can be life threatening. These complications can occur years after the initial untreated infection. Neurosyphilis: This can occur at any stage. The infection can spread and cause damage to the brain and nerves. Congenital syphilis: Syphilis can also be transmitted from the mother to unborn baby or at the time of birth. Most newborns with congenital syphilis may not have any symptoms initially. Some babies have a rash on the palms and soles. Signs and symptoms that may develop later include deafness, teeth deformities, and saddle nose deformity (collapsed nose). Babies with syphilis may also be born prematurely, be born dead, or die soon after birth."

What is vitiligo?,"'Vitiligo is a long-term (chronic) medical condition causing areas of skin to lose color. This presents with pale white patches on the skin. The patches do not cause any ''pain'' or ''itch''. The condition results from the loss of skin pigment, ''melanin''. Vitiligo can affect any part of the body, although it is mostly seen on the face, neck, hands, and skin creases. Some people may also get white patches inside the mouth, on the hair, or in the eye. Vitiligo may affect people to different extents; some may only get a few white patches while others may get most of their body affected.''The exact cause of this condition is not known. Many studies, however, suggest that vitiligo occurs due to some autoimmune mechanism (when the body’s immune system attacks its cells and tissues). Vitiligo is not a life-threatening disease. It cannot be transmitted from one person to another.' "
Who is at risk of getting vitiligo?,"'Vitiligo can affect any person of any age or gender. The exact cause and risks for vitiligo are not known. Many people start getting vitiligo patches before they are 20 years old.''The condition also seems to occur more often in people who have family members with vitiligo or who have certain autoimmune diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''type 1 diabetes''.''Vitiligo may, at times, occur or get worsened due to a ''sunburn'', stressful event like ''childbirth'', or contact with certain chemicals.' "
Can vitiligo be cured?,"'There is no available cure for vitiligo. The treatment, however, can be done to''The treatment for vitiligo may vary from person to person. A treatment option that works for one individual may not work for the other. Sometimes, it needs a combination of treatment options for adequate results. Some people may get new vitiligo patches with time. You must consult with your dermatologist to know which treatment options will work best for you.''Treatment of vitiligo can include:' Slow or stop disease progression. Help melanocytes (the skin cells that make color) to grow again. Make the white skin patches to attain normal skin color again. Cosmetics to camouflage the patches: These include makeup, self-tanners, and skin dyes. They are safe but time-consuming options. Because of their safety, they can be used in children with vitiligo. Topical medications (medicines applied to the skin): Many topical medications, such as steroid creams or ointments, can add color to the skin. Topical medications work best for people with darkly pigmented skin. They show the best results on the face as compared to other body parts. Light treatment: It involves using light to restore skin color. PUVA (Psoralen and ultraviolet/UV A) light therapy: It uses UV A light and the medicine Psoralen (topical or as a pill) to restore the skin color. Surgery: Surgery may be done in some adults when medications and other therapy fail. Unconventional treatment: In some people, certain vitamins, minerals, and herbs, such as Ginkgo biloba, help restore the skin color Depigmentation: Rarely, some people may opt for the removal of the remaining skin pigment (depigmentation). This may be done in people who have extensive skin involvement due to vitiligo."
Are yeast infections contagious?,"'Yeast infections are ''contagious''. They can be transmitted through sexual contact. Those with weak immunity have a high risk of the infection. Yeast infections can be vaginal (''candidiasis''), oral (''thrush'') or penile.''Mucocutaneous yeast infections (those affecting the body creases where moisture accumulates) may not be contagious.' "
How is a yeast infection treated?,"'Yeast infections are treated by medications and maintaining proper personal hygiene. The doctor may prescribe''The doctor may instruct the patient to control their blood ''sugar'' levels (if they have ''diabetes'') and maintain a healthy weight and healthy skin hygiene.''If the patient has an oral ''yeast infection'' (''thrush''), the doctor may prescribe antifungal treatments such as' Local pessary: These are antifungal medicinal pills that are inserted inside the vagina. A typical course is 6 to 10 days. These are taken for vaginal yeast infections. Antifungal skin creams, ointments or powders may be used by men for penile infections. A single tablet of antifungal medicine taken by mouth for a severe yeast infection (except if a woman is  pregnant or has diabetes or other diseases where immunity is weak).

Candida sepsis: This is a condition wherein the candida may infect other organs via the blood. Yeast may cause infections of organs such as the heart and lungs."
How are recurring yeast infections prevented?," Blood sugar level control may prevent recurrent yeast infections in those who have diabetes. Keeping a healthy weight may lower the risk of a skin yeast infection. General hygienic rules such as using powders to keep skin dry and wearing loose, breathable cotton clothes must be followed to prevent skin yeast infections. It is best to avoid sex if your partner has a yeast infection to prevent catching the infection. Probiotics can help to keep any type of yeast infection away. In case of a recurrent vaginal yeast infection, a probiotic product may be either swallowed or inserted into the vagina to restore healthy vaginal flora. Eating yoghurt or over-the-counter probiotic pills may help  restore healthy mouth flora in case of a mild mouth yeast infection. Women should avoid douching (showering of the vagina with chemical soaps and water) that may increase the risk of infections."
What are Brazil nuts?,'Brazil nuts are acquired from the Bertholletia excelsa tree grown widely in the Amazon forests.

"What is the spleen, and what does it do?","'The spleen, situated under the left rib cage near the stomach, is an important part of the immune system. The spleen contains special white\xa0blood cells\xa0that can destroy bacteria. It helps the body fight infections and also removes old ''red blood cells'' from the body’s circulation.' "
What is an open splenectomy?,"'An\xa0open splenectomy\xa0is a surgery to remove the entire\xa0spleen. Unlike a laparoscopic procedure, an open splenectomy requires a larger surgical cut. Patients with a very large or swollen spleen, or who are ''obese'' or have ''scar tissue'' in the spleen area from a previous operation. are considered for an open splenectomy.' "
How is an open splenectomy performed?," An open splenectomy is a major surgery performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision across the middle or left side of the abdomen underneath the rib cage.  After locating the spleen, the surgeon disconnects it from the body’s blood supply and then removes it.  The surgical openings are closed using stitches or sutures.  When the spleen has been ruptured by severe injury, the surgeon approaches the organ from its underside and ties the splenic artery before removing the ruptured organ."
What happens if the spleen is removed?,"'Usually when the spleen is removed, other organs such as the ''liver'' can take over most of the functions of the spleen. But because the spleen is important for the body’s defense against germs, the patient is at a higher risk of infection after the operation.\xa0''Even without a spleen, the ''human body'' can cope with most infections, but there is a small risk that a serious infection (especially with certain bacteria) may develop quickly. Although these infections do not happen very often, they can be life-threatening. So, it is important to take precautions. This increased infection risk will be present for the rest of\xa0life.\xa0''Interestingly, however, about 30% of people have a second spleen (called an accessory spleen). These are usually very small, but may grow and function when the main spleen is removed.\xa0' "
What are the common complications after open splenectomy?,"'The most common complication after open splenectomy are fast-developing infections. The following are few other common complications.\xa0' Blood clot in the vein that carries blood to the liver Hernia or infection at the operated site Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Lung collapse Injury to the pancreas, stomach, and colon"
How to prevent infections after splenectomy,"'A splenectomy makes a patient susceptible to infections, and below are a few preventive measures:' To prevent infections, doctors recommend all immunizations two weeks prior or two weeks after the procedure.  Usually the doctor recommends the flu shot every year post splenectomy.  Children are placed on antibiotics every day until the age of 16 to prevent infections. Adults are only placed on antibiotics when they are sick or when they are on the verge of developing an infection.  People who do not have a spleen who plan on traveling out of the country or to a place where medical help is not available can carry antibiotics to take as soon as they become sick."
What Happens to Your Body When You Have Thyroid Cancer?,"'Thyroid cancer'"" arises from the cells of the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck, just below Adam's apple. The thyroid gland is an endocrine gland, producing hormones that regulate body weight, temperature, ""'blood pressure'' and ''heart'' rate.''The common signs and symptoms of ''thyroid cancer'' include' A swelling in the front of the neck which is initially painless Difficulty swallowing  Difficulty breathing due to compression of the trachea (windpipe)  Change in voice  Cough  Weight loss Palpitations"
What are the types of thyroid cancer?,"'Thyroid ''cancer'' is classified on the basis of the type of cells present in the ''tumor''. The treatment and prognosis depend on the type of thyroid ''cancer''.''Types of thyroid ''cancer'' include' Papillary thyroid cancer: This is the most common form of thyroid cancer. It arises from follicular cells present in the thyroid gland which produce and store thyroid hormones. Papillary thyroid cancer most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 30 and 50, but it can occur at any age.  Follicular thyroid cancer: Follicular thyroid cancer also arises from the follicular cells of the thyroid. It commonly presents in those over the age of 50. Hurthle cell cancer is a rare variant of follicular thyroid cancer and is more aggressive. Papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer are sometimes referred together as differentiated thyroid cancer. Anaplastic thyroid cancer: Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare type of thyroid cancer that usually occurs in older patients over the age of 60. It is very aggressive and grows rapidly. It is very difficult to treat with a poor prognosis. Anaplastic thyroid cancer typically occurs in adults age 60 and older. Medullary thyroid cancer: Medullary thyroid cancer arises in the C cells in the thyroid gland. C cells produce a hormone called calcitonin. Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood may indicate medullary thyroid cancer at an early stage. Calcitonin levels also help to monitor treatment.  Other rare types: Though extremely rare, some types of cancer can arise in the thyroid, such as thyroid lymphoma (arises from the immune cells of the thyroid) or thyroid sarcoma (arises from the connective tissue cells in the thyroid)."
What causes thyroid cancer?,"'The exact cause of thyroid cancer is not known, but various factors increase the risk of thyroid cancer. The common risk factors include' Genetic predisposition and certain genetic syndromes, such as familial medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia, familial adenomatous polyposis and Cowden's syndrome History of breast cancer Female sex  Radiation exposure because of cancer treatment, occupation or its presence in the environment Age: Thyroid cancer is more common in those over the age of 40."
How is thyroid cancer diagnosed?,"'The physician performs a complete clinical assessment. Complete blood analysis and radiological tests are performed (''ultrasound'', computed tomography [CT], ''magnetic resonance imaging'' [''MRI''] and radioactive iodide imaging). Genetic testing may be done if genetic syndromes are suspected. A biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis and identify the type of thyroid cancer. Biopsy is a minimally-invasive procedure that involves obtaining a small sample of the thyroid tissue with the help of a needle and then studying it under the microscope.' "
How is thyroid cancer treated?,"'The treatment may involve one or a combination of modalities, which depend on the extent and type of cancer.''The treatment options include' Surgery: Surgery may involve removing all (total thyroidectomy) or most of the thyroid (near-total thyroidectomy). Removal of lymph nodes in the neck (lymph node dissection) may or may not be performed.  Thyroid hormone therapy: After thyroidectomy surgery, thyroid hormone medication needs to be taken for a lifetime to replace thyroid hormone levels. Radioactive iodine: Radioactive iodine treatment uses large doses of radioactive iodine and is usually used after surgery. It destroys the remaining thyroid tissue and microscopic thyroid cancer. Most of the radioactive iodine is excreted in the urine a few days after treatment.  External radiation therapy: This targets and selectively kills cancer cells and shrinks tumors using radiation.  Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a drug treatment given intravenously (IV) that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells.  Targeted drug therapy: Targeted drug treatments focus on specific abnormalities in cancer cells. The drugs block the abnormalities and can cause death of the cancer cells. Injecting alcohol into cancers: Alcohol ablation involves injecting small thyroid cancers with alcohol using radiological guidance which causes thyroid cancer to shrink. Palliative (supportive) care: This is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other serious symptoms."

What's the difference between having mercury exposure and mercury poisoning?,"'Just because a person was exposed to a toxin doesn’t mean they are poisoned. Our body usually has some level of threshold to toxins, and the immune system usually defends us.\xa0''Mercury exposure:'"" A person with no symptoms and no changes physically or chemically may have a high mercury level. It doesn’t become poisonous under the true definition unless someone has had physical or chemical changes in their\xa0body. That doesn’t mean it's safe to have levels without symptoms. Over time, even if they are exposed at low levels, the symptoms may not manifest until weeks or months later.""'Mercury poisoning:'' The person who is symptomatic is considered poisoned. They are usually diagnosed through urine and blood tests.' "
How is mercury poisoning usually treated?,"'The goal of treating mercury poisoning is to remove exposure and decontaminate the patient.\xa0' Patients may be placed on intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy depending on the type of exposure. Gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination and whole bowel irrigation may be attempted. Activated charcoal and chelation may be initiated early in mercury exposure cases because it may reduce toxic effects. Inorganic mercury and elemental mercury can be treated with an initial course of intramuscular dimercaprol and then followed by oral succimer. Hemodialysis is usually preferred for patients with renal damage. In addition, exchange transfusions may also be attempted."
What is the outlook in patients with mercury poisoning?,"'Mercury toxicity can be very difficult to identify with multisystem involvement. Symptoms of mercury exposure and toxicity can easily be misdiagnosed as normal medical problems such as ''gastritis'', gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and respiratory distress. A keen awareness leading to early identification and treatment is critical due to severe and potentially irreversible damage. The outlook for mercury exposure is highly variable but is dependent on the level of exposure. Significant exposures can lead to ''coma'' and death. Minor symptoms may resolve over time. Neurologic symptoms that can be delayed in the presentation may persist for decades. High exposures may lead to death, permanent neurologic deficits, or mental retardation. For adults, mercury poisoning is usually a reversible problem. The body can rid itself of mercury if the exposure to mercury is halted. Symptoms such as ''fatigue'' and memory problems seem to go away as mercury levels decrease. However, for children and developing fetuses, mercury poisoning can cause long-term neurological problems. Mercury exposure before birth has been linked to lower intelligence and delays in learning motor skills.''Anyone with concerns about mercury exposure can consult their physician and/or their ''poison control'' center at 1-800-222-1222.'

How to deal with changes after a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy that also involves the removal of ovaries results in the permanent cessation of a woman’s ''menstrual cycle''. This condition is known as ''surgical menopause'' or surgery-''induced menopause''. Hormonal changes also take place during ''menopause'' for which the doctor may recommend'' ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'').''Menopause results in a decrease in the estrogen hormone that gives rise to signs and symptoms of menopause. HRT aims at making up for the loss of estrogen by replacing it with synthetic estrogen.''If you experience vaginal dryness and ''pain'' during sex, you can use a vaginal lubricant just before performing the carnal act.''You may feel ''depressed'' or stressed due to the loss of one or more of your reproductive organs.

If the cervix is left behind, the PAP smear may be advised.''Sometimes, even after a total hysterectomy, especially if done for a cancerous condition, a PAP smear may be recommended to detect any cancerous changes in the surrounding area.''If your mother took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) while she was ''pregnant'' with you, regular PAP tests are recommended because DES exposure in the uterus increases your risk of ''cervical cancer''.' "
Is there any alternative to a hysterectomy?,"'Hysterectomy remains the last option after all alternatives to treat problems such as heavy bleeding have failed.''Before going for a hysterectomy, here is what the doctor will generally suggest:' Wait-and-watch approach: This is usually adopted for uterine fibroids to observe whether they are growing or not and sometimes to see if they shrink by themselves after menopause. Exercises: For uterine prolapse, pelvic muscle–strengthening exercises such as Kegel exercises are recommended. Medicines: Medicines are the first line of treatment when it comes to issues such as endometriosis, pelvic pain, and excessive or irregular vaginal bleeding. Vaginal pessary: This is a rubbery or plastic object similar to a diaphragm used for treating uterine prolapse. Surgeries: Certain surgeries treat the underlying problem but are minor to a hysterectomy. These are as follows:  Surgery to treat endometriosis Dilation and curettage (D&C) (removing the lining of the uterus that is shed during every monthly period) Endometrial ablation (destroying the lining of the uterus permanently by freezing or heating) Myomectomy (surgery to remove uterine fibroids without removing the uterus) Myolysis (surgery to shrink fibroids without removing the uterus) Uterine artery embolization (UAE) (treatment to shrink fibroids without surgery) Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided focused ultrasound (treatment to shrink fibroids without surgery)"
What are parathyroid glands?,"'The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized glands located in the neck near the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, which helps to control the calcium and phosphorous levels in the body. They are located on the outside borders of the thyroid glands.''The parathyroid glands raise blood calcium levels by:' Causing bone to release calcium in the blood Aiding the intestines to absorb calcium from the diet Helping the kidneys to store calcium and return it to the blood instead of excreting it in the urine"
What causes hyperparathyroidism?,"'Primary hyperparathyroidism is a type of hyperparathyroidism that starts in at least one of the parathyroid glands. It occurs due to one of the following reasons:''Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a type of hyperparathyroidism that occurs due to low calcium levels in the blood, triggered by certain medical conditions. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may occur due to:''About 100,000 people in the United States develop hyperparathyroidism each year. Women are more commonly affected than men and the risk increases with age.' Benign tumor Cancer of one of the glands Two or more of the glands being overactive Low calcium levels in the blood due to chronic kidney disease or some other conditions Low levels of Vitamin D that balances the amount of calcium in the blood Paraneoplastic syndrome (an accompanying disease because of cancers of other organs) may also be present with elevated PTH levels."
What are the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism?,"'Hyperparathyroidism does not manifest any symptoms in the majority of the patients. However, in some, hyperparathyroidism may exhibit the following symptoms:''In severe cases of hyperparathyroidism, the patient may experience:' Joint pain Muscle weakness Fatigue Depression Trouble concentrating Loss of appetite Increased need for sleep Nausea and vomiting Confusion Increased thirst and need to urinate Constipation Pain on one side of the lower abdomen Kidney failure symptoms"
How is hyperparathyroidism diagnosed?,"'The physician may order blood tests to check the level of calcium and PTH in the blood. After diagnosis, the physician may conduct the following tests to assess the complications:' Bone densitometry: It uses a small dose of ionizing radiation to look for reduced bone mineral density. Kidney ultrasound: It may be useful to check for kidney stones. Imaging tests, such as MRI or CT scan, may be helpful to check for broken bones 25-hydroxy-vitamin D blood test to assess the level of Vitamin D"
How is hyperparathyroidism treated?,"'Treatment options include:' Surgery: It involves removal of the either one or more overactive glands. Medication: Cinacalcet is approved for the treatment of primary as well as secondary hyperparathyroidism. Dietary supplements: Calcium and Vitamin D supplements need to be consumed lifelong. Identify and treat the cancer-causing paraneoplastic syndrome, if any. Regular monitoring involves physical examination from time to time, blood tests, and bone density measurements."
What is the ileum?,"'The entire small intestine is around 20 ''feet'' long and is divided into three parts.''The ileum opens into the ''large intestine'' controlled by the Ileocecal valve.\xa0''The ileum is responsible for the ''digestion'' and absorption of nutrients like vitamin B12, ''fats'', bile, and everything else not digested in the rest of the intestine. The undigested food enters the large intestine to get excreted.''The Ileocecal valve is a muscle at the junction of the ileum and the first part of the large intestine or colon. Its main function is to regulate the passage of undigested food from the small intestine to the large intestine.' The first part is called the duodenum. The stomach opens into the duodenum. The middle part is called the jejunum. The third and final part is called the ileum."
Why is ileal removal done?,'Surgical removal of the ileum is also called small bowel resection. The most common reasons for the surgery may be:' Uncontrolled bleeding due to perforated ulcers or injury.  Blockage of the ileum due to tumors or scar tissue. Birth defects like Meckel’s diverticulum (outpouching of the small intestine). Infections and ulcers that do not respond to medication.  Inflammatory conditions like Crohn's disease.
Why is the ileocecal valve removed?,"'Ileocecal valve is removed in case of:' Crohn's disease complicated by stricture (narrowing) of the valve. Tumors in the area of the ileocecal valve. Trauma, infection, or bleeding in the area of the valve."
What happens when the ileum is removed?,"'In conditions where the ileum is removed surgically, the duodenum is connected to the colon. This is called anastomosis. The ileum is removed surgically under anesthesia. Patients may typically stay in the hospital for around a week after surgery. It could take 6 to 8 weeks to completely recover.\xa0''Though this surgery may be necessary and even lifesaving, the ileum is responsible for the digestion and absorption of nutrients like vitamin B12, fats, bile, and everything else that is not digested by the rest of the intestine. Removal of the valve can cause difficulty in absorbing ''nutrition'' and other digestive problems like ''diarrhea''.''However, it is possible to survive without the ileum with appropriate postoperative care, nutritional therapy, and digestive aids.''Like any surgery, ileal resection also has risks of complications. Some possible complications of surgery are:' Swelling, bruising and pain which usually resolves in around 2 weeks Infection  Bleeding Damage to surrounding structures  Reaction to anesthesia Localized blood clot (hematoma) and smaller blood clots which may travel through blood vessels, causing heart and lung complications  Wound dehiscence (a condition where the cut made during a surgical procedure separates or ruptures after being stitched together) Seroma (fluid collection) Anastomotic leak (intestinal contents may leak through the site of anastomosis) which may lead to systemic infection Anastomotic stricture Scarring and adhesions leading to bowel obstruction"
What happens if the ileocecal valve is removed?,"'When the ileocecal valve is removed, like any surgery, there is a risk of complications during and after surgery. The valve functions to move undigested food from the ileum to the colon,\xa0 to prevent the backflow of digested contents from the large intestine and block colon bacteria from spreading back into the small intestine.\xa0''Some possible complications of ileocecal valve removal are:' Excessive bleeding Infection Localized blood clot and smaller blood clots which travel through blood vessels to cause heart and lung complications  Wound dehiscence (a condition where the cut made during a surgical procedure separates or ruptures after being stitched together) Anastomotic leak (intestinal contents may leak through the site of anastomosis) which may lead to body-wide infection. Anastomotic stricture (constriction at the site anastomosis) Scarring and adhesions leading to bowel obstruction"
What is bronchitis?,"'Bronchitis'' refers to the inflammation of the air-carrying tubes in the ''lungs'' (''bronchioles''). The condition is often associated with persistent, nagging ''coughs'' with ''mucus''. The condition often starts as an infection of the nose, throat, ears, or sinuses that later moves to the bronchi.''Bronchitis'' can be acute or chronic:' Acute bronchitis: It is a short-term condition. It is usually caused by a viral infection. Smoking may initiate or worsen the symptoms. Bacterial infection may occasionally cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually goes away in a week or two. The symptoms may at times last for three weeks. Chronic bronchitis: It is less common compared with acute bronchitis. It is defined as cough productive of sputum, lasting for three months of the year for at least two consecutive years. It may block the airflow in the lungs and is classified as a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Chronic bronchitis may begin as cough and inflammation caused by a respiratory infection or illness, exposure to tobacco smoke, or other irritants in the air."
What causes bronchitis?,"'Bronchitis is usually caused by viral infections. It may occasionally result due to ''bacterial infections''. Certain conditions such as ''asthma'' and ''obesity'' may make a person more likely to get bronchitis.''Smokers'' are more likely to get bronchitis. The risk is relatively higher in female smokers than in male smokers.''A history of childhood lung diseases is associated with a high risk of bronchitis.''Exposure to environmental pollutants, dust, and second-hand smoke increases the risk of bronchitis.\xa0''People who have ''allergies'', ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'', a type of digestive\xa0disorder\xa0that occurs when acidic stomach juices or food and fluids back up from the stomach into the food pipe), or a family history of bronchitis are more likely to get bronchitis.' "
What are the symptoms of bronchitis?,"'The commonest symptom of bronchitis is a persistent cough with mucus production. Other symptoms include:' Shortness of breath Fever that is usually low grade Wheezing (a high-pitched, coarse whistling sound when a person breathes) Feeling sick or having a lack of energy Chest discomfort or pain"
Is bronchitis contagious?,'Acute bronchitis may be ''contagious'' because it is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. You may get the infection from the affected person when they sneeze or cough. You may also get the infection if you touch a contaminated object and then touch your face without washing your hands.\xa0''Chronic bronchitis is usually not contagious because it results from a long-term irritation of the airways.' 
What is systolic and diastolic blood pressure?,'Blood pressure is often noted as:' Systolic blood pressure (the highest reading): It denotes the amount of pressure the blood exerts against the artery walls as the heart beats. The upper value is the systolic value. Diastolic pressure (the lowest reading): It denotes the amount of pressure the blood exerts against the artery walls while the heart rests in between the beats. The lower value is the diastolic value.
Which blood pressure reading is more important?,"'The systolic pressure has been given major attention. In most people, the systolic pressure increases with age due to the hardening of the large arteries, the buildup of plaque, and an increased risk of heart and blood vessel diseases. The risk of death from a ''heart attack'' and ''stroke'' doubles with every 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg increase among people aged 40-89 years.''Usually, the physician notes either an elevated systolic or diastolic reading to diagnose ''high blood pressure''.' "
Why is blood pressure measured in mm Hg?,'Millimeters of mercury abbreviates to mm Hg. Mercury was used in the first accurate pressure gauges and still is used as a standard unit of pressure in medicine.' 
What are the different blood pressure categories?,"'Blood pressure can be categorized into five different types:''Normal:'' Blood pressure upto 120/80 mm Hg is normal blood pressure.''Prehypertension'':'' When blood pressure readings consistently range from 120 to 139 systolic and upto 80 mm Hg diastolic, it is known as prehypertensive. People with elevated blood pressure are at a risk of ''high blood pressure'' unless steps are taken to control it.''Hypertension'' stage I:'' In this condition, blood pressure readings consistently range from 140 to 159 systolic or 90-99 mmHg diastolic. Doctors may prescribe lifestyle modifications such as cutting back on salt and ''stress'' along with blood pressure medication to reduce the risk of heart diseases and ''strokes''.''Hypertension'' stage II'': In this condition, blood pressure readings consistently range upto 160 mmHg systolic or higher. The diastolic value is up to 100 mmHg or higher. The doctors may prescribe a combination of two blood pressure medications and lifestyle changes.''Hypertensive crisis: ''This is the most critical condition and requires emergency medical attention. In this condition, the blood pressure suddenly exceeds 180/120 mmHg. Contact the physician immediately if you experience the following symptoms:' Shortness of breath Chest pain Back pain Numbness/weakness Change in vision Difficulty speaking Giddiness Severe headache"
How to maintain normal blood pressure?,"'Lifestyle changes and regular exercises can help to maintain normal blood pressure. Some of the suggested lifestyle changes are as follows:' De-stress  Quit smoking Lose weight Avoid alcohol or at least limit the intake Eat a low-sodium, low-fat diet (the DASH diet) Eat foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium such as bananas, papaya, and milk Regular monitoring of blood pressure after reaching the age of 35 years Practice meditation and other stress-relieving exercises Cut back on caffeine"
Does a 3-snip procedure have any risk?,"'Yes, all operations have some level of risk. The most common risks of the 3-snip procedure include:' Surgery related complications like pain and infection and bleeding Bruising and swelling of the eyelids are the most common complication seen in the procedure Pinkish color tears are normal for the first few days The puncta may become small again, or sometimes may close completely. Further surgery may be needed to correct this."
When is 3-snip recommended?,'An ophthalmologist may recommend a 3-snip punctoplasty if the patient has below symptoms:' Excessive tearing in the eyes Tears overflowing onto the cheeks and causing skin irritation Irritation or redness in the eyes due to using tissues constantly
What is a recovery period after a 3-snip procedure?,"'The patient may be able to resume normal activities within a day after the procedure. If there are no complications, the patient may notice that tears are drained appropriately within a few minutes; however, it may usually take a few months to completely heal. A few common recommendations are given to the patient:' The patient may be asked to rest their eyes for a couple of days. The patient may need to continue pain medications and antibiotics to ease and prevent any further discomfort. The patient may use an ice pack for quick relief. Travelling and driving may not be recommended at least for a week. A few common activities like bending, swimming, engaging in vigorous exercise, or lifting any heavy articles after the surgery may not be recommended. An eye shield or protective glasses may be given to the patient to protect the eye from any injury or infection. Eye makeup is not recommended for a few weeks after surgery."
What is the outlook of the 3-snip procedure?,"'The 3-snip procedure is a minor and minimally invasive procedure with almost no complications. Most of the patients found the procedure to be effective. Patients found the resolution to excessive tearing within 1.2 months postoperatively. Another surgery, such as ''stent'' placement, to drain the eyes is required for very few patients.' "
What is a bicipital tendon?,'The biceps muscle is located on the front of the upper arm and has two tendons known as the bicep tendons (bicipital tendon) that attach it to the bones of the shoulders. The long head of the muscle attaches to the top of the shoulder socket. The short head of the biceps attaches to the bone of the shoulder blade.' 
What is a bicipital tendonitis?,"'Inflammation (swelling) of the long head of the bicep tendon is known as bicipital tendonitis. As tendonitis develops, the covering of the tendon (tendon sheath) can thicken. Damage to the tendon can result in tendon tear and deformity of the arm. Other conditions associated with biceps tendinitis are' Diabetes mellitus Long-term untreated Hypothyroidism  Arthritis of the shoulder joint Injuries to the tissue surrounding the shoulder socket Dislocation of shoulder Degenerative alteration in a shoulder joint in which there is excessive friction between joint tissues Diseases that cause inflammation of the shoulder lining"
Who should avoid taking bicipital tendon injections?,'Taking injections should be avoided in the following conditions:' Infection of the overlying skin Presence of a bleeding disorder Severe low blood platelet count Infection of the muscular and skeletal system Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
How is a bicipital tendon injection administered?,"'You will be made to sit with hands on the lap; you need to relax your shoulders and neck. The doctor identifies the site of injection, marks the site, and sterilizes it with ethyl ''alcohol''. The doctor fills the syringe with a local anesthetic and ''corticosteroid''. Next, the doctor inserts the needle in the marked area. After inserting the needle, the physician injects the corticosteroid. Once the steroids are injected, the physician withdraws the needle. An ''ultrasound'' may be used to guide the needle towards the tendon.' "
What care should be taken after a bicipital tendon injection?,"'You need to consider the following aftercare instructions:' Complete rest for one to two days. Keep the injected area dry and clean. Apply ice packs for 15 minutes every four to six hours on the shoulder. Take acetaminophen in case of pain or soreness. Avoid lifting anything heavy for 30 days after the injection. Avoid regular activities, workouts, and sports, until fully recovered. Repeat the injection, if the improvement rate is less than 50% after 8 to 12 weeks. Consult the doctor if the symptoms persist for more than three months."
What are the complications of bicipital tendon injection?,'The most prominent issue of bicipital tendon injection is infective arthritis. Other complications include:' Infection Tendon rupture or tear Cigarette-paper like skin (repeated injections or faulty injection technique) Ecchymosis (discoloration of the skin due to bruises) Chronic pressure pain Osteoporosis (brittle bones) Nerve damage Chronic pain
What is a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy?,"'A sphincterotomy'' is a complex procedure that involves the use of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera at one end) and imaging techniques to manipulate the sphincter of Oddi.\xa0 ''\xa0''A biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy is a procedure that ''cuts'' the muscle (sphincter) between the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. This procedure uses a catheter (flexible tube) and wire to remove ''gallstones'' or any other blockages.' "
Why is a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy done?,'The most common use of a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy is removing blockages in the bile ductular system. Below are a few common conditions where a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy is performed:' Removal of common bile duct (CBD) stones Treatment of papillary stenosis or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (bile obstruction) Stent placement Tissue sampling
Which patients should not undergo a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy?,"'Patients with the following conditions are not recommended to undergo a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy:''However, patients having swelling in the pancreas due to bile obstruction can be considered for this procedure.' Heart disease such as myocardial infarction Severe lung disease such as severe cardiopulmonary disease Acute pancreatitis (swelling in the pancreas).  Dye allergies Abnormal blood conditions such as uncorrected severe coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia (bleeding disorders)"
What triggers the sphincter of Oddi pain?,"'The sphincter of Oddi'' refers to the smooth muscle that surrounds the terminal portion of the common bile duct and pancreatic duct. This muscle relaxes during a meal to allow bile and pancreatic juices to flow into the intestine.\xa0''Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction'' refers to the medical condition in which the sphincter (smooth muscle) loses its ability to contract and relax in a normal fashion. This may obstruct bile flow resulting in biliary ''pain'' and obstruction of the flow of pancreatic juice, leading to ''pancreatitis''.\xa0''The cause of this dysfunction is unknown; however, several theories suggest that the presence of microscopic stones in the bile and duodenal (part of the intestine) swelling could be the causes of this dysfunction.\xa0''The most common symptom of this dysfunction is recurrent steady ''pain'' in the abdominal upper right area.\xa0' This pain may worsen after meals, particularly after fatty foods.  Medications such as opiates may also worsen the pain.  Patients may present with recurrent persistent pain after gallbladder removal.  Patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may require a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy for long-term pain relief."
How is a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy performed?,"'A biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy'' is performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon passes a thin instrument into the area of the small intestine where the sphincter of Oddi is located and cuts the muscle. The surgeon will ensure that there are no stones in the gallbladder.' After the patient is given anesthesia, vitals are monitored throughout the procedure. In this procedure, the surgeon passes a cannula (flexible tube) to the bile duct through the papilla of Vater (an organ in the small intestine) using an electrocautery sphincterotome (a surgical instrument that has a metal wire covered by an insulating sheath, with the 20-30 mm of wire exposed, and a short radio-opaque, tapered tip for passing current). The surgeon makes a small cut measuring approximately 1 cm through the sphincter of Oddi and on the duodenal portion of the common bile duct, creating an opening from which bile can flow. Through the same opening, the surgeon removes the microscopic stones as well."
What are the risks involved in a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy?,"'Endoscopic sphincterotomy complications'' are related either to the ''drugs'' used during the procedure or to the results of dye injection or cutting of tissue.' Anesthesia risks such as headache, vomiting, and drowsiness Perforation during surgery Inflammation of the pancreas is the most common complication. Inflammation of cholangitis (bile ducts) Bacteremia (the passage of bacteria into the bloodstream) Severe bleeding"
What is the outcome after a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy?,"'In most cases,'' ''a biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy can provide a good relief from pain and other symptoms of dysfunction. However, this procedure is usually considered only after the medical treatment has failed.\xa0''A biliary endoscopic sphincterotomy is a difficult procedure that has a fairly high risk of complications. Approximately 5%-15% of patients develop complications such as swelling of the pancreas, but in some cases, the complications are severe and may require a long stay in the hospital.\xa0''According to studies, the overall success rate of this procedure is 70%.' "
What is a Bristow procedure?,'Bristow procedure and its variants are performed to treat shoulder instability caused by\xa0shoulder blade problems (glenoid defects).\xa0''The outer end on the scapula (shoulder blade) is called the glenoid. It meets the head of the humerus (the bone of the upper arm) to form the glenohumeral ''cavity''. This functions as a flexible ''ball-and-socket joint''. The joint is stabilized by a ring of cartilage called the labrum.\xa0' 
Why is a Bristow procedure done?,"'Indications for open surgical intervention include recurrent anterior shoulder instability after the failure of a course of nonsurgical management. If glenoid bone loss is judged to be greater than 25-30%, restoration of bone loss must be considered as an option to prevent recurrent instability.' "
When is Bristow procedure avoided?," Instability associated with weakness of the deltoid muscle, rotator cuff and/or muscles around the scapula Multidirectional instability associated with generalized ligament laxity Voluntary instability Uncontrolled epilepsy (seizures)"
How is a Bristow procedure performed?," The surgery is performed under general anesthesia or intravenous sedation.  The coracoid process (an anteriorly projecting hook-like process on the outer edge of the scapula/ shoulder blades) is transferred through the subscapularis tendon. The subscapularis is the largest muscle in the rotator cuff of the shoulder (the group of muscles that attaches the upper arm to your shoulder). These muscles help to lift and rotate the arm. Postoperatively, pain can be managed with pain killers.  Swelling and bruising usually resolve in about two weeks.  The patient would be placed in a shoulder immobilizer for approximately one week, after which the patient is transferred to a standard shoulder sling for three to four weeks. Full extension of the elbow is not allowed, but flexion is encouraged.  Guided exercises can begin in three to six weeks.  After six weeks, complete range of motion of the shoulder can be initiated. Regular follow-up with the surgeon is advised."
What are the complications of a Bristow procedure?,'Some complications that may be encountered are:' Recurrent instability of the shoulder Loss of external rotation Nonunion of the coracoid transfer Screw-related problems Injury to the nerves and blood vessels
What is a bronchovascular sleeve resection?,"'Bronchovascular sleeve resection'' is a surgery performed for ''lung cancer''. It is usually performed when the ''tumor'' invades the pulmonary artery (the artery carrying blood from the ''right ventricle'' of the ''heart'' to the ''lungs'' for oxygenation), as well as the bronchus. For example, tumors located in the upper left lobe of the lung. The surgery aims to preserve the bronchial blood supply.''During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes called bronchus (bronchi). The bronchi open into the lungs. Within the lungs, the bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. The end of bronchioles opens into little air sacs called alveoli, which aid in gaseous exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels, which help exchange gases, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.' "
Why is bronchovascular sleeve resection done?,'Bronchovascular sleeve resection is indicated in:' The primary tumor involving the ongoing pulmonary artery and the bronchial wall Bulky peribronchial and perivascular metastatic nodal disease inseparable from the ongoing pulmonary artery and bronchial wall
When should bronchovascular sleeve resection not be done?,"'Contraindications to bronchovascular sleeve resection are as follows:' When complete resection is not achievable by bronchovascular sleeve resection Metastatic disease to lung (i.e., the lung is not the primary site of cancer) Recurrent lung cancer Small cell lung cancer Metastasis (spread of cancer from the lung to the rest of the body) Poor health status"
How is bronchovascular sleeve resection performed?,"'There are a few stages to having a bronchovascular sleeve resection done, including before, during, and after surgery.''A surgeon takes a detailed history and performs physical examination and may advise the following tests:''The surgery is performed under general anesthesia, and there are various surgical approaches to perform bronchovascular sleeve resection. The choice of technique depends on the extent of the disease and the surgeon’s discretion.''Following resection of the tumor, the surgeon proceeds to perform bronchial and pulmonary artery reconstruction''Patients are typically monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 24 to 48 hours. Patients require chest physiotherapy. The patient can mobilize within the first 48 hours. Postoperative can be managed with ''pain'' killers. Swelling and ''bruising'' typically resolve in one to two weeks. The patients typically stay in the hospital for three to seven days after surgery.' Chest X-ray Chest computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast dye Positron emission tomography scan Magnetic resonance imaging Bronchoscopy Pulmonary function test Lung perfusion quantitation scan  Evaluation of surrounding lymph nodes  Traditionally, this technique has been performed through an open thoracotomy (open surgery), because of the complex anatomy of the airway. Open surgery also provides easier access to perform reconstruction. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become a popular surgical approach over the past few decades. VATS is less invasive. Small incisions are made on the skin above the chest cavity to insert a thoracoscope (camera with a light source) and surgical instruments. VATS also allows quicker recovery and is associated with lesser postoperative pain than open thoracotomy. Robotic-assisted technology is also available to perform bronchovascular sleeve resection."
What are the complications of bronchovascular sleeve resection?,'Some complications encountered during surgery are:' Respiratory failure Pneumonia (lung infection) Bleeding Atelectasis (collapse of the lung) Cardiac (heart) problems Deep vein thrombosis: Blood clot in deep-lying veins Pulmonary embolism: Blood clot in the lungs Pain and/or infection at the incision site Reaction to anesthesia
What is a calf augmentation procedure?,"'Calf augmentation is a surgical procedure to enhance the appearance of the leg. It usually involves placing an implant made of silicone over the muscles along the calf, usually performed by ''plastic'' and reconstructive surgeons.' "
Why is calf augmentation done?,"'Deformity''Cosmetic reasons' If the lower leg is shrunken following injury or disease, an implant in the calf can help minimize the deformity. Calf implants won’t improve the function of the legs but may restore normal appearance. Persons with naturally thin or underdeveloped calf muscles, despite exercise or diet may seek calf implants. Women may desire only the inner leg to be filled out. Body builders may want larger calf augmentations, and both the inner and outer lower leg to be filled out."
Who should not get calf implants?,'Doctors avoid this surgery in people with' Unrealistic expectations and aesthetic goals Systemic conditions Vascular (blood vessel) problems Severe medical conditions of the legs Tendency to form keloids or thick scars
How is the calf augmentation procedure performed?,"'The patient has''After the procedure and recovery period:' Historical and physical assessment by the surgeon. Routine blood and radiological tests. The procedure can be performed under local anesthesia or combined with general intravenous sedation. There will be no pain during the procedure. An approximately 4-cm incision is made behind the knee. Underlying fat, superficial and deep connective tissue (fascia) is dissected. A standard or custom-made implant made of silicone is inserted, lying flat against the muscle. The wound is sutured and dressed. Painkillers and antibiotics may be administered. Bed rest is advised for 12 to 14 hours. Rest with the legs elevated, without bending the knees. Patients are usually discharged 24 hours after surgery. Dressing to be kept on for around seven days. After seven days, pressure stockings may have to be worn for five weeks to provide support to the implant and keep it compressed against the muscle. Patients can walk and take care of themselves 24 hours after surgery. Patients can resume short walks and light work after seven days. Standing for long periods and lifting heavy objects should be avoided for three weeks. Patients can resume exercise and sports after eight to 10 weeks. Patients can resume work based on the nature and requirements of the job after a discussion with the surgeon. Scars generally heal well and are barely visible with time."
What are the risks and complications of calf augmentation?,"'Calf augmentation is a relatively safe procedure with low mortality and relatively few incidences of complications. As with any surgery, there are complication risks, most of which resolve on their own or with treatment.''Some possible complications are:' Pressure problems due to tight dressing or large implants that may lead to severe pain Swelling Necrosis (tissue death) Skin slough (loss of skin) Hematoma (collection of blood forming a blood clot) Seroma (collection of fluid) Edema (swelling due to inflammation) Infection Loss of sensation around surgical site, usually temporary Thickening of scar, keloid formation or hyperpigmentation (darkening of skin) The edges of the implants can show, affecting cosmetic appearance Long-term complication of the implant As it is a foreign material to the body, there is a risk of hardening around the implant"
What are the risks involved in catheter ablation?,"'Even with minimally invasive ablation procedures, there are several risks that you should know about:' Bleeding at the site of incision Puncture of the heart Damage to blood vessels Blood clots Worsened arrhythmia symptoms Heart tissue inflammation (pericarditis) Collapsed lung from deflating the lung in surgery, which is correctable with a chest tube Heart muscle or heart nerve damage Infection Leg nerve injury Stroke or heart attack Very rarely, the procedure causes death"
What are the precautions after catheter ablation?,"'Ablation procedures can be very successful, but for some people, they may need to have it repeated. Medications may need to be continued even after ablation. There is a range of changes you can make to your\xa0lifestyle\xa0that may help to improve your heart health and prevent further problems. These include:' Avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine like in coffee, alcohol, and nicotine from smoking. Have blood pressure and cholesterol monitored regularly and keep them under control. Be active. Check with the doctor or nurse to know the safe and reasonable level of activity or exercise for you before you start. Reduce stress and find ways to manage or control any stress you cannot avoid. Eat heart-healthy foods and maintain a healthy weight. Go for regular checkups. They will help you maintain your quality of life."
What is a choledochojejunostomy?,"'A choledochojejunostomy is a surgical procedure to make a connection (anastomosis) between the common bile duct and the jejunum, which is the middle portion of the small intestine. This technique is called the Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy.''The common bile duct is the tubular channel that drains the bile from the ''liver'' and gallbladder, through the pancreas, into the duodenum, the beginning portion of the small intestine. Bile helps in digesting ''fats'' and fat-soluble ''vitamins'' in the small intestine.''An alternative procedure is choledochoduodenostomy, which creates an anastomosis between the common bile duct and the duodenum.''A choledochojejunostomy may be performed as' Open surgery: The surgeon makes a long, midline or right incision and uses surgical tools typical for performing open abdominal surgeries. Laparoscopic surgery: The surgeon makes a single or several tiny incisions. The surgeon then performs the procedure with tiny surgical tools inserted through a flexible tube with a lighted camera (laparoscope). Robotic laparoscopic surgery: A robot operates the tiny surgical tools in the laparoscope. The surgeon uses a computer terminal to direct and control the robotic equipment."
Why is a choledochojejunostomy performed?,"'Choledochojejunostomy is performed to remove obstruction in the common bile duct and restore the continuity of the biliary tract.

How is choledochojejunostomy performed?,"'A choledochojejunostomy is performed under general anesthesia by a gastrointestinal surgeon.''Prior to a choledochojejunostomy, the patient may be required to undergo''The patient must' Blood, urine, and imaging tests. Specific imaging tests for biliary anatomy, such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). A procedure to decompress the biliary system in the case of complete obstruction or presence of jaundice, known as percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD). Correction treatment in the case of blood coagulation disorders because of liver dysfunction. A course of antibiotics for infection. Avoid eating or drinking 8 hours prior to the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient is intubated to provide oxygen. The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the abdomen depending on the type of surgery. The surgeon cuts the jejunum about 25 cm to 30 cm from the end of the duodenum. The lower section of the jejunum is taken up to the common bile duct. The surgeon severs the common bile duct above the level of obstruction and connects it to the jejunum with sutures. Bile fluid is removed for a culture test. The upper section of the severed jejunal tract is connected to the jejunum farther down. A stent is placed for bile drainage. The abdominal muscles and the incision are closed with sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia and administered painkillers for post-surgical pain. The patient will be monitored in the recovery room for several hours. The patient may need hospitalization for up to a week depending on the type of surgery. Complete recovery may take up to 6 weeks during which period the patient may needTo be on a special dietAvoid heavy liftingAvoid strenuous activities To be on a special diet Avoid heavy lifting Avoid strenuous activities Patients with malignancies may need continued treatment."
What are the risks and complications of choledochojejunostomy?,"'Complications associated with choledochojejunostomy include the following:''Side effects of anesthesia such as''Surgical risks such as:' nausea, headache, and confusion Wound infection Hemorrhage Blood clots Pneumonia Damage to nearby organs, blood vessels or nerves Anastomotic leakage or stricture Biliary drainage tube dislodgement Collection of bile fluid in the abdominal cavity (biloma) Inflammation of the stomach lining (peritonitis) Inflammation of the common bile duct Abdominal abscess Lower common bile duct stump leak Incisional hernia Infection and sepsis"
What does a chromoendoscopy mean?,"'A chromoendoscopy is a diagnostic procedure in which a chemical substance (called a stain or pigment) is sprayed inside the gut to highlight specific areas or distinguish among the different types of cell layers. This helps visualize the inner surface of the bowel (epithelia) during ''endoscopy''. Chromoendoscopy is a simple, cost-effective, quick, and safe diagnostic method that improves the recognition of the tiny changes in the surface pattern. It does this by enhancing the contrast of raised and deepened areas.\xa0''Three types of stains can be used for chromoendoscopy:' Absorptive or vital stains: These stains diffuse or are selectively absorbed across specific epithelia (e.g., Lugol's solution and methylene blue). Contrast stains: These stains highlight surface irregularities (topography) of the inside of the gut by filling the mucosal crevices (e.g., methylene blue). Reactive stains: As the name suggests, these stains undergo chemical reactions with specific cell components, resulting in a color change (e.g., congo red and phenol red)."
Why is a chromoendoscopy performed?,"'A chromoendoscopy may be done to diagnose:''A chromoendoscopy may be used for treatment approaches like:''A chromoendoscopy is avoided if there is a history of an ''allergy'' to the dye or stain used for the procedure.' Barrette esophagus: A condition in which the normal, flat pink lining of the food pipe (esophagus) becomes thickened and red because of the damage caused by acid reflux Cancer of the esophagus Stomach cancers Gut polyps: Small clump of cells formed on the lining of the gut, especially the colon Cancer of the intestine (bowel) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): A medical conditions which involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract or gut (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease) A chromoendoscopy may be used along with other advanced endoscopic imaging techniques such as magnification endoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy and confocal endocytoscopy Endoscopic mucosal resection Photodynamic therapy "
Why is a chromoendoscopy performed in an ulcerative colitis?,"'An ''ulcerative colitis'' is a type of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), a condition in which there is long-term inflammation of the ''large intestine'' (colon) with peculiar sores or ulcers in the inner lining of the colon. The condition may involve severe ''diarrhea'', ''pain'' in the abdomen, ''loss of appetite'', ''fatigue'', ''fever'', and ''weight loss''.''An ''ulcerative colitis'' increases the risk of cancers of the colon and rectum. A chromoendoscopy helps monitor the signs of progression toward ''cancer''. In this technique, a dye is sprayed via an endoscope inside the gut which helps the doctor see which parts are affected by the ulcerative ''colitis''.\xa0It enables the visualization of the inside of the colon and takes targeted biopsies. It also helps the doctor provide early management for the ''prevention'' of the development of ''cancer'' and if cancer has developed, to treat it at an early stage. Besides better visualization, the procedure has the advantage of being accurate, safe, quick and less expensive for monitoring or surveillance in case of an ulcerative colitis.' "
What is a colon resection?,"'Colon resection'' (colectomy) is the surgical removal of part or all of the colon. The surgeon removes the diseased part of the colon and connects the remaining healthy parts (anastomosis).\xa0''A colon resection may be performed as an\xa0''Colon resection for certain rectal ''cancers'' may include removal of the nearby ''lymph nodes''.''After some colectomies, the doctor may also perform a ''colostomy''. Colostomy is a procedure where the surgeon makes an opening in the stomach wall (''stoma'') and attaches a bag to the open end of the colon. The feces will collect in the bag instead of being excreted normally.''The colostomy may be performed when,\xa0''Colostomy may be a temporary procedure that is reversed after about 12 weeks, or permanent in some patients.' Open resection: conventional surgery with a single, long incision. Laparoscopic resection: minimally invasive, with two or four tiny incisions using surgical tools through a flexible tube with a lighted camera (laparoscope). Robot-assisted laparoscopic resection: laparoscopic surgery with tiny surgical tools attached to robots controlled by the surgeon. there is a healing problem in the resected colon not enough healthy colon is left the rectum and anus are removed"
What is the colon?,"'The colon, also known as the ''large intestine'' or large bowel, is the final part of the ''digestive system''. The colon reabsorbs the fluids and nutrients from the gastric contents, and processes the waste, to be excreted via the rectum and anus.''The colon consists of' The cecum is the beginning part of the colon in the bottom right abdomen receives the digested food from ileum, the final part of the small intestine. The ascending colon in the right side of the abdomen pushes the bowel contents up from the cecum to the transverse colon while absorbing the remaining fluids and nutrients in the contents. The transverse colon pushes the digested matter across the abdomen from the ascending to the descending colon. The descending colon in the left side of the abdomen receives the contents from the transverse colon and further processes the waste to form stools (feces). The Sigmoid colon is the terminal part of the colon which stores the fecal matter received from the descending colon till it is emptied into the rectum and passed out of the anus."
What are the types of colon resection?,"'Colon resection may be partial or whole. Following are the types of colectomy:' Total colectomy: removal of the entire colon. Subtotal colectomy: removal of most of the colon. Segmental colectomy: removal of a segment of the colon Hemicolectomy: removal of the right or left half of the colon. Proctocolectomy: removal of rectum in addition to the colon. Low anterior resection: removal of sigmoid colon and upper rectum. Abdominoperineal resection: removal of sigmoid colon, rectum and anus. Proctectomy: removal of the rectum."
Why would you have a colon resection?,'A colon resection is performed to treat and prevent diseases of the colon. It is usually considered after less invasive methods have failed to provide relief to the patient. It may be performed as an emergency procedure for certain acute conditions such as major hemorrhage and perforation to the bowel.''A doctor may perform a colon resection for the following conditions:''Colon resection may be done as a treatment or a precautionary measure in people with ''inherited'' conditions that predispose them to developing ''precancerous'' polyps or being at high risk for ''colorectal cancer''.'

Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer: a genetic condition with high risk of colorectal cancer without development of many polyps.
What is the outlook of patients with colpectomy?,"'The success rate of the colpectomy is between 90-95%. After the procedure, the patient may have ''tiredness'', ''spotting'', and ''pain'', which is usually managed through a good ''diet'' and ''pain'' medications. Most women recover well and find relief from prolapse symptoms. The patient may usually feel fit within 60 days with proper care. Colpectomy is only advised to patients who are not sexually active and when the patient is completely sure that she will never want to have intercourse again. Patients will continue to pass urine and have bowel movements in the same fashion. This technique has a high rate of success and safety.' "
Who undergoes colpocleisis?,"'Surgery for uterine prolapse is usually performed when women don’t show improvement with other non-invasive treatment options. Because colpocleisis is less invasive than reconstructive surgery, it is preferred in patients who have systemic medical conditions and are hence unfit for more extensive surgeries. This procedure is usually recommended for older, post-menopausal women who are no longer sexually active and don’t wish to be sexually active in the future either. Women will not be able to have vaginal intercourse after colpocleisis because the vagina would be too narrow. The surgery also prevents access to the cervix and uterus; hence, performing a ''pap smear'' of the cervix and other diagnostic tests of the uterus or fallopian tubes would not be possible.' "
How is a colpocleisis procedure performed?,"'During surgery:''The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia (anesthesia below the level of the waist). Hence, there will not be any ''pain'' during surgery. The surgeon sutures (stitches) the anterior (front) and posterior (back) walls of the vagina together to shorten the vagina. The sutures used are absorbable and get absorbed in a few months. The surgery usually takes around an hour. A catheter may be placed in the bladder to drain out urine, which may be removed after 24-48 hours, so the patient would not have to walk to the bathroom.''After surgery:''Patients are usually discharged 24-48 hours after the surgery. The urinary catheter is removed before discharge. Patients may have to wear compression stockings while on bed rest to prevent the formation of ''blood clots'' in the blood vessels. Painkillers and antibiotics would be prescribed. Patients experience bloody ''vaginal discharge'' for a few days to weeks after the surgery, for which they would need to wear sanitary pads. The recovery period after colpocleisis is usually shorter and less painful compared with that after reconstructive surgery. Patients can resume their daily activities a few days to a few weeks following surgery, after consulting with the surgeon. Patients are advised to avoid lifting heavy objects or rigorous exercises for up to six weeks. Complete recovery may take six to eight weeks. Patients can urinate and defecate normally after surgery, but they would not be able to engage in vaginal intercourse.' "
What are the complications of a colpocleisis procedure?,"'Colpocleisis is relatively safe, but like any surgery, there is a risk of complications. They include:' Bleeding Infection Blood clots in the blood vessels Damage to the surrounding organs, muscles, nerves, and other tissues Reaction to anesthesia"
What is compartment syndrome?,"'Compartment syndrome'' is a painful condition caused by excessive pressure building up within and between muscles.\xa0''The muscles in your arms and legs'' are divided into groups by thick bands of tissue called fascia. The fascia has some openings or compartments which contain muscle tissue, nerves, and blood vessels. The fascia is non-expandable.\xa0''Swelling due to the collection of fluids'' in the openings or compartments causes the fascia to be pushed against the muscles, nerves, or blood vessels within the arms and legs. This condition is called ''compartment syndrome''.''The high pressure can damage muscles and nerves, ''which can decrease blood flow. Compartment syndromes may develop suddenly (acute compartment syndrome) or gradually over time (chronic compartment syndrome).\xa0''In either case, compartment syndrome can lead to ''severe and permanent damage ''if left untreated. Compartment syndrome can happen at any site within the body. The\xa0leg, however,\xa0is most frequently affected. Other sites include\xa0' the forearm,  buttocks,  hand,  foot,  arm,  thigh and  back."
What is a compartment pressure measurement test?,"'A compartment pressure measurement test'' is a method to determine the pressure within the muscle compartment. It is done to diagnose compartment syndrome, which is a condition of increased pressure in the non-stretchable space containing nerves, blood vessels, and muscles.\xa0''This may result in damage to the structures within the compartment. If the test shows an increased pressure within the compartment, urgent surgery may be done to ''decompress'' and save the tissues from further damage.''Indications include:''Symptoms suggestive of a compartment syndrome such as' A severe injury such as a car crash Badly bruised muscle Fracture Crush injury Tight bandage or cast Steroid use Excessive pain Pain that becomes severe when stretching muscles Pale skin Tingling or burning feeling in the skin Tightness or fullness in the muscle Numbness/weakness/paralysis Obvious muscle bulging Tightness felt when touching the muscle"
What will happen during a compartment pressure measurement test?,'During the compartment pressure measurement test:' You will be comfortably positioned depending upon the part of the body where compartment pressure is to be measured. The doctor administers local anesthesia.  The doctor then inserts a needle into the muscle. The needle is attached to a machine that gives a compartment pressure reading.  The doctor may exert a little pressure on the affected part or ask you to move the limb or perform any activity that recreates the symptoms. Any rise in compartment pressure is recorded.
Is a compartment pressure measurement test painful?,'A compartment pressure measurement test can be painful. Local anesthesia reduces the pain to some extent. The discomfort caused by the test typically goes away once the test is completed.' 
What can be the complications of a compartment pressure measurement test?,"'The compartment pressure measurement test is relatively safe. The risks, although low, include:' Infection Pain Bruising Bleeding  Nerve damage Muscle injury Development of acute compartment syndrome and the need for urgent surgery "
Why is a cystography test done?,"'Cystography provides information on the bladder and detects any abnormalities such as diverticula, fistulas, or traumatic bladder rupture. In case of trauma, cystography is done in the presence of ''hematuria'' (''blood in the urine'') or ''hip fracture'' with microscopic hematuria (there is no visible ''blood in the urine'', but ''red blood cells'' are seen in a microscopic examination of urine). Cystography may be indicated in the following conditions:' Vesicocourethral reflux (VUR): It is indicated for the evaluation of VUR. Hydronephrosis: It is swelling of the kidney due to accumulation of urine, which occurs due to obstruction of the flow of urine out of the kidney. Enuresis: It is the inability to control urination despite being old enough to be able to exercise bladder control, resulting in involuntary urination. This is called urinary incontinence. Incontinence: It is a loss of bladder control. Voiding (urinating) dysfunction: The voiding dysfunction term is used to describe conditions associated with inconsistent coordination within the urinary tract between the muscles of the bladder and urethra, resulting in incomplete relaxation or overactivity of the pelvic floor muscles during urination. Congenital genitourinary malformations: These are present since birth."
How is a cystography test performed?,"'The procedure may be performed in a clinic or hospital set up under strict aseptic conditions. An image of the abdomen and pelvis (kidneys–ureters–bladder [KUB]) is first obtained. After this, the patient’s bladder is catheterized (a tube is inserted from the urinary opening), and the stored urine in the bladder is drained. The urine sample may be sent for analysis. The contrast agent that is non-reactive is then introduced through the catheter into the bladder. The amount of the contrast agent introduced into the bladder depends on the capacity of the patient’s bladder, which is usually 300-400 mL in adults and 30 mL in children. Once the contrast is introduced, radiological images of the bladder and urethra are obtained from all angles, after which the contrast is drained out. There is minimal discomfort during the procedure. Non-cooperative patients, especially children, may receive a short-acting sedative to reduce discomfort and ''anxiety''. The patient can usually go home right after the procedure and resume all their regular activities.' "
What are the complications of a cystography test?,"'Cystography is a safe procedure, but rarely, complications may occur that include:' Urinary tract infection, mainly due to the catheter being introduced Injury caused by the catheter being inserted, resulting in frank bleeding or blood-stained urging Discomfort during urination, which usually resolves in a few hours after the procedure Allergic reaction to the contrast agent"
When does your doctor suggest a diagnostic hysteroscopy?,'Your gynecologist will suggest a diagnostic hysteroscopy to check the inside of your womb and take a tissue sample (biopsy) if you have''It is useful to diagnose' Abnormal bleeding during periods. Heavy periods. Repeated abortions. Infertility (difficulty becoming pregnant). Bleeding after menopause. Uterine fibroids (non-cancerous growths of the fibrous tissue in the womb). Uterine polyps (abnormal tissue growth inside the womb lining). Uterine adhesions (scar tissue formation in the womb). Endometrial cancer (cancer of the womb lining). Endometrial hyperplasia (enlargement of the womb tissues).
What happens during the procedure?,"'Diagnostic hysteroscopy may be done in a clinic under local or no anesthesia. However, if you have more complex issues, it may be done in the hospital in an operating room under local, regional, or general anesthesia.''Before the procedure''During the procedure''After the procedure' You will be informed to empty your bladder. You will be prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The vaginal area will be cleaned and shaved. An intravenous line may be put on your arm and sedatives will be given if required. You will be asked to lie down on your back and keep your feet in stirrups. Your gynecologist may dilate your cervix for an easier view. A hysteroscope (thin flexible scope) will be inserted into your vagina toward the cervix into your uterus (womb). Saline fluid or gas may be pumped through the hysteroscope to expand your womb for a better view. Your gynecologist will view and check the womb linings through the hysteroscope and take photographs or videos. If your gynecologist feels that it is required to take a tissue sample, they may pass a small instrument through the hysteroscope and take a tissue sample. If further your gynecologist feels the need for a procedure such as a fibroid removal, a tool is inserted through the hysteroscope. For some complex issues, your gynecologist may insert a laparoscope through your belly to view outside of your womb at the same time. When the procedure is done, the hysteroscope is removed. Your recovery will vary based on the type of anesthesia used during the procedure. If your doctor uses general anesthesia or sedative, then your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored until they are stable and you are alert. Once you are stable, you will be discharged."
What to expect?," You may feel sleepy if you are given general anesthesia during the procedure. You will recover rapidly after this procedure and can return to your normal activities within a few hours to one to two hours. You can start taking a normal diet unless your doctor tells you otherwise. You may have uterine cramps for a day or two, which will be normally managed with over-the-counter painkillers. You may experience minimal-to-moderate bleeding from the vagina or spotting. You may feel gaseous distension and pain in the upper belly or shoulder due to gases used during the procedure, which may last for 24 hours. Pain can be managed with some painkillers. You will be informed to Take pain relievers for your soreness as advised by your doctor.Not take aspirin or certain other medicines because this may increase your chances of bleeding.Not douche (showering of the vagina with water) or have sex for the next two weeks after the procedure.Avoid using tampons for some weeks. Take pain relievers for your soreness as advised by your doctor. Not take aspirin or certain other medicines because this may increase your chances of bleeding. Not douche (showering of the vagina with water) or have sex for the next two weeks after the procedure. Avoid using tampons for some weeks."
What are the possible complications?,"'It is a generally safe procedure, and significant complications are very rare. However, if inappropriate instruments or techniques are used, it may cause''You should seek for doctor’s advice if you have' Risk of anesthesia (if general anesthesia was given). Infection. Bleeding. Pelvic inflammatory disease (inflammation of the women’s reproductive organs). Damage to the cervix. Scar tissue formation in the uterus.

Rupture or tearing of the uterus (rare).  Excess fluid/gas buildup during the expansion of the womb. Breathlessness or difficulty in breathing. Fever. Nausea and vomiting. Heavy bleeding from the vagina. Severe tummy pain."
What is a diaphragm?,"'A diaphragm is the main muscle of ''respiration''. It is located below the ''lungs''. The diaphragm is a large, dome-shaped muscle that contracts involuntarily, rhythmically, and continuously. Upon ''inhalation'', the diaphragm contracts and flattens, and then, the chest ''cavity'' enlarges. This contraction creates a vacuum, which pulls air into the lungs. Upon ''exhalation'', the diaphragm relaxes and returns to its domelike shape, and the air is forced out of the lungs.' "
What happens during a diaphragm pacing system procedure?,"'The diaphragm pacing system (DPS) procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia. After the patient is unconscious, his vital parameters are monitored and procedure is started.' The surgeon usually creates four to five dime-size holes in the abdominal region. A laparoscope (tube with a camera) will be inserted so that the diaphragm muscle can be observed. The electrodes are surgically attached to the phrenic nerves on each side of the neck or in the chest. The receivers for the stimulus are surgically placed under the skin in the chest or under the skin of the neck. The antennae are taped on the chest over the receivers. When turned on, the transmitter sends a signal to the receivers through the antennae.  The external transmitter generates electrical energy like radio wave signals. This energy is converted to electrical current which is conducted to the phrenic nerves on both sides. The nerve stimulation causes the diaphragm muscles to contract and the person takes a breath in.  This cycle repeats for a fixed number of breaths needed each minute. This number is manually set. A proper contraction of diaphragm via external stimulation is checked before the procedure is terminated. DPS procedure usually works on a battery that is generally changed every three weeks. After the procedure, the laparoscope is removed, and wounds are covered with bandage. This entire procedure is completed within 90 minutes."
Who is eligible for a diaphragm pacing system?,'A diaphragm pacing system (DPS) is recommended for:' Patients who are at least 18 years of age or older and can be committed to DPS treatment. Patients with a cervical spinal cord injury and who are dependent on mechanical ventilation. Patients who are clinically stable following a spinal cord injury. Have a committed primary caregiver (caregiver will be required to devote several hours during the day operating the system). Female patients (of childbearing age) must have a negative pregnancy test. Patients with a normal or almost normal lung functions.
Who is not eligible for a diaphragm pacing system?,"'A diaphragm pacing system (DPS) is not recommended for:' Patients who have any medical conditions which would interfere with the surgery. Patients with active lung disease, heart disease, or brain disease. Patients who require supplemental oxygen use. Patients who have been hospitalized or treated for an active infection within the last three months before DPS procedure. Patients with a significant chest deformity (scoliosis). Females who are currently pregnant or breastfeeding. Overweight patients. Patients who do not have a care taker."
What are the benefits of a diaphragm pacing system over ventilator system?,'Patients on mechanical ventilation usually opt for a diaphragm pacing system (DPS) because of the following benefits:' DPS decreases secretions. It helps in decreasing lung infections. DPS decreases lifetime costs (only need one ventilator instead of two). Increases life expectancy and quality of life. Helps patient to breathe more naturally due to which patient’s speech is improved. Patient can continue daily activities with minimum effort. Improves patients’ sense of smell and taste.
What are the risks involved in diaphragm pacing system?,'The risks involved in diaphragm pacing system:' Pain and spasm at the surgical site Nausea after the anesthesia Rare damage to internal organs  The expected risks with any general anesthesia (headache and drowsiness)
What is a trigger finger?,"'A ''trigger finger'' (''stenosing tenosynovitis'') is a painful condition in which one of the fingers gets stuck in one position and then snaps straight. The affected finger may bend or straighten with a snap like a trigger being pulled and released.\xa0 ''This condition occurs when swelling narrows the space within the sheath that surrounds the tendon (a fibrous tissue) in the affected finger. In severe cases, the finger may become locked in a bent position.\xa0''People whose work or hobbies require repetitive gripping actions are at higher risk of developing a trigger finger. Moreover, the condition is more common in women and people with ''diabetes''.' "
What is a digital flexor injection?,"'Corticosteroids'' can be used to ''reduce swelling. ''A digital flexor injection is a conservative treatment for a trigger finger.\xa0''In this treatment, the affected area is injected with a ''corticosteroid''. This treatment may provide temporary but rapid relief from the ''pain'' and triggering.\xa0''A digital flexor injection is usually administered under ''local anesthesia.'' The finger to be injected is cleaned with ''iodine'' solution or ''alcohol''. Liquid corticosteroids mixed with local anesthetics are injected into the tendon sheath (the membrane that the tendon slides through) at the base of the affected finger or thumb.\xa0''The patient experiences momentary ''pain'' during the procedure. However, the area becomes numb within some time.\xa0''Corticosteroids are thought to work by reducing tendon swelling, allowing the tendon to move freely again. This can sometimes happen within a few days of having the injection, but it usually takes a few weeks.' "
Is a digital flexor injection effective?,"'Corticosteroid or digital flexor injections ''are effective in an estimated 50 to 70% of people with a trigger finger. However, they are generally less effective in people with certain underlying health conditions, such as ''diabetes'' and ''rheumatoid arthritis''.\xa0''This injection can permanently improve the trigger finger, but in some cases, the problem can return after treatment. Although patients can have a second injection if the first injection effect wears off, it is often less effective than the earlier injection.' "
How many times can an individual get a steroid injection or digital flexor injection?,"'A digital flexor injection can be safely administered three times, but overuse of steroid injections can lead to various complications. Doctors typically advise steroid injections'' no more than three times.' "
What are the risks of a digital flexor injection?,"'The risks of corticosteroid injections'' used for a trigger finger are very rare. Very occasionally, it causes some thinning or color change of the skin at the injection site. There is also a very low risk of infection.\xa0''Usually, patients have anesthesia effects such as ''headache'' and drowsiness. Potential side effects of a digital flexor injection increase with higher doses and repeated use. Side effects include:' Damage of the nearby bone Cartilage damage Joint infection Nerve damage Temporary facial flushing Temporary flare of pain and joint swelling Temporary increase in blood sugar Tendon weakening or rupture Osteoporosis (thinning of the nearby bone) Thinning of the skin and soft tissue around the injection site Whitening or lightening of the skin around the injection site"
What are the common precautions recommended after a digital flexor injection?,"'Patients are usually advised a ''24-hour rest after a digital flexor injection.'' They are also advised to avoid wetting the site and perform any strenuous activity for several days.''The doctor may advise a few painkillers, antibiotics, and antiinflammatory medications for a few days after a digital flexor injection.' "
Who needs a fasciotomy surgery?,"'Fasciotomy surgery is done for the treatment of acute compartment syndrome. Untreated compartment syndrome can lead to severe and permanent damage to nerves, blood vessels, muscles, and other structures present in the compartment. When compartment syndrome is diagnosed and treated through a fasciotomy within 6 hours of onset, overall functional impairment is unlikely.''A fasciotomy may be done in patients who may be suspected of having a compartment syndrome. They include a person with:''A compartment pressure measurement test may be done to determine the pressure within the muscle compartment. If the test shows an increased pressure, an urgent fasciotomy may be done to ''decompress'' and save the tissues from further damage.'

What are the complications of a fasciotomy surgery?,"'A fasciotomy surgery is necessary to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent tissue damage in a person with compartment syndrome. The complications of fasciotomy, although rare, may include:''Certain health conditions may increase the risk of complications. You must talk to your surgeon, before the procedure, if you have certain disease conditions, such as ''diabetes'', or if you are on any medications, such as steroids, ''aspirin'', or blood thinners. You should also tell your doctor if you smoke or consume ''alcohol''. ''Obese'' people may also be at a higher risk of developing complications.' Pain Excessive bleeding Infection Scarring Nerve damage Muscle damage Pruritus (excessive itching) Altered sensation such as numbness Need for future corrective surgeries, which may include an amputation Rhabdomyolysis is a condition that involves the breakdown of muscle tissue, which can cause kidney failure."
What is the femur bone?,'The femur or thigh bone is the longest and strongest bone in the body. It usually takes a lot of force to break the femur. ''Motor vehicle accidents are the number one cause of femur ''fractures''. The femur is the only bone in the thigh that serves as an attachment point for all the muscles that exert force over the hip and knee joints.' 
What is a femoral osteotomy?,"'A femoral osteotomy is a surgical procedure that is performed to correct specific deformities of the femur (thigh bone). Orthopedic surgeons perform this operation to realign it and restore a more normal appearance. During this surgery, the surgeon ''cuts'' a small part of the femur so the bone fits better into the hip socket.' "
Why is a femoral osteotomy done?,"'A femoral osteotomy is most often done in patients who are born with a hip abnormality. In some patients, the pelvic and femur bones may not work together in the right way. The femur may be angled too far forward or backward. They may walk with inward- or outward-facing toes. The surgery is often performed to delay a joint replacement. Surgery is considered for below conditions:''A femoral osteotomy can ease ''pain'' in the hip joint, and it can also help an individual run and walk more normally. Moreover, it can correct inward- or outward-facing toes.' Legs that are of different lengths due to various pathologies Nonunion of a femoral neck fracture Nonunion or malunion of a hip fracture Cerebral palsy: A patient with this condition can have severe muscle spasms that can cause the hips to come out of their sockets. Hip osteoarthritis Fibrous dysplasia (a condition in which repeated microfractures of the femoral neck lead to progressive displacement and abnormal healing of the femur) Femur abnormalities can cause severe pain and mental agony due to the stigma attached to it."
How is femoral osteotomy done?,"'A femoral osteotomy is usually performed under general or spinal anesthesia. The surgery usually takes 90-180 minutes depending upon the cause of the surgery.' The patient is placed on the back on an operating table. A surgeon administers anesthesia to the patient and monitors his/her vitals throughout the surgery. The surgeon makes a cut along the patient’s femur near the hip joint. The surgeon uses X-rays to confirm where he/she will cut out a small part of the femur. The surgeon cuts the femur using an osteotome. The surgeon puts the femur in the right place and turns it to fit as it should into the hip socket. The surgeon attaches a plate with screws or pins to the top of the femur. The plate helps align the femur in the hip socket and keeps the bone in place as it heals. The surgeon then closes up the incision, and the patient is monitored in the hospital for a few days."
What are the common risks involved in a femoral osteotomy?,"'Risks of femoral osteotomy are' Anesthesia risks (headache, nausea, and drowsiness) Infection Bleeding Bone may not heal as it should Nerve damage Arthritis Fracture (broken bone) Clots in the deeper veins Cartilage degeneration Persistence of pain after the surgery"
What is the recovery period of a femoral osteotomy?,"'The patient should be able to put weight on the leg four to six weeks after the surgery. The patient will require help for getting around for a few days. In addition, the patient may be recommended for physical therapy after the surgery.\xa0''In some cases, the metal plate may need to be removed at some point in the future. Within or after six weeks, the patient can start ''walking'' without pain and difficulty.' "
What is a gastrojejunostomy procedure?,"'Gastrojejunostomy is a surgical procedure to create a direct connection (anastomosis) from the stomach to the middle part of the small intestine (jejunum), bypassing or removing the beginning part of the small intestine (duodenum).' "
What are the types of gastrojejunostomy?,"'Depending on the individual requirement, a doctor may perform one of the following types of gastrojejunostomy:''A percutaneous gastrojejunostomy may also be performed along with an ''endoscopy'' as a hybrid procedure.' Open surgery: The surgeon accesses the nerve with a long, midline incision and surgical tools typical for open abdominal surgeries. Laparoscopic surgery: The surgeon makes a single or several tiny incisions.  The surgeon then performs the procedure with tiny surgical tools  inserted through a flexible, lighted, viewing tube (laparoscope) Robotic laparoscopic surgery: A  robot  operates  the tiny surgical tools in the laparoscope. The surgeon uses a computer terminal to direct and control the robot.     Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy: A minimally invasive procedure to place a feeding tube through the stomach wall and the stomach’s interior    through the duodenum into the jejunum. Endoscopic gastrojejunostomy: A  recently developed procedure to place a stent in the jejunum using a flexible tube (endoscope) passed through the nose, through the upper digestive tract."
Why is a gastrojejunostomy performed?,"'A gastrojejunostomy is most often performed as a treatment for obstruction in the terminal part of the stomach (pylorus) and the duodenum (gastric outlet obstruction).

What is the gracilis muscle?,'The\xa0gracilis muscle\xa0is one of the\xa0muscles\xa0in the groin. It starts at the external point of the pubic bone (ischiopubic ramus) and extends down to the upper-middle shaft of the shinbone (tibia).' 
What is a flap surgery?,"'Flap surgery is an operation by which a piece tissue (flap) is lifted from a healthy site in the body and moved to a site of defect while still attached to a blood supply.''Types of flaps:' Cutaneous flaps contain the full thickness of skin and connective tissue. They are ideal for small defects. Fascio-cutaneous flaps contain the full thickness of skin, connective tissue, subcutaneous tissue, deep fascia and more blood supply with ability to fill a larger defect. Musculocutaneous or myocutaneous flaps add the muscle layer to a fascio-cutaneous flap. They provide bulk to fill deeper defects and restore function. Muscle flaps only use muscle to fill defects and restore function. Skin can be placed over it, if needed. Bone flaps are used to replace bone for bony defects."
What is gracilis tissue transfer?,"'The gracilis\xa0is a commonly used muscle to create a flap for free\xa0tissue transfer or flap surgery\xa0for reconstruction of small- to medium-sized soft\xa0tissue defects in the arms, legs, head and neck. It is a muscular flap, which means only muscle is used. Muscle flaps\xa0are commonly used to eradicate infection, fill defects following ''trauma'' or surgery and restore function.''Advantages of muscular flap:''Advantages of using gracilis muscle:''Disadvantages of gracilis muscle:' Muscle flaps provide a soft tissue with a rich blood supply (well-vascularized) that is relatively resistant to infection, helps wounds heal, and offers a vascularized surface to supply blood for potential future skin grafts.

What is the difference between tumor staging and tumor grading?,"'Both staging and grading help in knowing the intensity and location of cancer; these may help the doctor decide the possible treatment.' Tumor grading: Tumor grade is the description of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells and tissue look under a microscope. It is an indicator of how quickly a tumor is likely to grow and spread. Tumor staging: Cancer stage refers to the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor and whether cancer cells have spread in the body. The cancer stage is based on factors, such as the location of the primary tumor, tumor size, regional lymph node involvement (the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes), and the number of tumors present."
What are the different types of cancer staging?,"'There are several different staging systems:''Stage 0 to Stage IV:'' The most common system that many people are aware of puts cancer on a scale of 0 to IV.''TNM (Tumor, Node, and ''Metastasis'') staging:'' When a patient’s cancer is staged with TNM, a number will follow each letter. This number signifies the extent of the disease in each category.''Primary tumor (T):''Regional lymph nodes (N):'' Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures that help move lymph fluid. Cancer often first spreads to and through nearby lymph nodes.''Distant metastasis (M):'' Metastasis is the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.' Stage 0: Cells are abnormal, but they did not spread yet. They may become aggressive in the future. This stage is also called “in-situ.” Stage I to Stage III: Cancers have not spread beyond the primary tumor site or have only spread to the nearby tissue. The higher the stage number, the larger the tumor, and the more it has spread. Stage IV: Cancer is aggressive and has spread to distant areas of the body. Recurrent: Cancer has come back (recurred) after it has been treated. It may come back in the same area or a different part of the body. TX: The main tumor cannot be measured. T0: The main tumor cannot be found. T in situ: The tumor is still within the confines of the normal glands and cannot metastasize. T1, T2, T3, and T4: It refers to the size and/or extent of the main tumor. The higher the number after the T, the larger the tumor or the more it has grown into the nearby tissues. T's may be further divided to provide more detail, such as T3a and T3b, depending on different cancer types. NX: Cancer in nearby lymph nodes cannot be measured. N0: There is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes. N1, N2, and N3: It refers to the number and location of lymph nodes that contain cancer. The higher the number after the N, the more the lymph nodes that contain cancer. MX: Metastasis cannot be measured. M0: Cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. M1: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body."
What is a guillotine ankle amputation?,"'A guillotine ankle amputation'' is an open type of amputation that involves surgical cutting of all of the tissue from the skin to bone at the level of the ankle. Because this surgery is performed without closure of skin, it is known as open surgery. A guillotine ankle amputation is performed to treat infection and remove drains from the surgical site.\xa0 ''The residual leg (stump) closure or revision is carried out in a second surgical procedure.' "
Why is a guillotine ankle amputation performed?,'A guillotine ankle amputation is indicated for the following conditions:' Wet gas gangrene (severe bacterial infection of the affected tissue) of the feet Fulminant osteomyelitis (severe or sudden onset of infection in the bone) Foot complications due to diabetes mellitus Severe injury Cancerous tumor in the bone or muscle of the foot Severe burn in the foot Poor blood flow to the foot All these conditions prevent the normal functioning of the foot.
How to get ready for a guillotine ankle amputation?,"'Before the surgery day, the patient needs to follow the following things:' Enlist medical and medication history to the physician Refrain from alcohol and cigarette smoking Be physically and emotionally prepared for the surgery Maintain optimum health and nutritional and fluid balance Stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, warfarin, or any other blood thinners Refrain from eating or drinking anything for 8 to 12 hours before the surgery"
How is a guillotine ankle amputation performed?,"'The amputation is performed under general or spinal anesthesia (numbs the body from the waist down). The patient is made to lie flat on the operation table. The patient is given antibiotics and blood thinners before the procedure.''During the procedure, the surgeon removes the diseased tissue and smoothens irregular areas of the bone. The physician closes off the blood vessels and nerves. The physician keeps the site open for several days. The surgeon performs stump closure or revision along with free drainage after several days.' "
What to expect after a guillotine ankle amputation?,"'The stump will be dressed and monitored for bleeding, ''edema'', infection, or any blood flow restriction for three more days. The physician prescribes a ''pain reliever'' and antibiotics to prevent infection.''If the patient has a sensation that the amputated foot is still present (phantom limb sensation), the physician may prescribe medications. Counseling may be required for the ''grief'' that may follow from the loss of the body part.''The patient must begin physical therapy and gentle exercises soon after the surgery to strengthen the muscles and prevent joint tightening.''The ''wound'' generally heals in approximately four to eight weeks. An artificial foot may be fitted immediately or after some days depending on the condition of the patient.' "
How to take care of an amputated foot after a guillotine ankle amputation?,'Patients should follow these instructions in the hospital after the amputation for faster recovery:' Strengthen the muscle with exercises Begin walking with a walking aid Keep the joints mobile Start moving around the bed and into the chair Try sitting or lying in different positions to prevent joint stiffness Control swelling around the amputated area Avoid putting excess weight on the stump until it is completely healed
What is hallux valgus?,"'Hallux valgus'', also known as a ''bunion'', is the most common misalignment of the big toes. It is a deformity in which the big toe deviates toward the small toes. In a severe type of deformity, the big toe goes below or above the second toe.''In a hallux valgus deformity, the joint connecting the bones of the foot and toe (metatarsophalangeal joint) are overextended, and as a result, painful ''arthritis'' of the big toe (hallux rigidus) can develop.''The protruding ''bunion'' at the metatarsophalangeal joint becomes inflamed and painful.'

How is a hallux valgus osteotomy performed?,"'Before the surgery:''During the surgery:''The procedure depends upon the type of osteotomy selected by the physician. The most commonly performed osteotomies are described further below:''The wound is irrigated and closed with ''stitches''.\xa0''After the surgery:' The patient will be given painkillers on the day of the surgery. The physician will choose and give a local or general anesthetic to the patient. The physician will place triangular support under the patient’s knee to keep their foot flat on the table. The physician will place the patient’s foot over a bump of double-brick height and shape to clear it from the other foot. Chevron osteotomy: A V-shaped wedge is removed from the part of the big toe with the joint—also known as the metatarsal head. An incision is made at the back of the foot. This technique is useful for moderate hallux misalignments. The metatarsal head is aligned to the default position and secured with titanium screws. Scarf osteotomy: During the procedure, a Z-shaped wedge is sawed out at the side of the big toe. The metatarsal head is aligned to the default position and secured with titanium screws. Akin osteotomy: In this technique, a wedge-shaped wafer of the bone is sawed out at the side of the big toe. The patient should elevate their foot and place ice packs on the foot to minimize pain and swelling. The foot will be covered in a special bandage. The stitches will be removed after about 12 days. The patient will have to wear special shoes for four weeks, which takes the pressure off the forefoot.  It takes about three to six weeks for complete healing. Post-procedure infection may be observed with this surgery."
What is a heel stick test?,"'The heel-stick test is a simple method to collect a ''newborn'' baby’s blood by pricking their heel to screen for certain diseases. It is usually performed as soon as possible after the baby’s birth.''During this test, a small amount of blood is collected with a capillary or on a filter paper. It is also called a newborn blood spot test.''The blood collected through this tiny heel prick can reveal around 50 rare illnesses, but also potentially life-threatening or crippling illnesses such as''Finding these early may allow the best chance for your baby to grow and thrive. Early treatment of these disorders, including changes in the ''diet'', may prevent the disease from progressing further.' Phenylketonuria (PKU): PKU is present in 1 in 10,000-15,000 newborns. It is a rare amino acid disorder (disorder of acids that are the building blocks of protein). Newborns with PKU appear perfectly healthy at first. However, if their condition isn’t treated soon after birth by changing their milk supply, the baby may experience serious health issues such as developmental delays, brain damage and even death. Primary congenital hypothyroidism: This is a disorder in which your baby’s body does not produce enough thyroid (neck gland) hormones. It may cause developmental delays and slow growth. Maple syrup urine disease: This is an amino acid disorder that can lead to developmental delays. The baby may have sweet-smelling urine, lethargy, vomiting and poor feeding habits due to nausea. If left untreated, they can develop a seizure. It can eventually be fatal. Cystic fibrosis: This illness affects the mucus glands and makes mucus thick and sticky and disturbs functions of organs including the lungs, liver and intestines. It may hinder a baby’s growth. There is no cure for this condition, but it can be managed well and the child can live a longer and healthier life. Sickle cell anemia: This condition may cause anemia (low red blood cells), fatigue, pain, organ damage and death. Medium-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD): This is a hereditary disorder caused by a low medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase enzyme. Isovaleric acidemia (IVA): This is a rare, serious, inherited disease condition, in which the body can't process the amino acid leucine. Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1): This is a rare but serious inherited condition in which the body can't process certain amino acids. Homocystinuria (pyridoxine unresponsive) (HCU): This is an inherited disorder of the metabolism of the amino acid methionine that may cause brain damage and developmental problems in the child."
What is the appropriate age for a heel-stick test?,"'When a live birth occurs in a hospital or birthing center, the doctor collects the infant’s blood before discharge. The infant’s blood is collected 24 hours following birth and no later than when the infant is one week old. If the infant born in a hospital or birthing center is discharged before 48 hours after birth, a blood specimen shall be collected prior to discharge. In this case, the newborn must be tested again prior to one week of age. In case of home birthing, it is the mid-wife’s duty to get the blood sample 24 hours after the birth. If the doctor feels the first testing was in any way inadequate or improper, they may ask for a repeat test.' "
How can heel stick test safety be assessed?,"'It is safe to perform a heel-stick test on a baby’s inner or outer side of the sole of the foot, on the darker areas. The heel of the newborn is not used because it may damage the heel bone.''Due to the special technical requirement of this test, it is better to have trained staff that performs this test frequently.\xa0' "

What is a hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder?,"'A hemiarthroplasty is a surgical procedure that replaces one half of the shoulder joint.''The shoulder is made up of three bones: the upper arm bone (humerus), shoulder blade (scapula), and the collarbone (clavicle). The shoulder joint is a ''ball-and-socket joint''—the ball or head of the humerus fits into a shallow socket known as glenoid in the shoulder blade. Surrounding the joint is a layer of articular cartilage that acts as a lubricant reducing ''abrasion'' of the bones.''A hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder involves the replacement of the ball (humeral head) with the prosthesis, and the socket (glenoid) is left intact.' "
Why is a shoulder hemiarthroplasty done?,"'Shoulder pain'' and disability can be intimidating and may not be cured by medications or physical activities alone. In such cases, a shoulder hemiarthroplasty is preferred. Several conditions can cause ''joint pain'' and disability:' Osteoarthritis of the shoulder (a degenerative joint disease) Rheumatoid arthritis of the shoulder (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the joints) Shoulder injury  Avascular necrosis (disruption of the blood supply to the shoulder joints) Severe fractures Failed previous shoulder replacement surgery Loss of motion or weakness in the surgery Failure of other treatments such as anti-inflammatory medications, cortisone injections or physical therapy Rotator cuff tear arthropathy (wear and tear of the shoulder joints caused over time due to damage of the rotator cuff muscle) Tumors of the shoulder"
When should a shoulder hemiarthroplasty be avoided?,'A shoulder hemiarthroplasty should be avoided in the following conditions:' Infections Neuropathic shoulder (nerve damage of the shoulder) Ankylosed shoulder (joint stiffness due to abnormal fusion of the joint bones) Previous glenohumeral arthrodesis (abnormal fusion of the glenoid and humeral head) Incompatible glenoid and humeral surfaces Fractures treatable with open reduction and internal fixation surgery Less severe fractures treatable nonoperatively Unenthusiastic patient Poor general health Deltoid paralysis (paralysis of the deltoid muscle in the shoulder) Unrealistic patient goals
How is a shoulder hemiarthroplasty performed?,"'A shoulder hemiarthroplasty should be performed under general anesthesia. The physician makes an incision in the area between the upper arm and shoulder. Next, the physician rotates or extends the arm to locate the humeral head. Before cutting out the humeral head, the surrounding muscles and tissues connecting the muscle and bone (tendons) are protected.''Once the surgeon locates the humeral head, an instrument called an osteotome is used to cut the humeral head. The surgeon then replaces it with a cap-like prosthesis. The incision is then closed with ''stitches''.' "
What to expect after a shoulder hemiarthroplasty surgery?,"'You need to perform exercises to prevent joint ''stiffness''. You can return to the normal routine after 24 weeks of strengthening exercises.''The healing takes place in phases:' Phase I: You will remain in a shoulder immobilizer for four weeks. During this time, you need to perform pendulum motion. Phase II: After four weeks, the sling will be removed so that you can use the arm for daily activities. Phase III: At eight weeks, therapy consists of advanced strengthening exercises. Phase IV: At 16 weeks, you can practice skilled sports."
What is hepaticojejunostomy?,"'The hepatic duct is the tubular channel that carries bile from the ''liver'' to the small intestine to aid ''digestion''. A hepaticojejunostomy is a surgical procedure to make a connection (anastomosis) between the hepatic duct and the jejunum, which is the middle portion of the small intestine. This technique is called the Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.''An alternative procedure is hepaticoduodenostomy, which creates an anastomosis between the hepatic duct and the duodenum, the beginning portion of the small intestine.''A hepaticojejunostomy may be performed as' Open surgery: The surgeon makes a long, midline or right incision and uses surgical tools typical for performing open abdominal surgeries. Laparoscopic surgery: The surgeon makes a single or several tiny incisions. The surgeon then performs the procedure with tiny surgical tools inserted through a flexible tube with a lighted camera (laparoscope). Robotic laparoscopic surgery: A robot operates the tiny surgical tools in the laparoscope. The surgeon uses a computer terminal to direct and control the robotic equipment."
Why is a hepaticojejunostomy performed?,"'Normally, the hepatic duct joins the cystic duct (the duct that carries bile from the gallbladder) to form the common bile duct that drains the bile into the duodenum. When disease or injury in the biliary system obstructs the free flow of bile, digestion is impaired.''A hepaticojejunostomy is performed to ensure that the bile from the liver freely drains into the intestine. A hepaticojejunostomy may be performed to treat conditions such as:' Benign strictures in the common bile duct due to stonesinflammationcysts stones inflammation cysts Malignant strictures in the biliary system from tumors in theliverpancreasgallbladderbile duct liver pancreas gallbladder bile duct After gall bladder removal for gallstones or other reasons Injury to the biliary system Liver transplantation"
How is hepaticojejunostomy performed?,"'A hepaticojejunostomy is performed under general anesthesia by a gastrointestinal surgeon.''Prior to a gastrojejunostomy the patient may be required to' Undergo blood, urine, and imaging tests. Undergo specific imaging tests for biliary anatomy, such as magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Avoid eating or drinking 8 hours prior to the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Inform the doctor of any allergies. Undergo a procedure to decompress the biliary system in case of complete obstruction, known as percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD). An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient will be intubated to provide oxygen. The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the abdomen depending on the type of surgery. The surgeon cuts the jejunum about 25 cm to 30 cm from the end of the duodenum. The lower section of the jejunum is taken up to the upper right abdomen, close to the hepatic duct. The surgeon severs the hepatic duct above its junction with the cystic duct and attaches it to the jejunum with sutures. The upper section of the severed jejunal tract is connected to the jejunum farther down. The anastomosis is closed with sutures. A drain may be left in place. The abdominal muscles and the incision are closed with sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia and administered painkillers for post-surgical pain. The patient will be monitored in the recovery room for several hours. The patient may need hospitalization for up to a week depending on the type of surgery. Complete recovery may take up to 6 weeks during which period the patient may need To be on a special diet Avoid heavy lifting Avoid strenuous activities"

What is an ankle-brachial index?,"'An ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) or ankle-brachial index (ABI)'' is the ratio of the systolic (upper) blood pressures (BP) of the ankle to the upper arm (brachium). Ankle BP is indicative of arterial disease. Lower ankle BP in the leg suggests blocked blood vessels due to ''peripheral artery disease'' (PAD) or ''atherosclerosis''.''It is a simple procedure and cost-effective assessment that can be in an outpatient set up by a doctor, nurse, or trained medical professional. It helps to detect lower-extremity arterial narrowing in cases of diseases of peripheral blood vessels or in cases of a lower-extremity arterial injury after penetrating or blunt ''trauma''.''An ABI less than 0.90 has been shown to have a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 98% for detecting lower-extremity stenosis of higher than 50%. During a trauma, an ABI less than 0.90 has been shown to have a sensitivity exceeding 87% and a specificity exceeding 97% for identifying a lower-extremity arterial injury.' "
How is an ankle-brachial index estimated?,'The required equipment for measuring the ankle-brachial index (ABI) include the following:''No anesthesia is used during the procedure. Any form of a sedative or anesthesia may affect the BP measurement and thus reduce the accuracy of the ABI.''The procedure is performed with the patient lying down on an examination table.' An appropriate-sized blood pressure (BP) cuff for the upper and lower extremities with a working sphygmomanometer (commonly referred to as a BP apparatus) A Doppler device for detecting flow Ultrasound transmission gel An examination table
What does a high ankle-brachial index mean?,"'Based on the results, the physician advises a treatment plan.''In a normal patient, the pressure at the ankle is slightly higher than at the elbow.''The ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI)'' is the ratio of the highest ankle to brachial artery pressure. An ABPI ranging from 0.90-1.29 is considered normal (free from major peripheral artery disease [PAD]), whereas a lesser than 0.9 indicates an arterial disease.''An ABPI value of 1.3 or higher is also considered abnormal and suggests' calcification, hardening, and narrowing of the vessel walls."
What is a jejunum tissue transfer?,"'Swallowing defects due to ''esophageal cancer'' can be repaired using jejunum flaps (grafts). A jejunum tissue transfer helps restore swallowing, which can be affected by esophageal ''cancer''.''The small intestine is composed of three segments:''The surgeon takes about 10 to 20 cm of the segment of jejunum along with its blood supply to use as jejunum flaps.'

Why is a jejunum tissue transfer done?,"'A jejunum tissue transfer is not recommended with:' To repair defects of the pharynx after surgical removal of cancer of the pharynx To restore the patient’s ability to swallow Previous surgery of the jejunum Uncontrolled abdominal swelling due to buildup of fluid Chronic conditions of the jejunum Patients who require the reconstruction of mouth, lips, tongue, nose, and other upper tract organs"
How is a jejunum tissue transfer performed?, The patient will be asked to undergo an endoscopy or a CT scan. Bowel preparation will be given the night before the surgery. The patient will receive antibiotics before the surgery. A long segment of the jejunum is removed using laparoscopy. The blood supply is located and harvested. The flaps harvested are placed at the site of the defect and adjusted. The incisions are closed. The patient is monitored overnight in an ICU. The patient is given medication for post-operative pain. Food is given via a feeding tube for a few days. The surgeon might perform a barium imaging test to check internal healing after 10 to 14 days.
What are the risks and complications of a jejunum tissue transfer?,'The common risk and complications of a jejunum tissue transfer may include:\xa0''A jejunum tissue transfer is gaining popularity due to its effectiveness and reliability.

What happens during a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy?,"'A laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy surgery involves the strengthening of the pelvic floor. During the surgery, a surgical mesh is attached from the vagina to the tailbone (''sacrum''). The uterus may be removed if needed with or without the removal of the cervix. Depending on the patient’s age, consent, and family history, the fallopian tubes and/or ovaries may also be removed.''During a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy:' The anesthesiologist establishes the IV line. General anesthesia is given to the patient (the patient sleeps during the procedure). The surgeon cleans the area to be operated on and makes four to five small cuts on the abdomen. Carbon dioxide gas is used to inflate the abdomen, which creates a better view and space for the surgery. The surgeon passed a laparoscope (a thin, flexible, tube-like instrument with a camera and a light source) through one of the incisions. Other instruments are passed through the remaining incisions. The surgeon attaches a piece of surgical mesh to the front and back walls of the vagina and then to the sacrum. This suspends the top of the vagina or the cervix back into its normal position. The supports of the bladder and/or the rectum may also be strengthened if needed. In patients with an inability to control urine (urinary incontinence), a small piece of the mesh may be placed underneath the urethra (the tube that carries urine) to give support when the patient laughs, sneezes, or coughs. The surgeon ensures that there are no injuries at the end of the surgery through a small camera that examines the inside of the bladder."
What are the risks of a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy?,'The risks associated with a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy are:' Pain Difficulty in passing urine Bleeding and bruising Delayed wound healing Wound infections Urinary tract infection (UTI) Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the deep veins of the legs or the lungs) Injury to the bladder/bowel
What is a laryngeal mask airway (LMA)?,"'A laryngeal mask ''airway'' (LMA)'' is a device inserted into the area behind the mouth and nose, connecting them to the food pipe (the pharynx) to allow ventilation, oxygenation, and administration of anesthetic gases, without the need for inserting a tube in the windpipe (''endotracheal intubation'').\xa0''It is a supraglottic airway device, which means that it stays above the vocal cords and does not enter the windpipe (trachea). It was developed by a British anesthesiologist Dr. Archi Brain and has been in use since 1988.''It was initially used mainly in an operating room setting. Recently, it has been used in the emergency setting as an important accessory device for managing the difficult airway.''The device is composed of an airway tube that connects to an elliptical mask with a cuff that is inserted through the patient’s mouth. It is designed to sit in the patient’s throat, forming an airtight seal on top of the vocal cords and allowing a secure airway to be managed by a healthcare provider.''LMA is a good airway device in many settings, including the operating room, emergency department, and outpatient care because it is easy to use and quick to place, even for the inexperienced provider.\xa0''Its use causes less gastric distention than bag-valve-mask ventilation and thus reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of aspiration (entry of food or liquids into the windpipe). This may be especially helpful in patients who have not fasted before being ventilated.' "
What is a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) used for?,"'A laryngeal mask airway has various uses including:' Elective ventilation: The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is often used for short surgical procedures in which endotracheal intubation is not necessary. Difficult airway: In some patients where endotracheal intubation fails, the LMA can be used as a rescue device for maintaining the airways. It is easier to maintain over time, and it has been shown to reduce, though not eliminate, aspiration risk. Cardiac arrest: LMA is an acceptable alternative to endotracheal intubation for airway management in some cases of cardiac arrest. This is particularly useful in the prehospital setting, where emergency medical technicians, even the ones with less experience, can place the LMA with high success rates. Conduit for intubation: LMA can be used as a channel or conduit for endotracheal intubation, especially in situations when direct laryngoscopy (the visualization of the vocal cords) is unsuccessful. An endotracheal tube can be passed directly through the LMA. Prehospital airway management: LMA is of great help in prehospital settings, not only for patients with cardiac arrest but also for managing a difficult airway. In the emergencies outside the hospital, an LMA can be inserted for successful airway management until a definitive airway can be established. Pediatric use: Laryngeal mask airways are available in a range of sizes suitable for their use in children as well."
What are the complications of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA)?,"'The complications, although rare, include:' Aspiration of stomach contents Local irritation Upper airway injuries Mild sympathetic response (such as increased heart rate and alertness) Obstruction Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords that makes it difficult to speak or breathe) Pulmonary edema (excessive fluid in the lungs) Bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways making breathing difficult)"
What is a laser diskectomy?,"'A laser diskectomy (diskectomy or percutaneous laser diskectomy)'' is a surgical procedure in which the bulged out part of an intervertebral disk (''herniated disk'') in your spine is removed by evaporating it by using laser energy delivered through a small incision (minimally invasive surgery) made on the skin and soft tissues over the affected disk. A minimally invasive technique, a laser diskectomy causes less ''pain'' and has a fast recovery rate.''The spine or backbone'' is composed of a series of bones called the vertebrae. The chain of vertebrae forms a hollow column or path through which the spinal cord runs in a way that the vertebrae protect the cord from injury.\xa0''The vertebrae'' rest on each other with disks (intervertebral disks) between each vertebra to provide cushioning and support. Many nerves from the spinal cord pass through small holes in the vertebrae called foramen.''In some conditions, such as ''aging'', injury, or certain infections, the outer wall of one of these disks may dry out and weaken, and the soft, inner part of the disk bulges out. This condition is called a herniated or bulging disk.\xa0''The bulging disk may press on the nerves and spinal cord to cause symptoms such as ''pain'', ''weakness'' or tingling. In such cases, a laser diskectomy can remove the part of the disk compressing the nerves by burning it with a laser, providing relief.' "
What happens during a laser diskectomy?," A laser diskectomy is an outpatient procedure, which means you can go home the same day. You may, however, need someone to drive you back home. The anesthetist administers local anesthesia with light sedation so that you do not feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure. The surgeon monitors your vitals (such as blood pressure and heart rate) during the procedure. The skin is cleaned with antiseptic, and drapes are applied. The surgeon makes an incision (a small surgical cut) on your back at the level of the affected disk. The surgeon uses fluoroscopy (an imaging technique) to find the correct location. The surgeon advances a thin needle through your back under image guidance. Once the needle reaches the desired location, laser energy is applied to vaporize the part of the disk that is causing the problem. The needle is removed. A small bandage is placed to close the wound."
Who would need a laser diskectomy?,"'A laser diskectomy may be indicated in people who have a herniated disk, along with associated symptoms, such as pain, burning sensation, tingling, or weakness in the area supplied by the ''compressed nerve''/s.\xa0''Not every person with a herniated disk requires a laser discectomy, and the doctor may recommend surgery if conservative therapy such as medications, rest, physical therapy, and ''weight management'' have failed.\xa0''All cases of herniated disk, however, cannot be treated with a laser discectomy, and some may require open surgery.' "
What is the success rate of a diskectomy?,"'A diskectomy is an effective procedure providing relief to many patients with a herniated disk. The success rate depends on many factors such as''On average, the success rate is approximately 80% for diskectomy. Some risks associated with the procedure are:' The extent of disk herniation, The extent of nerve/spinal cord compression, The duration of the diseases and The presence of other health conditions (such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) Discitis (inflammation of the intervertebral disk) Infection Excess bleeding Blood clots Nerve injury"
What is an obstetric ultrasound?,"'An obstetric ''ultrasound'"" or sonography is a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce pictures of a baby inside the mother’s womb. It also shows pictures of the mother's uterus and ovaries. It is an excellent tool to monitor the well-being of the mother and baby because it is a safe and painless procedure.""'An obstetric ultrasound is an important part of ante-natal (before the delivery of the baby) care. It can provide a lot of information about the ''pregnancy'' such as' Presence of a living embryo or fetus Age of pregnancy Expected date of delivery Presence of any abnormalities of the fetus Presence of an ectopic pregnancy (the embryo or fetus is present outside the womb) Position of the fetus inside the womb Position of the placenta and diagnosis of any placental abnormalities Number of embryos or fetuses (diagnosis of multiple pregnancies) Amount of the amniotic fluid around the developing fetus Presence of any opening or shortening of the cervix Adequacy of fetal growth Fetal well-being"
What is a limited obstetrical ultrasound?,"'A limited ultrasound, as the name suggests, is performed to know about a specific aspect of the pregnancy such as the location of the embryo/fetus (inside the uterus or ectopic), whether the pregnancy is viable and the gestational age. A limited ultrasound does not provide detailed information about the fetal well-being or gender. It just answers the most basic and crucial questions. In early pregnancy, a limited ultrasound is important to rule out or diagnose an ''ectopic pregnancy'' (a pregnancy where the embryo is present outside the uterus), which is a dangerous condition. It may be done during ''labor'' to know about the position of the baby inside the uterus. A limited obstetrical ultrasound quickly helps determine the management of conditions such as ''vaginal bleeding'' during pregnancy. In such a situation, the ultrasound can tell whether the baby is alive or there are certain placenta abnormalities such as a low-lying placenta (when the placenta covers the cervix).''For example, if a woman is in ''labor'', a limited ultrasound exam may be done to check the fetus’s position in the uterus. If a woman has ''vaginal bleeding'', an ultrasound may be used to see if the fetal ''heart'' is still beating or if the placenta is too low.' "
How many ultrasound examinations are required during pregnancy?,"'The number of ultrasound examinations required during pregnancy may vary depending on the presence of any complications or need for frequent evaluations. The obstetrician is the best person to tell how many ''ultrasonography'' exams a woman needs. It is recommended that at least one standard ultrasound examination must be done during the pregnancy. This is generally done at 18 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, although some women may have the examination done in the first\xa012 weeks (''first trimester'') of pregnancy. The ultrasound examination in the first trimester does not provide details about the limbs and organs of the fetus. It can, however, help provide information about several important aspects such as the estimated gestational age, whether the pregnancy is ectopic and the number of fetuses as well as screen for certain genetic conditions.' "
What is a longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow procedure)?,"'A longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy'' (LPJ or Puestow procedure) is a surgical procedure to create an artificial passage connecting the pancreas to the second part of the small bowel (jejunum). The procedure is generally performed in refractory cases of ''chronic pancreatitis'', which is the inflammation of the pancreas that does not heal or improve.\xa0''The disease eventually impairs a person’s ability to digest food and other body functions because of the deficiency of pancreatic hormones (such as ''insulin'' that regulates blood ''sugar''). The most common symptom of chronic ''pancreatitis'' is ''pain'', which can be severe and stubborn in some people.''A longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy may be considered in patients whose condition did not improve or worsened with nonsurgical management of chronic pancreatitis, such as enzyme replacement, control of ''diabetes'' with insulin, and administration of painkillers.\xa0''The procedure not only eliminates the symptoms and improves the quality of life but also reduces the risk of complications, such as bowel obstruction, ''jaundice'', and ''cancer of the pancreas''.' "
Who needs a longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy?,"'A longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (LPJ) can be performed in patients with chronic pancreatitis who' report severe pain resistance to conventional nonsurgical therapy, have associated or suspected malignancy (cancer), or have developed complications such as a bile duct or bowel obstruction, pancreatic fistulae (leakage of pancreatic fluid as a result of disruption of the pancreatic ducts) and ascites (excessive collection of fluid in the abdomen)."
What happens during a longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow procedure)?,"'The procedure is typically performed by a gastrointestinal (GI) surgeon under general anesthesia.''Your doctor may' Order some blood tests and imaging studies (such as ultrasonography, CT scan and endoscopic imaging) Ask you about any chronic health conditions Ask you about any medications you are on Ask about any allergies you may have Explain the surgical procedure in detail, including possible complications and address your doubts and concerns related to the surgery Obtain your written consent Ask you to not eat anything for at least eight hours before the procedure Ask you to abstain from alcohol before and after the surgery Ask you to take medications for anxiolytics (keeping you calm) and reduce proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (acid formation in the stomach) Ask you to take antibiotics and painkillers You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back on the operation table. The anesthesiologist will attach an intravenous (IV) line and administer general anesthesia. The surgeon will clean the skin with an antiseptic and make an incision (a surgical cut) on the abdomen either under the lower border of the ribcage or in the midline. The surgeon gains access to the pancreatic duct and the jejunum (the second part of the small bowel) and connects them with sutures in a way that bowel continuity is not compromised. Additional corrections such as the removal of stones from the pancreatic duct and obstruction in the small bowel may also be done if needed. When the repair is completed, the incision is closed with stitches and covered with a bandage. Your vital signs will be monitored. Nasogastric decompression (removal of stomach secretions through a tube placed into the stomach through the nose) is continued until bowel function resumes. Oral intake is resumed when bowel function is optimal."
What is a discography?,"'A ''discography'', or ''discogram'', is an imaging test of the spine to determine which particular disc is causing a patient’s ''back pain''. The doctor injects a dye into a specific disc to reveal damage on an X-ray image.\xa0''A doctor may choose discography for patients with persistent ''pain'' when other imaging methods have failed to precisely locate the source of ''pain''. A discogram is most commonly done prior to a lumbar fusion surgery.''A spinal disc is a sponge-like cushion in between the vertebrae of the spine. It has a tough layer surrounding a jelly-like material inside. It has three functions:''A radiologist (a doctor specialized in performing and interpreting imaging tests) performs the procedure. The radiologist injects a dye into a few selected discs, depending on the region of pain, to determine if it produces pain in the patient. They also observe an X-ray and CT monitor to see if there are tears or herniation in the discs that cause the pain.' Shock absorption To maintain the position of adjacent bones of the spine (vertebrae) Spinal flexibility and mobility"
How is a lumbar discography performed?,"'The lumbar discography is usually an outpatient procedure. It is likely to take about three hours total, while the procedure itself takes about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the number of discs planned for testing.''Before the discogram a patient needs to,''The radiologist does not use general anesthesia as the patient needs to be awake and responsive during the procedure. Some may administer a mild sedative to relax the patient. They may also give an antibiotic to prevent infection. They attach an IV line for administering fluids and medications if required.''The patient remains under observation for 30 to 60 minutes after the procedure.''The patient may feel nothing if the disc is normal or feel some pressure or pain. If the discogram causes a pain that is similar to the pain that the patient has been experiencing, it may indicate that the disc is the source of pain.''If the disc is normal, the injected dye will stay in place, but if it spreads, it may indicate wear and tear or a ''crack'' in the disc which may or may not cause pain.' refrain from eating or drinking in the morning before the test  stop taking blood thinners (such as anticoagulants and aspirin) The patient lies down on their side or abdomen for the discogram. The radiologist injects a local anesthetic to numb the area. They insert the needle in the abnormal disc guiding the insertion with the help of a live X-ray image on a monitor. The doctor injects the dye in the disc and observes the patient’s pain response. The material injected increases the pressure in the disc and may cause pain or pressure. The patient must describe the kind of pain, its location and intensity. The doctor also studies the imaging results on a live X-ray known as fluoroscopy, and sometimes also on a CT monitor. The doctor repeats this process on each of the discs that need to be examined."
Why is a lumbar discography performed?,"'A lumbar discography is performed to precisely locate the source of ''back pain''. Typically, the doctor does not rely solely on a discogram, but uses it in combination with CT, ''MRI'' and physical examination. The doctor performs a lumbar discography in the following situations:' To devise alternate treatment plans for persistent back pain conservative treatments like medication, physical therapy and activity modification cannot relieve. When less invasive tests have failed to locate the precise location or cause of the pain. To decide if a spinal surgery will be effective. To assess the disc before a surgery such as lumbar fusion."
How painful is a discogram?,"'The needle insertions for IV and local anesthetic may cause a mild stinging pain from the pricking.''The discogram is designed to provoke existing pain to find out the source, so certain amount of pain is to be expected. If the disc is normal there will most likely be no pain, there might be a sense of pressure.''If the disc is abnormal, the discogram duplicates the patient’s original pain. The sedation helps reduce the patient’s pain and discomfort, and painkillers can be used to relieve the pain.' "
How useful is a discogram?,"'The use of discography as a diagnostic tool has its pros and cons, and doctors only use it when more conservative treatments have failed or surgery is being considered.\xa0''The most important advantage is the capacity to pinpoint the problem disc for treatment, which greatly improves the success rate in relieving a patient’s pain. The diagnosis from this procedure also helps in avoiding an unnecessary surgical operation.' "
What are the risks and side effects of a discogram?,'A discogram performed with due precautions is generally safe. There usually are a few side effects like ''headache'' and some amount of ''back pain'' that is relieved with analgesics. Following are a few risks and complications:''All above are preventable and highly unlikely in a procedure done in a qualified medical facility by a competent radiologist. ''Disc herniation'' and paralysis are rare. The procedure’s potential to aggravate chronic back pain still needs further study.' Allergic reaction to the dye material Exposure to excessive radiation Meningitis or discitis caused by infection Nerve or blood vessel damage leading to pain or bleeding Spinal headache Aggravation of the chronic back pain Disc herniation Paralysis
What is a lumbar facetectomy?,"'A lumbar facetectomy is a surgical procedure to relieve the pressure on the nerve roots that pass close to the facet joints of the lumbar spine in the low back. During a lumbar facetectomy the surgeon partially or entirely removes the affected facet joints in the lumbar region of the spine.''The backbone is made up of a chain of bones (vertebrae) that form a protective covering over the spinal cord. Each vertebra has a main body separated from the adjacent ones by a sponge-like disc, which acts as a cushion.''Facet joints are two joints between each vertebra attached by cartilages and lubricated by a fluid known as synovial fluid. The facet joints are located on the bony projections called laminae, which extend on either side of the vertebral body to form an arch over it.''The lumbar facet joints provide stability and flexibility to the vertebral column of the low back. Facet joints allow gliding movements between the vertebrae that help a person stand up, bend or twist. Nerve roots emerge from the spinal cord through openings in the vertebrae, known as neural foramina.' "
What is a partial facetectomy?,'A partial facetectomy is done to preserve as much of the facet joints as possible and may be accompanied by:' Foraminotomy: removal of tissue blocking the foramina Laminotomy: partial removal of the lamina Laminectomy: complete removal of the lamina
What is a complete facetectomy?,"'A complete facetectomy is the removal of the entire facet joint on one or both sides of the vertebrae. A complete facetectomy is usually accompanied by a fusion of the two vertebrae with bone graft, a rod, and screws to prevent any movement between them and provide stability to the spine.' "
What is a medial facetectomy?,'Medial facetectomy is the most-performed partial facetectomy. The procedure removes a part of the facet joint on the side close to the midline of the backbone.' 
Why is a lumbar facetectomy performed?,"'A lumbar facetectomy is performed when medical treatments and physical therapy do not provide symptom relief from facet joint disease. When facet joints are damaged or degenerated, they compress the nerve roots and may cause:''A facetectomy is performed to release the compressed nerves and relieve the associated symptoms.

What is a medial epicondyle injection for?,"'A medial epicondyle injection'' is a procedure in which medications are injected into the elbow joint to treat diseases of the joint.''There are different types of medial epicondyle injections. The most common type of an intra-articular medial epicondyle injection is with ''corticosteroids''. Other agents used are ''hyaluronic acid'', ''infliximab'' botulinum neurotoxin (''Botox''), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP).''Elbow joint (medial epicondyle) ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' can be debilitating and difficult to treat. Elbow conditions may negatively affect the quality of life and emotional well-being.

Why is a medial epicondyle injection done?,"'A medial epicondyle injection is used to treat various diseases of the elbow joint. The type of medication injected and frequency depend on the condition being treated. Based on the diagnosis and extent of the disease, the doctor would recommend a treatment plan.''Indications for the various agents used for medial epicondyle injections are mentioned below:''These help to relieve pain and inflammation in individuals with''Infliximab suppresses inflammation and can be used to treat the following:''Hyaluronic acid (HA) is naturally present in the joints, eyes, and skin.

Hence, joint function improves, significantly reducing pain and stiffness.  Platelet-rich plasma is obtained from the patient’s own blood. It contains growth factors that stimulate collagen formation and lubricate the joint. Platelet-rich plasma can improve joint function and reduce pain."
How is epicondyle injection administered?,"'A medial epicondyle injection is a quick procedure and may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain. A needle of an appropriate size and length connected to a syringe is introduced into the joint, and the medicine is injected. Radiological guidance may sometimes be used to aid in injection.''After the procedure, the patient would need to rest for a few minutes, soon after which they can resume normal activities. Patients may experience pain, swelling, and ''bruising'', which will get resolved in a few days. Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and ''bruising''.''It is advised to keep the area clean and dry for 48 hours after the injection to avoid complications.' "
How long does it take for a medial epicondyle injection to work?,"'The time taken for medial epicondyle injections to work depends on the medicine injected. Different medications have different durations of onset and longevity.' Steroids: These take two to three days following the injection for patients to observe the relief of symptoms. In case of severe joint disease, it may take longer for the effects to begin. Steroid elbow injections are usually injected three to four times a year because the effects last for six to 12 weeks. Hyaluronic acid: This takes three to four weeks to observe the effects of pain relief after the initial injection. The effects last for two to six months, after which the injection would have to be repeated. Platelet-rich plasma: This takes longer for its action on the joints to begin, which is approximately six months, but the results are more superior and effects last longer than those of hyaluronic acid. Infliximab: This may take a few days up to two to six weeks for the effects to begin after the first treatment. The treatment can be repeated every eight weeks. Botox: This takes three to 14 days to observe pain relief, and the results last for approximately three months."
What are the complications of a medial epicondyle injection?,'Complications are rare and can usually be resolved. Some common complications are:' Infection Bleeding Swelling Risk of tendon rupture due to frequent injections A hypopigmented (light-colored) patch on the skin Osteoporosis of bones (thinning of bones) due to serial injections Nerve damage due to injections
What is a metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis?,"'Joint aspiration'' (''arthrocentesis'') of the metatarsophalangeal joint (in the foot) is a diagnostic procedure involving the extraction and analysis of the synovial fluid in the joints. A relatively quick procedure, it is an important component in diagnosing ''arthritis'' and differentiating an inflammatory arthritis from a non-inflammatory arthritis.\xa0''An arthrocentesis can also be performed therapeutically (for ''pain'' relief, fluid drainage or injection of medications).\xa0It can be performed by any physician, physician’s assistant, or nurse who has the training and equipment in a clinic or hospital setting.''Any joint in the body can be aspirated, including for the following conditions:''Joint aspiration may be performed as a treatment in certain conditions:' Monoarticular arthritis (inflammation of the joint) Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) Joint effusion (swelling due to fluid accumulation in the body) Intra-articular fracture (fractures that involve the joint space) Crystal arthropathy (accumulation of calcium crystals in the joint and surrounding areas) Repeated aspirations can be part of the management of the septic joint to relieve discomfort and prevent joint damage. Aspiration can be considered in cases of hemarthrosis (blood in the joints) to prevent adhesions. Aspiration can be performed along with injecting intra-articular medications such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid to improve efficacy. Steroid injections help reduce joint inflammation, reduce pain, and preserve joint structure and function. Hyaluronic acid lubricates the joint, reduces impact, delays joint aging, and reduces pain and stiffness."
When should a metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis not be performed?,'A metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis should be performed with caution in patients with ''bleeding disorders'' or those on ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs''. Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may be advised to stop the medications for a few days before the procedure and resume again after the procedure.' 
How is a metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis performed?,"'Sometimes, a ''metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis'' may be performed using radiological guidance because it may be required to confirm the presence of fluid before aspirating. Radiological guidance can also be helpful in aspirating other deep and technically difficult joints such as the hip joint or spine.''A metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis'' is a relatively quick procedure, but may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain. A needle of an appropriate size and length is introduced into the joint, and the synovial fluid is collected in syringes. The fluid is then sent to the lab for analysis.\xa0''Apart from microscopic analysis, the appearance of the aspirated synovial fluid can indicate certain features. Normal fluid is clear or light yellow and is viscous. Inflammatory fluid appears darker yellow to cloudy in appearance and loses its viscosity. Purulent fluid (pus in the fluid) appears brownish to whitish and opaque.''After the procedure, the patient would need to rest for a few minutes, soon after which they can resume normal activities. Patients may experience pain and ''bruising'', which will resolve in a few days. Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and ''bruising''.' "
What are the complications of a metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis?,"'A metatarsophalangeal arthrocentesis is a relatively safe procedure, and complications are rare.''The common complications'' patients usually face are localized bleeding, pain, and swelling and sometimes a reaction to local anesthesia. Joint infection may occur, which is called ''septic arthritis''.''If other medications such as steroids are simultaneously injected,'' though rare, it may cause localized shrinkage or hypopigmentation of the skin. Long-term use of steroid injections may cause systemic side effects such as ''weight gain'', puffy face, ''stretch marks'', and ''easy bruising''.' "
What is a minimally invasive esophagectomy?,"'The ''esophagus'' is a tubular organ that connects the throat to the stomach. A minimally invasive esophagectomy is a surgery that involves removing the entire esophagus or a part of it.\xa0''After the esophagus is removed, it is rebuilt from a part of the stomach or the ''large intestine''. Most of the time, esophagectomy is done to treat\xa0''cancer of the esophagus''. This surgery may also be performed if the esophagus is no longer working to move food into the stomach (''dysphagia'').' "
Who performs an esophagectomy?, 
How is a minimally invasive esophagectomy performed?,"'Minimally invasive esophagectomy is usually performed under general anesthesia.''Some medical centers do this operation using\xa0robotic surgery. In this type of surgery, a small scope and other instruments are inserted through the small cuts in the skin. The surgeon controls the scope and instruments while sitting at a computer station and observing through a monitor.' The surgeon makes three to four small cuts in the upper belly, chest, or lower neck. These cuts are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts into the upper belly. The scope has a light and camera on the end. Video from the camera appears on a monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the area being operated on. Other surgical tools are inserted through the other cuts. The surgeon frees the esophagus from nearby tissue. Depending on how much of the esophagus is diseased, part or most of it is removed. If part of the esophagus is removed, the remaining ends are joined together using staples or stitches. If most of the esophagus is removed, the surgeon reshapes the stomach into a tube to make a new esophagus. It is then joined to the remaining part of the esophagus. During surgery, lymph nodes in the chest and belly are likely removed if cancer has spread there. A feeding tube is placed in the small intestine, so the individual can be fed while recovering from surgery."
What happens after a minimally invasive esophagectomy is performed?,"'After the procedure, most people stay in the hospital for seven to 14 days. The patient may spend one to three days in the intensive care unit (ICU) right after surgery.' The patient might be asked to sit on the side of the bed and walk on the same day or day after surgery. Patients may not be able to eat for at least the first two to seven days after surgery. After that, they may start on a liquid diet. The patient will be fed through a feeding tube that was placed into the intestine during surgery. Patients may be asked to wear special stockings on the feet and legs to prevent blood clots. They might receive medications to prevent blood clots. Patients are also given pain medicine, antibiotics, and other medications either intravenously or orally.  They may be advised to do breathing exercises. Patients might usually take eight to 10 weeks to recover after a minimally invasive esophagectomy."
What are the advantages of a minimally invasive esophagectomy procedure?,'The advantages of minimally invasive esophagectomy include' Less postoperative pain Faster recovery from surgery Shorter hospital stay A more rapid return to work and normal activities
What are the common complications after a minimally invasive esophagectomy procedure?,"'Apart from general anesthesia complications (''headache'', ''nausea'', drowsiness, etc.), patients may also have other complications, which include' Acid reflux Infection Injury to the stomach, intestines, lungs, or other organs during surgery Leakage of the contents of the esophagus or stomach from the tube where the surgeon joined them together Narrowing of the connection between the stomach and esophagus Pneumonia"
What is the prognosis after a minimally invasive esophagectomy procedure?,"'Most patients after a minimally invasive esophagectomy recover well and can have a fairly normal ''diet''. After they recover, they will likely need to eat smaller portions and eat more frequently. This procedure has a high success rate, depending upon the reason why the surgery was performed.\xa0' "
Why is a minimally invasive total hip replacement surgery done?,"'Surgery is indicated when the ''pain'' is severe and interferes with routine activities such as ''sleep''. Ideally, MIS-THR is considered when there is little or no anatomic deformity of the femoral head and acetabulum.''Degenerative arthritis'' of the hip can often be initially managed medically with ''exercise'', physical therapy, painkillers and alternative ''pain management'' techniques. If medical therapy fails, then surgical therapy can be considered.' "
When is a minimally invasive total hip replacement surgery avoided?,"'There are no absolute contraindications for MIS-THR, but conventional hip replacement surgery is preferred in patients who have:''In addition, conventional hip replacement surgery is more suitable for patients who are ''overweight'' and those who are very muscular.' Pathologic conditions that require a wider exposure Revision hip arthroplasty Previously undergone certain surgical procedures for fractures and other conditions Bony ankylosis Rheumatoid arthritis Patients with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 30  Severe hip contracture (inability to fully extend the hip)"
How is a minimally invasive total hip replacement surgery performed?," Prior to surgery, the surgeon performs a complete physical assessment and might ask additional tests that include X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the joint to get detailed information about your hip.  The surgery is performed under general anesthesia.  The surgeon makes two small incisions approximately 2-inch long. The damaged joint is removed and replaced with a prosthetic joint.  The surgical wound is closed with sutures (stitches) and dressed."
How long does it take to recover from a minimally invasive total hip replacement?," After the surgery, painkillers and antibiotics are administered.  Patients are usually discharged within one to three days after the surgery.  They are encouraged to walk with support the same or the next day to prevent the formation of blood clots.  Physical therapy may begin at the hospital, and the patient is advised to continue the exercises at home.  Pain, swelling and bruising due to surgery reduce in two weeks.  Most patients can resume their routine activities in six to12 weeks.  Complete recovery after surgery may take  six to 12 months; after that patients can resume high-impact exercises and sports."
What are the complications of a minimally invasive total hip replacement?,"'Some complications of minimally invasive total hip replacement are:' Osteolysis (inflammation destroying the bone and causing the prosthesis to loosen) Infection  Bleeding  Blood clot formation, Bone necrosis (bone death) Different leg lengths leading to altered gait/ limp Migration or failure of prosthesis  Dislocation or fracture of the joint Fractures around the joint  Reaction to anesthesia "
What is a mitral valvuloplasty procedure?,"'Mitral valvuloplasty, also known as mitral valvotomy, is a minimally invasive procedure to treat narrowing (stenosis) of the ''heart''’s ''mitral valve''. The procedure dilates the mitral valve opening by inflating a tiny balloon inserted into the mitral valve. The balloon is advanced into the heart’s chambers through a thin flexible tube (catheter) inserted into the femoral vein in the groin.''Before the advent of mitral valvuloplasty, an open-heart surgery known as surgical commissurotomy was the treatment for mitral valve stenosis. The first of these percutaneous mitral ''balloon valvuloplasty'' surgeries was performed in 1984, and now the procedure is the preferred mode of treatment for mitral valve stenosis.' "
Why is mitral valvuloplasty performed?,"'Mitral valvuloplasty is performed to improve blood flow into the heart’s ''left ventricle'' and reduce the pressure in the pulmonary artery and ''lungs''. Left untreated, these conditions can lead to ''heart failure'' and death.''The mitral valve is located between the ''left atrium'' and left ventricle of the heart. The mitral valve is made up of leaflets that open to let the blood flow from the left ''atrium'' into the left ventricle, and close to prevent the blood from flowing back into the ''atrium'' (''mitral regurgitation''). When the mitral valve leaflets thicken or become stiff due to disease, they fail to function normally.''Mitral valve stenosis obstructs the free flow of blood, causing blood to back up in the lungs and increase the pressure in the pulmonary artery (''pulmonary hypertension''). Because the function of the pulmonary artery to bring oxygenated blood to the left ''atrium'' is compromised, the left ventricle gets insufficient blood to pump to the organs of the body.' "
What causes mitral valve stenosis?," Rheumatic fever, a complication of strep throat, is the most common cause of mitral stenosis, due to inflammation of the mitral valve. Rheumatic mitral stenosis usually occurs decades after the illness. Calcium deposits in the mitral valve building up over time, particularly in dialysis patients. Carcinoid syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors. Congenital defect in the mitral valve or inherited disorder."
What are the symptoms of mitral valve stenosis?," Shortness of breath, especially with exertion Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Chest pain or discomfort Fatigue Swollen feet and legs Dizziness or fainting"
When is a mitral valvuloplasty performed?,"'Mitral valvuloplasty may be performed in patients with severe or mild mitral valve stenosis who''Mitral valvuloplasty is not usually performed in the following situations:' Are asymptomatic Do not improve after treatment with medication Develop symptoms during pregnancy Do not require mitral valve repair or replacement surgery Are at high risk for commissurotomy Are critically ill, as a palliative measure Presence of blood clot in the left atrium. The patient may have to undergo treatment for a few months to dissolve the blood clot, before testing for the procedure again. Presence of moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Stenosis of tricuspid valve that is between the right atrium and right ventricle. Malfunctioning tricuspid valve causing regurgitation of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium. Aortic valve disease. Patients requiring surgery for any coexisting (comorbid) heart diseases such as coronary artery disease."
What is a nebulizer?,"'A nebulizer is a device that helps a person inhale medicine in the form of a mist through a mask or a mouthpiece. A nebulizer delivers the drug directly into the airways and the ''lungs'', achieving targeted action and minimizing systemic side effects in the body. Nebulizers are used for a variety of conditions affecting the airways and lungs.' "
What is a nebulizer used for?,'A nebulizer is used to relieve various symptoms related to the lungs:''Some common lung diseases that can require a nebulizer are:' Wheezing (a whistling or rattling sound in the chest during breathing) Breathlessness Severe cough Chest tightness Asthma COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) Bronchiectasis Cystic fibrosis Severe lung infections
What do you put in a nebulizer?,"'A nebulizer converts the liquid form of a drug into a mist or a fine spray with oxygen, compressed air or ultrasonic power. ''Drugs'' that can be given through a nebulizer include:' Corticosteroids (e.g., budesonide, fluticasone and triamcinolone): These drugs reduce the inflammation and irritation in the lungs and airways. Bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol, formoterol, levalbuterol and salmeterol): These drugs open the airways. Hypertonic saline solutions (medical grade saltwater solutions): These solutions loosen mucus in the airways and make it easier to cough it out. Antibiotics to treat and prevent infections.  "
How do you use a nebulizer at home?,"'It is recommended that you use a nebulizer at home only if:''Nebulizers may vary in their design and usage. Generally, it is very simple and convenient to use a nebulizer. The basic steps are:' Your healthcare professional recommends using it at home. You are prescribed medications to use with a nebulizer. You understand its usage and maintenance. Wash your hands well. Place only the prescribed quantity of medicine in the medicine cup. Close the medicine cup tightly to avoid spills. Attach the tubing and mouthpiece/mask to the medicine cup. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth with your lips firmly around it. If you are using a mask, be certain that it fits well around your nose and mouth. Turn on the nebulizer and breathe through your mouth until the medicine is consumed. Hold the mouthpiece and medicine cup upright. You must breathe slowly and deeply. You will likely feel comfortable and pleasant as the drug reaches your airways. Turn off the machine when done. Wash the mouthpiece and medicine cup with water and air dry them. Do not use the same mouthpiece, mask or tubing for other medications."
How should I clean my nebulizer?,"'A thorough cleaning of the nebulizer is recommended once a week to ensure that it functions well and to avoid the spread of infection. Tips to keep your nebulizer clean:' Wash the mouthpiece/mask, top piece and medicine cup after each use. To start, remove the tubing and set it aside. Never place it under water. Remove the mouthpiece/mask and medicine cup from the top piece. Wash them in warm soapy water and rinse. You can also wash them on the top shelf of a dishwasher. Air dry the pieces after washing and keep them in a cool and dry place until you use them again. Soak the mouthpiece/mask, top piece and medicine cup in a solution of white vinegar and water for 30 minutes and/or per the manufacturer’s instructions. Rinse and air dry after 30 minutes. The compressor and the outside of the tubing must be cleaned with a soapy cloth or disinfectant wipe. Never submerge them in water. Most compressors have an air filter that needs to be replaced every six months and/or per the manufacturer’s instructions."
What is a gastrectomy?,"'A partial gastrectomy is the surgical removal of a portion of the stomach, as opposed to a total gastrectomy in which the entire stomach is removed. A gastrectomy may also be accompanied by a vagotomy (removal of the part of the vagus nerve that stimulates the stomach’s acid production for ''digestion'').''A partial gastrectomy is most often accompanied by a surgery to create a connection (anastomosis) between the remaining portion of the stomach and the small intestine’s beginning (duodenum) or middle (jejunum) portion. It depends on where the particular disease is and how much of the gastrointestinal tract is removed.''A partial gastrectomy may be' Antrectomy: removal of the lower 30% of the stomach Hemigastrectomy: removal of 50% of the stomach Subtotal gastrectomy: removal of 80% of the stomach"
Gastrectomy history and development,"'The earliest partial gastrectomies performed in the 19th century were unsuccessful. The first successful partial gastrectomy was performed in 1881 for pyloric ''cancer'' (''cancer'' in the lower part of stomach opening into the small intestine).''Partial gastrectomies were originally performed using the conventional method with a large incision. Subsequently, advancements in imaging technology and surgical techniques, led to development of several minimally invasive methods.' "
What are the surgical techniques used in partial gastrectomy?,"'A partial gastrectomy may be performed using one of the following methods:''Non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS): A newly developed technique that involves a single incision at the umbilicus for the laparoscopic instruments, assisted by an endoscope (flexible tube with a lighted camera inserted through the nose into the stomach).''The minimally invasive methods are aimed at achieving precision of procedure with minimal blood loss and ''trauma'' to the patient, but may not be appropriate for all conditions. In some situations the surgeon may even have to convert a laparoscopic surgery into an open surgery.' Open surgery: The surgeon makes a long, upper midline incision and uses surgical tools typical for performing open abdominal surgeries. Laparoscopic surgery: The surgeon makes a single, small incision at the navel (umbilicus) or five tiny incisions in the stomach region. The surgeon then performs the procedure with tiny surgical tools inserted through a flexible tube with a lighted camera (laparoscope). Laparoscopic wedge resection: The surgeon removes a wedge-shaped portion of the stomach laparoscopically. Robotic laparoscopic surgery: A robot operates the tiny surgical tools in the laparoscope. The surgeon uses a computer terminal to direct and control the robotic equipment."
Why is a partial gastrectomy performed?,"'A partial gastrectomy is most often performed to treat ''stomach cancer''. A partial gastrectomy may be indicated in the following situations:''Recurrent ulcer disease'': Recurrence of ulcers have become uncommon, with advancement in treatment of ulcers with medications for acid reduction, and eradication of ''Helicobacter pylori'' (a bacteria species that causes ulcers). Partial gastrectomy is now a rare treatment for ulcer.''Large duodenal perforations'': A partial gastrectomy of the lower stomach may be performed when there are large perforations in the duodenum that cannot be patched. The perforated part of the duodenum is removed and the remaining portion is connected to the main part of the stomach.''Bleeding gastric ulcers'': Partial gastrectomy may be performed when there are bleeding ulcers in the stomach.''Gastrointestinal stromal tumors'': Partial gastrectomy may be required to remove large stromal tumors (gastrointestinal tract tumors that may be benign or ''malignant'') in the stomach.''Corrosive stricture of the stomach'': Partial gastrectomy is performed to treat strictures caused primarily in the esophagus and the stomach after ingestion of any corrosive substance.''Morbid ''obesity'': A subtotal gastrectomy, also known as a sleeve gastrectomy, is performed to reduce the size of the stomach in people with life-threatening obesity. A small pouch is left remaining which is connected to the duodenum or jejunum.''Partial gastrectomy is performed with caution in patients with''The patient may have to undergo corrective treatments where possible, prior to surgery. In some patients with metastasized cancer, a partial gastrectomy may be performed as a palliative measure to relieve symptoms.''Patients with ''malignancy'' may undergo an exploratory ''laparoscopy'' before a planned partial gastrectomy. The reason is to assess the stage of the cancer, and presence of ''metastasis'' in the peritoneum or liver.' Subtotal gastrectomy of the lower stomach is performed for cancer in the antrum and pylorus (the lower parts of stomach attached to the small bowel). Total gastrectomy is performed for cancer in the upper or main part of the stomach. Partial gastrectomy of the upper stomach and partial esophagectomy (removal of esophagus) is performed for cancer in the esophagogastric junction (the place where esophagus is attached to the stomach). Anemia Hypoproteinemia (low protein levels in blood) Hypokalemia (low potassium in blood) Severe comorbidities (co-existence of more than one disorder) Severe ascites (fluid in the abdomen) Metastasized (spread from original site) cancer  Cancer in the peritoneum (abdominal membrane) Tumors fixed to the adjacent organs such as liver or pancreas Adhesions from previous abdominal surgeries"
What is a pacemaker?,"'A ''pacemaker'' is a tiny device (not more than the size of a small matchbox), placed in the chest or abdomen, that sends small electrical impulses to the ''heart'' muscles for maintaining a suitable heart rate. It may also be used to treat ''heart failure'', ''fainting'' spells (''syncope''), and certain diseases of the heart muscles (''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'').''The commonest use of pacemakers, however, is the treatment of ''abnormal heart rhythms'' (arrhythmias). The heart has its internal electrical system to control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. During a heartbeat, the different parts of the heart receive electrical impulses from the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial or SA node) that causes phasic contraction and relaxation of different parts of the heart. The normal heartbeat allows the heart to pump blood regularly and adequately to meet the body’s requirement.''Pacemakers can be classified as:''Faulty electrical signals in the heart lead to arrhythmias. This may cause the heart to beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or with an irregular rhythm. An ''arrhythmia'' may hamper the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively leading to the following symptoms:''A permanent pacemaker may relieve the symptoms by sending low energy electrical pulses to overcome the faulty electrical signals in an arrhythmia. This regularizes the heartbeat and enables the heart to pump blood effectively to the body.' Temporary pacemakers: These are used to treat short-term heart problems, such as a slow heartbeat caused by a medicine overdose, heart attack, or heart surgery.  Permanent pacemakers: These are used to regulate long-term (chronic) heart rhythm problems.  Fatigue Fainting Breathlessness Uneasiness Chest pain Sweating"
What happens during a permanent pacemaker placement?," A permanent pacemaker implantation procedure is a minor surgery that can be done in a hospital or a special heart treatment lab. The surgery site is cleaned with antiseptics. The anesthesiologist gives intravenous antibiotics to prevent infections and sedation to keep you calm during the surgery. Local anesthesia is administered to numb the area where the doctor will put the pacemaker so that you do not feel any pain. The doctor inserts a needle into a large vein near the neck or shoulder of your non-dominant hand.  The doctor then uses the needle to thread the pacemaker wires into the vein and correctly place it in your heart. To ensure proper placement, the procedure is done under X-ray image guidance. The doctor will make a small cut into the skin of your chest or abdomen to create a small pocket under your skin where they place the pacemaker's small metal box containing the pacemaker’s battery and generator.  They will then connect the metal box to the wires that lead to your heart.  The doctor then tests for the proper functioning of the pacemaker. Once the pacemaker functioning is ensured, the doctor will apply sutures to close the cut.  A sterile dressing is applied.  An arm restraint or immobilizer is applied to the arm on the side of the surgery for 12-24 hours to limit movement. Pain levels are typically low after the procedure. You may be given pain medication to manage any pain associated with the incision site."

What is a person with bipolar disorder like?,"'Bipolar disorder'' is a serious, persistent ''mental illness'' characterized by changes in mood, energy, and the ability to function.\xa0 People with ''bipolar disorder'' frequently display extreme, intense, and disturbing emotional states known as mood episodes. Extreme ''happiness'' or excitement (''mania'') and melancholy (''depression'') are typical symptoms of mood episodes. People with ''bipolar disorder'' can also have normal ''moods'' occasionally.''Bipolar disorder is classified into:' Bipolar I: Characterized by alternating severe depression and intense mania Bipolar II: It involves severe depression but a less intense mania (hypomania) Cyclothymic disorder: A less severe form of mania and depression"
What does a person with bipolar disorder experience?,"'Bipolar disorder does not have a set pattern and differs from individual to individual. Patients may feel a particular emotion several times before switching to another state.''Symptoms of mania are:''Symptoms are severe enough to interrupt the daily activities of the patient. These episodes can be present from early childhood to later adulthood.''Symptoms of depression are:' Decreased need for sleep Unusual sexual drive Patients may feel that they are on the top of the world Highly irritable Gets distracted easily Talks too much Increased energy Excessive happiness and excitement Perceiving oneself as grand Being impulsive Making unrealistic plan Drug and alcohol abuse Multitasking many activities at once Highly risky behavior or reckless thoughts Intense melancholy, feeling hopeless and worthless Lack of interest in the activities once enjoyed Feeling extreme tiredness, fatigue Feeling restless Sleep problems Eating disorder Lack of concentration Thoughts of suicide and even attempting it"
Who gets bipolar disorder?,'Some of the factors that can trigger or are associated with bipolar disorder are:' Family history of bipolar disorder People subjected to extreme stress Sleep deprivation Faulty genes Drugs and alcohol may sometimes trigger the episodes Pregnancy may trigger post-delivery mental disorders
How is bipolar disorder diagnosed?,'One must undergo a mental status examination to evaluate the disease. A psychiatrist will assess the following:''The diagnosis depends mostly on history-taking.\xa0Lab tests the patient are done to rule out other underlying conditions. These include:' Mood Perception Appearance Suicidal thoughts Violence/aggression Physical health Insight Thought process Physical health Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Electrolytes Fasting glucose Protein Thyroid hormone Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen Liver and lipid panel
How is bipolar disorder treated?,"'The management of bipolar disorder involves a combination of medicines and other psychological methods (''psychotherapy''). Treatment also depends on the type of bipolar disorder.''Medications used to treat bipolar disorders are:''When medication therapy is ineffective, ''electroconvulsive therapy'' might be considered.\xa0During electroconvulsive therapy, an electric current is passed through the brain to treat the disorder. In some, talk therapy (psychotherapy) has proven to be beneficial in treating mood episodes. Another part of treatment is psychoeducation where patients and their families are educated regarding symptoms and importance of medication compliance.' Benzodiazepines: Lorazepam Amtimanic agents: Lithium Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine and sodium valproate First-generation antipsychotics: Haloperidol Second-generation antipsychotics: Risperidone Dopamine agonists: Pramipexole Phenothiazine antipsychotics: Chlorpromazine"
What to expect after bipolar disorder treatment?,"'Recognizing the symptoms early and treating it promptly is necessary to prevent complications such as ''suicide'', homicide and addictions.''Some lifestyle modifications are important in managing bipolar disorder:' Treatment compliance is of utmost importance for the patient as well as the caregivers. Always follow a routine for sleep and meals. Talk to your family and friends and ask for their support. Try connecting with other patients and caregivers through social groups. Talk to a licensed medical practitioner about your symptoms."
What is pharmacologic stress testing?,"'Pharmacologic ''stress'' testing is a method of testing the functioning capacity of the ''heart'' by administering certain medications (pharmacologic agents). These medications mimic the response of the heart to physical ''stress'' (''exercise''). You may get a pharmacologic stress test done if you are unable to ''exercise'' (e.g., walk or run on a treadmill). During the test, ''drugs'' such as adenosine, dobutamine, regadenoson or ''dipyridamole'' make the heart respond as if you are exercising.\xa0''These medications may increase your heart rate and the strength of contractions (pumping) of the heart muscles. This causes an increase in the blood flow and may cause the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart (coronary arteries) to widen so that there will be more blood flow to the heart. Through this test, the doctor can learn how your heart responds to stress, but without making you ramp up your heart rate through exercise. Pharmacologic stress testing is used in combination with other tests such as electrocardiography (''ECG'') and radionuclide imaging for gauging heart health.' "
What is pharmacologic stress testing used for?,"'You may require pharmacologic stress testing if you cannot exercise but have symptoms related to ''heart disease''. According to the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), pharmacologic stress testing is generally performed in the following cases:''Your doctor may use the test to:' Elderly patients with decreased functional capacity and possible coronary artery disease (CAD) (a medical condition in which the blood flow through the coronary arteries is compromised) Patients with poor general health and possible CAD Younger patients with functional impairment due to injury, arthritis, orthopedic problems, peripheral neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease, in which a maximal heart rate is not easily achieved with routine exercise stress testing, usually because of early onset of fatigue due to muscle, bone, neurologic or vascular problems rather than cardiac ischemia (decreased blood flow to the heart) Patients taking beta-blockers or other medications that slow the heart rate and prevent an adequate heart response to exercise Diagnose the cause of chest pain, shortness of breath and weakness. Diagnose or monitor a heart condition, such as heart disease or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm). Evaluate your risk for a cardiac event (such as a heart attack). Determine your fitness for surgery for another health condition."
How is pharmacologic stress testing performed?,"'The test is performed as an outpatient\xa0 procedure, which means you may go back home the same day unless you are admitted for some health conditions.''Your doctor may' Ask you to not eat or drink anything other than water and refrain from smoking for three hours before the test. Ask you to not consume anything with caffeine, including products that say “decaffeinated” or “caffeine-free,” after midnight, the night before the test. Ask you to wear comfortable clothing. Ask you to bring a list of all current medications, along with times and dosages. Ask you to withdraw medications that will interfere with the results if possible, for 24 hours before the test. Ask you to avoid strenuous activities (jogging, running) before the appointment. Explain the procedure along with the risks involved. Ask you to shave your chest. Anesthesia is not used in pharmacologic stress testing. Some centers prefer to use pharmacologic stress testing along with echocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scanning. Blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiography (ECG) are monitored before, during and after the test. Imaging is obtained at specified times. An intravenous (IV) line is placed in a vein of your arm. A small amount of radioactive tracer is given through the IV line. The tracer releases radiation detected by a special  “gamma camera,” to produce computer images of the heart. The healthcare provider will place electrodes (sticky patches) on your chest. The electrodes are attached to wires that send the electrical activity of your heart to the ECG monitor. A baseline ECG will be performed before giving the medication. Your healthcare provider will administer the medicine slowly through the IV line. They will record many ECGs during and after the medicine is administered. The doctor may continue monitoring for at least four minutes after the effects of the pharmacologic stress testing agent have resolved. You may have no activity restrictions after the test. If you are breastfeeding, you may be advised when to resume breastfeeding depending on the specific radioactive tracer agent used. Another follow-up may be required based on the results of the stress test or other related health conditions."
Will pilonidal cysts return?,"'Pilonidal cysts develop again even after surgery in most of the patients. A ''pilonidal cyst'' is not fatal; however, it can become more difficult to treat and may turn into a severe condition. One can prevent recurrence by washing the area daily with mild soap, making sure all soap is removed, keeping the area completely dry, and avoiding sitting for long periods.' "
What is piriformis syndrome?,"'The pyriformis syndrome is a painful neuromuscular condition that develops due to abnormal tightening of the pyriformis muscle situated near the hip joint. The tight muscle irritates or compresses the ''sciatic nerve'' in its vicinity and causes ''pain'', tingling, or numbness along the buttock down the back of the leg and into the thigh.' The piriformis muscle is a flat, band-like muscle located in the buttock near the top of the hip joint. This muscle stabilizes the hip joint and lifts and rotates the thigh away from the body. This enables us to walk, shift our weight from one foot to another, and maintain balance. It is helpful in almost every motion of the hips and legs. The sciatic nerve is a thick and long nerve in the body. It passes alongside or through the piriformis muscle, down the back of the leg, and eventually branches off into smaller nerves that end in the feet. Nerve compression can be caused by the constant pressure of the tightened or swollen piriformis muscle."
What is a piriformis injection used to treat?,"'Sometimes the piriformis muscle can become irritated, swollen and tight due to injury and twitching. It can then press upon the nearby sciatic nerve. This can cause hip and ''buttock pain'' that can extend down the leg. A piriformis injection is used to treat ''pain'' in the buttock area. During the procedure, a steroid (medication used to reduce swelling) is injected into the piriformis muscle. This reduces swelling and this decreases the pressure on the nerves and reduces the pain. This may allow the muscle to heal, especially with physiotherapy.' "
What happens during the piriformis injection procedure?," The patient will lie on a table. The area to be treated will be cleaned and covered with a special sheet. This is done to maintain aseptic precautions. The doctor will use a special X-ray to view the area and then numb the area with a local anesthetic. The doctor may inject contrast (to help highlight the area on X-rays) and then they will inject a drug (steroid + numbing agent combination or botulinum toxin) into the piriformis muscle. The procedure usually takes about 10 minutes, and the patient remains awake throughout the procedure."
What are the complications of piriformis injection procedure?,"'Complications from piriformis procedures are rare. Possible side effects include:' Pain, bruising or bleeding at the injection site Infection Nerve injury Increased pain in normal painful areas Allergic reaction to the medications used or contrast used."
What can I expect after piriformis injection?," The patient may feel sore at the injection site for a few days after the procedure. An ice pack is applied on the injection site for 15-20 minutes at least four times a day for several days. Before using the ice, it is wrapped in a towel, so it does not touch the skin. The patient may continue to have the usual pain until the steroid starts to work. This can take up to two weeks. Usually, the doctor recommends over-the-counter pain medications or muscle relaxants. Physiotherapy is recommended after the injection to further reduce pain in the muscle. Pain relief from a piriformis injection usually last for several months, but this may differ from patient to patient.  The patient may have three to four steroid injections a year. If a patient gets no relief from the steroid, doctors will continue to look for the source of the pain and explore other treatment options."
What is a pleural biopsy?,"'A pleural biopsy is a procedure used to remove a sample of the pleura using a special biopsy needle during surgery to diagnose disease, infection or ''cancer''.''Pleura is a thin tissue that lines the chest ''cavity'' and surrounds the lung. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissues or cells from the body so that it can be analyzed in a lab. Pleural biopsy is performed to diagnose various lung problems.''There are three types of pleural biopsies:''Needle biopsy: This is done under local anesthesia, the physician inserts the special biopsy needle into the pleural space (the space between the pleura and the chest wall) to obtain a sample. ''Ultrasound'' (high-frequency sound waves) or computed tomography (''CT scan'', a combination of X-ray and computer technology) may be used to guide the biopsy needle insertion. Most pleural biopsies are performed using this technique. This procedure may also be referred to as a thoracentesis.''Thoracoscopic biopsy: A special type of endoscope (thin, flexible, lighted tube) is inserted into the pleural space under either local or general anesthesia. The endoscope help physician visualizes the pleural tissue and takes a biopsy of any suspicious site.''Open biopsy: This done under general anesthesia, the physician makes an incision in the skin and surgically removes a piece of the pleura. Depending on the laboratory findings, further surgery may be performed.' "
Why is a pleural biopsy performed?,"'Pleural biopsy is performed to:' Evaluate an abnormality of the pleura seen on chest x-ray Diagnose the cause of recurrent pleural infection (caused by bacteria, virus, fungus, or tuberculosis) or other condition Investigate fluid collection in the pleural space (pleural effusion) Determine if a pleural mass is malignant (cancerous) or benign Obtain further information after pleural fluid analysis suggests the presence of cancer, infection or tuberculosis"
What happens during pleural biopsy?,"'A pleural biopsy may be performed on an outpatient basis or a part of the hospital stay. Procedures may vary depending on the patient’s condition.' The patient’s vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and oxygen level) may be monitored before and during the procedure. Patients may receive supplemental oxygen as needed, through a face mask or nasal cannula (tube). The patient will be placed in a sitting position with arms raised and resting on an overbed table. This position aids in spreading out the spaces between the ribs for needle insertion. If a patient is unable to sit, they may lie on their sides on the edge of the bed on the unaffected side. The patient will be asked to hold still, exhale deeply, and breathe during the procedure. The skin at the puncture site will be cleansed with an antiseptic solution. The patient will receive a local anesthetic. They may experience a brief stinging sensation at the site of the injection. When the area is numb, the physician will insert a needle between the ribs in the back. The patient may experience some pressure at the injection site. When the needle enters the pleural space, fluid may be withdrawn slowly. The physician will insert the biopsy needle into the site. One or more samples of pleural tissue will be obtained. The biopsy needle will be withdrawn and firm pressure will be applied to the biopsy site for a few minutes until any bleeding has stopped. A sterile adhesive bandage/dressing will be applied. The tissue sample will be sent to the lab for examination. The patient may have a chest X-ray immediately after the biopsy."
What are the risks involved in pleural biopsy?,"'As with any surgical procedure, complications may occur. Possible complications of a pleural biopsy may include:''Pleural biopsy is not indicated in certain bleeding conditions and ''pregnant'' patients.' Air becomes trapped in the pleural space causing the lung to collapse (pneumothorax) Bleeding in the lung Infection Pain Anesthesia-related complications like headache and drowsiness."
What is a pleurectomy?,'Lungs'' are surrounded by a thin lining called pleural membrane (pleura). Pleura help lungs move with ease during ''respiration''. A pleurectomy is a surgical procedure that is done to remove part of the\xa0pleura. Pleurectomy is indicated for an individual who has recurrent lung diseases or infections.\xa0' 
Why and how is a pleurectomy performed?,"'There are a few different reasons why a doctor may recommend a pleurectomy which include:''A pleurectomy is usually done under general anesthesia in the operating room. During the procedure, an incision is made along the back and parallel to the lungs (thoracotomy). After gaining access to the chest, the surgeon then carefully peels away and removes the layers of pleura. Additional tissue may be removed if the doctor is operating for mesothelioma. Before the incision is closed, drainage tubes are placed which will be removed later on when the bleeding and discharge are small. The incision is then closed, often with ''sutures'' that will dissolve on their own. The procedure is usually completed within four hours.\xa0' Mesothelioma: Mesothelioma is cancer-related to asbestos exposure. This can arise from the pleural linings (pleural mesothelioma) as well as the thin linings that cover the heart and abdomen. The most common indication for a pleurectomy is to treat malignant mesothelioma (aggressive cancer which can spread). When a pleurectomy is used to treat mesothelioma, it is often combined with a procedure called decortication (pleurectomy decortication). This procedure involves not only the removal of the pleura but also of any adjacent tumor that may be present in the chest cavity. Recurrent pleural effusions: A pleurectomy may also be done for people who have persistent or recurrent pleural effusions (excess fluid accumulates in the space between the lungs and the chest cavity). Sometimes, a pleural effusion spread to several separate areas in the lungs. The build-up of fluid can then be prevented by removing the pleura altogether. Malignant pleural effusions: Malignant pleural effusions are the pleural effusions that contain cancer cells. They may arise from primary lung cancer or due to metastases from other cancers such as breast cancer. Although the treatment of malignant pleural effusions is most often palliative (the procedure is done to improve quality of life but not to cure a disease), controlling the build-up of fluid can often improve shortness of breath and decrease pain. Recurrent pneumothorax (accumulation of air in the lungs): For people who have had two or more collapsed lungs, a pleurectomy may be done to prevent another recurrence.? Removing the linings of the lungs (the pleura) leaves no space where air can accumulate."
What are the risks involved in pleurectomy?,"'As with any surgical procedure, there are potential risks and complications. Risks of pleurectomy include:' Anesthesia-related headache, nausea, and drowsiness Bleeding Infection Damage to the lungs and other organs in the chest cavity Persistent air leak (sometimes it can be difficult to remove a chest tube following a pleurectomy due to a persistent air leak) Recurrence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax due to include inadequate removal of pleural tissue Scar tissue (adhesions) may develop in the chest and chronic pain may occur in some people"
What is the outcome of pleurectomy?,"'Respiratory therapy is usually involved throughout the recovery period, helping people to breathe deeply and get out of bed quickly to lower their risk of ''pneumonia'', ''blood clots'', and other complications. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be recommended down the line as well to improve ''breathing''. A pleurectomy is a surgical procedure that carries risks, but can sometimes greatly improve quality of life for people living with mesothelioma or a malignant pleural effusion. For those who have been coping with a recurrent collapsed lung or recurrent pleural effusions, a pleurectomy can sometimes resolve the problem completely.' "
What is the diaphragm muscle?,"'A ''diaphragm'' is a primary muscle that helps in ''respiration'' (''breathing'' process). This dome-shaped muscle is located just below the ''lungs'' and ''heart''. It contracts continually as we breathe in and out. This thin muscle at the chest base separates the abdomen from the chest. It contracts and flattens when we breathe. This creates a vacuum effect that pulls air into the lungs. When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes, and the air is pushed out of the lungs.''Additionally, it has some nonrespiratory functions. The diaphragm increases abdominal pressure to eliminate vomit, urine and feces from the body. It also places pressure inside the throat to prevent ''acid reflux''.''The phrenic nerve controls the diaphragm movement.' "
What is a plication of the diaphragm procedure?,'A plication of the diaphragm is performed for ''paralysis'' or abnormally shaped diaphragm. This condition usually leads to breathing difficulties. Diaphragm paralysis is typically due to damage to the phrenic nerve. Abnormality of the diaphragm may be birth related. Surgical plication to stabilize the diaphragm is needed to prevent the lungs from ballooning outward during expiration (breathing out).' 
How is a diaphragmatic plication performed?,"'A diaphragmatic plication can be performed with either an open or thoracoscopic approach. Usually, it is performed under general anesthesia. The procedure takes about two hours.\xa0''For open plication of the diaphragm:''Thoracoscopic diaphragm plication:' The patient is placed lying on their side. A surgical incision is made into the chest wall below the eighth rib.  The lung is deflated and retracted upward.  Any adhesions found are freed. The weakened area of the diaphragm is then grasped with a clamp and elevated to determine the location of the suture line.  Layers of sutures, sometimes reinforced with Teflon pads, are sewn in rows at the edge of the diaphragm along the patient's rib cage encircling the inside of their chest wall. After plication, the height of diaphragm is lowered by one or two ribs, helping the lungs inflate properly and prevent abdominal contents from pushing into the chest. Chest tubes are placed to drain fluid or air that accumulates. It is similar to the open technique. Two or three small incisions are made, and ports are placed. In addition, a 5-cm surgical incision into the chest wall may be made. The diaphragm is depressed into the abdomen, and two rows of sutures are sewn into either side of the edge of the diaphragm where it meets the chest wall. The suture is tied in place, creating a crease in the diaphragm that tightens and lowers the diaphragm into the abdomen."
What are the risks involved in the diaphragmatic plication?,'The severity of some of these complications is probably a reflection of the severity of comorbid health problems in this patient population. Complications of diaphragmatic plication include:\xa0' Prolonged chest tube drainage of higher than seven days  Respiratory failure  Gastrointestinal hemorrhage  Splenic cut requiring splenectomy  Stroke  Abnormal heart rhythm Injury to the heart or its adjoining structure  Injury to the lung and its adjoining structure
How long does it take to recover from a diaphragmatic plication surgery?,"'Usually, recovery time for a diaphragmatic plication surgery is eight to 12 months. It is common to feel tired for six to eight weeks after the surgery. The chest may hurt and be swollen for up to six weeks.' "
What is the outcome of diaphragmatic plication?,'Successful diaphragmatic plication for ''birth defects'' and diaphragm paralysis reduces lung compression and symptoms. It improves the quality of life for the long-term.' 
What are the common precautions after pneumatic retinopexy?,"'Common precautions after the procedure include:' Patients may be recommended to keep their head in a certain position for 3 weeks, depending on the recovery. To ensure that the retina reattaches properly and depending on the location of the retinal tears, patients may have to spend a significant amount of time each day in a facedown position to keep the bubble in the correct position. They may be recommended not to lie on their back as the bubble will move to the front of the eye and press against the lens instead of the retina. Until the gas bubble disappears, patients may also position pillows in the bed in a way that keeps them from lying on their back. They may be advised against air travel until the eye has healed. A change in altitude could cause the gas bubble to expand. This would increase the pressure inside the eye. Patients will need to wear protective eyewear for some time after the surgery as well. Patients may be advised to take pain medications and antibiotics for a few weeks depending on their age and recovery."
What is the recovery period after pneumatic retinopexy?,"'The success of pneumatic retinopexy depends on maintaining the head position after the gas bubble injection. Some patients notice an improvement in vision immediately after surgery, and for others, improvement can take several months. The recovery period usually lasts several weeks (at least 4 weeks). Most patients do not resume normal activities for at least 2 weeks. The vision may continue to improve for 6 months after surgery.' "
What are the possible complications of pneumatic retinopexy?,"'Pneumatic retinopexy is a minimally invasive procedure and usually does not have complications, but as with any procedure, a few common complications may be expected, which include:' Surgery related complications like pain, infection, and bleeding The most common complication is a recurrence of the detachment The other common complication is the cataract formation (a condition in which the lens of the eye may become opaque, resulting in blurred vision) An increase in the eye pressure may damage the optic nerve and cause glaucoma Gas may get under the retina if the head position is not maintained Excessive scar tissue formation Cystoid macular edema: A condition where there is swelling in the central part of the retina. This may cause permanent loss of vision due to the scarring of the retina. More serious but a rare complication includes vision loss. Approximately, there is a 20% chance of needing further procedures to save the eye and the vision."
Is pneumatic retinopexy the best treatment to reattach a retina?,"'Pneumatic retinopexy is not usually the best or the only treatment to reattach a retina. This procedure is usually used for uncomplicated detachment with the tear located in the upper half of the retina. However, it is usually not recommended for a complicated ''retinal detachment''. Compared to other retinal surgeries, this surgery has a lower single surgery success rate.' "
What is a polyamorous relationship?,"'The traditional belief is that every person should seek a single soulmate and commit to that person completely. Some individuals believe that it is unrealistic and unfair to expect the fulfillment of emotional, sexual and financial needs from one person. This thought process is the basis for polyamory. Numerous studies show that around four to eight percent\xa0 of the population in the United States is in a polyamorous relationship.''Polyamory, or consensual nonmonogamy, is the practice of having multiple intimate relationships, with the full knowledge and consent of all parties involved. It is generally not\xa0gender specific. Anyone can have multiple partners of any\xa0gender. Polyamorous relationships require consent, open-mindedness, immense trust, communication skills, clear boundaries and mutual respect without feelings of jealously.''The studies also show that individuals who are in polyamorous relationships make more efforts to practice ''safe sex'' and have a high incidence of blood testing for ''HIV'' and STIs.''Polyamory differs from other types of open relationships, such as swinging (couples having casual sex outside of the relationship, without being emotionally attached). Polyamory may often be confused with polygamy. Polygamy is being married to more than one person at the same time. Polygamy involves marriage to multiple people of the opposite\xa0gender, whereas polyamory involves both married partners having the freedom to have relationships outside their primary relationship. Polyamorous relationships are not illegal, but polygamy is illegal in many parts of the world, including the United States.''A social stigma is associated with polyamorous relationships. Therefore, it is often practiced privately and may be kept secret even from close friends and family out of fear of being judged. Polyamory is not a sexual orientation, but more of a lifestyle choice.''Some polyamorous people have a primary relationship and engage in casual relationships with others with consent from the other partner. Some may introduce a secondary partner, which requires the primary couple to agree on a set of rules, such as date times and the type of\xa0intimacy\xa0allowed. Some relationships start out as polyamorous, while others may become polyamorous after being together for a while. Each couple may have their own set of rules. However, if one partner wants a polyamorous relationship and the other doesn’t, then it could be threatening to the relationship.''The reason why polyamorous relationships are not very common is that they do not follow the traditional social, cultural or religious construct of relationships. Polyamorous relationships need a lot of work and may benefit from counseling from time to time. Polyamory is not a personality disorder or a malady. It is simply an alternate way of life.''The concept of “cheating” does not exist in polyamorous relationships because both parties involved in a polyamorous relationship are required to be completely honest about their other relationships.''Ultimately, being in a polyamorous relationship comes down to the people involved in the relationship. It may work for some people, but it requires partners to be open and transparent.' "
What is a splint?,'A splint is a type of a medical tool made of wood or rigid material. It is used to immobilize a fractured or dislocated bone. A splint usually helps to maintain any part of the body in a fixed position. The most common use of splints is in emergency settings to keep a ''broken bone'' in position until it heals.' 
What is an elbow dislocation?,"'An elbow joint injury frequently occurs during sporting activities. A significant force is required to disrupt the joint because the elbow joint’s stable, bony structure. Therefore, an associated ''fracture'' often occurs along with the ''elbow dislocation'', thus classifying the dislocation as complex.''The elbow joint is made up of three main bones:''There are several different ligaments, tendons and muscles that help keep these bones in their normal positions while a person moves this joint around. In most cases, the ulna is dislocated and goes behind the humerus.' Humerus (bone of the upper arm) Radius (bone on the thumb side of the forearm) Ulna (It lies medially and parallel to the radius)The Olecranon process is bony prominence at the top of the ulna that forms the “point” of the elbow. The Olecranon process is bony prominence at the top of the ulna that forms the “point” of the elbow."
What is a posterior elbow splint?,'A posterior elbow splint is a type of splinting procedure used to stabilize the following injuries:' Fractures or soft tissue injuries of the elbow Fractures or soft tissue injuries near the radius or ulna that require immobilization of the wrist and elbow
When can a posterior elbow splint not be used?,"'Certain injuries require immediate evaluation or intervention by a consultant (e.g., orthopedic surgeon, hand surgeon and ''plastic surgeon''), and splinting alone cannot be the treatment. Such injuries are as follows:' Complicated fractures Open fractures Injuries associated with nerves and blood vessels"
How is a posterior elbow splint done?,"'Splinting is usually tolerated without the use of anesthesia. However, if significant manipulation of the injury is required during the splinting process, anesthetic techniques may be used.' The displaced or fractured bone is immobilized by a posterior splint at 45-90° of elbow flexion, and the wrist is slightly extended at 10-20°. Usually, a posterior elbow splint is made of plaster or fiberglass with sufficient padding or cotton. A splint is cut out into a 3- or 5-inch length, necessary to immobilize the affected part (usually radius and ulna). A splint may be bisected lengthwise from the fingertips to the shoulder. The splint is secured in place using a sling that makes it look like an “L” shape. This splint would be in place for three days to three weeks.  Throughout the immobilization phase, wrist and shoulder functions should be maintained through a range of motion and strengthening exercises."
What are the complications of a posterior elbow splint?,'Complications of a radial gutter splint are as follows:' Excess heat during splinting may cause skin burns Pressure sores Skin infection Swelling and pain Joint stiffness Too tight a splint may exert pressure on adjoining nerves.
What is anterior shoulder instability?,"'The shoulder joint is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body. It has the greatest range of movement of any joint, but this leaves it unstable and with the highest chance of dislocation of all the body’s joints. The shoulder is a ball-and-socket type of joint that permits a wide range of movement. Its bony structures include the upper arm bone (the humerus) and the shallow ''cavity'' (the glenoid) of the shoulder blade. The shoulder joint is formed where the head of the upper arm bone fits into the shallow ''cavity'' (glenoid fossa). The joint is surrounded by numerous ligaments and muscles such as the subscapularis, which give it stability.' Shoulder instability refers to a condition in which an injury that allows the head of the upper arm to dislocate from the shallow cavity. This type of dislocation is also called anterior (near) shoulder instability. In anterior shoulder instability, the subscapularis muscle plays an important role."
What is the subscapularis muscle?,"'The subscapularis is a triangular-shaped shoulder muscle located in the shoulder bone. This muscle attaches the shoulder bone to the upper arm bone called the humerus. The function of this muscle is to stabilize and rotate the shoulder joint. It allows the shoulder to allow the arm to turn inward. When the arm is extended, it draws the humerus forward and downward. It also prevents the dislocation of the head of the humerus (upper arm bone). The subscapularis is the most used muscle in the shoulder. It is the primary muscle used in pitching, hitting, ''swimming'', and all types of sports. As a result, injuries to the shoulder muscle are common among athletes.' "
What are the symptoms of anterior shoulder instability?,"'People with anterior instability of the shoulder joint can sometimes feel the ball of the shoulder come out of its socket or “give way.” Often, the episodes of giving way occur with specific activities or positions of the arm, such as throwing a ball or reaching behind the body.' Commonly associated with severe pain A decreased range of arm/shoulder motion Swelling and bruising"
What is the Putti-Platt procedure?,"'Putti-Platt is one of the surgical treatment options for anterior shoulder instability. In this procedure, the flexible cord (tendon) of the subscapularis muscle is cut and then reattached to the head of the upper arm bone (humerus). This procedure makes the head of the upper arm bone tighter to the shoulder blade allowing better stability of the shoulder joint. This type of procedure is rarely indicated.' "
When is the Putti-Platt procedure not recommended?,'Putti-Platt is a rare procedure and done only for anterior shoulder instability. Below are conditions in which the Putti-Platt procedure is not recommended:' Any other shoulder instability (posterior or multidirectional). Glenohumeral arthritis (swelling of the shoulder joint). Restricted external rotation of the shoulder.
How is the Putti-Platt procedure done?,"'The Putti-Platt procedure is done under general anesthesia. Usually, the procedure is completed within 180 minutes. During this procedure:' The surgeon monitors the patient vitals throughout the procedure after administering general anesthesia. The patient is positioned in a beach-chair position. The room is arranged to allow the arm to be raised (the relaxing position) fully abducted (away from the body) and externally rotated throughout the procedure. The skin is incised along the shoulder bone and curved at the tip of the upper arm bone. The flexible cord (the tendon) of the subscapularis muscle is detached from the shoulder bone and then reattached to the head of the upper arm bone (humerus). After the upper bone is tightened with the flexible cord, the surgical opening is sutured, and the patient is monitored in an intensive care unit"
What are the complications of the Putti-Platt procedure?,"'This procedure has promising initial outcomes but disappointing long-term follow-up.' The main drawback of this procedure is the loss of external rotation of the shoulder to increase the stability of the shoulder. This cannot be performed on athletes because it reduces the shoulder range of motion. Pain and recovery periods are more in this procedure. Sometimes, late osteoarthritis (degeneration of the joints) is observed after this procedure."
What is the recovery period after the Putti-Platt procedure?," After surgery, the patient’s shoulder may be immobilized for three to six weeks. Rehabilitation with exercises is recommended for the next two months after the immobilization period. Usually, patients regain full motion and strength of the shoulder joint after one year of the procedure."
What is a radial gutter splint?,'A splint is a medical device made of wood or other rigid material. It is used to immobilize a fractured or dislocated bone. A splint usually helps to maintain any part of the body in a fixed position. The most common use of splints is in emergency settings to keep a detached bone in position until a surgeon can look at it.' The radius and ulna are the two bones that form the forearm and join with the wrist and fingers. A radial gutter splint is a type of splint that is used to treat fractures of the index (second) and long (third) fingers. It is so named because these fingers lie on the radial (lateral) side of the hand.
What is a radial gutter splint used for?,'A radial gutter splint is used to treat' Soft tissue injuries to the second and third fingers Fractures of the second and third fingers Rheumatoid arthritis (swelling and pain of the joints) Deep cuts or lacerations over the joints of the second and third fingers
When is a radial gutter splint not recommended?,'A radial gutter splint cannot be used for fractures with nerve damage or fractures where the overlying skin is broken. Such types of injuries require surgery and monitoring. A radial gutter splint is also not recommended when there is a severe deformity due to a birth defect or injury (angulated neck fractures) at second and third fingers.' 
How do you make a radial gutter splint?,"'A radial gutter splint is placed along the radial aspect (radial bone) of the wrist. It sandwiches the second and third fingers providing the optimal function of the second and third fingers, allowing maximum mobility of other digits. Radial gutter splinting is usually tolerated without anesthesia. However, anesthesia or analgesia may be required in cases where a minimal alteration is required.''Below are the steps of making a radial gutter splint:' A splint is cut out into a three- or four-inch length, necessary to immobilize the wrist and injured fingers (usually second and third). A splint may be bisected lengthwise from the fingertips to the wrist. A dry gauze or cotton material may be inserted between the second and third fingers. The splint “tails” are folded so that it sandwiches the second and third fingers. The splint is secured in place using a bias wrap or an elastic bandage."
What are the complications of a radial gutter splint?,'Complications of a radial gutter splint include' Skin burns due to excess heat used during splinting Pressure sores Skin allergies Swelling and pain Joint stiffness and reduced movement
What are the recommendations after placing a radial gutter splint?,"'Usually, the patient may be recommended to rest and elevate the limb.' The patient may report back immediately in the emergency department if there is increased weakness or numbness or color change (pale or blue) of the affected arm. The same should be done in case of pain that does not relent or a feeling of plaster constriction. Spreading redness or streaking should be immediately reported. The plaster should be kept dry and clean. The patient should not insert any items into the splint to scratch if it itches. Sticking objects into the splint can wrinkle the padding and lead to pressure sores. It may also cause a break of skin and infection that would be overlooked because of the presence of covers. The patient should visit the clinic or hospital within 48 hours of splinting for surgery or other treatment."
What is a sacrocolpopexy procedure?,"'Sacrocolpopexy is a procedure to surgically correct pelvic organ prolapse where a mesh holds the organ in the correct position inside the body. Pelvic organ prolapse is a condition caused by weakening of the support system in the pelvic floor. It is similar to a ''hernia'' in men.''Organs of the pelvis (the area between the hip bones) include''The organs are held in place by a group of muscles and other support tissues. When the support system becomes stretched, weak or torn, it leads to slippage of the pelvic organs from their normal place (prolapse).''The different types of prolapse include''The most common cause of pelvic organ prolapse includes' Vagina Uterus Cervix Bladder Urethra Intestines Rectum Uterine prolapse: The uterus and cervix slips down past the vaginal opening. Vaginal vault prolapse: The top part of the vagina (vaginal vault) slips down the vaginal canal. Cystocele: The urinary bladder bulges into the vagina. Rectocele: The rectum bulges into the vagina. Enterocele: The small intestine bulges against the vaginal wall. Vaginal birth that increases the risk of vaginal prolapse Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) Aging Vigorous physical activity Lifting heavy objects Conditions related to increased abdominal pressure such as obesity, frequent straining while defecating or chronic cough Genetic factors that lead to a weaker pelvic support system"
How is sacrocolpopexy performed?,"'The physician performs sacrocolpopexy laparoscopically. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia so that the patient remains asleep throughout the procedure. Next, the physician makes four to five incisions on the abdomen. The physicians fill the abdomen with carbon dioxide ''gas'' to create space for the surgery. With the help of a laparoscope and other instruments, the physician performs the surgery. The physician attaches a surgical mesh to the front and back wall of the vagina to suspend the cervix back into its position. Most of the time, the physician prefers to remove the uterus but may leave the cervix. If the bladder or rectum does not seem to be in place, the physician may repair these areas. The physician may place a small piece of mesh underneath the urethra to give support to patients with ''urinary incontinence'', especially when they ''cough'', laugh or sneeze. The camera attached to the laparoscope helps the physician to examine the inside of the uterus to look out for injuries during the surgery.''Sacrocolpopexy takes about two to three hours to complete.' "
What happens after a sacrocolpopexy surgery?,"'You will be sent to the recovery room for monitoring. While in the hospital, you will''Sacrocolpopexy isn’t devoid of any risks. Hence, you must be aware of its risks, which include' Take medications for pain and nausea. Get a shot of blood thinners. Walk as much as possible to speed up recovery. Wear compression stockings on your legs to prevent the formation of blood clots. Be checked for bladder emptying. Take Miralax for softening the stools. Bleeding Damage to the bladders or ureters Nerve damage Blood clots in the legs or lungs Bowel obstruction Discomfort during sex Hernia (weakness in the muscles near the incision causing lumps) Infection Urinary problems Opening of the incision"
How is a fetal scalp electrode placed?,"'A fetal scalp electrode is placed for internal fetal monitoring, which is generally done when the patient is in labor. The doctor will explain the procedure and take the patient’s consent. The patient will be asked to wear a hospital gown before the procedure. During the procedure:' The patient will lie on a labor bed with their feet and legs supported like in a pelvic examination. The healthcare provider will perform a vaginal exam with a gloved hand to know how much the cervix has dilated. If the amniotic sac is not broken, the provider will break open the membranes with a tool. The healthcare provider will then feel the part near the cervix (the presenting part), which is usually the baby’s head. A thin tube called a catheter is inserted in the vagina. The catheter is attached to a small wire (the electrode). The catheter is finally removed leaving the electrode on the baby’s scalp for monitoring."
Can a fetal scalp electrode harm the baby?,"'Fetal scalp electrode placement is a relatively safe procedure that does not use any sharp instruments or radiations. There may, however, be an increased risk of infections, injury, and ''bruising'' of the baby’s scalp or other body parts. Internal fetal monitoring should not be done if the mother has ''HIV'' infection since it may be transmitted to the baby during the procedure.' "
Can I drown if I fall asleep in a sensory deprivation tank?,"'No. Some people fall asleep, but the water is so buoyant that they stay afloat. The worst that can happen is getting woken up by a bit of saltwater in the eyes. Using the shower afterward is also suggested to remove the coating of Epsom salt that is left on the skin and hair.' "
What is a short arm splint?,"'Short arm splints are short splints that immobilize joints of the hand and wrist or to protect bony and soft tissues in the forearm (between the elbow and wrist). They also extend between the thumb and pointer finger. They heal the fractured bones by keeping the broken ends together and in alignment.''The different types of short arm splints used are as follows:' Ulnar gutter splints: This type of splint is useful for fractures and severe sprains to the bones of the ring and small fingers. The ulnar gutter splint extends from the upper part of the forearm to the last joint of the fractured finger. Radial gutter splints: This type of splint is useful for fractures and sprains to the bones of the middle and pointer fingers. Thumb spica splint: This type of splint is useful for thumb fractures, dislocations, and sprains. It is also useful for fractures to the scaphoid (small bone in the wrist). Volar/dorsal splints: Splints extend from the middle of the forearm to the distal crease (crease near the top of the palm). These are useful for fractures to the bones of the wrist and index, middle and ring fingers. Sugar-tong splints: This type of splint is useful for fractures of the forearm and wrist."
When is a short arm splint used?,"'Short arm splints are used for several different types of injuries:' Fractures to the bone close to the wrist Fractures to bones in the wrist Control of pain and swelling After the surgery protection of the forearm or wrist Fracture to the bones of the fingers Fracture to the scaphoid (a small round bone in the thumb side of the wrist) Carpal tunnel syndrome: A condition characterized by pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand due to a pinched nerve in the wrist. Rheumatoid arthritis Sprains and strains of the wrist and hand"
What is the difference between a short arm splint and long arm splint?,"'Long arm splints start from the humerus (a bone in the upper arm) and extend down the arm to the base of the fingers. They are mainly used to heal injuries of the upper arm, particularly of the elbow.' "
How is a short arm splint applied?,"'The common procedure for applying all types of splints is as follows:' First, the physician applies a soft loosely knitted stretch fabric called stockinette. Next, the physician applies two to three layers of cotton padding as a protective layer to the skin. Extra layers of padding are applied to the bony area. A splinting material can be either strips or rolls. The physician dips the splinting material in water and places it over the padding. Lastly, the physician applies an elastic bandage over the splint. While still wet, the physician uses palms to mold the splint to the desired shape. Once hardened, the physician checks the pulse."
What to expect after the application of a short arm splint?, Swelling may exert pressure in the splint for the first 48-72 hours. You need to elevate your swollen arm for the first 24-72 hours. Gentle movements of the swollen arm prevent stiffness. Apply ice to the splints. Consult your physician if you experience any of these symptoms around the splints:Increased painNumbness or tingliness in your handBurning and stingingExcessive swelling below the splint Increased pain Numbness or tingliness in your hand Burning and stinging Excessive swelling below the splint
How long does a short arm splint stay on?,"'A splint usually stays on for several days to weeks. A splint is usually preferred in case of swelling. Once the swelling resolves, the doctor will remove the splint and apply a cast. Splints need to be adjusted in the first few days if the injury is swollen.' "
What else do I need to know about short arm splints?,'You need to take good care of the splints for proper healing. You should also remember to:' never insert objects inside the splint. They can stick inside or break off the skin. not allow dirt or sand to get inside the splint. not apply powder or deodorant inside a splint. always keep the splint dry and in place.
What is a subacromial space?,'A subacromial space is the area below the top of the shoulder blade (acromion) and above the ''rotator cuff'' tendons present on the top of the bone of the upper arm (humerus). Inflammation of the ''rotator cuff'' tendon or subacromial bursa present in the subacromial space can lead to painful symptoms.' 
What is a shoulder subacromial injection?,'Injecting ''corticosteroids'' into the subacromial space is one method to treat inflammation and ''pain''. Injections can reduce ''pain'' and inflammation and restore the mobility of shoulder joints. Injections into the subacromial space also are administered in the following conditions:''Subacromial injections can be used as either a treatment or diagnostic technique.' Subacromial bursitis: Inflammation of the bursa (small fluid-filled sac) found near joints. Rotator cuff impingement syndrome: Injury to the muscles around the bones in the shoulder. Rotator cuff disorders: A tear in tendons (tissue connecting the muscle to bone) around the shoulder joint. Adhesive capsulitis: A condition characterized by stiffness and pain in the joints. Rotator cuff tendinopathy: Swelling of the tendons in the shoulder.
When should be shoulder subacromial injections avoided?,'Subacromial injections should not be administered in the following conditions:' Uncontrolled coagulopathy (impaired bleeding disorder) Cellulitis (overlying serious bacterial skin infection) Allergic to the contents of the injection Septic arthritis (infectious joint arthritis) Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) Bedsores Less stable joints resulting in falls and injury Blood thinner use Diabetes mellitus Overlying skin bruise or wound Young age Unable to remain still for the procedure
How is a shoulder subacromial injection administers?,"'The patient is made to either stand or sit. The physician identifies the subacromial space by examining it. Once the physician identifies the subacromial space, a syringe filled with steroid and a local anesthetic is injected into the joint space. The solution should enter the space with minimal resistance. The physician may reposition the needle in case of any resistance. The ultrasonographic technique can enhance the accuracy of the subacromial injection. It may take two-seven days for the steroid medication to provide pain relief.''This technique offers temporary relief of pain and inflammation. ''Shoulder pain'' that does not respond to subacromial injections needs to be treated with surgery.' "
What are the complications of a shoulder subacromial injection?,"'The complications of a subacromial injection include:''Other possible rare side effects of the subacromial injections are' Allergic reactions to the anesthetic agents  Infection at the site of injection Rupture of blood vessels and nerve The increased blood sugar level in patients with diabetes tendon (a tough band of tissue connecting the muscle to the bone) rupture Reddening of skin Light patches on the skin Steroid-induced joint inflammation Loss of fatty tissue Steroid-induced side effects Steroid flare-up (pain and inflammation around the site of injection) Muscle wasting Skin discoloration bruising, bleeding and pain at the injection site for some days."
How is mastectomy performed?,"'The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The surrounding ''lymph nodes'' may also be removed during a mastectomy if they are at risk of developing cancer or already infiltrated with cancer.''A'' simple mastectomy'' involves the removal of the entire breast, including the breast tissue, ''areola'', and nipple.''A ''skin-sparing mastectomy'' involves the removal of all the breast tissue, nipple, and areola, without removing the skin of the breast skin. This may not be suitable for larger tumors that have infiltrated the skin.''A ''nipple-sparing mastectomy'' involves the removal of only the breast tissue, without removing the skin, nipple, and areola.''Breast reconstruction'' may be performed immediately after mastectomy or can be planned for a later time, based on the patient’s condition and preference.''After the procedure:' Painkillers and antibiotics would be administered The dressing may be removed after 48 hours Patients may be discharged on the same day or 24 to 48 hours after the surgery if there are no complications Postoperative pain, swelling, and bruising is normal and usually resolves in 1 to 2 weeks Patients can resume daily activities in a week after surgery Complete recovery may take around 2 to 4 weeks.

What are the complications of mastectomy?,"'Common complications of mastectomy include:' Bleeding Hematoma (blood clot formation) Infection Pain Swelling Bruising Unsightly scarring or keloid formation at the surgical site Shoulder pain Numbness or decreased sensation around the incision site, which is usually temporary Reaction to anesthesia"
How can you detect breast cancer early?,"'In the early stages, there may be no ''symptoms of breast cancer''.''One of the earliest signs are:''Other signs and symptoms of breast cancer are:' A painless lump in the breast or under the armpit. The lump is firm or hard and does not move within the breast tissue (fixed to the underlying structures). Self-examination by patients and regular screening in high-risk patients is advised. This allows for early diagnosis and treatment. There can be swelling throughout the breast or in part of the breast without a lump being felt. Cancer cells multiply fast and spread quickly. Hence, the lump quickly increases in size, involves surrounding structures, including the skin, and spreads to the rest of the body. The reddish appearance of affected breast skin with dimpling of the skin, which is similar to an orange peel Changes in the shape of the breast The nipple, if involved, gets retracted and pulled inwards, having an inverted appearance Discharge or bleeding through the nipple Peeling, crusting, and flaking the areola (pigmented skin around the nipple) or breast skin Enlarged lymph nodes, felt as lumps in the armpit, groin, neck, and other areas"
What are the causes of breast cancer?,'The exact cause of breast cancer has not been determined. Researchers have found that several factors increase the risk of breast cancer. It could either be a single risk factor or a combination of risk factors causing breast cancer. Some common risk factors that have been identified to cause breast cancer are:' Genetics Increasing age Radiation exposure Early menarche (before the age of 12) Late-onset of menopause Late first pregnancy (over 30 years) or never being pregnant Hormonal replacement therapy Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption Obesity
What is a single-port surgery?,"'A single-port surgery is performed through a single incision (cut) in the navel. It is less invasive surgery than traditional laparoscopic surgery. The major advantages of single-port surgery are' minimal scarring, less discomfort, faster recovery and fewer complications."
What is a single-port appendectomy technique?,"'A single-port ''appendectomy'' technique involves the removal of the ''appendix'' (''appendectomy'') using a single-port laparoscopic surgery.''A single-port appendectomy is indicated in acute, recurrent and chronic inflammation of the appendix (''appendicitis''). The appendix is a small, tube-shaped pouch attached to the ''large intestine''. The exact function of the appendix is unknown. It does not have a major role in the functioning of the body and is known as a vestigial organ.' "
Who should not undergo a single-port appendectomy?,'Patients with the following conditions should not undergo this surgery:' Pregnancy Perforations (burst) in the appendix Retrocecal appendix (appendix situated behind the cecum) Severe obesity Scar tissue in the abdomen after previous abdominal surgery Bleeding disorders
How is a single-port appendectomy performed?,"'Before the surgery''An appendectomy may or may not be an emergency procedure. There would be little time for preparation in case of an emergency.''In a planned appendectomy, the patient may need to refrain from eating eight hours before the surgery.''Additionally, certain medications may need to be discontinued.''During the procedure''The surgeon generally performs a single-port appendectomy under general anesthesia. As with the traditional laparoscopic methods, a single-port appendectomy does not use forceps for retraction. The surgeon makes an incision near the navel and passes a slender tool that has a tiny video camera and light on the end\xa0 (laparoscope) through the incision. A surgical loop is created over which the appendix is pulled out.''The physician creates a loop using a synthetic suture material in the abdominal wall. Next, the physician passes a string through the loop to be attached to the appendix. The surgeon pulls out the appendix to create tension.''Lastly, the surgeon removes the appendix and takes it out from the abdomen. The surgeon ''cuts'' the loop and closes the incision.''After the surgery''You may feel ''pain'' at the incision site.''You can take ''pain''-reliever medications to relieve pain.''You may feel nauseated or throw up after the surgery.''You can resume your normal activities approximately a week after the surgery.' "
What are the complications of a single-port appendectomy?,'Complications of a single-port appendectomy include''Inform your physician if you notice the following symptoms:' Bleeding Infection in the surgery area Hernias Blood clots Heart problems Risk of hurting nearby organs Small risk of pus collection in the site of surgery Fever above 101° Severe pain or swelling in the abdomen Severe nausea or vomiting Severe pain that does not relieve by medications Breathing problems or cough
What is a sugar-tong forearm splint?,'A ''sugar''-tong forearm splint is a long U-shaped splint that immobilizes the injured forearm or wrist and prevents forearm rotation and wrist motion. They heal the fractured bones by keeping the broken ends together and in alignment. A ''sugar''-tong splint may align the ''broken bone'' or protect the patient’s forearm or wrist after the surgery.''Sugar-tong splints are applied to treat the following conditions:' Wrist fracture Mid lower arm fractures Lower arm fractures Control of pain After surgery protection of the forearm or wrist
What is the purpose of sugar-tong splinting?,"'The main purpose of sugar-tong splinting is to immobilize the joints and bones above and below the fracture site. This is to prevent bone edges from moving and damaging other muscles, vessels, or nerves and further complications. Splinting will only be effective when the adjacent joints and bones remain immobilized.' "
When should be sugar-tong splint application avoided?,"'Sugar-tong splint application should be avoided in the following conditions:' Open fracture (the broken bone that tears the skin) Impending compartment syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition in which the pressure builds up in the arms) Neurovascular compromise (malunion of the nerves and blood vessels) Active or developing reflex sympathetic dystrophy (chronic arm pain caused due to injury, surgery, stroke or heart attack)"
How is a sugar-tong splint applied?,"'The traditional sugar-tong splint utilizes the help of an assistant. First, the physician applies a soft loosely knitted stretch fabric called stockinette over the area. Next, the physician applies two to three layers of cotton padding as a protective layer to the skin. Extra layers of padding are applied to the bony area. The splinting material can be either strips or rolls. The physician dips the splinting material in water and places it over the padding. Next, the physician applies an elastic bandage over the splint. While still wet, the physician uses palms to ''mold'' the splint to the desired shape. Once hardened, the physician checks the pulse.''The ''caregiver'' usually applies a splint to a fresh injury. Once the swelling subsides, the caregiver replaces the splint with a cast.' "
What to expect after the application of sugar-tong splint?, Swelling may cause pressure in the splint for the first 48-72 hours. You need to elevate your swollen arm for the first 24-72 hours. Gentle movements of the swollen arm prevent stiffness. You need to apply ice to the splints. You need to consult your physician if you experience any of these symptoms around the splints:Increased painNumbness or tingling in your handBurning and stingingExcessive swelling below the splint Increased pain Numbness or tingling in your hand Burning and stinging Excessive swelling below the splint
How long does a sugar-tong splint stay on?,"'A splint usually stays on for several days to weeks. A splint is usually preferred in case of swelling. Once the swelling resolves, the doctor will remove the splint and apply a cast. Splints need to be adjusted in the first few days if the injury is swollen.' "
What else do I need to know about sugar-tong splints?,'You need to take good care of the splints for proper healing. You should also remember to' Never insert objects inside the splint. They can stick inside or break off the skin. Not allow dirt or sand to get inside the splint. Not apply powder or deodorant inside a splint. Always keep the splint dry and in place.
What is a sural nerve block?,"'A sural nerve block is a procedure for anesthetizing a part of the calf, lower leg, heel and foot. An anesthetic solution is injected adjacent to the Achilles tendon on the outer side of the foot. The anesthetic blocks the transmission of ''pain'' signals from injury or surgery in these parts of the lower leg.''The sural nerve is a terminal branch of the ''sciatic nerve''. The sciatic nerve provides motor function and sensation to the back of the thigh and the entire lower leg from the knee down. The sciatic nerve has two major branches:''The sural nerve is a sensory nerve made up of a branch each from both the tibial and peroneal nerves. The sural nerve passes down the calf and lower leg adjacent to the Achilles tendon, into the little toe-side of the foot. The sural nerve is relatively superficial and can be blocked by an anesthetic injection at a variety of levels above, or at the ankle.' Tibial nerve Common peroneal (fibular) nerve"
What does the sural nerve do?,"'The sural nerve and its branches transmits information of sensation from part of the calf, lower leg, heel and foot to the brain. The sural nerve transmits ''pain'' signals to the brain when injury or ''trauma'' occurs in these parts of the lower leg.' "
What does sural nerve pain feel like?,"'Injury or irritation to the sural nerve causes a burning pain in the calf and below. Sural nerve damage may also cause tingling, hypersensitivity, or numbness in the affected region.' "
Why is a sural nerve block performed?,"'A sural nerve block may be performed alone, or in combination with other ''nerve blocks'' depending on the area that requires anesthesia. A sural nerve block is performed to provide:''A sural nerve block is performed during surgical procedures in the lateral part of the calf, lower leg, heel and foot, including:''A sural nerve block is a better alternative to a local tissue infiltration anesthesia because it:''A sural nerve block is avoided for any of the following reasons:' Anesthesia for surgical procedures Pain relief (analgesia) for injury, or post-surgery Repair of wounds and lacerations Treatment of ankle fracture or dislocation, as part of an ankle block Incision and drainage of abscess Removal of foreign body Requires a lower volume of anesthetic agent to achieve anesthesia in a larger area. Requires fewer injections, which reduces the trauma to the patient. Provides selective pain relief and reduces the need for sedation and opioids. Provides longer-lasting anesthesia and analgesia (pain relief). Allergy to local anesthetics Infection at the injection site Bleeding disorders Pre-existing nerve damage"
What does synchronized electrical cardioversion mean?,"'Synchronized electrical ''cardioversion'' is a medical procedure in which an electric current is passed through a person’s chest to convert abnormal ''heart'' rhythm (''arrhythmia'') to normal heart rhythm. The direct current (DC) shocks to the heart has long been used successfully to convert ''abnormal heart rhythms'' back to normal rhythms. The use of an electric current as a rescue method dates back to the eighteenth century when electricity was used to revive a hen from lifelessness. Dr. Beck was the first physician to use a DC to treat arrhythmia in a 14-year-old boy during cardiac surgery in 1947.''Cardioversion is typically used to terminate a life-threatening or unstable tachycardic arrhythmia (arrhythmias with an increased heart rate such as unstable ventricular and supraventricular rhythms). In synchronized electrical cardioversion, the electrical discharge from the cardioversion machine is synchronized with the electrical activity of the patient’s heart. During an arrhythmia, the heart does not pump enough blood to the body. Irregular heart rhythms if left untreated can lead to more serious conditions such as a ''heart attack'' or ''stroke''.' "
Who needs synchronized electrical cardioversion?,"'Synchronized electrical cardioversion is done to restore normal heart rate and rhythm, so the heart can pump blood as it should. The procedure is required in cases when the heartbeat is too fast or irregular, which may cause the following symptoms:''The various types of arrhythmias that may be managed with synchronized electrical cardioversion are' Chest pain or discomfort Light-headedness or dizziness A pounding or fluttering in the chest Shortness of breath Chest discomfort Extreme fatigue Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to re-entry Atrial fibrillation (AF, afib) Atrial flutter Atrial tachycardia (AT, atrial tach) Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with pulses"
How is synchronized electrical cardioversion done?," Synchronized electrical cardioversion may be scheduled (elective procedure) or done as an emergency procedure.  It is typically an outpatient procedure that means you can go home on the same day. In case of a scheduled or planned procedure, before the procedure, your doctor mayOrder some blood tests and imaging studiesAsk about any allergies you may haveAsk you about any long-term health conditions you may haveAsk you about any medications you are onExplain the procedure in detail along with the risks involvedAsk you to shave any hair on the chestTake your consent for the procedureAsk you not to eat or drink anything for at least eight hours before the procedure Order some blood tests and imaging studies Ask about any allergies you may have Ask you about any long-term health conditions you may have Ask you about any medications you are on Explain the procedure in detail along with the risks involved Ask you to shave any hair on the chest Take your consent for the procedure Ask you not to eat or drink anything for at least eight hours before the procedure During the procedureYou will be asked to wear a hospital gown.The doctor will attach an intravenous (IV) line and administer sedatives and painkillers.The doctor will place several electrodes (sticky patches) and adhesive cardioversion pads on your chest and sometimes on the back.The electrodes are connected to a cardioversion machine through wires.The cardioversion machine records the heart rhythm and delivers shocks to the heart to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. The doctor will attach an intravenous (IV) line and administer sedatives and painkillers. The doctor will place several electrodes (sticky patches) and adhesive cardioversion pads on your chest and sometimes on the back. The electrodes are connected to a cardioversion machine through wires. The cardioversion machine records the heart rhythm and delivers shocks to the heart to restore a normal heart rate and rhythm. Once you are sedated, the procedure usually takes a few minutes to complete. After the procedure, you will be monitored in the recovery room for any complications before you are allowed to go back home."
What is the difference between synchronized cardioversion and defibrillation?,"'Both synchronized cardioversion and ''defibrillation'' are performed to restore a normal heart rhythm. However, they differ in some respects:' In synchronized cardioversion, the electric current is synchronized or timed with the electrical activity of the patient’s heart (the QRS complex in electrocardiography [ECG]). The synchronized shock is delivered at a precise moment to avoid causing or inducing a certain type of arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation). The defibrillation procedure, on the other hand, delivers an unsynchronized electric current to the heart. Although synchronized cardioversion is often performed in stable patients, defibrillation is typically done in unresponsive patients in a cardiac arrest. Synchronized cardioversion delivers a low energy shock to the heart, whereas during defibrillation, a high-energy shock is delivered without the need to time the shock to the unstable rhythm."
What is TME surgery?,"'Total mesorectal excision (TME)'' is a type of procedure to remove ''cancer'' from the end of the anal area (rectum). In this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of the rectum that contains ''cancer'' and some healthy tissue on either side.\xa0''They also remove the fatty tissue (mesorectum) around the rectum, which contains the blood vessels and ''lymph nodes''. Removing the mesorectum reduces the risk of any ''cancer'' being left behind. This procedure can sometimes be used for early-stage ''cancers'' that are higher in the rectum and not accessible by other procedures.\xa0''A specially designed magnifying scope is inserted through the anus and into the rectum. This allows the surgeon to remove the cancerous part with greater precision and accuracy.\xa0' "
When is total mesorectal surgery recommended?,'Total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery ''is recommended for patients who have cancers in the middle and lower area of the rectum. It is now considered the gold standard procedure for removing tumors in the middle and lower areas of the rectum.' 
How is a TME surgery performed?,"'Total mesorectal excision (TME) ''is performed under general anesthesia with or without an epidural painkiller. The procedure is performed by a specially designed instrument called a laparoscope.\xa0''The rectum and colon are freed up from the surrounding attachments so that the diseased segment can be safely removed along with some of the fatty tissue that carries the blood vessels and lymph drainage to the bowel.''The ends of the intestine are then reattached. At the end of the operation, the abdominal wall is stitched up and then the skin is closed, usually with absorbable ''sutures''.''The rectal procedure has three different methods of approach:' Anterior resection or TME: Anterior resection is usually used for cancers in the upper and middle parts of the rectum (close to the colon). After the cancer is removed from the area, the surgeon rejoins the two open ends of the intestine. Some people may need an artificial opening called a stoma after this operation. This artificial opening is usually closed after a few months. Colo-anal and J pouch surgery: This method may be used for removing cancers in the lower rectum. The surgeon removes the entire rectum and attaches the intestine to the anus. Sometimes, the surgeon makes a pouch (called a J pouch) from part of the colon, before joining it to the anus. The pouch acts like a new rectum and stores stools until it is convenient to pass them. Usually, the patients need an artificial opening for this procedure, which is later closed upon the patient’s recovery. Abdominoperineal resection (APR): This method is usually used for cancers that are very low in the rectum (near to the anus). To remove all cancers, the surgeon needs to remove the rectum and anus. The patient might have a permanent artificial opening for this procedure because the anal area is completely removed."
What are the risks involved in TME surgery?,"'Total mesorectal excision (TME) procedure'' is associated with the following risks:' Anesthesia complications such as headache, drowsiness, and vomiting Bleeding Pain Infection in the surgical area Leak from the joined area Blood clot in the veins or lungs Impaired rectum function Stigma due to the presence of an artificial opening"
What is the outcome of TME surgery?,'Patients who have ''rectal cancer'' that is confined to the lower two-third of the rectum are generally considered good candidates for a total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery. Patients are usually discharged within a week after the procedure. Patients typically have a five-year survival rate with fewer complications after a TME procedure.' 
What is complete mesocolic excision (CME)?,"'Complete mesocolic excision (CME)'' is the surgical treatment of colon (''large intestine'') cancer. The goal of this procedure is to remove the affected large intestine along with some healthy tissue on either side.\xa0''Usually, the surgeon also removes the fatty tissue (mesocolon) around the colon, which contains the blood vessels and lymph nodes. Removing the mesocolon reduces the risk of any cancer being left behind.\xa0''This procedure is performed under a specially designed laparoscope under general anesthesia. CME adopts the same principle as total mesorectal excision (TME).\xa0' "

What are the types of a pelvic exenteration?,'A pelvic exenteration can be carried in three different ways depending on the ''cancer'' location:' An anterior exenteration: It removes the bladder but not the rectum. It is done if there is no cancer in or close to the rectum. A posterior exenteration: It removes the rectum but not the bladder. It is done if there is no cancer in or close to the bladder. A total exenteration: It removes both the bladder and rectum.
Why is a total pelvic exenteration performed?,'A pelvic exenteration is used when cancer has spread within the pelvis or has come back in the pelvis after other treatments. It is most often used to treat ''cervical cancer'' that has come back after treatment. This operation can be done to treat cancers in the pelvis including:' Cervical cancer Womb cancer Vaginal cancer Vulval cancer Rectal cancer Anal cancer Prostate cancer in men
Is total pelvic exenteration a major surgery?,"'A pelvic exenteration is a major operation. It is an open procedure and usually takes around 8-10 hours to complete. The average length of the stay in the hospital is 10-14 days after the procedure. There are risks associated with the procedure. Possible risks and complications from this surgery are as follows:\xa0' Bleeding Blood clots Problems due to general anesthesia such as dizziness, headaches, and vomiting Infections and slow wound healing Joining inside of the bowel or stoma could come apart Joining tubes coming from the kidneys could come apart A hole called a fistula can occur in the pelvis or abdomen due to having cancer treatments Bowel could get obstructed The kidneys could start to fail Reconstruction tissue may begin to break down"
What is the survival rate of a patient after a total pelvic exenteration?,"'As per research, the survival rate is considered poor in a total pelvic exenteration, despite improvements in the technique. Multiple non-modifiable factors at the time of an exenteration are associated with poor survival.' "
How is a tracheostomy performed?,"'A tracheostomy is usually done under general anesthesia, but in emergencies, patients are administrated local anesthesia.''The type of procedure depends on why the patient needs a tracheostomy and whether the procedure was planned. There are essentially two options:''For both procedures, the surgeon inserts a tracheostomy tube into the hole. A neck strap attached to the faceplate of the tube keeps it from slipping out of the hole, and temporary ''sutures'' can be used to secure the faceplate to the skin of the neck.' A surgical tracheotomy can be performed in an operating room or a hospital room. The surgeon usually makes a horizontal incision through the skin at the lower part of the front of the patient’s neck. The surrounding muscles are carefully pulled back, exposing the windpipe (trachea). At a specific spot on their windpipe near the base of their neck, the surgeon creates a tracheostomy hole. Minimally invasive tracheotomy (percutaneous tracheotomy) is typically performed in a hospital room. The surgeon makes a small incision near the base of the front of the patient’s neck. A special lens is fed through the mouth so that the surgeon can view the inside of the throat. Using this view of the throat, the surgeon guides a needle into the windpipe to create the tracheostomy hole, then expands it to the appropriate size for the tube."
What are risks involved in a tracheostomy procedure?,"'Every surgical procedure carries the risk of infection and excessive bleeding along with anesthesia complications that include ''headache'', drowsiness, and ''vomiting''. Below are few common risks involved in a tracheostomy procedure:' Damage to the thyroid gland in the neck Damage to the larynx (voice box) or airway with resultant permanent change in voice (rare) Lung collapse Airway obstruction and aspiration of secretions  Need for further and more aggressive surgery Air trapping in the surrounding tissues or chest. In rare situations, a chest tube may be required. Scarring of the airway or erosion of the tube into the surrounding structures Need for a permanent tracheostomy.

What is esophageal cancer?,"'The ''esophagus'' is a long hollow muscular tube connecting the throat (pharynx) with the stomach. ''Esophageal cancer'' originates from any of the layers of the esophagus. It is the sixth most common cause of ''cancer'' deaths worldwide. The most common symptom of esophageal ''cancer'' is trouble swallowing, or ''dysphagia'', which occurs when the ''cancer'' grows and the opening to the esophagus gets smaller.' "
What is a transhiatal esophagectomy?,"'The surgical treatment for removing esophageal cancer is called an ''esophagectomy. ''In an esophagectomy procedure, some or all of the swallowing tube (esophagus) is removed and then the esophagus is reconstructed by using part of another organ, usually the stomach. Esophagectomy is a common treatment for esophageal cancer that includes aggressive and nonaggressive ''cancers''.' If a surgeon performs an esophagectomy by making incisions in the abdomen and neck, it is called a transhiatal esophagectomy. This procedure is one of the types of open esophagectomy. If a surgeon performs an esophagectomy by making incisions in the abdomen and chest, it is called a transthoracic esophagectomy. Rarely, surgeons make an incision in the neck, chest, and abdomen if required, which is called a three-field esophagectomy."
What happens during a transhiatal esophagectomy?,"'Usually during a transhiatal esophagectomy patients are given general anesthesia. It is major surgery, and the procedure may last for five to six hours depending upon the patient’s condition.\xa0' After anesthesia is given, the surgeon monitors the patient’s vitals throughout the procedure.  The surgeon makes incisions in the abdomen and neck to deliver the instruments used for the procedure.  The surgeon may then remove some or most of the esophagus, a portion of the top of the stomach, and nearby nodes or tissues where the cancer is involved.  The length of the esophagus and the part of the stomach that is removed depend on the stage and location of cancer. Once the diseased part is removed, the surgeon reconstructs the esophagus with the stomach by pulling it up. In some circumstances, a portion of the intestine rather than the stomach may be pulled up and connected to the esophagus. After the surgeon completes the procedure, they suture the incisions. Patients may then be monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) until they wake up."
What are the risks involved in a transhiatal esophagectomy?,"'There are risks associated with any surgical procedure, and these are usually explained to the patient and their family. The risks are as follows:' Bleeding Infection Cough Leakage from the surgical connection of the esophagus and stomach Changes in voice Acid or bile reflux Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia Dysphagia (swallowing difficulties) Atrial fibrillation Death"
How does a transhiatal esophagectomy affect digestion and absorption?,"'After the procedure, the doctor will recommend tube feeding (enteral ''nutrition'') through a small tube placed through the abdomen that connects to the small bowel. This type of feeding will continue for four to six weeks to ensure adequate ''nutrition'' while the patient recovers.\xa0''Once the patient recovers and starts a normal ''diet'', they may need to eat frequently in smaller quantities because the stomach size is reduced. However, the patient may have nutrient deficiency, and the doctor may prescribe ''vitamins'' and ''supplements''.\xa0''Absorption and ''digestion'' processes may change due to stomach size. The patient might feel more hunger, and they may need to eat frequently over the day.\xa0''The patient may also ''lose weight'' because the stomach size was reduced; hence, the patient must consume frequent small portions regularly after a transhiatal esophagectomy.''After the surgery, the remaining esophagus may not be able to move foods as easily from the patient’s mouth to their stomach.\xa0''Certain foods can block the esophagus or be difficult to swallow. Some people may complain of food ""sticking"" or have mid-sternal (behind the breastbone) ''pain''. This may be prevented or resolved by sipping fluids when eating solid foods, chewing foods well, eating soft or chopped foods, and avoiding tough, gummy, or stringy foods.' "
What is the outcome of a transhiatal esophagectomy?,"'A transhiatal esophagectomy is an effective operative approach for esophageal cancers. The procedure has fewer complications and a high survival rate in a five-year case study. Sometimes, however, this procedure may also be used along with ''chemotherapy'' to increase the survival chances of the patient.' "
What is a transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB)?,"'A transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) is a method used by radiologists to remove a piece of lung tissue for examination. It involves inserting a long needle through the patient’s chest wall (thorax).\xa0''TNB is also called a closed, transthoracic, or percutaneous biopsy. This procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis or during the patient’s hospital stay.\xa0' "
Why is a transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) performed?,"'Most often, a transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) is performed to rule out ''cancer''. It is usually performed after the doctor detects an abnormality on chest ''X-rays'' or a computed tomography (CT) scan. Other reasons are' To diagnose lung infection To determine the cause of fluid collection in the lungs To determine if the lung mass is benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous)"
When is a transthoracic biopsy avoided?,'A transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) is avoided if the patient has the following conditions:' Bleeding disorder Severe bullous emphysema (enlarged alveoli that occur with emphysema) Hydatid cyst (fluid-filled sacs caused by parasitic infestation in the lungs) Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lung arteries) Severe hypoxia (low oxygen level in blood) Recurrent cough
How is a transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) performed?," The patient is advised not to eat anything for 6-12 hours before the test.  The doctor will ask the patient to discontinue medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen or blood thinners (warfarin), for a certain number of days before the procedure.  Before a needle biopsy of the lungs, a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan may be performed to locate the exact spot. The doctor may give the patient a sedative to make them comfortable. The patient leans forward or lies down on their back on the bed. The doctor may inject a local anesthetic into the chest wall. The doctor makes a small incision on the chest. Next, the doctor inserts the biopsy needle, attached to a syringe, into the chest. During this procedure, the doctor looks at images displayed by the computed tomography (CT) scan or special X-ray (fluoroscopy) as the needle moves forward inside the chest toward the suspicious area in the lungs. Once the needle reaches the lungs, a small sample of the lungs is drawn into the syringe. The patient may feel a short quick pain or mild discomfort. They will be asked to hold their breath at this time.  The needle is removed gently, and pressure is applied on the incision wound to stop the bleeding followed by bandaging the wound. The procedure usually takes 30-60 minutes.  If the patient remains stable for 30 minutes, a chest X-ray is taken after the biopsy. The biopsy sample is sent to the lab for examination, which usually takes a few days. If the chest X-ray does not show a complication known as pneumothorax—collection of air between the lung and chest wall—the patient can begin to eat and move around the hospital. The chest X-ray is repeated after three hours to exclude a delayed pneumothorax. If the procedure has been performed on an outpatient basis, the patient can be discharged home on the same day. If the patient develops pneumothorax during a transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB), they will be observed for several hours. Sometimes, a chest tube needs to be inserted to allow the draining of air from the chest."
What are the complications of a transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB)?,"'A computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (TNB) is generally a safe procedure. Complications are observed more in patients aged 60-69 years, ''smokers'' and those with ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'').''The possible complications of TNB are' pneumothorax, bleeding of wound or the lungs, hemoptysis (coughing of blood), hemothorax (leaking of blood in the space between the lungs and chest wall) and air embolism (one or more bubbles of air that block a blood vessel)."
What is a tube thoracostomy?,"'A tube thoracostomy, also known as open chest drainage, is a surgical procedure to drain the collection of pleural fluid, air, blood, or pus from your pleural ''cavity'' through a tube inserted in your chest.''The pleural ''cavity'' is the space lying between the pleura (visceral and parietal)—the two thin layers that surround the ''lungs''. This space contains a small amount of liquid known as the pleural fluid, which acts as a lubricant for the expansion and contraction of the lungs during ''respiration''.\xa0''When there is an excessive collection of the pleural fluid or buildup of air, blood, or pus in your pleural cavity, you will have difficulty in ''breathing''. In such conditions, a tube thoracostomy eases your breathing.''In some situations, such as severe traumatic injuries to the chest, a tube thoracostomy becomes an emergency and a life-saving procedure.' "
When do you need a tube thoracostomy?,'You need a tube thoracostomy if you suffer from the following conditions:' Pleural effusion: An excessive collection of the pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. Pneumothorax: A leakage of air in the pleural activity. Hemothorax: A collection of the blood in the pleural cavity. Hemopneumothorax: A collection of the blood and air in the pleural cavity. Hydrothorax: A collection of the fluid in the pleural cavity due to organ (the liver or heart) failure. Chylothorax: A collection of chyle (lymphatic fluid) in the pleural cavity. Empyema: A collection of pus in the pleural cavity.
What is done before a tube thoracostomy?," Your doctor will physically examine you and ask for your signs and symptoms. They will order an X-ray and a computed tomography (CT scan) of your chest to decide the best approach for performing a tube thoracostomy. You and your family will be explained about the procedure and its complications, and your written consent will be taken for the same."
How is a tube thoracostomy performed?," Your doctor will tell you to lie down on your back, or sit and lean forward. They will mark the skin below your axilla with a pen and then clean it with an antiseptic solution. They will inject an anesthetic solution locally to numb the marked area. This will make the procedure less painful for you. They may also give you a painkiller and a sedative.  They will first insert a needle attached to a syringe in the marked area to aspirate the fluid and confirm the location of tube insertion. They will make an incision of around 1.5-2 cm in the marked area. They will insert a chest or drainage tube measuring between 6 and 14 mm through the incision. They will stop the procedure if you experience chest tightness or start coughing at this time. The chest tube may have valves around its insertion, and it is connected directly to the outside collection chamber, which collects drainage from the chest cavity. The remaining part of the incision wound and chest tube are covered with bandages and sticking to secure the tube in place."
What is done after a tube thoracostomy?," Your doctor will order a chest X-ray to confirm the correct placement of the chest tube. They will monitor you by closing and opening the valve of the chest tube to allow the flow and stop the drainage as needed. After adequate drainage, they will remove your chest tube and close the wound with sutures and bandages. They will perform a chest X-ray to confirm the resolution of your original disease. Another chest X-ray taken several hours after the removal of the chest tube will show if a complication such as pneumothorax has developed."
What are the complications of a tube thoracostomy?,"'Minor complications of thoracostomy tube placement such as pneumothorax or misplacement of the tube are common. Other possible complications are as follows:' Bleeding: Bleeding may be at the incision wound, inside the chest, or in the abdomen (organ penetration). Tube dislodgement: If the tube gets dislodged, it is replaced by another tube. Hemothorax: The tube is reinserted after the hemothorax resolves. Empyema: Empyema may occur due to the entry of bacteria through the chest tube. Pulmonary edema (fluid collection in the lungs): A rare and life-threatening condition that is more common in patients with diabetes and those with large pleural effusion."
What is the difference between thoracotomy and thoracostomy?,"'A thoracotomy is an operation in which the chest wall is opened to gain access to any of your chest organs, to obtain the tissue samples for laboratory examination or to remove a part of your lung or your entire lung. Being a major surgery, surgeons use it as a last resort when all other options of diagnosis or treating a particular lung disease have failed.''A thoracostomy involves the insertion of a surgical tube into the pleural space to drain air or fluid from the chest through a small incision. It is a simpler procedure than thoracotomy.' "
What is an eye twitch?,"'A ''blepharospasm'' (''eye twitch'') is a harmless tic of the ''eyelid'' muscle, which may resolve on its own. Eye twitch causes the eyelid to blink every few seconds for a minute or two. Twitches are generally painless, but if there is a strong spasm, it causes the eyelid to shut completely and then reopen.''Twitches can be caused by\xa0' Fatigue Eye Stress Smoking Caffeine Medication side effects Light sensitivity Lack of sleep Foreign particles in the eye Corneal irritation"
What is a twitching eye a sign of?,"'Eye twitching is generally painless and harmless and does not signify any serious medical conditions. However, persistent eye twitching can occasionally be a sign of more serious conditions like:''Very rarely, eye twitching can be a sign of a nerve or brain disorder like:' Blepharitis (inflamed eyelids) Dry eyes Light sensitivity Conjunctivitis or pink eye Bell's palsy (A form of facial paralysis due to dysfunction of facial nerves) Dystonia (Involuntary muscle contractions) Parkinson's disease (A brain disorder caused by nerve cell damage) Tourette's syndrome (A nervous system disorder causing sudden involuntary movements and exclamations, often profane in nature) The twitches may also be a side effect of some drugs (Antidepressant medicines or epilepsy medicine)"
What are the different types of eye twitches?,"'There are three types of eye twitches, which are:' Minor eyelid twitches: These are minor twitches associated with fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, caffeine or alcohol; corneal or conjunctival irritation. Benign essential blepharospasm: This results in non-stop blinking or eye irritation. As the condition advances, it can result in blurry vision, light sensitivity and facial spasms. Benign essential blepharospasm is caused by fatigue, stress or prolonged exposure to bright light or wind. Hemifacial spasm:  This rare condition affects the muscles around the mouth and the eyelid. It generally affects only one side of the face."
When should an eye twitch be treated?,"'Twitches mostly resolve without any treatment. However, seek medical attention in the following conditions:' Twitch that lasts for more than a week Eyelid closes completely Spasms which involve additional facial muscles Redness, swelling or discharge from the eye Drooping of the upper eyelid"
How is an eye twitch treated?,"'Minor eyelid twitches can be relieved with the following methods:''There are some alternative therapies, which include:' Getting adequate rest Refraining from alcohol, tobacco or caffeine Dry eyes or irritated eyes may require artificial tears to increase moisture. The physician might inject botulinum toxin (botox) to treat benign essential blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. Botox provides temporary relief by paralyzing the twitching muscles. The patient should undergo repeated treatment for complete relief. Doctors commonly prescribe medications like clonazepam (Klonopin), lorazepam (Ativan) or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride (Artane, Trihexane, Tritane) to treat mild cases. Biofeedback: This technique helps to control the involuntary muscle using relaxation exercises and methods. Acupuncture: Thin needles are inserted to the pressure points to relieve twitching Hypnosis Chiropractic measures: This technique involves hands-on spinal manipulation to heal twitching Diet management Tinted glasses or sunglasses As a last resort, the physician might perform a surgical myectomy, i.e., removal of muscle and nerve endings around the eyelid to relieve the spasms."
What is a video EEG test?,'Video ''EEG'' (''electroencephalogram'') monitoring is a specialized kind of EEG used for diagnosing the cause of ''seizures''. The patient is continuously monitored on a video while their brain activity is simultaneously recorded in an EEG unit.''The doctor studies and correlates EEG readings of the patient during a ''seizure'' and the recorded video of the patient’s behavior at the same time to arrive at a diagnosis.' 
Who is video EEG monitoring used for?,"'Video EEG monitoring is generally used for patients who continue to have ''seizures'' despite antiepileptic ''drugs''. Because seizures are unpredictable, the patient must undergo continuous video EEG monitoring so that the doctor can track and view the event.''Video EEG monitoring helps the doctor to determine the cause of seizures, and decide on the appropriate course of treatment. Video EEG monitoring is used to find:' If the seizures are caused by epilepsy The type of epilepsy, if that is the cause for the seizures The cause for the seizures, if not epilepsy The points of origin of the seizures"
What are the conditions diagnosed with video EEG monitoring?,"'Conditions diagnosed with video EEG monitoring include:' Temporal lobe epilepsy: This most common type of epilepsy starts as a localized seizure in the temporal lobe of the brain and may turn into a generalized seizure. Extratemporal epilepsy: Seizures that originate from any part of the brain other than the temporal lobe. Hemispheric syndromes: Widespread origin of seizures involving a whole hemisphere of the brain. Symptomatic generalized epilepsy: Caused by diffuse brain injury due to infection, congenital abnormality or oxygen deprivation during birth. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy: Known as primary generalized epilepsy — it is inherited. Psychogenic nonepileptic attacks (PNEAs): Occur due to psychological reasons and often misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Syncope: Fainting or blackout spells. Parasomnias: Sleep disorders. Hypnic jerks: Sleep starts that occur while falling asleep. Panic attacks: Seizure-like symptoms caused by anxiety. Nonepileptic myoclonus: Seizures that are not of brain origin and not visible on EEG. Hemifacial spasm: A muscle spasm that makes one side of the face twitch. Benign nonspecific symptoms: Benign, temporary seizure-like symptoms that resolve on their own. Tics: Sudden repetitive motor activity, which is common in children from five to 10 years of age. Shuddering attacks: Sudden jerky movements of the neck or body that may last up to 15 seconds. Cyanotic infantile syncope (breath-holding spells): Fainting after brief inability to inhale after a crying episode, typically in younger children up to five years of age. Gastroesophageal reflux: Reflux and vomiting due to laryngeal spasms that produce seizure-like symptoms. Benign myoclonus of infancy: Sudden muscle spasms and jerks that resolve on their own within a year. Mannerisms: Common in children with mental developmental issues. Spasmus nutans: Head nodding, head tilting and involuntary eye movements, found typically in babies up to 12 months."
What is abdominal wall reconstruction?,"'Abdominal wall reconstruction is a surgery involving the reconstruction of the abdominal wall in order to restore anatomy and function. For example, abdominal wall reconstruction can be used to repair a ''hernia'' of the front of the abdomen.''The abdominal wall (or the belly) is made up of skin, several layers of tissue, including fat and muscle. It protects the abdominal organs, such as the stomach, the ''liver'' and others and helps maintain posture while supporting the spine. The abdominal wall also assists in important body functions such as ''coughing'', urination, and defecation.' "
Why is abdominal wall reconstruction done?,"'The indications for reconstruction of the abdominal wall can be symptomatic (for example, ''pain'' relief of certain pains or for structural defects. Large abdominal defects can lead to significant herniation (abnormal protrusion of an organ or other body structures through a defect or natural opening in the body).''Defects of the abdominal wall may be due to:' Trauma Tumors Tumor removal surgery Other past abdominal surgeries Infection"
What are the contraindications of abdominal wall reconstruction?, Poor general health and nutritional status Simultaneous other serious illnesses
How do you prepare for abdominal wall reconstruction surgery?, Maintain a healthy diet and stop smoking at least 2 weeks prior to surgery. Tobacco smoking delays healing. Stop taking blood thinning medication five to seven days before surgery. Refrain from eating or drinking (including water) six to eight hours before surgery.
How is abdominal wall reconstruction done?,"'The surgery is performed with general anesthesia. Depending on the extent of defect or infection, the surgery can take anywhere between two to eight hours. Abdominal wall is reconstructed using the following:''The method of reconstruction is decided by the surgeon based on experience and nature of defect.''Various types of synthetic prosthetic meshes are available for abdominal reconstruction. ''Polypropylene'' mesh is the most used synthetic prosthetic material in abdominal reconstruction. It is ideal for clean defects with enough soft tissue coverage.''Prostheses are superior to grafts due to the following:''The disadvantages of prostheses are:''Types of flaps:''\xa0Myocutaneous and muscle flaps are commonly used in abdominal reconstruction.' Graft harvesting the patient’s own tissue (autograft).ProsthesesBioprosthesisTissue expansionFlapsVacuum assisted closure Prostheses Bioprosthesis Tissue expansion Flaps Vacuum assisted closure Higher tensile strength Easy availability No donor site morbidity Low rate of recurrence and complications Low cost Susceptibility to infection Bowel erosion Adhesion formation Foreign body reaction Seroma (accumulation of fluid) Biological meshes are derived from human or animal sources. The advantage of biological meshes are lower infection rates. This procedure uses the ability of skin to stretch over time to promote healthy skin and tissues and replace damaged tissue. It is usually performed by placing a balloon-like expander beneath the skin near the damaged area. Over time, the expander is filled with saline causing the skin around it to stretch and grow.  It is commonly used in breast reconstruction, but rarely in abdominal reconstruction. Flap is a tissue lifted from a donor site and moved to a site of defect with an intact blood supply. Based on the nature of the defect. Cutaneous flaps: Contain full thickness of skin and underlying superficial tissue. Ideal for small defects. Fascio-cutaneous flaps: Contain full thickness of skin, underlying superficial and deep tissue and more blood supply with ability to fill a larger defect. Musculocutaneous or myocutaneous flaps: Addition of muscle layer to fascio-cutaneous flap. Provides bulk to fill deeper defects and restore function. Muscle flaps: Only the use of muscle to fill defects and restore function skin can be placed over it if needed. Bone flaps: Used to replace bone in case of bony defects VACUUM-ASSISTED CLOSURE THERAPY (VAC): VAC device uses a device to reduce the air pressure on the wound, hence helping wounds heal faster and reduces infection."
What can I expect after abdominal wall reconstruction?," Painkillers and antibiotics may be administered. A surgical drain may be placed during surgery which may be removed after 24 to 48 hours. Dressing may be removed after 24 to 72 hours. Based on the extent of reconstruction, the patient may be discharged between two to seven days. Patients can walk slowly with support typically after 2 days. Swelling and bruising may be present, which eventually revolves."
How long does it take to recover after abdominal wall reconstruction?," Swelling, pain, and bruising after surgery, which would subside in a week or two. After 5 to 7 days, patients would usually be able to walk around comfortably. The result may take a few months following surgery in case of major reconstruction. Patients are generally able to resume pre-operative activities, including sexual intercourse and exercise after 4-6 weeks. Regular follow-up would be required to monitor healing. Patients are advised to eat healthy and avoid smoking to promote healing."
What are the complications of abdominal wall reconstruction?," Swelling and bruising Hematoma (blood clot) Seroma (accumulation of fluid) Bleeding Infection Recurrence of hernia Poor wound healing Itching of skin Scarring or keloid formation Temporary numbness around incision site Loss of umbilicus Failure of prosthesis Adhesions due to prosthesis Bowel obstruction Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS): increase in pressure inside the abdomen, probably due to recurrent small bowel obstruction. Patients may present with:Abdominal distentionIncreased abdominal painDifficulty in breathingLoss of consciousnessNausea and vomitingMulti-organ failure – failure of heart, kidney, lungs, brain Abdominal distention Increased abdominal pain Difficulty in breathing Loss of consciousness Nausea and vomiting Multi-organ failure – failure of heart, kidney, lungs, brain"
What is the function of the knee joint?,"'The ''knee joint''’s main functions are to bend and lift (flex and extend), permitting the body to shift positions. The thigh bone (femur) and the shin bone (tibia) meet the kneecap (''patella'') to form the knee joint.\xa0 ''There are four thick bands of tissues (ligaments) that stabilize the knee and keep its movement steady. These include:' Medial collateral ligament (MCL) Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) A posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) ACL prevents the gliding of the knee from back to front and vice versa."
What is the ACL-deficient knee?,"'An ACL injury is a tear in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Injuries may be mild or severe (ligaments tear completely). Without treatment, the ACL loses its function and creates instability in the joints that result in the friction between the bones, leading to a condition known as a chronic ACL deficiency.''An ACL injury occurs due to:' Playing sports Sudden bending or twisting of the knee Falling off a ladder Sudden force hitting the knee"
What is allograft reconstruction of ACL-deficient knee?,"'The ACL-deficient knee can be repaired using an allograft reconstruction technique. Allograft reconstruction utilizes tissue\xa0(Achilles, hamstrings, or patellar tendons) obtained from a different donor to reconstruct the ACL-deficient knee. Autograft reconstruction uses tissues obtained from one’s body to repair the defect.''Advantages of using allograft reconstruction over autograft are:' Spares recipient’s own tissues (autogenous tissues) Complications of using autogenous tissue can be avoided Incisions are small Short surgical times A larger choice of tissue types and size is possible. Because of all these advantages, allograft reconstruction appears to be the rational choice in repairing an ACL-deficient knee."
How is allograft reconstruction of ACL-deficient knee carried out?,"'The physician identifies the potential donor. The donor needs to undergo physical examinations as well as blood tests to rule out any underlying conditions. Tissues or grafts can be taken from the donor site in sterilized conditions.\xa0''Next, the physician sterilizes the issue by soaking the tissue in antibiotic solution and freeze-dries it for preservation.''The freeze-dried tissue is thawed, which then undergoes the following steps:''Once the remodeling is complete, the grafts appear similar to the recipient’s ACL. The remodeled graft is used to repair the ACL-deficient knee.' Revascularization: Restoration of blood supply Cell repopulation: Increase in the number of cells Remodeling: Changing the structure of the grafts to match the recipient’s ACL"
What are the complications of allograft reconstruction?,'The complications of allograft reconstruction include:' Disease transmission Immune response to the implanted grafts High failure rates Donor site complications Infections
What is amaranth good for?,"'Amaranth is a plant with several benefits. It is native to Mexico and Central America. The leaves and seeds of this plant are edible and provide various nutritional benefits. Amaranth was used as a staple food by the Aztecs in the past. The leaves and seeds (also called Kiwicha seeds in Peruvian) of this plant are emerging as a popular “superfood” because of the many health benefits they offer. Both the seeds and leaves of the plant are ''gluten''-free and rich in protein, ''fiber'', ''minerals'' and other nutrients. Gluten is the general name given to the protein found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye, which may not be tolerated by some people because of health conditions such as gluten ''allergy'' or ''celiac disease''. Amaranth seeds come in the category of pseudocereals (not true cereals, but includes plants such as amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat that produce fruits and seeds, but are not a part of the grass family). Amaranth grain can be consumed as amaranth flour in several preparations, popped amaranth and amaranth flakes.''One-fourth cup of dry, uncooked amaranth grains contain about''Moreover, amaranth is a rich source of several other nutrients such as ''vitamins'', antioxidants and minerals including iron, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese and selenium.''Various health benefits of amaranth include' Rich in protein: Amaranth is rich in protein that is needed for overall health. The protein quality of amaranth is considered as good as animal proteins, such as those found in cheese. This is especially beneficial for growing children because it is absorbed better and provides various amino acids needed for their growth and development. Amaranth provides gluten-free protein, which can be consumed even by people with health conditions such as gluten allergy or celiac disease. Good for gut health: Both the seeds and leaves are rich in fiber. Fiber aids in digestion, prevents constipation and maintains gut health. Promotes cardiovascular health: Amaranth has several nutrients including vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber that maintain heart health, regulate blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol levels. Plant sterols or phytosterols found in amaranth particularly have cholesterol-lowering properties. The high potassium content of amaranth also maintains heart health and regulates blood pressure. Managing anemia: Amaranth is rich in iron and can thus help manage low iron levels in the body that cause anemia (low hemoglobin or red blood cells in the blood). Health of bones and teeth: Calcium and vitamin K present in amaranth help maintain healthy bones and teeth. Healthy skin and vision: Amaranth has plenty of antioxidants including vitamin A that help keep the skin and eyes healthy. Anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties: Several studies have reported that amaranth may help prevent cancer. Various antioxidants and other nutrients such as the peptide lunasin found in amaranth are known for their anti-inflammatory and cancer-prevention properties. The anti-inflammatory properties may help prevent various diseases including heart disease, stroke and diabetes."
What is an acromioclavicular joint?,'The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is located at the top of the shoulder; it joins the collar bone (clavicle) and the top of the shoulder blade (acromion). The AC joint deteriorates over time as the joint space between the clavicle and acromion decreases with ''aging''. Any injury to the AC joint can result in inflammation and swelling of the joints.' 
When should acromioclavicular joint injection be avoided?,'Injection to the AC joint should not be performed in the following conditions:' Bleeding disorder Infection at the site Allergic to the contents of the injection Joint fracture Severe joint damage Bedsores Less stable joints resulting in falls and injury Presence of infection or brittle bones adjacent to the injection site Use of blood thinners Overlying skin bruise or wound Young age Unable to remain still for the procedure Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus
How is an acromioclavicular joint injection given?,"'The patient is either made to stand or sit. The physician identifies the AC joint by examining it. Once the physician identifies the AC joint, a syringe filled with steroid and a local anesthetic is injected into the joint space. The solution should enter the space with minimal resistance. The physician may reposition the needle in case of any resistance. The ultrasonographic technique can enhance the accuracy of the AC ''joint injection''.' "
What are the complications of an acromioclavicular joint injection?,"'The complications of the acromioclavicular joint injection include:''Other possible, rare side effects of the AC joint injections are:' Infection of the joint (septic arthritis) Allergic reactions to the anesthetic agents  Infection at the site of injection Rupture of blood vessels and nerve Increased blood sugar level Tendon (tough band of tissue connecting muscle to the bone) rupture Reddening of skin Light patches on the skin Steroid-induced joint inflammation Loss of fatty tissue Steroid-induced side effects Steroid flare-up (pain and inflammation around the site of injection) Muscle wasting Bruising Bleeding Pain at the injection site for some days"
What is an adhesiolysis procedure?,"'Adhesiolysis is a surgical procedure that removes ''abdominal adhesions''.\xa0''After abdominal surgery, the ''scar tissue'' is formed over the surgical wounds. This is part of the healing process.\xa0 In some cases, the ''scars'' thicken giving rise to bands or lumps of scars known as abdominal adhesions. These adhesions can form between two organs or between an organ and the abdominal wall.\xa0''Adhesiolysis can be performed in two ways:' Open adhesiolysis: A single, large cut (incision) is made through the midline of your body which can be extended to either side of your belly button to remove the abdominal adhesions.  Laparoscopic adhesiolysis: A tube-like camera is inserted through a single, small incision made into your abdomen to visualize and remove the abdominal adhesions."
What causes abdominal adhesions?,'There are 90-95% chances that you may develop abdominal adhesions due to abdominal surgery.''Other causes of abdominal adhesions include:' Tuberculosis Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Infections of the reproductive organs of a woman Crohn’s disease: Chronic inflammatory bowel disease Diverticulitis: Infection of the pouches that may get formed in your intestine Peritonitis: Infection of your abdominal cavity (peritoneum) Radiation: High-energy waves used in cancer therapy Congenital: Present by birth
When do you need open adhesiolysis?,"'Abdominal adhesions do not usually present with troublesome signs and symptoms. They remain undetected until found accidentally. However, if you experience health issues due to the adhesions, your doctor may recommend you undergo adhesiolysis.''These may be:\xa0''Open adhesiolysis is generally preferred over laparoscopic procedures when it is difficult to locate the adhesion that is causing the symptoms.' Chronic abdominal pain Small bowel obstruction Infertility"
What is done before open adhesiolysis?," Your surgeon will evaluate your complete physical status and order certain blood tests, X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan. He will decide either to give you medical treatment or operate using any of the two adhesiolysis procedures. Based on the emergency of your condition, your surgeon will plan adhesiolysis within 48 hours to one week. On the day of surgery, you will be given a medicine (general anesthesia) that makes your entire body numb and sleep throughout the procedure. A tube known as Foley’s catheter will be inserted into your urethra to know how much urine you are passing and how much fluid is needed by your body to be given through your veins. You may also be given an injection of a medication (local anesthesia) on your abdomen to numb the area of operation."
How is open adhesiolysis performed?," A single incision is made through the midline of your abdomen which may extend to either side of your belly button. The surgeon identifies the position of the adhesions, cut them, and then connect the necessary abdominal structures. In case of a nonfunctioning part of the bowel that has been obstructed by the adhesions, will be cut (resected). The surgical wound is examined for any bleeding and wiped with a sterile solution. The wound is then closed with surgical threads (sutures) and bandaged."
What is done after open adhesiolysis?," You will be shifted to the surgical ward and observed for several hours after the surgery.  Depending upon how well you improve, you will be sent home after three to seven days. Your doctor will give you painkillers and antibiotics through your veins till you get discharged from the hospital and advise you to continue them orally for the next three to seven days. After the discharge, you will have to monitor your wound to check if it is healing properly.  Your follow-up with your doctor will be scheduled, generally, after one week. "
What are the complications of open adhesiolysis?,"'Like any other abdominal surgery, open adhesiolysis too has some complications that include:' Sepsis (life-threatening response to an infection that can lead to organ failure) Acute renal failure Respiratory failure Myocardial infarction (permanent damage to a part of the heart due to block in the artery that supplies blood to your heart)  Wound infections"
How long does it take to recover from abdominal adhesion surgery?," You may experience abdominal discomfort for about 14-21 days after abdominal adhesion surgery. If there are no complications, you have will have to wait for one or two days after abdominal adhesion surgery to resume your normal activities like walking as followed in any other open abdominal surgery (laparotomy). You can resume strenuous physical activities like lifting heavy objects or jogging after four to six weeks of the surgery or as recommended by your doctor."
What is an ampullectomy?,'An ampullectomy is the surgical removal of the entire ampulla of Vater. The ampulla of Vater or ampulla is the small projection into the duodenum through which bile and pancreatic secretions flow to mix with food for ''digestion''.''Ampullectomy can be performed as:' Open surgery Laparoscopic surgery (key-hole surgery)
When is ampullectomy indicated?,"'Ampullectomy is indicated in the following conditions:' Noncancerous tumors (benign) of the ampulla smaller than 2 cm and located within 2 cm of the ampulla. Early stages of cancer of ampulla (ampullary cancer), where the tumor size is less than or equal to 1 cm and is well-differentiated."
When should ampullectomy be avoided?,'Ampullectomy should be avoided in the following conditions:' Malignant periampullary cancer (cancer originating near/ around the ampulla) Pancreatic lesion Noncancerous tumors of the ampulla that measures more than two centimeters Tumor of the common bile duct that is larger than 1.5 cm Large noncancerous tumors located 2 cm away from the ampulla
How to prepare for an ampullectomy surgery,"'Before undergoing ampullectomy, the patient must be aware of the risks and benefits of the surgery. The patient should be aware of the following information before undergoing ampullectomy:' Ampullectomy is major surgery, and the patient must be able to tolerate the risk of general anesthesia. The patient must undergo certain laboratory tests, imaging tests and physical examinations before the surgery. The surgeon will explain the complications of the surgery. During the surgery, if a new cancerous tumor is detected, further surgeries may be indicated. The patient must list medical and medication history to the physician The doctor assesses the patient’s overall health to check if they arefit to undergo the surgery."
How is ampullectomy surgery performed?,"'Before the surgery, the surgeon will administer general anesthesia. The patient lies flat on the table.\xa0''Stages of the surgery include:' Laparotomy and evaluationOnce the patient becomes unconscious, the surgeon makes an incision in the middle of the abdomen. Once the incision is made, the physician explores the abdominal cavity and the liver.  Once the patient becomes unconscious, the surgeon makes an incision in the middle of the abdomen.  Once the incision is made, the physician explores the abdominal cavity and the liver.  Exposure of duodenum and ampullaAfter the exploration, the duodenum and pancreatic head are moved away (mobilized) from their attachment. The pancreatic head is examined for any tumor. Next, the ampulla and the lesion are identified and examined from outside the duodenum.  After the exploration, the duodenum and pancreatic head are moved away (mobilized) from their attachment.  The pancreatic head is examined for any tumor.  Next, the ampulla and the lesion are identified and examined from outside the duodenum.  ResectionThe surgeon carefully identifies the pancreatic and bile ducts.Superficial cancerous cells on the ampulla are surgically removed (excised) with the help of needle-tip electrocautery. Both the pancreatic and bile ducts are marked with stitches before completing the excision.

What are the risks and complications of ampullectomy surgery?,"'After the surgery, drains are taken out once oral intake has been restored, without complications. In the case of infections, antibiotics will be prescribed.\xa0''Complications of ampullectomy include:' Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Infection Death during operation Narrowing of the duodenum, pancreas or bile Hemorrhage inside duodenum Leakage from the duodenum, bile or pancreas"
What is trabeculoplasty?,"'Trabeculoplasty\xa0is a laser treatment for an eye condition called glaucoma. Glaucoma is a long-standing condition that damages the ''optic nerve'' due to increased eye pressure. Trabeculoplasty helps to open the drainage area of the eye and reduce the eye pressure. Nowadays, laser surgery is used for trabeculoplasty, which makes it more effective and less painful.' "
What happens during argon laser treatment?,"'This procedure does not need any hospitalization and can be carried out by an eye specialist called as an ophthalmologist.''The whole procedure requires about two hours.''Before the treatment,''During the treatment,''After the treatment.' A nurse or doctor will test your vision. Your eye doctor may administer eye drops to dilate your eyes to allow your doctor to carry out the procedure.  You need to wait for 30-40 minutes, so the drops start working on your eyes. Your doctor will put some anesthetic eye drops in your eyes to prevent any discomfort. A special contact lens will be gently placed on your eye to focus the laser beam. Your doctor will ask you to sit in front of the slit-lamp for the treatment. Your doctor will direct a very intense beam of light onto the retina (internal surface of your eye). You may see some flashes of light before your eyes. It is very essential to keep your head still and not to roll it. There may be a slight stinging sensation but nothing more. It will take 5-45 minutes depending on your condition. You can leave the clinic immediately. Your doctor will inform you about the follow-up visit (approximately within three months). You may find that your vision is a blur for the next three to four hours. You will be informed not to drive after this treatment for that day."
Is there any side effects or risk in this treatment?,"'Side effects include:' The eye drops used before the procedure may blur your vision for three to four hours even after treatment. You may have swelling on your retina (the internal surface of the eye) that gradually resolves with time. There is very little risk of worsening your vision clarity. You may require a second treatment session. It may reduce your night vision for a temporary basis (for some hours). Additionally, it may reduce your color vision temporarily (for several hours). You may experience some loss of peripheral vision due to laser treatment depending on your eye condition. Some may experience floaters (spots before their eyes). Occasionally, you may experience a headache for a week after the treatment. You will be informed not to drive on that day of treatment; no other restriction on your daily activity will be required."
Who can undergo this procedure?,"'Your eye specialist may suggest this surgery if you have''Your eye surgeon will examine you and address the shortening of the eye membrane (lamella) and other associated disorders before surgery. It is once again important to identify the cause of ectropion before surgical intervention. Defects such as relaxed eye muscle and outward bending (ectropion) of the tear duct opening (punctum) will require additional surgery. If you have an eye defect since birth, paralysis of the eye muscles, or other reasons of ectropion, then you may require different treatment.' Foreign body sensation in the eye. Hyperemia (excess blood in the eye vessels). Epiphora (excessive watering of the eye). Inflammation of the cornea (clear layer of the eye). An open sore on the cornea (clear layer of the eye)."
When will your doctor not suggest this procedure?,"'Your doctor may not suggest this surgery if' Your condition can be corrected with other treatment options such as lubrication of the eye surface or horizontal tapping of the eyelid. You are unable to tolerate the procedure. You are suffering from severe uncontrolled eye inflammation or infection, and the progress is worse. You may have a high chance of getting complications after surgery."
What happens during an ectropion repair of the eyelid?,"'Before surgery, you will receive local anesthesia.''During surgery:''An eye specialist (ophthalmologist), an eye ''plastic surgeon'', and a ''plastic'' surgeon will work together during this eye surgery. You may require multiple surgeries depending on the cause of your ectropion. The eye surgeon will customize your eye surgery after examining you.''Your surgeon will decide the type of surgery depending on the cause of your ectropion such as follows:''After surgery:' If your ectropion is due to eye muscle and ligament relaxation due to aging: Your surgeon may remove a small part from the outer corner of the lower eyelid. The eyelid is then stitched back together, and muscles will be tightened and repositioned again. If your ectropion is due to scar tissue from an injury or a past surgery: Your eye surgeon will use a skin graft from the upper eyelid or behind your ear and support the eyelid. If you have facial paralysis: You may need more surgeries to correct the eyelid. You will be informed to wear an eye patch for 24 hours or more. Your doctor will prescribe you an antibiotic and a steroidal ointment to apply on the eye several times a day for one week. Your doctor will inform you to put cold compression regularly to reduce swelling and redness. You may feel tightness in the eye after surgery for some days that heals over time. Stitches will be removed a week after your surgery."
What are the complications of an ectropion repair of the eyelid?,'Complications include:' Infection Swelling Bruising Bleeding Pain Poor physical appearance of the eye Drawing back of the lower eyelid Dehiscence (opening) of wound sutures Retrobulbar hematoma (accumulation of the blood behind your eyeball) Corneal abrasion (scraping of the clear layer of an eye) Canthal dystopia (displacement of the inner corner of the eye)
What is EGD?,'EGD'' (''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'') is a procedure for examining the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A flexible tube with a lighted camera (endoscope) is introduced through the mouth or nose passing through the ''esophagus'' and stomach up to the top part of the small intestine (duodenum). An EGD is also known as an ''upper endoscopy''.' 
Is EGD a surgery?,'EGD is not a surgery. It is generally an outpatient procedure lasting about 30 to 60 minutes.' 
Why is an EGD performed?,"'An EGD is performed to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. It may be performed for diagnosis or treatment of digestive disorders. The doctor may recommend an EGD for patient with symptoms such as''Persistent ''pain'' in the upper abdomen''EGD is also performed as a regular screening procedure for people''The doctor may perform an EGD for treatments such as''EGD may be avoided in patients who' Chronic heartburn Chest pain (after heart problems are ruled out) Difficulty or pain swallowing Feeling full with small quantity of food Nausea and vomiting Vomiting blood Anemia and weight loss Blood in stool Feeling of food stuck in the throat at risk for upper GI diseases with existing GI disorders with liver cirrhosis Removal of foreign bodies Control of bleeding Widening or stenting of narrowed esophagus Removal of polyps and ablation of pre-cancerous growths Placement of drainage or feeding tubes are medically unstable are unwilling have perforated or inflamed bowel have bleeding disorders have diverticulitis or adhesions from previous surgery"
What is an EGD used to diagnose?,'EGD is used to diagnose diseases of the ''digestive system'' such as''Inflammatory conditions such as' Celiac disease Esophagitis Gastritis Duodenitis Hiatal hernia Ulcers Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Narrowing of esophagus due to abnormal tissue growth (esophageal rings) Swollen veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) Esophageal tears Tumors or cancer in the GI tract
How is an EGD performed?,"'An EGD is usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' as an outpatient procedure.' The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests. The patient must not eat or drink 8 hours before the procedure. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications and inform them of any allergies. The patient lies on their left side. The doctor administers pain medication and light sedation, and numbs the patient’s mouth and throat with a topical anesthetic. The doctor may place a mouthguard between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting the scope or their own tongue. The doctor may use gentle air pressure to inflate the GI tract. The doctor inserts the endoscope through the mouth and passes it through the esophagus and stomach to the duodenum. The doctor examines the digestive tract on a monitor and may take a biopsy sample for testing or perform treatment as needed using tools that are part of the endoscope. The endoscope is slowly withdrawn. The actual procedure may take about 20 minutes. The patient is monitored in the recovery room and will be able to leave in about an hour. The patient must not eat or drink until they are able to swallow without gagging."
What are the side effects of an EGD?,'EGD may cause a few side effects such as''These side effects usually resolve on their own within 24 hours.' sore throat gas and bloating cramping
What are the risks and complications of an EGD?,"'EGD is a fairly routine and safe procedure for most people. Complications arise rarely, occurring in fewer than 2% of patients. Complications and risks may include:' Perforation of the digestive tract Bleeding Infection Breathing problems Drop in blood pressure and heart rate Excessive sweating Spasm of the throat Allergic reaction to the medication"
What is an endoscopic breast augmentation?,'Breast augmentation'' is performed to increase breast size and structure by inserting implants under the breast tissue or chest muscles. Silicone ''bags'' filled with silicone gel are most often used as implants. ''Endoscopy'' has significantly advanced breast augmentation techniques. High-definition cameras and endoscopes can help improve visualization.''Endoscopic breast augmentation is classified based on the incision employed:' Transaxillary: This procedure utilizes local incision in the armpit (axilla) Transumbilical: This procedure employs an incision in the navel area
Who should avoid endoscopic breast augmentation?, Patients with breast malformation or deformities Patients with sagging breasts Patients with cylindrical-shaped breast
How is an endoscopic breast augmentation procedure performed?," Your surgeon may discuss the procedure, risks and benefits. Your surgeon may discuss four possible access incisions. Your surgeon might also discuss the potential complications involved in this procedure. Your surgeon will assess your health status and any underlying condition. The surgeon might perform a physical examination and also describe the location of the incision. Patients should stop smoking tobacco and using cocaine before the surgery. Avoid aspirin and certain anti-inflammatory drugs. Your surgeon might position you in either of two positions:Transaxillary position: You lie in a straight position with arms extended at 80 degreesTransumbilical position: You lie in a straight position with arms extended at 90 degrees Transaxillary position: You lie in a straight position with arms extended at 80 degrees Transumbilical position: You lie in a straight position with arms extended at 90 degrees The surgeon draws markings before the surgery. After making an incision, the surgeon will separate your breast tissue from the muscles of your chest. This creates a pocket either behind or in front of the outermost muscle of the chest wall (pectoral muscle). The surgeon will insert the implant into this pocket and center it behind your nipple. Saline implants are inserted empty and then filled with sterile salt water once they're in place. Silicone implants are pre-filled with silicone gel. When the implant is in place, the surgeon will close the incision — typically with stitches — and bandage it with skin adhesive and surgical tape. Sutures removal may take up to 10 days to two weeks. You will notice some soreness and swelling for a few weeks. Wear a compression bandage or sports bra that will help during the healing process. Pain medications can control postoperative pain. Avoid any strenuous activities that may cause an increase in blood pressure or pulse. You can resume your normal activities within a week. If you notice warmth and redness in your breast, or you have a fever, you might have an infection. Contact your surgeon as soon as possible. Contact your surgeon if you have shortness of breath or chest pain"
What are the risks of an endoscopic breast augmentation?," Asymmetry: The implant might be placed at an undesired site, either too high or too low, which results in asymmetry and requires surgical repair. Infection: Signs of infection include fever, redness, swelling, and discomfort. Bleeding: Signs of bleeding include marked swelling, increased pain and bruising."
What is the outcome of an endoscopic breast augmentation?,"'Breast augmentation yields immediate results. Breast augmentation may not last for a lifetime. Factors such as ''aging'', injury, ''weight gain'', or ''weight loss'' might disrupt the implants. ''Scars'' may take longer to fade than expected.\xa0' "
What is an epidural nerve block?,"'An epidural nerve block is a procedure to block ''pain'' by injecting anesthetic medication into the epidural space. The epidural space is the area between the inner wall of the backbone (vertebral column) and the outermost of the three membranes (dura mater) that surround the spinal cord. The space between the inner two membranes (subarachnoid) is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.''The vertebral column is a series of interconnected bones that form a protective covering for the spinal cord. A part of the vertebra called lamina forms a roof over the spinal canal in the back of the spine. The needle is inserted between adjacent laminae to access the epidural space and administer the medication for the epidural nerve block.''The epidural space contains ''fats'' to absorb ''shock'', blood vessels and nerve roots. The epidural nerve block numbs sensation by blocking the transmission of ''pain'' signals from the nerves to the brain. An epidural nerve block may be administered in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar or the caudal (lowermost) region of the spinal column.' "
Why is an epidural nerve block performed?,"'An epidural nerve block is performed as anesthesia during surgeries or for pain relief (analgesia) for short periods or to treat ''chronic pain'' syndromes.''An epidural nerve block may be performed:''Epidural nerve block is performed for anesthesia in the following situations:''Epidural nerve block for pain relief may be given as a single injection that lasts up to 24 hours or as a continuous infusion through a flexible tube (catheter) inserted into the epidural space.\xa0''Epidural nerve block is useful in pain relief in the following situations:''Epidural injections are used for chronic ''pain management'' in the following conditions:''Epidural nerve block is not administered in the presence of certain conditions such as:''Epidural nerve block may be avoided in certain conditions:' As the sole method of anesthesia In combination with spinal anesthesia (anesthetic injected into the subarachnoid space) In combination with general anesthesia Orthopedic surgery on the lower limbs including ankles, knees, hips and pelvic area Vascular surgery (involving blood vessels) Amputation of lower limbs Caesarean delivery of pregnancy Surgery in the lower abdominal area that include:AppendectomyBladder or kidney surgeryIntestinal proceduresHernia repairProstate surgeryPenile procedures Appendectomy Bladder or kidney surgery Intestinal procedures Hernia repair Prostate surgery Penile procedures Cardiac and other surgeries in the thoracic region Lower body surgeries for children Prolonged pain relief with a catheter, after a major surgery Pain relief during labor Diseases in the backbone such as:Degenerative disc diseaseDisc herniationSpondylosis Degenerative disc disease Disc herniation Spondylosis Pinched nerves (radiculopathy) Arthritis in the facet joints of the spine (facet arthropathy) Narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) Complex regional pain syndrome Pelvic pain Depletion of fluid in the blood vessels (hypovolemia) due to salt or water loss Elevated pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure) Infection at the epidural injection site Allergy to local anesthetic Bleeding disorder (coagulopathy) Low platelet count Uncontrolled diabetes Spine abnormalities Previous surgeries on the spine Unstable spine due to trauma Patient positioning problems Sepsis"
What are the benefits of an epidural nerve block?, Improved pain relief post-surgery Less need for opioids Lower incidence of pulmonary complications post-surgery Reduced gastrointestinal complications post-surgery Lower duration of mechanical ventilation Lower risk for deep vein thrombosis Reduced blood loss Lower dosage of medication Longer lasting pain relief Improved quality of life Reduced dependence on opioids
Why is an ERCP done?,"'An individual may need endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to determine the cause of unexplained and recurrent ''abdominal pain'' or yellowing of the skin and eyes (''jaundice''). It also helps in the diagnosis of the following conditions:' Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Cancer of the liver, pancreas, or bile ducts Blockages or stones in the bile ducts Fluid leakage from the bile or pancreatic ducts Blockages or narrowing of the pancreatic ducts Infection in the bile ducts Severe injury or surgical complications in the bile or pancreatic ducts"
What happens during an ERCP procedure?,"'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be done on an outpatient basis or as part of hospital stay. Procedures may vary based on patient’s condition.''Generally, during an ERCP procedure:' An intravenous (IV) line will be put in on the patient’s arm or hand for anesthesia. Most endoscopy units use a combination of a sedative to induce relaxation and medication to prevent discomfort. This is called “conscious sedation” because the patient is awake, but the body is relaxed and pain is numbed. In some more complicated cases, the patient may be sedated more heavily or given anesthesia (put to sleep) for the ERCP procedure. The patient may get oxygen through a tube in their nose during the procedure. They will be positioned on their left side or, more often, on their belly on the X-ray table. A numbing medicine may be sprayed into the back of their throat. This prevents gagging as the endoscope is passed down the throat. The patient will not be able to swallow the saliva that is collected in the mouth during the procedure. It will be suctioned from the mouth as needed. A mouth guard will be put in their mouth to keep them from biting down on the endoscope and to protect their teeth. Once the throat is numbed and patient is relaxed from the sedative, the doctor will guide the endoscope down the patient’s digestive duodenum until it reaches the ducts of the biliary tree (throat into their stomach). A small tube will be passed through the endoscope to the stomach, and a contrast dye will be injected into the ducts. Air may be injected before the contrast dye. This may cause the patient to feel fullness in the abdomen. Various X-ray views will be taken. The patient may be asked to change positions during this time. After X-rays of the biliary tree are taken, the small tube for dye injection will be repositioned to the pancreatic duct. The contrast dye will be injected into the pancreatic duct, and X-rays will be taken. Again, the patient may be asked to change positions while the X-rays are taken. If needed, the doctor may take samples of the fluid or tissue. Sometimes, other procedures such as the removal of gallstones or other blockages are done, while the endoscope is in place. After the X-rays and any other procedures are done, the endoscope will be withdrawn. The length of the examination varies between 30 and 90 minutes (usually about an hour)."
What are the side effects of ERCP?,'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a safe procedure. Side effects can occur with any medical procedure. Below are a few common side effects of ERCP:' Post-ERCP pancreatitis/PEP (inflammation of the pancreas) Infections Perforation of the intestine Severe abdominal pain Continuous cough Fever Chills Chest pain Nausea or vomiting Bleeding or vomiting blood Blood in stools
What is an eucapnic hyperventilation (EVH) test?,'Eucapnic voluntary ''hyperventilation'' (EVH) is a provocative test to diagnose ''exercise''-induced ''airway'' narrowing (''exercise''-induced bronchospasm).' 
Which individuals require eucapnic hyperventilation (EVH) test?,"'Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) is usually done for below individuals:' Occupations in which asthma needs to be excluded, such as divers and army personnel In professional athletes to prove that they have exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) and hence need to take medications for the same during a competition To evaluate young active-duty soldiers in the military  for unexplained shortness of breath"
In which patient conditions eucapnic hyperventilation test shouldn’t be done?,'Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) shouldn’t be done in' Patients with seizures Pregnant women Patients who may develop breathing problems due to spirometry Patients with a recent severe asthma attack or any other respiratory disease Patients who had heart disease condition within three months prior to EVH test Patients with uncontrolled hypertension
What should a patient avoid prior to an eucapnic hyperventilation test?,"'Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) is a painless test, and patients may need to be calm, which can help them during breathing challenges.' Patients may need to avoid smoking at least six hours before the test because it may give false-positive results. Patients may need to avoid heavy meals or any alcoholic drinks. Patients might also need to avoid spicy foods and caffeine-containing drinks (which may cause heartburn, indigestion, or reflux) on the day of the procedure. Patients may be asked to avoid any strenuous exercise or excess exposure to cold/hot air within four hours prior to the test. Certain medications, such as steroids bronchodilators, need to be taken many hours prior to the procedure. Doctors may usually advise the patients regarding medications a day prior to the procedure."
What happens during the eucapnic hyperventilation test?,"'The eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) test was designed to mimic the effect that prolonged exercise has on the airways. The procedure usually takes between 60 and 90 minutes depending on the patient’s breathing and further procedures.\xa0' Spirometry testing will be done before and after the six-minute test. Spirometry is a test that measures how much and how fast a patient can force air out of their lungs. A value called FEV1 obtained during the spirometry test is used as a parameter during the test. The patient uses a nose clip to prevent air escape. During the procedure, the patient breathes a specific gas mixture (21% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and balance nitrogen) at high minute ventilation. The patient actively hyperventilates for a total of six minutes. Spirometry testing is done at the end of the test and 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after the breathing challenge to measure FEV1. The test is considered positive if FEV1 falls to less than 10% of the pre-test value. Depending on FEV1 levels, bronchospasm is classified as mild, moderate, and severe (severe >30% fall in FEV1). The doctor may perform a laryngoscopy procedure after the breathing challenge. During laryngoscopy, the doctor will place a fiber optic probe (small tube) in the patient’s nose. The tube is passed through the nose to the back of their throat. The movement of the vocal cords can be seen with the probe."
What is an extensor tendon?,"'A tendon is a flexible but inelastic cord of strong tissue that lies next to the bone; they attach a muscle to bone. Extensor tendons of the upper limb are located on the back of the hands, wrists, and fingers. They allow individuals to straighten their fingers and thumbs.\xa0 ''These tendons are attached to the muscles in the forearm. As these tendons continue over the fingers (digits), they become flat and thin. In the fingers, these tendons are joined by smaller tendons from the muscles in the hand. It is these small muscle tendons that allow finer movements and coordination of the fingers.' "
What is an extensor tendon injury?,"'Extensor tendons can be injured by a minor cut or jamming of the finger, causing the thin tendons to rip from their attachment to the bone. If untreated, an extensor tendon injury may make it difficult to straighten one or more joints.\xa0''Cuts'' on the back of the hand can injure the extensor tendons. This can make it difficult to straighten the fingers.\xa0''Below are a few common extensor tendon injuries:' Mallet finger: This happens when an extensor tendon is cut or torn from the bone. It is common when a ball or other object strikes the tip of the finger or thumb and forcibly bends it. Boutonnière deformity: It is described as the flexed (bent down) position of the middle joint of the finger. This can happen from a cut or tear of the extensor tendon."
What is an extensor tendon repair?,"'Surgical repair of a lacerated or torn extensor tendon is called extensor tendon repair. An extensor tendon repair surgery can be performed under either regional or general anesthesia.\xa0''The goal of any extensor tendon repair surgery is to re-establish the integrity and durability of the damaged tendon, thereby renewing as much of the previous function as possible. A tendon repair is not usually regarded as an emergency surgery but is generally performed as quickly as possible after the injury—usually within a few days.' If a tendon is damaged because of a wound, the wound is thoroughly cleaned. A surgeon makes an incision (cut) on the hand to make the wound larger and stitches the two ends of the ruptured tendon together. The surgeon closes the wound with stitches and fits a rigid splint (support to protect your hand) made of plaster to stop moving your hand and damaging the repaired tendons. Sometimes, a tendon is too short for the surgeon to sew it back together as it is. In this case, the surgeon will graft an extra piece of the tendon between the ends to make them meet. The surgeon usually takes a healthy tendon tissue for the graft from another part of the person’s body. If a person requires a tendon transfer, the surgeon removes a tendon that is close to the severed tendon and sews it into the place of the broken tendon to restore function. The surgeon usually takes tendons from areas where the body has two tendons but can manage with just one. If nothing else has been damaged, an extensor tendon repair surgery can take approximately 30 minutes to complete. If there is a tendon graft involved, this procedure may take approximately 120 minutes."
What is the recovery period after an extensor tendon repair?,"'There are three stages of extensor tendon healing after a surgery:''In most cases, a person can go home shortly after the tendon repair surgery. The medical team will recommend physical therapy or occupational therapy to help bring back the range of motion slowly and safely. A person should not start the exercises until a doctor says it is safe to do so.''It is essential to keep the area elevated to prevent ''pain'' and swelling for the first few days.' Swelling/Inflammation: For the first three to five days, the area may feel swollen while the body works to heal itself. Early repair: During the next three to six weeks, the range of motion will start to return, but the area may feel slightly stiff. Later repair: After 10-12 weeks, the swelling will reduce, and the tendon will be easier to move."
What is an Ileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgery?,"'An ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (J-pouch)'' is a surgical procedure to restore the stomach and bowel (gastrointestinal) continuity after the surgical removal of the large bowel (the colon and rectum).\xa0 ''Many conditions, including inflammatory diseases, ''cancer'' or infection, may necessitate the complete surgical removal of the colon and rectum.' The procedure involves the creation of a pouch of the small bowel to recreate the removed rectum (the part of the large bowel above the anus).  Two or more loops of bowel are surgically stitched (sutured) or stapled together to form a reservoir for stool.  This reservoir is then attached to the anus to eliminate waste normally after the removal of the entire large bowel.  The Ileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) is often protected by temporarily diverting the path of stool through a temporary opening on the abdomen (ileostomy).  After recovery, this ileostomy is reversed during a separate procedure."
Who needs an Ileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgery?,"'The J-pouch surgery is performed after the large bowel (the colon and rectum) has been completely removed. It is performed under the following conditions:' Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or, rarely, Crohn’s disease) Certain cancers of the large bowel Disorders of excessive colonic polyps (abnormal tissue outgrowths in the large bowel) Toxic megacolon (a potentially life-threatening complication of inflammatory bowel disease or infectious colitis characterized by abnormal dilatation of the colon) The surgery should, however, be avoided when the small bowel is involved in the disease process, as seen in many cases of Crohn’s disease."
What happens in an Ileoanal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgery?,"'The following will help you understand what to expect during an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (J-pouch) surgery.''Your doctor may:' Order some blood tests and imaging studies (such as ultrasound, computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) Ask you about any chronic health conditions Ask you about any medications you are on Ask about any allergies you may have Explain the surgical procedure in detail, including possible complications, and address your doubts and concerns related to the surgery Obtain your written consent Ask your permission to perform a bowel preparation to clear the colon of waste, thereby reducing the bacterial load and chances of complications. This is usually done the day before the surgery with 4 L of a polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution or 300 mL of a magnesium citrate solution.  Ask you to maintain a clear liquid diet the day before the surgery and to not eat or drink anything for 8-12 hours before the surgery You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back in the lithotomy position (legs in stirrups or “frog-leg"" position). The anesthesiologist will administer general endotracheal anesthesia (general anesthesia with the airway protected using a breathing tube). This surgery is usually performed in two stages. The first surgery removes the colon and rectum.  The second part involves the ileum (small bowel) being made into a J-shaped pouch and connected to the top of your anal canal. A temporary ileostomy is performed to give your newly formed pouch a chance to heal. A loop of your small bowel will be pulled through an opening in your abdomen, called a stoma, to allow waste to exit your body into a stoma bag. A second surgery may be performed 8-12 weeks later. The second surgery reverses the ileostomy and reconnects your small bowel to the pouch. The internal pouch collects waste and allows stool to pass through your anus in a bowel movement. You may have an increased number of bowel movements, sometimes up to 12 times per day. This generally decreases over time. You should discuss sexual functions with your surgeon and ask when it is safe to resume sexual activity. You may ask your nurse or doctor what supplies you may need at home, especially if you will have a temporary ileostomy. Your nurse or doctor will teach you how to manage the ileostomy and how to keep it clean."
What is an iliac crest?,"'An iliac crest is the thick curved upper border of the most prominent bone of the pelvis, the pelvic bone. Locate it by placing the hands over the lower waist and following the curve of the bone downward.' "
What is an iliac crest tissue transfer and flap surgery?,"'Iliac crest\xa0is a commonly used bone and soft tissue that is used as a tissue transfer for flap surgery. Flap surgery is a surgical operation by which a tissue (flap) is lifted with an intact blood supply from a donor site and moved to a site of a defect. Tissue transfer flap surgery is a method of\xa0repairing bone and tissue defects, especially in the head and neck after ''trauma'' or ''cancer'' surgery. Iliac crest tissue transfer is usually performed by ''plastic'' and reconstructive surgeons.' "
What are the types of flap surgery?," Cutaneous flaps: Contain the full thickness of skin and underlying superficial tissue. Ideal for small defects. Fascio-cutaneous flaps: Contain full thickness of skin with underlying superficial and deep tissue. It has more blood supply and the ability to fill a larger defect. Musculocutaneous or myocutaneous flaps: This technique adds muscle layer to the fascio-cutaneous flap. It provides bulk to fill even deeper defects and restore function. Muscle flaps: This technique only uses the muscle to fill defects and restore function.  Skin can be used to cover it, if needed. Osteo-cutaneous flaps: Bone-containing flaps including skin and underlying tissues with rich blood supply."
What are the advantages of osteo-cutaneous flaps?,"'The choice of flap technique depends on the surgeon and the deformity. Osteo-cutaneous flaps have some advantages:' The ability to transfer bone, muscle and skin together are ideal for reconstruction of complex and large deformities. Osteo-cutaneous flaps contain a rich blood supply. This technique improves wound healing more than some other flap techniques."
Why is an iliac free tissue transfer done?,"'An iliac crest tissue transfer is usually performed for:' Reconstruction of defects to restore anatomy, structure, function, and appearance, particularly of the head and neck after:TraumaCancer surgeryBone infectionBone death Trauma Cancer surgery Bone infection Bone death"
Who should not get an iliac crest tissue transfer surgery?,"'Some people have health conditions that make this surgery less optimal, including:' Deformities in the lower body Difficulty in mobility Chronic systemic health conditions Chronic cough Prolonged use of certain medications, such as steroids"
How is iliac crest tissue transfer surgery performed?," The surgeon performs a history and physical examination. The surgeon gives the patient specific instructions before surgery, including quitting smoking and signing consent forms. The patient undergoes blood and radiological tests. It is performed with general anesthesia. A surgical drain may be placed. Painkillers and antibiotics may be administered. The patient stays on bed rest for three to five days. The patient is discharged after five to seven days. The patient may be kept in the ICU (intensive care unit) for 48 hours. The surgical drain may be removed after 24 to 48 hours. Patients require continuous monitoring while in the hospital. Nutrition may be done through a feeding tube and/or intravenously for the first few days. Swelling and bruising are present. Patients may be mobile after one week. Depending on the suture material used, the surgeon will schedule the date of suture removal. Complete healing may take six weeks to six months, depending on the surgery. Patients may have to avoid exercise and sports for two to six months. Physical rehabilitation may be required. Regular follow-up with the surgeon is required to monitor progress."
What are the complications of iliac crest tissue transfer surgery?, Flap failure or flap tissue death Donor site deformity Hernia: Weakness of the abdominal wall following surgery causing organs to push through it. Sometimes an additional surgery to prevent hernia may be required during or after flap surgery Hemorrhage (bleeding) Hematoma (collection of blood) Seroma (collection of fluid) Infection Scarring Reaction to anesthesia
Incision in the abdomen,"'An incision in the abdomen is an opening or a cut made by the surgeon. It is done to permit access to abdominal organs for surgery.

It is useful for esophagectomy, gastrectomy, or liver transplantations. Mercedes Benz incision: It is the Chevron incision with a vertical incision extending up through the chest."
What is an inferior pedicle technique?,"'The inferior pedicle technique is a surgical technique performed for ''breast reduction'' (reduction mammoplasty). “Pedicle method” means the surgeon leaves an attached tissue graft (pedicle) with nerves and blood vessels that supply the breast.''A pedicle can be superior, lateral, medial, inferior, or central. With the\xa0inferior pedicle technique,\xa0the blood supply to the ''nipple'' and ''areola'' remains generous. As a result, the inferior pedicle has proven sufficient to sustain the nipple-areola complex (NAC) with good circulation, good sensation, and ''breastfeeding'' ability.''Patients who undergo reduction mammoplasty tend to be the most satisfied patients treated by ''plastic'' surgeons. It can be performed at any age following ''puberty''. Patients tend to experience immediate relief of their neck and shoulder pains, including older patients.''In general, the ''scars'' that result from this procedure heal very well. Occasionally, some redundancy may be present which may require ''liposuction''.' "
Why is an inferior pedicle breast reduction done?,"'This procedure may prove useful for:' Large breasts, disproportionate to the body frame Large, heavy breasts causing significant neck, back and shoulder pain Grooves in the shoulders from the weight of bra straps Difficulty in wearing and fitting in clothes Breasts that interfere with sports and exercise Skin irritation beneath the breasts Asymmetrical breasts Self-consciousness or aesthetic concerns"
Who should not get an inferior pedicle breast reduction?,"'Some people are medically unable to undergo the surgery when other systemic diseases are present.''Smokers'' should ''quit smoking'' prior to the procedure as it increases risk of complications.''Breast reduction and age' Patients may seek reduction mammoplasty starting at puberty. If reduction mammoplasty is performed at an early age, such as 14 years, patients may require an additional procedure. If breasts are significantly large, surgery can be performed in the teenage years. The patient should undergo a preoperative mammogram if she is older than 35 years."
How is an inferior pedicle breast reduction procedure performed?," The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. Breast reduction reduces the skin envelope and volume of breast tissue while the nipple is repositioned. The breasts are not reduced to a standard size but to one that is compatible with the patient's body. This may range from a B to a D cup or even bigger in larger women. Breast tissue is carefully preserved, marked, and protected so that each specimen from each breast can be evaluated by a pathologist to detect malignancy in the breasts. The wounds are closed with buried sutures and then either a subcuticular suture or Dermabond (skin glue) on the skin, which heals with minimal scarring in most people.. Some surgeons opt for drain placement to reduce risk of blood clots (hematomas) or fluid accumulation (seroma). Painkillers and antibiotics may be administered. The patient may be advised to wear a surgical bra to provide support and help healing. The patient should rest upright with their back elevated. The patient can be discharged 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Swelling and bruising resolve in one or two weeks. Assistance with routine activities like bathing, dressing may be required in the first week. The surgeon may advise certain exercises and massage techniques for the first two to three weeks. Light activities can be resumed after two weeks. Avoid rigorous exercises, sports, lifting heavy objects for the first eight to 12 weeks. After four to six weeks, patients can switch from surgical bras to bras of their choice. Patients can resume work depending on nature and requirement of job, their own comfort level and the surgeon’s approval. The scars generally heal well and are barely visible with time. Regular follow-up with the surgeon is required to monitor healing."
What are the complications of an inferior pedicle breast reduction?," The most devastating potential complication is total loss of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC)This is extremely rareIn patients with extremely large breasts, consider the possibility of a free nipple graft to avoid loss of NAC  This is extremely rare In patients with extremely large breasts, consider the possibility of a free nipple graft to avoid loss of NAC  Blood Clot (hematoma) formation (common) Bleeding Infection Possible asymmetry Loss of sensation around incision Problems with breastfeeding Scarring (keloid formation) Lack of fullness and poor projection Poor reaction to anesthesia"
What is an infraclavicular nerve block?,"'An infraclavicular nerve block is a procedure to numb the brachial plexus nerves, which transmit sensation of the arms. An anesthetic injection is administered below the collarbone (clavicle), adjacent to the brachial plexus, to block the transmission of ''pain'' signals to the brain.''The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that emerge from the neck (cervical) region of the spine and transmit sensory and motor functions of the shoulders, upper arms and hands. Three main techniques are used to block the brachial plexus:' Infraclavicular nerve block: administered below the clavicle to numb the hand, forearm, elbow, and most of the upper arm. Supraclavicular nerve block: administered above the clavicle to numb the arm below the shoulder. Interscalene nerve block: administered in the neck to numb the shoulder and upper arm."
How do you block the intercostobrachial nerve?,"'The intercostobrachial nerve transmits sensation from the inner side of the upper arm. The anesthetic injection is administered in the arm, just below the armpit, to block the intercostobrachial nerve.''The infraclavicular nerve block anesthetizes the outer side of the upper arm. The brachial plexus ''nerve blocks'' may not adequately anesthetize the intercostobrachial nerve, so this nerve block is usually performed as a supplementary measure.' "
Why is an infraclavicular nerve block performed?,"'An infraclavicular block may be performed to provide anesthesia or ''pain'' relief (analgesia). An infraclavicular nerve block may also be administered in combination with general anesthesia.''An infraclavicular block is performed:''The infraclavicular approach is useful for placing a thin flexible tube (catheter) when continuous analgesia is required for longer periods, because the infraclavicular area has very little movement and poses minimal risk of catheter displacement.''An infraclavicular block is avoided in the following conditions:' Prior to surgical procedures in theElbowForearmHand Elbow Forearm Hand For post-surgical pain relief in the arm For pain from a tourniquet applied on the arm For making a surgical connection between an artery and a vein (arteriovenous fistula) for hemodialysis Infection in the injection site Allergy to local anesthetics Presence of splint, cast or dressing in the area Bleeding disorder Systemic infection"
How is an infraclavicular nerve block performed?,"'An infraclavicular nerve block may be performed as an outpatient procedure or in the hospital, depending on the surgical procedure involved.''The doctor may use one or a combination of the following anesthetic agents:''The doctor' Mepivacaine for blocks lasting up to three hours Mepivacaine and epinephrine for blocks lasting four hours Mepivacaine, tetracaine and epinephrine for blocks of up to six hours Bupivacaine or ropivacaine for blocks lasting 12 hours The patient is in a semi-sitting position. Mild sedation is administered. The patient’s blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels are monitored. The injection site is sterilized. May administer the injectionat the midpoint below the clavicle, orcloser to the arm end of the clavicle. at the midpoint below the clavicle, or closer to the arm end of the clavicle. Uses ultrasound guidance for accurate positioning of the needle. May confirm the correct location of the nerve by stimulating the nerve and producing a finger twitch. Inserts the needle deep through the pectoral muscles. Aspirates the needle to be certain the needle is not in a blood vessel. Slowly injects the anesthetic around the axillary artery and the brachial plexus nerve cords. Inserts a catheter through the needle insertion site, if analgesia is required for extended periods. Withdraws the needle and waits for 10 minutes for the nerve block to take effect. Recovery depends on the surgical procedure performed."
What are the risks and complications of an infraclavicular nerve block?,"'Potential complications of an infraclavicular nerve block include:' Muscle pain because the needle goes through the pectoral muscles Infection at the injection site Hematoma Bleeding Injury toNervesBlood vesselsLymphatic vessels Nerves Blood vessels Lymphatic vessels Puncture of the lung (pneumothorax), which is rare Local anesthetic systemic toxicity Allergic reaction to local anesthetics"
What is an intra-aortic balloon pump?,"'Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation or intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a type of therapeutic device which helps the ''heart'' to pump more blood.\xa0''The IABP consists of a thin, flexible tube called a\xa0catheter.\xa0Attached to the tip of the catheter, is a long balloon. This is called an intra-aortic balloon or IAB. The other end of the catheter is attached to a machine (computer console).\xa0This machine has a mechanism for inflating and deflating the balloon at the proper time when the heartbeats.\xa0''The device deflates when the heart pumps, so blood can flow to the rest of your body. It inflates when the heart relaxes to keep more blood in the heart.\xa0''IABP allows blood to flow more easily into the coronary arteries (arteries in the outer walls of the heart). IABP also helps your heart pump more blood with each contraction.''IABP is a short-term treatment. It is usually needed till the heart condition improves or till a permanent treatment is performed.\xa0' "
What is an intra-aortic balloon pump used for?,'IABP is performed when the heart isn’t getting enough blood or isn’t pumping out to the rest of the body. It can be performed after the following heart problems:' Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat or rhythm) Myocarditis (infection of the heart muscle) Heart attack  An IABP may be used to help recover from surgery to reopen or bypass a blocked artery near the heart. 
How is an intra-aortic balloon pump insertion performed?," The doctor performs a complete physical assessment.  Basic blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray and echocardiogram are done before the procedure.  The procedure may be performed under anesthesia.  An IABP is attached to a tube called a catheter.  The balloon is inserted into your aorta with the help of an X-ray camera. The aorta is the very large artery leaving the heart.  This procedure is done through a small cut on the inside of the upper leg.  The balloon pump catheter is inserted into an artery in the leg and then guided into the aorta.  The device is connected to a machine that regulates the balloon to increase and decrease in size.  It uses helium to inflate the balloon as helium doesn’t cause problems in the body if it leaks.  Once the IABP is in place, the patient may feel chest pain and chest discomfort which usually resolves in a few minutes. The patient is required to have rest in bed with the legs kept straight to ensure the device doesn’t move. "
What are the complications of Intra-aortic Balloon pump? ,"'Though rare, as with any procedure, there’s a risk of complications, such as:' Bleeding at the site the device was inserted Decreased blood flow in the arms or legs Injury to an artery Rupture of the balloon Incorrect position of the balloon Infection Stroke"
What is an introvert?,"'Carl Jung, a psychologist, began using the terms introvert and extrovert in the 1920s and categorized people into these two personality types based on how they get or spend their energy or how they dealt with their surroundings. Whether a person is an introvert or an extrovert depends on how they process and react to the world around them.''A typical introvert is a quiet calm daydreamer who talks less and enjoys being by themselves. Introverts feel more comfortable being by themselves, focusing on their thoughts, work, and ideas rather than what is happening around them. At most, they enjoy spending time with just one or two people they feel comfortable with, but they usually don’t enjoy large groups or crowds. They are often labeled as shy, quiet, or wanting to be alone. However, this is not always the case with all introverts. There is a lot to this personality type. On the contrary, extroverts are usually described as the life of the party. They are known to be talkative, outgoing, vibrant, enjoying attention, and thriving off interaction with others.''The exact cause of introvert or extrovert behavior is unknown. The brains of two personality types work a little differently from each other. Research has shown that introverts have a higher blood flow to the frontal lobe (the anterior/front part of the brain) than extroverts. ''Dopamine'' levels (a brain chemical) in introverts on exposure to crowds are low. Thus, introverts are not very happy in noisy surroundings. The frontal lobe of the brain helps reasoning, planning, problem-solving, speech, and performing multistep activities and is more active when they are alone or in quieter places. Introverts and extroverts have the same levels of dopamine, but they react differently to it. Having an introverted to extroverted personality may also be influenced by genetics and hormones.''According to Jung, the two personality types differ in how they derive or spend their energy. Introverts turn to themselves and their own minds to recharge, whereas extroverts seek out other people to fuel their energy. Basically, extroverts are energized by crowds and interacting with others. Introverts need their alone time to recharge and are more reserved. There are no good or bad personality types; they are just different and process things differently. Being an introvert or extrovert is not black and white. Most people fall somewhere on the spectrum between the two polar ends. Many people have characteristics of both personality types. One way to find one’s personality is to take a test, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or SAPA project.' "
What is an open appendectomy?,"'An ''appendix'' is a small, finger-like structure at the junction of the small and ''large intestine''. The function of the appendix is largely unknown and its removal seems to not cause any observable problems. However, its infection can be painful.''An ''appendectomy'' is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the appendix. The ''appendectomy'' can be performed in two ways:' Open appendectomy: The surgeon makes a cut of about 2 to 3 inches over your abdomen (laparotomy) to remove your appendix.  Laparoscopic appendectomy: The appendix is visualized through a long, tube-like camera (laparoscope) after making multiple small cuts in the abdomen. Then the appendix is removed with the help of surgical tools."
Why is appendectomy done?,"'Your doctor will advise you to go for an appendectomy if your appendix gets infected, making it swollen (inflamed) and causing ''pain''. This condition is known as ''appendicitis''. ''Appendicitis'' signs and symptoms include:''Initially, your doctor will treat your ''appendicitis'' with antibiotics. But if you get frequent attacks of appendicitis (chronic appendicitis) or the doctor suspects that the infection has spread deeply and extensively, he/she will plan an appendectomy.\xa0''If the infected appendix is not removed at the right time, it might turn into a pus-filled structure (''abscess''), or it might burst and infect the entire abdomen (''peritonitis''), which is a life-threatening condition.' Aching pain around the belly button/navel that shifts to the lower right abdomen Sharp pain that increases by movements such as walking or coughing Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite Fever Constipation Inability to pass gas Abdominal swelling Diarrhea"
What is done before the appendectomy?,"'Most of the time, an appendectomy is done on an emergency basis.''To check the intensity of the infection, your surgeon might ask you to undergo a few blood tests and investigations like ''ultrasonography'' (USG)/''CT scan''.''When you get admitted, you will be instructed not to eat or drink (nothing by mouth) for at least eight to 10 hours or until your surgeon advises you to do so.''You will receive injections for your ''nausea''/''vomiting'', as well as antibiotics and saline solutions given intravenously.\xa0' "
How is appendectomy done?," You will be given general anesthesia, which numbs your entire body and makes you sleep throughout the procedure to make it painless. Based on the severity of the infection, your surgeon will decide to go either for an open appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy. By either method, once the appendix is identified, it is tied off and removed.  The surgical wound is then cleaned with an antiseptic solution, closed with surgical threads (sutures), and bandaged."
What happens after an appendectomy?," You will be shifted to the surgical ward and observed for several hours after appendectomy.  If you had a laparoscopic appendectomy, you may be sent home on the same day of the surgery or on the next day in case of an open appendectomy.  You will be given painkillers and antibiotics intravenously until you get discharged from the hospital and advised to continue them orally for the next three to seven days. You will be told to follow-up with your doctor, generally, after one week. Until then, you need to keep an eye on your wound to check if it is healing properly.  You can resume your normal activities like walking, within a day or as advised by your doctor."
Is an appendectomy a major surgery?,"'An appendectomy is a major abdominal surgery that can lead to the following complications:''Other complications that can happen in the long-term include:''Incisional ''hernia'': Bulging of the surgical ''scar'' that happens due to the surgical cut not healing after appendectomy.''Stump appendicitis: Frequent infections due to a small piece of the appendix that was accidentally left in the abdomen during the operation.''Small-bowel obstruction: A partial or complete blockage in the small intestine due to the surgical scar from the appendectomy. The rate of bowel obstruction after laparoscopic appendectomy is lower than after open surgery. It occurs in approximately 0.89% of patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and in 3.21% after open appendectomy.''To allow the complete healing of the internal and external surgical wounds, you need to avoid strenuous physical activities like vigorous exercises or lifting heavy weights for about four to six weeks after the appendectomy.' Internal bleeding Infection of the surgical wound An abdominal abscess (pus in the abdomen) Enteric injury (injury to the intestine) Fistula (formation of a cavity that discharges fluid)"
What are splints?,"'Splints are usually applied to reduce movement and provide support and comfort by stabilizing an injury. They are primarily used during nonemergency injuries to the bones or ligaments until they can be evaluated by a consultant such as an orthopedic surgeon. They are also used to temporarily immobilize an extremity before surgery (e.g., for an open ''fracture'') or enable healing.''Unlike casts, splints are preferred in an emergency setting when the injuries are acute and swelling may continuously increase. All patients with splinted injuries should be referred for evaluation by a consultant within two to seven days.' "
How does an ulnar gutter splint work?,"'An ulnar gutter splint is a flexible splint that is used to support, stabilize, and immobilize injuries, dislocations and ''fractures'' of the hands, fingers, or wrists to allow the bones and tissues to heal properly.' "
What is an ulnar gutter splint used for?,'An ulnar gutter splint can be used for various injuries in the hand including the following:' Soft-tissue hand injuries to the little and ring fingers Fractures anywhere in the pinky and ring fingers Positioning and healing of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis
When is an ulnar gutter splint not done?,"'There are no absolute contraindications for ulnar gutter splinting. Relative contraindications involve the following injuries that require an immediate evaluation or intervention by a consultant (an orthopedic surgeon, a hand surgeon, or a ''plastic surgeon''):' Complicated fractures Open fractures Injuries with associated neurovascular compromise"
How do you wrap an ulnar gutter splint?," Ulnar gutter splinting is usually tolerated without the use of anesthesia. In case of significant pain during joint manipulation or reduction of fracture, anesthesia and painkillers would be required. There are various types of ulnar gutter splints that are made of various materials and have different techniques of application. Ulnar gutter splints are generally applied by a healthcare professional. The injured limb is completely exposed.  A stockinette covering the pinky finger extends beyond the wrist till just before the elbow. Soft padding is applied over the stockinette. The padding should extend 2-3 cm beyond the overlying plaster on both ends.  Plaster of Paris (POP) is applied over the padding. A bandage wrap is applied over the wet plaster.  The thumb and wrist remain immobile until the splint is dry. The patient may feel some warmth released from the plaster as it dries. In case of a simple sprain, the doctor may advise a simple brace with Velcro clips or a bandage wrap to be worn for two to six weeks to immobilize the injured area. The patient is advised to rest, elevate and ice the injured limb. If the patient experiences weakness, numbness, color change (pale or bluish), increasing pressure or pain or spreading redness, it is advised to remove the splint and visit the emergency department right away.  The splint must be kept clean and dry. Patients can be tempted to use sticks, pens, or hangers to scratch an itch inside the splint. Sticking objects into the splint to scratch yourself can wrinkle the padding and lead to pressure injuries or cause cuts in the skin and potentially an infection. The splint is usually rechecked in 48 hours by the doctor."
What are the complications of ulnar gutter splints?,"'Complications to ulnar gutter splints include the following:''Hence, aftercare often requires physical therapy.' Thermal burns due to the warmth as the plaster dries Pressure sores Contact dermatitis Neurovascular compromise (damage to the nerves and blood vessels) Decreased range of motion from immobilization."
What is an umbilical hernia repair surgery?,"'A ''hernia'' is a protrusion of an internal body part, such as the intestine, through a weak spot in the muscle or the surrounding tissue wall. An ''umbilical hernia'' repair is a corrective surgery for a hernia in the navel (umbilicus) region.''An umbilical hernia repair surgery is a procedure to return the herniated tissue back in place and strengthen the muscle wall with ''stitches'' and a mesh so the hernia doesn’t reoccur.' "
What is an umbilical hernia?,"'An umbilical hernia is an abdominal wall hernia, which occurs when a part of the abdominal membrane, fatty tissue or bowel protrudes through a weak spot in the muscle wall in or near the navel. Umbilical hernia may be' True or direct umbilical hernia, which is a symmetric protrusion through the umbilical ring, as seen in infants. Indirect or paraumbilical hernia, which protrudes just above or below the umbilicus, common in adults."
What causes an umbilical hernia?,"'Umbilical hernias are common in infants, especially in premature ''babies''. The umbilicus is a small opening in the abdominal muscle wall where the fetus is attached to the mother during ''pregnancy''. This opening normally closes soon after birth.''Umbilical hernia occurs in children when the umbilicus doesn’t close fully and a part of tissue or bowel bulges through. It is often visible as a lump in infants when they laugh, cry or strain, and go back in when the belly is relaxed.''Adult umbilical hernia may be caused by' Obesity Ascites (fluid collection in the stomach Large abdominal tumors Multiple pregnancies Previous abdominal surgery Pressure on the belly fromLifting heavy weightsChronic coughChronic vomitingStraining to urinate due to enlarged prostate in menStraining during bowel movements due to chronic constipationLong-term peritoneal dialysis due to kidney failure Lifting heavy weights Chronic cough Chronic vomiting Straining to urinate due to enlarged prostate in men Straining during bowel movements due to chronic constipation Long-term peritoneal dialysis due to kidney failure"
Should an umbilical hernia be repaired?,"'Generally, infantile umbilical hernia resolves on its own within one or two years and does not require surgery. Children may require a hernia repair surgery if:\xa0''In adults, small hernias without symptoms may be watched. Adult umbilical hernias do not resolve on their own and tend to grow larger.

What is a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty?,"'A unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA)'' is a surgical procedure used to relieve disease in one of the knee compartments. In UKA, only the damaged parts of the knee are replaced. The UKA surgery may reduce postoperative ''pain'' and have a shorter recovery period than a ''total knee replacement'' procedure, especially in the elderly population.''Knee arthroplasty ''is also called a ''knee replacement'' surgery. The surgery involves removing the damaged parts of the ''knee joint'' and replacing them with parts constructed with metal, ceramic, and very hard ''plastic''.\xa0''This artificial joint is also called a prosthesis or an implant. It reduces ''pain'' and improves the function of the knee joint. Knee arthroplasty is indicated when the knee joint is damaged. ''Arthritis'' is the most common cause of knee joint damage and, hence, one of the most common indications for knee arthroplasty.''The ends of the bones, where the bones in the knee joint move against each other the most, are most likely to suffer damage. These areas are known as compartments, and they are as follows:''There are various surgical approaches to the surgery, including minimally invasive techniques. The choice of technique depends on the surgeon’s decision.' The medial or inside compartment The lateral or outside compartment The patellofemoral or behind-the-kneecap compartment"
When is a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty done?,"'To undergo a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), the damage to the joint should be confined to only one compartment. UKA may be indicated in the following conditions if it is limited to a single compartment:' Osteoarthritis  Osteonecrosis (tissue death) Malalignment  Mild deformities "
When is a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty not done?,'Contraindications for a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) include the following:' Inflammation of the joint Previous surgery with overcorrection Septic arthritis (joint infection) and sepsis (systemic infection) Ligament tears leading to joint instabilities Tibial (shin bone) or femoral (thigh bone) shaft deformity Major joint deformities Damage in more than one compartment
How is a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty performed?,"'Prior to the surgery, the surgeon performs a complete physical assessment, X-ray and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') of the joint.\xa0''The surgery is performed using general anesthesia. The concept behind a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is the replacement of only the damaged part of the knee and the preservation of as much normal tissue and bone as possible to allow the restoration of normal kinematics.''A conventional incision is usually around 12 inches in length, whereas the incision in UKA is around 7 cm. The damaged part of the joint is replaced with a prosthetic. The surgery can also be performed arthroscopically (minimally invasive). A small incision of around 3-4 inches in length is made over the area of the knee joint through which an arthroscope (a camera with a light source) and surgical instruments are inserted. The surgical ''wound'' is closed with ''sutures'' (''stitches'') and dressed.' "
How long does it take to recover from a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty?,"'After the surgery, painkillers and antibiotics are administered. Patients are usually discharged between one and three days after the surgery. Patients are encouraged to walk with support the same or next day to prevent the formation of ''blood clots''.\xa0''Physical therapy may begin at the hospital, and the patient would be advised to continue the exercises at home. Pain, swelling, and ''bruising'' due to the surgery are reduced in two weeks. Most patients can resume their routine activities in less than 6-12 weeks.\xa0''Recovery and joint strength continue to improve. Complete recovery after the surgery may take around six months, after which patients can resume high impact exercises and sports.\xa0' "
What are the complications of a unicompartmental knee arthroplasty done?,'Some complications encountered are as follows:' Osteolysis (inflammation destroying the bone and causing the prosthesis to loosen) Infection  Bleeding  Formation of blood clots  Bone necrosis (bone death) Different leg lengths leading to altered gait/limp Migration or failure of the prosthesis  Dislocation or fracture of the joint Fractures around the joint Residual disease in the other compartments  Reaction to anesthesia 
What is ankle arthrocentesis?,"'Arthrocentesis'' (''joint aspiration'') is a diagnostic procedure where the body’s synovial joint lubrication fluid is drained using a sterile needle and syringe. Ankle arthrocentesis is an important procedure used for diagnosing ''arthritis'' and differential diagnosis of inflammatory and noninflammatory arthritis. Arthrocentesis can also be performed therapeutically for ''pain'' relief, drainage of\xa0fluid or injection of medications.''Any joint in the body can be aspirated. Joint aspiration is a relatively quick and inexpensive procedure to perform. It can be done in a clinic or hospital. Any trained physician, physician’s assistant or nurse can perform the procedure.' "
When is ankle arthrocentesis done?,"'Ankle arthrocentesis is indicated for any patient with inflamed ankle joints or who does not have an established diagnosis. Inflamed joints are recognized by being red, warm, tender, swollen, and painful during movement. Ankle arthrocentesis is indicated for diagnosis of the following conditions:\xa0''Joint aspiration may be performed as a treatment in certain conditions, such as:''Aspiration can be performed while injecting intra-articular medications such as ''corticosteroids'' or ''hyaluronic acid'' to improve efficacy.\xa0' Monoarticular arthritis (inflammation of the joint) Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) Joint effusion (swelling due to fluid accumulation in the body) Intra-articular fracture (fractures which involve the joint space)  Crystal arthropathy (accumulation of calcium crystals in the joint and surrounding areas) Septic joint or hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joints): Repeated aspirations are performed to relieve discomfort and prevent joint damage. Hemarthrosis (blood in the joints): Aspiration is performed to prevent adhesions.  Steroid injections help reduce joint inflammation, reduce pain, preserve joint structure and function.  Hyaluronic acid lubricates the joint, decreases impact, delays joint aging, reduces pain and stiffness. "
When should ankle arthrocentesis be avoided?,'Ankle arthrocentesis should be performed with caution in patients with a ''bleeding disorder'' or those on ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs'' (blood thinners). Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may be advised to pause the medications from a few days before to a few after the procedure.' 
How is ankle arthrocentesis performed?," Ankle arthrocentesis is a relatively quick procedure and only in some cases may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain.  A sterile needle of appropriate size and length is introduced into the joint and the synovial fluid is collected in syringes.  The fluid collected is then analyzed microscopically.  Apart from microscopic analysis, the appearance of the aspirated synovial fluid can indicate certain features.  Normal fluid is clear or light yellow and viscous.  Inflammatory fluid appears darker yellow to cloudy and loses its viscosity.  Purulent fluid (pus in the fluid) is brownish to whitish and opaque. Occasionally, ankle arthrocentesis can be performed using radiological imaging, as it may be required to confirm the presence of fluid before aspirating.  Radiological imaging can help aspirate other deep and technically difficult joints like the hip joint or spine.  After the procedure, the patient is asked to rest for a few minutes, after that they can resume normal activities.  Some patients may experience pain and bruise which resolves in a few days.  Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and bruising."
What are the complications of ankle arthrocentesis?,"'Ankle arthrocentesis is a relatively safe procedure, and complications are rare. The common complications patients usually face are localized bleeding, pain and swelling and sometimes reaction to local anesthesia. In rare cases, infection of the joint may occur, which is called ''septic arthritis''.\xa0''If medications like steroids are simultaneously injected during the procedure, it may rarely cause localized shrinkage or hypopigmentation of the skin. Long-term use of steroid injections may cause systemic side effects like ''weight gain'', puffy face, ''stretch marks'' and ''easy bruising''.' "
What is Anterior Cervical Discectomy?,"'There are three main types of anterior cervical discectomy surgeries. Anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) is a surgical procedure that involves removing a part or all of a damaged spinal disc through an incision in the neck.''Indications for each different type of surgery should be discussed with a spinal surgeon depending on the type, location, and severity of the disc injury.' ACD does not involve placement of a bone graft.  Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is similar to ACD, but it does involve placement of a bone graft.  The anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with instrumentation (ACDFI) technique is similar to ACDF but additionally involves the placement of a plate to help stabilize the cervical spine."
What is Anterior Cervical Discectomy Used For?,"'Anterior cervical discectomy (ACD), anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with instrumentation (ACDFI) are all used to treat:' chronic cervical spine osteoarthritis,  cervical spine trauma, radiculopathy,  cervical disc herniations, myelopathy,  osteomyelitis,  spondylosis,  vertebral body tumors, and  post-laminectomy kyphosis."
How Do Doctors Perform Anterior Cervical Discectomy?,"'Anterior cervical discectomy is performed under general anesthesia. For all three types of anterior cervical discectomy procedures:\xa0''X-rays'' may be performed at follow-up intervals. If there are any complications from the surgery, a ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' may be needed.\xa0' Patients are placed laying down on their back with their head extended Hands may be tied down to allow for easier access to the neck The area of the neck and chest are prepped with antiseptics  An incision is made in the front of the neck, and the muscles and subcutaneous layers are carefully separated Deeper structures such as blood vessels, nerves, the airway, and esophagus are also carefully moved  Once the damaged disc is located, it is removed  If an ACDF or ACDFI procedure is being performed, a bone graft and/or hardware is placed  Deep structures are moved back into normal position The incision is sutured closed After surgery, a cervical collar may be worn for up to 6 weeks"
What are Risks and Complications of Anterior Cervical Discectomy?,"'Prior to surgery, the surgeon will assess the risks for complications. Risk factors that can lead to increased complications include:''Complications of anterior cervical discectomy include:' Advanced age Smoking  Low bone density (osteoporosis) Obesity Sleep apnea Carotid artery disease Infection of surgical wound Infection of bone graft or around hardware Spinal cord injury Nerve root injury resulting in weakness Tears in the tissue around the spinal cord (dural tears) Cerebrospinal fluid leaks Hardware complicationsScrew loosening or breakagePlate breakagePlate movement Screw loosening or breakage Plate breakage Plate movement Graft failure Neck-related complications due to frontal approachDamage to esophagusProblems swallowingNeck bleeding Airway complications and obstruction Damage to esophagus Problems swallowing Neck bleeding  Airway complications and obstruction"
What is the olecranon bursa?,"'The olecranon is the pointed bone at the tip of the elbow. A bursa is a fluid-filled sac at the tip of the elbow. The bursa helps the skin glide over the bone.\xa0''Normally, this sac has little fluid and lays flat; however, the bursa can become inflamed and fill with extra fluid, resulting in painful swelling at the tip of the elbow.' "
What is olecranon bursitis?,"'The inflammation of a bursa, known as olecranon ''bursitis'', can be either infective (septic) or noninfective (aseptic). ''Aseptic bursitis'' is the inflammation of the bursa secondary to accidents, crystal deposition and diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Septic bursitis is the inflammation of the bursa secondary to infection of the sac with microorganisms.' "
What is the aspiration of olecranon bursa?," Fluid from the olecranon bursa is collected for examination.  Aseptic bursitis can be differentiated from the septic bursitis using the aspiration technique.  The fluid which is drawn via aspiration (aspirate), may have a markedly increased white blood cell (WBC) count, indicating septic bursitis, whereas, only a moderate increase in WBC accompanies aseptic bursitis."
When should be the aspiration of olecranon bursa avoided?,'The aspiration of the olecranon bursa should be avoided in the following conditions:' Bacteremia (presence of bacteria in the blood) Skin infection at the needle insertion site Joint prosthesis (replacement of joints with an artificial device)
What happens during the aspiration of the olecranon bursa procedure?," The physician might give you local anesthesia to numb the area.  You sit upright on a stretcher with your arm resting on a side table, and the elbow bent at 90 degrees. The doctor identifies the inflamed area and selects the elbow site for needle insertion.  Once the site is identified, the doctor applies an antiseptic solution and drapes it. The doctor inserts the needle and advances it into the bursa.  The fluid from the bursa is withdrawn completely.  The needle is retracted and an adhesive bandage is placed on the site. The removal of fluid helps in relieving the painful symptoms as well as provides a sample for examination. After the aspiration is completed, an injection of corticosteroids may be given to reduce inflammation in the elbow."
What are the risks and complications of olecranon bursa aspiration?," On examination, if the sample shows the presence of microorganisms, then your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. If there’s no infection found, your doctor might prescribe oral anti-inflammatory medicines or elbow pads. Refrain from activities that may place pressure on the swollen elbow.  Apply ice packs on the inflamed area.  Complications may include infection or abnormal connection between skin entry and bursa (fistula formation)."
What is atherosclerosis?,"'Atherosclerosis'' is a disease of blood vessels. In this condition, the innermost layer of the blood vessels (endothelium) is constricted by the deposition of fat, calcium and cellular debris. Atherosclerosis leads to the narrowing of the artery, which in turn reduces the flow of blood passing through it. The reduced blood flow results in a depletion of the amount of oxygen and nutrients reaching the affected part of the body.''Atherosclerosis can lead to further complications such as:' Coronary heart disease: Build-up of the fatty substance (plaque) in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. Angina: Chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. Carotid artery disease: Plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the brain. These are situated in the neck. Peripheral artery disease: Plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the legs. Chronic kidney disease"
What is the difference between atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis?,"'Arteriosclerosis'' is a broader term for the condition in which the arteries narrow and harden, leading to poor circulation of blood throughout the body.''Atherosclerosis is a specific kind of arteriosclerosis, but these terms are often used interchangeably. Both conditions lead to decreased blood flow to other parts of the body.' "
What are the main causes of atherosclerosis?,"'Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease, which may either start in childhood or late adulthood. The exact cause of atherosclerosis is still unknown; however, plaque formation begins when there is damage to the endothelium of the artery. Some of the most common factors which are more likely to cause this damage are:''Other risk factors include:' Elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the body High blood pressure Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitus Obesity Lack of exercise Sex (men are more prone) Family history of increased cholesterol"
What are the signs and symptoms of atherosclerosis?,'Early atherosclerosis does not present any symptoms. Symptoms may appear once the artery starts to become narrower. Symptoms may occur depending on the arteries that are affected. The various symptoms are:' Chest pain Weakness Vision problems Speech problems Headache Pain in legs or feet Difficulty walking
How is atherosclerosis diagnosed?,'Early diagnosis of atherosclerosis is important to prevent further complications. The physician evaluates the medical history and looks for the symptoms to diagnose atherosclerosis. Tests depend on the arteries that are affected. The various tests which help in diagnosing atherosclerosis are:' Electrocardiogram Angiography Cardiac catheterization Ultrasonography examination Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Scintigraphy Doppler (especially lower limbs)
How is atherosclerosis treated?,"'The treatment approach of atherosclerosis involves:''Medications which are effective in ''lowering cholesterol'' levels include:''Antiplatelet medications'' can be used to prevent blood from clotting or clogging arteries.''Antihypertensive medications such as diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be used to control blood pressure.' Controlling risk factors Controlling blood pressure, blood sugar levels and cholesterol levels Smoking cessation Statins Fibrates Bile acid sequestrants"
Which lifestyle changes help treat and prevent atherosclerosis?,'Lifestyle changes help treat as well as prevent atherosclerosis. The lifestyle changes that can be helpful include:' Eating a healthy diet that is free of saturated fats and cholesterol Avoiding fried and fatty foods Consuming fish twice a week Exercising daily for at least three to four hours Quitting tobacco use Stress management Weight loss
What is a bag valve mask?,'Bag-valve-mask (BVM) or the Ambu bag is a self-inflating bag used to provide ventilation to the person not ''breathing'' normally.\xa0\xa0 ''A BVM consists of a non-rebreathing valve and a face mask. The opposite end of the bag is attached to an oxygen source. The mask is manually held against the face. The bag is squeezed to provide ventilation to the patient through the nose and mouth until the ''intubation'' can be done.' 
What is bag valve mask ventilation?,"'BVM ventilation is a critical skill for emergency providers. BVM ventilation is a technique that restores breathing in patients who are not spontaneously breathing. In most settings, a BVM is an emergency procedure carried to tide over until intubation is done.''Factors that can cause difficulty in BVM ventilation include:' BMI greater than 26 Presence of facial hair Lack of teeth Age above 55 years History of snoring"
What are the criteria for BVM ventilation?,'Successful BVM ventilation depends on four things:' An open airway: Any obstruction or blockage in the airway can affect the BVM ventilation Mask should be sealed adequately on face Proper ventilation technique Valve for proper oxygenation
When is the bag valve mask indicated?,"'BVM ventilation is indicated in the following conditions:''However, BVM should be avoided in the following situations:' Respiratory (lung) failure Failed intubation (insertion of an artificial ventilation tube into the trachea) Patients undergoing anesthesia for elective surgery Apnea (slowed or stopped breathing) Complete upper airway (passage by which air reaches the lungs) blockage Paralysis"
How is bag valve mask ventilation carried out?,"'The patient is made to lie flat on the stretcher. The doctor tilts the head backward and lifts the chin. In patients with spinal injuries, head-tilting is avoided.''BVM ventilation is usually performed with two-rescuers.\xa0''The first rescuer places a mask on the patient’s face before attaching the bag and seals the nose and mouth with the mask.''The bag is squeezed manually by a second rescuer to transport oxygen via a mask or tube spontaneously to the patient.\xa0''A target rate of 10 ventilations per minute should be achieved during ventilation.' "
What are the complications of bag valve mask ventilation?,"'Complications of BVM ventilation include:' Over-ventilating or hyperventilation: Giving too much volume of air or giving it too fast can result in pushing of air into the stomach, leading to a condition known as gastric insufflation. Vomiting  Aspiration (entry of foreign objects into the airway) Hypoventilation Worsen the airway obstruction Accelerate hypoxia (low oxygen level in the blood)"
What is barotrauma in mechanical ventilation?,"'Barotrauma is a condition\xa0in which the alveoli (air sacs of the ''lungs'') rupture with a subsequent entry of air into the surrounding extra alveolar space. ''Barotrauma can complicate mechanical ventilation, as it is associated with life-threatening conditions or even death. Hence, diagnosing and preventing barotrauma during mechanical ventilation is crucial.' "
What are the causes of barotrauma in mechanical ventilation?,"'Barotrauma mainly occurs either due to the rupture of the air sacs (alveolus) of lungs or a direct injury.\xa0''Alveolar rupture can be either ventilator-related or disease-related.\xa0\xa0''Ventilator-related causes include:''Disease-related causes include:''Direct injury to the alveolus may result in an escape of the air to the surrounding tissue and cause conditions similar to barotrauma.' Positive pressure ventilation: Normal respiratory cycle is dependent on negative pressure. However, mechanical ventilation delivers positive pressure. Positive pressure ventilation results in increased pressure in the adjacent areas of the alveolus, causing it to rupture. Elevated pressure: Elevated pressure can result in the injury of the alveolus. Asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic interstitial lung disease Acute respiratory distress syndrome"
What are the signs and symptoms of barotrauma in mechanical ventilation?,'The common manifestations of barotrauma include:' Pneumothorax: It occurs when air escapes into the space between the lung and chest wall. The symptoms of pneumothorax include:Chest painShortness of breathIncreased heart rateAbnormally rapid breathingIncreased blood pressureLow level of oxygen in the blood Chest pain Shortness of breath Increased heart rate Abnormally rapid breathing Increased blood pressure Low level of oxygen in the blood Pneumomediastinum: It occurs when air is trapped in the middle part of the chest. The symptoms of pneumothorax include:Chest painShortness of breathNeck pain Chest pain Shortness of breath Neck pain Pneumoperitoneum: It occurs due to the presence of air in the abdominal cavity. The symptoms of pneumoperitoneum include:Abdominal painStomach tendernessBloating and swelling in the abdomenTympany (hollow drum-like sound produced when air is trapped in the cavity) Abdominal pain Stomach tenderness Bloating and swelling in the abdomen Tympany (hollow drum-like sound produced when air is trapped in the cavity) Subcutaneous emphysema: It occurs when air is trapped into tissues under the skin. Sudden painless tissue swelling is the typical manifestation of subcutaneous emphysema.
How is barotrauma in mechanical ventilation managed?,"'Adjustment of ventilator settings and ventilator management is the main focus of the treatment.''Additional management technique involves:''Once barotrauma is treated, the patient’s vital signs and ventilator settings are closely monitored. Chest radiography may be performed every eight to 12 hours to check for evidence of barotrauma.' Insertion of a chest tube for draining the air in the lungs for managing pneumothorax Surgical means to remove the pressure (surgical decompression) Reduction in ventilator pressure The patient should be taken off of the mechanical ventilator as a last resort Treating the underlying medical conditions"
What is acne?,"'Acne'' is a medical condition affecting the oil glands and hair follicles on the skin. The skin bears tiny openings (skin pores) that connect to the oil glands under the skin.''These glands make an oily substance (sebum). The oil glands connect to the skin pores via narrow canals called follicles. Thin hair grows through the follicles toward the outside of the skin.\xa0''Acne'' occurs when the follicles become clogged with sebum and dead skin cells. The bacteria present can cause inflammation that can be seen as redness, ''bumps'', and ''pimples''.''Acne'' is mainly seen on the forehead, face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. ''Acne'' is usually not a dangerous condition, but it can cause emotional ''stress'' and scarring. Although anyone can get acne, it is most commonly seen in ''teens'' and young adults.' "
What causes acne?,"'There are several myths and sayings about the cause of acne such as dirty skin, ''stress'', and certain foods (junk food and chocolates). None of the studies so far have proven any scientific basis for such claims. Although the exact cause of acne is unknown, some factors are proposed to play an important role in causing acne:''For people who have acne, certain triggers may worsen the condition:' Change in hormonal levels Certain medications (such as steroids) Wearing heavy or greasy cosmetics Hereditary (family history of acne) High humidity Pollution Touching, squeezing, or picking at pimples Pressure or friction on the skin due to bike helmets, backpacks, or tight collars Rough scrubbing of the skin Stress"
Are acne and pimples the same?,"'Although the terms acne and pimples are used interchangeably, pimples are simply one of the many symptoms of acne. Acne manifests as several symptoms, which include the following:' Whiteheads (closed and clogged pores) Blackheads (clogged pores that are open) Papules (small red and painful bumps) Pimples (pus-filled papules) Nodules (big, firm, and painful lumps under the skin) Cysts (deep, painful, pus-filled bumps under the skin)"
What is the best acne treatment?,"'You must consult your doctor to know what treatment will be best for your acne. The best treatment depends upon the cause of acne and associated factors, such as your age and severity of acne.''The treatment options for acne include the following:' Lifestyle management:Never pick or squeeze pimplesGet regular sleepMaintain a healthy weightInclude plenty of fruits and vegetables in your dietWash the affected areas once or twice a day with gentle cleansersAvoid greasy or oily skin products and cosmeticsShower after exercise or other strenuous activitiesAvoid pressure or friction on the skin Never pick or squeeze pimples Get regular sleep Maintain a healthy weight Include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet Wash the affected areas once or twice a day with gentle cleansers Avoid greasy or oily skin products and cosmetics Shower after exercise or other strenuous activities Avoid pressure or friction on the skin Topical (externally applied) antibiotic medications, such as creams and gels containing antibiotic medications such as erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfacetamide, azelaic acid, and dapsone Topical retinoids, such as adapalene and tretinoin Oral medications:Oral antibiotics such as minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracyclineOral birth control pillsSpironolactoneCortisone injectionsIsotretinoinLight treatmentsChemical peels Oral antibiotics such as minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline Oral birth control pills Spironolactone Cortisone injections Isotretinoin Light treatments Chemical peels Topical tea tree oil"
What does normal delivery mean?,"'Delivery of a full-term ''newborn'' baby (37-42 weeks from the last menses of mother) through the vagina without the use of forceps or vacuum for assistance is called a normal ''delivery of a baby''. It is the most preferred option of delivery in the United States, that is, almost two of every three deliveries are normal.' "
What does cesarean delivery mean?,"'Cesarean delivery is a surgical procedure to deliver babies through a horizontal or vertical incision on the mother’s belly. The operation is used almost solely to save the mother and baby’s life. It is also called ''C-section'' or cesarean section.''During this surgery, the mother’s belly muscles are separated to make a second cut (incision) on the wall of the womb. Then, the baby is extracted through the womb wall, and the womb and belly are closed with stitches. It is often necessary when a vaginal delivery would put both the baby and mother at risk.\xa0' "
When will your doctor suggest cesarean delivery?,"'Vaginal delivery has far fewer risks to both the mother and baby than a cesarean delivery. However, your doctor (obstetrician) may suggest cesarean delivery if\xa0' You have twins or triplets in your womb. There is obstructed labor (no further progress in your labor) Your unborn baby is in distress. Your unborn baby is too large to be delivered vaginally. You have previous cesarean deliveries. Your unborn baby is in a lie position or position other than vertex (vertex means the baby’s head is in the uterine mouth). Placenta previa is observed (the placenta of a baby is at the opening of the cervix). There are some complications with the baby’s umbilical cord. You have certain infections or sexually transmitted diseases that have higher chances of passing on to your baby during the vaginal delivery process (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]). You may have chosen this option by yourself for your convenience."
What causes BH4 deficiency?,"'BH4 deficiency is caused due to mutation in any of these genes: GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. Mutation in any of these genes affects the production and regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin.''Tetrahydrobiopterin has the following function in our bodies:''BH4 deficiency is acquired in an autosomal recessive manner, which means the disease will manifest when both the copies of the gene obtained from parents have mutations. Both the parents may carry one copy of mutated genes (carriers), although they do not show any signs or symptoms. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, there is a 25% chance to have a child with BH4 deficiency.' Breaking down or processing certain amino acids Proper development of amine neurotransmitters, such as catecholamines and serotonin"
What are the signs and symptoms of BH4 deficiency?,"'Infants with BH4 deficiency appear normal at birth. Over time, the symptoms become apparent and range from mild to severe.

Why is bone marrow biopsy and aspiration done?,"'Bone marrow analysis is one of the most important diagnostic tools for evaluating blood disorders and other conditions. It helps in the diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic monitoring of blood ''cancers''. Some common conditions that indicate bone marrow biopsy and aspiration are:' Chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia: Cancer arising from myeloid cells in the bone marrow which form WBCs (white blood cells), RBCs (red blood cells) and platelets  Acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia: Cancer arising from the lymphocyte cells, a type of WBC present in the bone marrow Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) Hairy cell leukemia (slow growing cancer of B cells, a type of WBC) Multiple myeloma (cancer of plasma cells, also called B cells, a type of WBC) Idiopathic thrombocytic purpura (low level of platelets due to an unknown cause) Cytopenia (decreased level of one or more blood cell types) Thrombocytosis (increased level of platelets) Undiagnosed anemia (decreased RBCs) Nutritional deficiencies Infections that may infiltrate the bone, e.g., tuberculosis and fungal infections. Fever of unknown origin  AIDS Metastatic cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) Metabolic disorders"
What happens during bone marrow aspiration and biopsy?,"'The most commonly used bone for a biopsy is the iliac crest (thick curved upper border of the hip bone, present on both sides of the hip). It is easily accessible and associated with lesser complications. A biopsy sample may be obtained from one or both iliac crests. Sampling from the iliac crest may be contraindicated in ''obese'' patients.\xa0''The sternum (breastbone) is sampled as the last resort in those older than 12 years of age and in those who are obese. Sternum has a higher risk of complications.\xa0''The tibia (shin bone) is sampled in infants aged younger than one year.''Before the procedure'':''The doctor obtains a detailed medical history, performs a physical assessment, and advises complete blood and radiological analysis to understand the disease better. Biopsy helps in confirming the diagnosis.''During the procedure'':''It is a short procedure performed under local anesthesia. Children or patients who do not cooperate require general anesthesia or intravenous sedation. Hence, there is no ''pain''. Bone marrow aspiration to extract fluid portion of the marrow is usually performed first. A small incision is made through which an aspiration needle is inserted into the bone and then into the bone marrow. Following this, bone marrow biopsy is performed. A larger biopsy needle is used to extract a solid part of the bone marrow tissue. The samples are sent to the pathologist for analysis.\xa0''After the procedure'':''Wound'' dressing would remain for 24 to 48 hours. In case of local anesthesia, patients can go home soon after the procedure and resume normal activities. Patients who had general anesthesia or intravenous sedation may take a day to fully recover from anesthesia.\xa0Patients may experience ''pain'', swelling, and ''bruising'' which usually resolve in a week. Pain killers and antibiotics may be prescribed.' "
What are the complications of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy?,'Some common complications encountered are:' Infection  Bleeding Damage to surrounding nerves and blood vessels  Bone fracture
Boric acid uses,"'Boric acid is a water-soluble white compound and occurs naturally. It consists of oxygen, boron, and hydrogen. It is claimed to have antifungal and antimicrobial properties. Always consult your healthcare provider before applying boric acid to any body part. It is irritating to the skin and may cause severe reactions.''The uses may include:''It’s naturally present in vegetables, most fruits, grains, and nuts. However, we wouldn’t be able to tell because boric acid crystals are odorless and essentially tasteless. It’s not poisonous in very small amounts that occur in nature. However, boric acid is poisonous if swallowed or inhaled in large quantities. High concentrations of boric acid can potentially lead to reproductive problems, possible kidney damage, endocrine disruption, increased ''liver enzymes'', ''abdominal pain'', ''allergic reaction'', burning sensation, irritation, central nervous system (CNS) stimulation, CNS ''depression'', ''diarrhea'', ''rash'', and ''vomiting''.' Boric acid is often a part of homeopathic medicines used for treating vaginal discharge and itching. This medication is a combination of friendly bacteria, vitamin E, and minute amounts of boric acid. It is usually used in dilute solutions as a treatment for diaper rash, insect bites and stings, and sunburns. Boric acid is an effective pesticide for cockroaches, rats, and flies. Boric acid is called a swimming pool chemical because it has proved to be highly useful for maintenance. It can help stabilize the pH level of water and prevent problems with algae. This product reduces the amount of chlorine needed in the pool. The compound can help to keep the water clear and sparkling. It is also used for clearing off fungi in the pool water. It is also helpful in treating various types of ear infections in both humans and pets (otitis externa, also called swimmer's ear, is an infection of the outer ear canal). The use of boric acid in children is not recommended. It is also helpful in treating foul foot odor. A person suffering from excessive smelly feet can apply boric acid powder mixed with talc to the inner side of footwear. Boric acid when mixed with distilled water serves as a wound spray. The solution contains antiseptic properties that help in treating minor wounds such as cuts and burns. This must not be used too frequently. Urine sample bottles often contain boric acid as a preservative, which maintains the quality of the specimen as it travels to the lab. Clear bottles tend to have a small amount of boric acid powder at the bottom. Research shows that the addition of this substance lowers false-positive results. It also preserves the white blood cells in the urine for analysis. Boric acid helps to get rid of tough stains on clothes by adding it to regular detergent while doing laundry. They are used to remove dirt and odor from kitchens and bathrooms.  Due to its flame-retardant properties, boric acid is extensively used in the manufacture of furniture, mattresses, and insulation. Boric acid is helpful in the preservation of timbers against fungal and insect attack. It is used industrially for the manufacture of fiberglass, household glass products, and glass used in liquid crystal display (LCD). To produce glass with a better chemical and high-temperature resistance, boric acid is applied to glass products. Boric acid serves as an excellent cleaner for all types of mold problems and insects such as ants, cockroaches, silverfish, fleas, and others. Boric acid is also used in leather manufacture, and it is used in the jewelry industry in combination with denatured alcohol. Boric acid is also used for welding flux by blacksmiths. Its mixture with petroleum or vegetable oil works as an excellent lubricant that can be used on ceramic or metal surfaces. It can also be used to lubricate carrom boards for faster and smooth play. Manufacturers use boric acid in various products such as enamels, pesticides, glazes, and paints. Boric acid is widely used to treat boron deficiencies in plants."
What is Botox?,"'Botox is a drug made from botulinum toxin, which is a neurotoxin that blocks the signaling processes between the nerves. This disturbs the muscle movements, especially muscle contraction that the concerned nerve controls.''Extremely small doses of botulinum toxin are used in ''Botox injections'', making Botox a safe drug.''Botox works by temporarily relaxing or paralyzing a muscle. This action is primarily used to improve facial features concerned with ''aging'' by reducing the ''wrinkles''.''Over time, the use of Botox also started in the treatment of other disorders where suppression of overactivity of the muscles was needed.' "
What are the possible side effects of Botox?,"'Botox is generally a safe procedure when performed under an experienced doctor. The possible side effects that can happen after a Botox session include:''Some of the signs and symptoms can be serious and need a visit to the doctor right away. These include:' Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site Flu-like symptoms such as fever and headache Neck pain Dry eyes or watery eyes Redness of the eyes Drooping of the eyelids A crooked smile Muscle weakness Vision problems Trouble swallowing Difficulty in breathing Loss of bladder control"
What is done before Botox?,"'Your doctor will take your medical history before initiating the ''Botox treatment'' on you. You should inform your doctor about''If you are on blood-thinning medications such as ''heparin'' or ''warfarin'', your doctor may ask you to discontinue it for a few days before the procedure to avoid post-Botox ''bruising''.''Most people tolerate the procedure well because the procedure does not cause much discomfort or ''pain''.''The doctor might administer local anesthesia just before the procedure to numb the area.' Your pregnancy or breastfeeding. Any Botox treatment that is taken in the previous four months. Any antidepressant medications, sleeping pills, painkillers, or allergy medications that you are on."
What happens during the procedure?,"'The doctor gives a few tiny shots of Botox in the required area.''The procedure takes a few minutes, and you can go home the same day.''Your doctor will schedule the next appointment (session) after a few to several months later.' "
What happens after the procedure?,'You will be able to resume all your activities normally as before. The general restrictions after the procedure include avoiding' Pressure on the area for 12 hours. Lying down for three to four hours. Physical exertion for 24 hours.

What is enteroenterostomy?,"'Enteroenterostomy is an anastomosis (connection) between one part of the small bowel to another (jejunum or ileum).''The entire small intestine is around 20 ''feet'' long and is divided into three parts.\xa0''When a part of the small or large intestine is resected (removed) because of intestinal pathology, the two sections of the remaining part of the intestine are joined together (anastomosis) to re-establish communication and continuity of the intestine. This surgical procedure is called intestinal anastomosis.\xa0' The first part is called the duodenum (the stomach opens into the duodenum).  The middle part is called the jejunum.  The third and final part is called the ileum. The ileum opens into the large intestine. "
Why is enteroenterostomy done?,"'Enteroenterostomy is performed following the removal of part of the small intestine due to intestinal pathology. Intestinal resection and anastomosis are performed during the same procedure. The procedure may be done in adults and children.''Intestinal resection may be indicated in the following conditions:' Intestinal gangrene (tissue death due to loss of blood supply)  Malignancy (cancer) Benign tumors (e.g., intestinal polyps) Intussusception (when a part of the intestine gets stuck in its preceding part)  Worm infestations with intestinal obstruction Infections like tuberculosis complicated with stricture or perforation Perforations due to infection, ulcers, or trauma  Damage to the intestine due to radiation therapy, especially when complicated with bleeding, stricture, or perforation Inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s disease Scarring and adhesions causing the intestinal block Chronic constipation Birth defects of the intestine (e.g., Meckel’s diverticulum, cysts, Hirschsprung disease) For intestinal bypass (short circuit) to relieve an obstruction or after the closure of intestinal perforation. As a part of the Braun loop of jejunum, also called Braun enteroenterostomy, which is performed as a part of other surgeries like bariatric surgery"
What is Braun enteroenterostomy?,"'Braun enterostomy is a type of anastomosis done following a major surgery like pancreaticoduodenectomy (removal of pancreas and a part of the intestine). It may also be done following other major gastric procedures.''Braun enteroesterostomy is a side-to-side anastomosis between two segments of the jejunum (small intestine) away from the primary site of surgery.''It may decrease the postoperative morbidity, but the results have not been consistent.' "
When can enteroenterostomy not be done?,"'The surgery may not be able to be performed when there is a high risk of anastomotic leakage. In such cases, the surgeon may advise alternative techniques. Some conditions in which enteroenterostomy may be contraindicated are:' Severe sepsis (widespread infection in the body) Poor nutritional status  Cancer metastasis (widespread of cancer cells in the body) Questionable viability of the intestine (a large amount of tissue in the intestine is dead because the blood supply has been cut off) Fecal contamination or infection in the abdomen Unhealthy and diseased intestine"
What are the types of enteroenterostomy?,"'The three main types based on the surgical technique. The surgeon decides on which technique would be ideal based on the condition. The three techniques are:''Side-to-side anastomosis''In this technique,\xa0the sides of each part of the intestine are connected either with ''sutures'' or surgical staples rather than the two ends.\xa0''End-to-end anastomosis''In this technique, the two open ends of the ''intestines'' are connected together.''End-to-side anastomosis''In this technique, the end of the intestine that is smaller is connected to the side of the larger section.' Side-to-side End-to-end End-to-side"
What are the complications of enteroenterostomy?,"'Like any major surgery, there is a risk for complications. Some may be on the table or in the post-operative period. Some common complications are:' Localized blood clot and smaller blood clots that enter the blood vessels, causing heart and lung complications Bleeding Reaction to anesthesia  Scarring and adhesions, causing intestinal narrowing and/or blockage Damage to surrounding structures Infection Wound dehiscence (a condition in which the cut made during a surgical procedure separates or ruptures after being stitched together) Anastomotic leak (intestinal contents may leak through the site of anastomosis), which may lead to systemic infection Altered bowel movements "
How long does it take for anastomosis to heal?,"'After surgery, the patient may have to stay in the hospital for up to seven days. Patients can mobilize 48 to 72 hours after surgery.\xa0''The small intestine heals very quickly. It usually takes two to three weeks for the anastomosis to heal and for the patients to recover. The large intestine anastomosis may take longer to heal.\xa0''Patients may experience ''fatigue'' and discomfort for six to eight weeks, making certain activities difficult like vigorous ''exercise'', sports, or lifting heavy objects. Most patients are able to return to their pre-operative activities in six to eight weeks.' "
When is breast needle localization indicated?,'The breast needle localization is performed in the following conditions:' Impalpable lesions visualized in either sonography or mammography Cancerous lesion Palpable lesions that appear to be vague or uncertain in clinical finding Hard to perform a core biopsy Lesions that require complete excision A person unable to undergo core biopsy
What are the advantages and disadvantages of breast needle localization?,'The advantages of breast needle localization include:''The disadvantages of breast needle localization include:' Decreased incidence and severity of vasovagal syncope (sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure) It doesn’t increase the anxiety level as the procedure takes place below the table Short procedure time Low-cost procedure Ease of performing the procedure Greater patient satisfaction Difficulty in approaching lesions close to the chest wall Difficulty in locating small lesion in the large breast due to a small field of view Detecting small lesions requires magnification imaging
How do I prepare for breast needle localization?,"'You have to inform the physician about your medical and medication history. The physician may ask you to stop certain medications for 3 to 5 days before the surgery, such as:''Do not wear any jewelry on the day of the procedure. Do not use deodorants or perfumes on the day of the procedure. Ask someone to accompany you for the procedure.' Aspirin Blood thinners Herbal supplements"
What can I expect during breast needle localization?,"'The physician identifies the abnormal area using a ''mammogram'' and ''ultrasound''. Once the suspicious area is located, the physician places a marker on the breast. The physician numbs the breast area and then inserts a needle. A mammogram is taken to check if the needle arrives at the lesion. If the needle is not in the position, the physician will reposition it and repeat the imaging process. After positioning the tip of the needle, the physician injects a small amount of blue dye through it. Finally, the physician will either remove the needle or replace it with a wire and take to the surgery. The procedure takes about 60 minutes.''In another (newer) localization method, localizing devices, such as tiny pellets that emit small amounts of ''radiation'' (radioactive or magnetic seeds) or radiofrequency reflectors, which are small devices that give off signals, are placed under the breast. The surgeon detects the abnormal area by using a handheld detector because these devices emit signals.' "
What are the complications of breast needle localization?,'The complications of breast needle localization include:' Potential inaccuracies Dislodging or migration of wires before the surgery Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) Bruising Bleeding Infection
What is breath sound assessment?,"'Clinical evaluation of breath sounds is the first and most common method of assessing lung health. The stethoscope placed on the back and chest lets the physician listen to the breath sounds. This process is called auscultation.\xa0''Assessment of breath sounds is a routine part of a clinical examination. If a pathology of the lung is suspected, assessing the breath sounds helps identify probable causes. The type and location of certain\xa0breath sounds can help make a diagnosis.' "
What are normal breath sounds?,"'There are two types, normal and abnormal (adventitious) breath sounds:''Normal breath sounds are divided into two subcategories:' Vesicular breath sounds: Sounds heard during auscultation of the chest of a healthy person. They can be heard all over the chest and the back. Tracheal sounds: Sounds heard over the sternum. They are louder and higher pitched than vesicular sounds are. "
What are the types of abnormal breath sounds?,"'The type and location of the abnormal breath sounds can help make a diagnosis. In the presence of abnormal breath sounds, the doctor will advise a management plan for further investigations and treatment. The types of abnormal breath sounds include the following:\xa0''This is a high-pitched whistling sound that occurs ''breathing'' in or out. It’s usually a sign that there is narrowing of the airways, preventing air from flowing through freely.''The most common causes of\xa0''wheezing''\xa0are\xa0''asthma'' and a group of lung diseases\xa0called\xa0''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''\xa0(''COPD''). Other conditions that can cause wheezing include:''This is a series of short, explosive sounds. They may sound like bubbling, rattling or clicking. They mostly occur during ''inhalation'' and sometimes during ''exhalation''.''Crackles can be a sign that there’s ''fluid in the lungs''.''They can be caused by:\xa0''This a harsh, noisy, squeaking sound happens with every breath. It can be high or low and usually a sign that there is obstruction of the airways. It may be present during inhalation or exhalation. It can be a sign of a life-threatening problem that needs medical attention right away.''The causes of stridor are:''These are low-pitched\xa0wheezing\xa0sounds that sound like\xa0''snoring''. They usually occur during exhalation. They can be a sign that the bronchial tubes (the tubes that connect the trachea to the lungs) are thickened because of\xa0''mucus''.''Rhonchi sounds can be a sign of ''bronchitis'' or\xa0''COPD''.''This is a high-pitched gasp that typically follows a long bout of\xa0''coughing''.\xa0 It may be a symptom of\xa0''whooping cough''\xa0(''pertussis''), a ''contagious'' infection in the respiratory system.\xa0''The membranes that cover the walls of the chest ''cavity'' and the outer surface of the lungs are called pleura. If they get inflamed and rub together, it produces a rough, scratchy sound.''It can be a sign of\xa0''pleurisy''\xa0(inflammation\xa0of the pleura), fluid in the lungs, ''pneumonia'' or lung tumors.''This sound, also called Hamman’s sign. It indicates that air is trapped in the space between the lungs (the mediastinum). It’s a crunchy, scratchy sound and occurs along with the heartbeat.''The sound can occur in lung diseases like\xa0COPD, ''pneumonia'' or cystic fibrosis.'

What do hives look like?," Hives may look like big bug bites that can last from minutes to months. They can be red or skin-colored bumps or wheals that usually appear suddenly and go away just as quickly. Hives can appear anywhere on the body. They may be as small as the tip of a pen to as big as a dish plate. They can change their shape and place where they appear. They disappear and reappear over short periods. On pressing them, they blanch, which means their redness disappears temporarily."
How are hives diagnosed?,"'The doctor usually diagnoses hives by looking at your skin. They will take your medical history and check for any possible triggers. Finding the cause of chronic hives can be difficult. The following tests can help in identifying the cause:' Allergy tests (that are done directly on the skin or through blood tests) Routine blood tests (including WBC count, liver function tests, kidney function tests) A skin biopsy (removing a piece of your skin to examine it under a microscope)"
How to get rid of hives fast?,"'An oral pill of an ''antihistamine'' medicine is the most common treatment and the first line of therapy to get rid of mild to moderate hives fast. They are very effective in relieving ''itchy'' skin. Your doctor may prescribe you a combination of a few ''antihistamines'' if you do not get relief from one.''If you have developed hives for the first time (acute hives), you may just receive a single dose of the medicine. If you suffer from chronic hives, you may have to take this medicine once daily for several days to prevent the hives from coming back.''Other medicines that dermatologists prescribe to treat hives include:''Chronic hives are commonly treated with:' Corticosteroids: These are given for severe hives and only for the short term. Epinephrine (adrenaline): This is an emergency medicine that is given as an injectable when swelling (angioedema) of the face, lips, tongue, or throat also develops along with the hives. Antihistamine: Usually higher doses of antihistamines are given. Dapsone (antibiotic): This medication effectively reduces the swelling and redness of hives. Omalizumab (monoclonal antibodies): If antihistamines do not work, injections of omalizumab are given under the skin. This drug works by reducing the sensitivity to allergens."
How do you stop getting hives?,"'Chronic hives disturb your work, ''sleep'', and other activities. Avoiding known triggers is the most important and effective way to stop getting them. You can take ''allergy'' tests to identify the hidden triggers.''Here are some other ways that can help you:' Wear loose, light clothing Avoid scratching the skin Use mild soaps (avoid harsh ingredients) Soothe the affected area with a fan, cool cloth, moisturizer, or anti-itch cream Apply sunscreen before venturing out in the sun"
When should I go to the doctor for hives?,"'You need to visit the doctor right away if''If hives come on and off for more than 6 weeks, schedule an appointment with your doctor who will evaluate you thoroughly and prescribe the right combination of medicines.' There is swelling of the face, tongue, or throat (angioedema). You face breathing trouble. Over the counter antihistamines fail to relieve the hives within 24 hours."
What are the complications of cervical lymphadenectomy?,"'The complications of cervical lymphadenectomy include:' Shoulder dysfunction due to the injury and damage to the surrounding nerve manifesting as significant shoulder pain, weakness in the movement of the shoulder, shoulder drop, and an abnormally prominent or winged scapula. Hematoma (localized collection of blood) Chylous fistula (leakage of lymph fluid from a lymph vessel and accumulating in the thorax) Facial edema (swelling in the face) Cerebral edema (swelling in the brain) subsequently leading to neurologic problems Weakness or numbness in the arms Blindness (rare) Nerve injury (such as the injury to the greater auricular nerve that provides sensations to the ear and facial nerve injury) Horner syndrome (characterized by drooping of the eyelid, excessive shrinking of the pupil of the eye, and the inability to sweat normally or anhidrosis) Difficulty in swallowing Injury to an important muscle (sternocleidomastoid) present on side of the neck, which may make the neck look thinner and sunken Bleeding Pain Poor wound healing Scarring Infections"
What are the different types of cervical lymphadenectomy?,"'Depending on the extent of lymph nodes removal, cervical lymphadenectomy may be:''Selective neck dissection:'' It involves the removal of the lymph nodes from some areas of the neck, usually the areas closest to ''cancer''.''Modified radical neck dissection:'' This procedure may be of different types. The surgeon may only remove most of the lymph nodes between the jawbone and collarbone on one side of your neck. In another type of modified radical neck dissection, the surgeon may additionally remove one or more of the following:''Radical neck dissection:'' It is the historical standard for cervical lymphadenectomy with which all other forms of neck dissection are compared. Radical neck dissection involves the removal of all the lymph nodes on one side of the neck. It also involves the removal of:' A muscle on the side of the neck called the sternocleidomastoid muscle A nerve called the spinal accessory nerve A vein called the internal jugular vein A type of saliva producing gland called the submandibular gland The spinal accessory nerve The sternocleidomastoid muscle The internal jugular vein"
What causes cleidocranial dysplasia?,"'Cleidocranial dysplasia is caused due to mutations in\xa0the RUNX2\xa0gene. This gene is responsible for the production of a protein that is involved in the development of the skeletal system. The RUNX2 gene mutations interfere with the development of bone, teeth, and cartilage. The condition is autosomal dominant. There is a 50% chance that the child will suffer from the disease if one parent has the disease. Sometimes, there may be a spontaneous mutation and the child may show signs of the disease though parents are normal.' "
What is the treatment for cleidocranial dysplasia?,"'Treatment depends on the individual’s symptoms. The individual has to undergo numerous reconstructive surgery and dental procedures for functional well-being. Treatment includes:''As a precaution, wear a helmet while playing sports to prevent the ''head injury''.' Facial reconstructive surgery to reshape the forehead and cheekbones in children Spinal fusion procedures to strengthen the spinal cord Surgical repair of fractures due to weak bones Surgical removal of small collar bone pieces affecting the network of nerves (brachial plexus). This can relieve the pain in the arm and nerve disorders due to compression. Surgery to correct knock knees Ear tubes to treat ear infection Calcium and Vitamin D supplements to strengthen the bone Oral surgery to correct extra teeth Jaw surgery to correct jaws"
What is CO2 laser skin resurfacing?,"'CO2 laser skin resurfacing is a procedure involving the use of carbon dioxide\xa0(CO2) and a skin surface-removing laser (ablative laser) to remove ''scars'', ''warts'' and deep ''wrinkles''.' "
How does CO2 laser skin resurfacing work?,"'Ablative lasers,'' such as a CO2 laser, work by traumatizing the skin. It removes the thin outer layer of skin (''epidermis'') and heats the underlying skin (dermis). This stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers. As the epidermis heals and regrows, the treated skin appears clearer, smoother and tighter.\xa0''Non-ablative lasers,'' such as pulsed light (IPL) devices, do not traumatize the skin, instead they stimulate collagen growth and improve skin tone and texture. This is less invasive and requires less recovery time, but is less effective.''The surgeon chooses the laser type based on the condition being treated and the patient’s cosmetic goals.' "
What are the uses of CO2 laser skin resurfacing?,"'CO2 laser skin resurfacing can be used to treat:''Other uses for carbon dioxide resurfacing include:' Fine and deep wrinkles Age spots Uneven skin tone or texture Sun-damaged skin Mild to moderate acne scars Large pores Superficial to deep hyperpigmentation Seborrheic keratosis Verruca vulgaris/plana Sebaceous gland hyperplasia Angiofibroma (fibrous papule of nose) Junctional and compound nevi Lentigo simplex Small syringomas Epidermal melasma Rhinophyma (potato nose) Vocal cord nodules, cysts and tumors"
When is CO2 laser skin resurfacing not recommended?,"'CO2 laser skin resurfacing is not recommended with:' Active bacterial, viral, or fungal infections Unrealistic expectations Poor general health Oral isotretinoin (Accutane) use within previous six months Fitzpatrick skin phototypes 5-6 (very dark skin) Other resurfacing procedures within preceding two to three months Unwillingness to accept possibility of complications Eyelid laxity Excessively thick or thin skin Collagen vascular disease Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or systemic infections Tendency for keloid or thick scar formation"
Is CO2 laser skin resurfacing painful?,"'CO2 laser skin resurfacing is usually done with anesthesia, so there is minimal discomfort during the procedure.' Topical anesthetics are common Numbing cream may be applied directly onto the skin or sometimes local infiltration (injection) Other types of anesthesia are usually performed in individual situations and for skin conditions that need deeper penetration of the laser. These forms of anesthesia includeRegional nerve blockIntravenous (IV) sedationLaryngeal mask airwayCombined techniques Regional nerve block Intravenous (IV) sedation Laryngeal mask airway Combined techniques Post-operative pain is minimal and can be managed with oral pain killers"
How do I care for my skin after the CO2 laser skin resurfacing procedure?,"'Avoid picking at the skin or rubbing skin vigorously when cleaning it or in the shower.' Avoid hot showers. Care for the skin after laser resurfacing is similar to managing a second-degree thermal burn. Keeping the wound moist and dressing regularly promotes faster healing. Two methods of wound dressing may be used:Open type: Apply an occlusive ointment (like petroleum jelly) till skin heals. Avoid topical antibiotics.Closed type: Apply semi-occlusive biosynthetic dressing until skin heals. It is painless and promotes faster healing. It is expensive, however, and requires frequent clinic visits and increases the chance of infection. Open type: Apply an occlusive ointment (like petroleum jelly) till skin heals. Avoid topical antibiotics. Closed type: Apply semi-occlusive biosynthetic dressing until skin heals. It is painless and promotes faster healing. It is expensive, however, and requires frequent clinic visits and increases the chance of infection. Antibiotics, painkillers and anti-itching medications can be administered if necessary."
How long does a CO2 laser skin resurfacing take to heal?," Recovery from CO2 laser resurfacing of the entire face is seven to 14 days, depending on the depth. Post-resurfacing swelling is expected. It peaks at day two or three, and then usually subsides by days five or seven. Redness and itching are common. During the first week, there are varying degrees of oozing and crusting depending on the dressing used. Apply dressings (open or closed) until complete healing takes place. Start applying a light water-based moisturizer for the next two to three weeks. The doctor may recommend post-procedure skin reconditioning early during the healing process. Avoid products that contain acids such salicylic acid, glycolic acid, etc., until the skin has completely regenerated, healed and skin tolerance has returned. Use sunscreen once healing occurs. Doctor visits may be required at two to three days, one week, three to four weeks, three months, six months, and one year after resurfacing."
What are the side effects of CO2 laser skin resurfacing?,"'Transient side effects (resolve spontaneously or with medication):' Swelling Erythema (redness) Itching (pruritus) Acne flare Post resurfacing hyperpigmentation Infection (bacterial, viral, yeast, fungal) Contact dermatitis Serious complications Hypopigmentation (loss of skin pigment)  Sharp demarcation lines Hypertrophic scars and keloids Tooth enamel injury Eye abrasion/injury Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) "
How effective is CO2 laser skin resurfacing?,"'Results of CO2 laser resurfacing are good to excellent, depending on the indication for which the procedure was performed. Sun damage improves the most with laser resurfacing. ''Wrinkles'' may improve by 60% to 80% in some people, while scars improve to a lesser degree.''Most patients are satisfied with the aesthetic improvement, and the surgery results in minimal recovery time and a low incidence of complications.' "
What are the advantages of operative laparoscopy?,"'Open surgery, also known as laparotomy, involves making a large incision of about 6-12 inches over your abdomen. As the surgical wound is large, the hospital stay becomes longer after the surgery. Technology has advanced so much that most of the operations can be performed through laparoscopy.''Operative laparoscopy has become popular due to its advantages over open surgery. These advantages include:' The option of getting it done as an outpatient procedure Lower chances of infection and complications Shorter hospital stays (during the hospital admission as an inpatient) Minimal scars at the surgical site Less pain after the surgery Faster recovery (earlier return to routine activities) Less risk of adhesion (bands of tissue in between organs) formation"
What are the conditions for which operative laparoscopy can be used?,"'Laparoscopic surgery can be used for a variety of conditions, including:' Removing the appendix in case of appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix) Removing the gallbladder (often used to treat gallstones) Removing a part of the intestine (to treat bowel conditions, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis) Repairing hernias Removing the embryo from the fallopian tube (to treat ectopic pregnancy) Removing uterine fibroid or myoma Removing the uterus (hysterectomy) Surgical treatment of bleeding stomach ulcers Performing bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery) Removing some section or the whole organ affected by cancer, such as the LiverColonOvariesProstateKidneyBladder Liver Colon Ovaries Prostate Kidney Bladder"
How is an operative laparoscopy performed?,"'Depending on your health status and the condition for which the operative laparoscopy is planned, you may be admitted a night before the surgery or on the same day of the surgery.''The doctor usually gives you general anesthesia that makes you ''sleep'' throughout the surgery. This is to make you ''pain''-free during the entire surgery.''The doctor cleans the surgical site and makes several, tiny incisions (each measuring less than half an inch). Next, they insert the laparoscope into one of the incisions. Carbon dioxide gas is also pumped through one of the incisions to expand the area for a better view and surgical access. The laparoscope acts like a camera and helps the doctor visualize the internal structures of your abdomen through the images on a small screen. The surgical instruments are inserted through the other incisions and the required surgical procedure is performed.''Next, the gas is removed from your abdomen. The surgical wound is either stapled or sutured followed by the wound dressing.''The doctor will observe you for a few to several hours after the surgery. Depending on your general health condition, you may be discharged on the same day or during the next 1-2 days after the surgery.' "
What is a cornea?,"'The cornea is the transparent dome-shaped covering the front of the eye and protecting the pupil, ''iris'', and eye chamber. The cornea plays a key role in a patient’s vision quality and optical health. The cornea works with the lens and anterior chamber to focus light to help you see clearly.' "
Why is corneal topography important?,"'Corneal topography, computer-assisted videokeratography (CAVK), or corneal mapping is a computer-assisted diagnostic imaging technique that helps in creating visuals of the corneal surface so that the doctor can view the visuals and analyze the entire shape of the cornea for diagnosis and treatment. It is a noninvasive medical imaging technique used for mapping the surface curvature of the cornea. Since the cornea is normally responsible for approximately 70% of the eye’s refractive power, its topography is of critical importance in determining the quality of vision. Therefore, corneal topography is an important diagnostic test.' "
How corneal topography is performed?,"'This corneal topography creates a map of the cornea that allows the physician to formulate a 3D perspective of the cornea’s shape.' The corneal topography usually has a computer linked to a lighted bowl, which has a pattern of concentric rings. The patient is usually asked to sit in front of the bowl with their head pressed against a bar. Multiple light concentric rings are then projected on the cornea and the reflected image is captured on a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The computer software then digitizes these data points and prints out the corneal shape using different color representations to identify different elevations. The cool shades of blue and green are usually used to indicate flatter areas of the cornea. Warmer shades of orange and red may indicate steeper areas."
Are corneal topography and corneal tomography the same imaging techniques?,"'No, both are different diagnostic techniques. However, both are very useful in the diagnosis\xa0of ''keratoconus''.' Corneal topography usually provides a map of the front surface of the cornea that is used to evaluate its curvature. Corneal tomography also provides a map of the front surface, as well as additional information about the curvature of the back surface of the cornea (inside of the eye). It may also be used to create a map showing the thickness of different areas of the cornea."
What does continuous positive airway pressure mean?,'Continuous positive ''airway'' pressure (''CPAP'') means maintaining a constant air pressure in a person’s airway by making air continuously flow into the airway. This keeps the airway open and clear and prevents it from collapsing.' 
What is CPAP therapy?,"'CPAP therapy is an effective home treatment for people who can spontaneously breathe, but have difficulty ''breathing'' while asleep. CPAP keeps a patient’s airway continuously open and stimulates breathing by pumping air with a machine.''A CPAP machine may consist\xa0of:''A ''sleep'' doctor or a ''pulmonologist'' usually first monitors the patient in a ''sleep'' lab to determine optimal air pressure for the individual. The doctor helps select the right kind of mask that fits the individual’s need. The patient will need to sleep with the mask on every night with the CPAP machine turned on.' An apparatus to wear on the face such as full-face mask that covers the entire face full mask that covers the nose and mouth  nasal mask that covers the nose nasal pillow that sits below the nose nasal prongs that go into the nostrils A motor that pumps the air A tube that connects the machine to the mask"
What are the kinds of positive airway pressure machines?,'Positive airway pressures machines are primarily of three kinds:' CPAP: Continuous positive airway pressure that delivers constant and steady air pressure. APAP: Autotitrating (adjustable) positive airway pressure that changes air pressure according to the breathing pattern. BiPAP: Bilevel positive airway pressure that delivers air with different pressures for inhalation and exhalation.
What conditions is CPAP used for?,"'CPAP cannot be used for people who are not spontaneously breathing. CPAP is primarily used by people who have breathing difficulties while asleep.\xa0''People who have certain diseases or conditions may find it difficult to breathe while asleep, due to obstruction or collapse of the airway. This is called obstructive ''sleep apnea''. This may lead to:''CPAP may also be used for breathing difficulties caused by''CPAP is not advised for patients in certain conditions that include:' Reduced sleep and poor sleep quality Snoring Reduced oxygen intake Hypertension Daytime sleepiness Mood swings Impaired cognition Fatigue Obstructive sleep apnea may be caused by Obesity Respiratory disorders Muscle weakness from muscular diseases Tissue growth in the airway Swelling or growth of tonsils and adenoids Hypothyroidism Lung tissue diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis Airway diseases such as Asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Certain viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory system Central sleep apnea (breathing stops and starts several times during sleep due to neurological disorders) Heart failure Infant respiratory distress syndrome in newborn infants Trauma or injury to the face Nausea and vomiting Copious secretions in the airway Unconscious or not spontaneously breathing COVID-19 coronavirus disease"
Should hospitals use CPAP machines for COVID-19 coronavirus patients?,"'No, according to The American Society of Anesthesiologists.\xa0''According to their guidance for clinicians treating patients with ''COVID-19'' coronavirus, CPAP machines may deliver adequate oxygen, but they also aerosolize the virus in the infected person’s breath and spread it around the area, increasing infection risk.''The ASA recommends direct ''endotracheal intubation'' for ''COVID-19'' patients with acute respiratory failure.' "
How effective is CPAP therapy?,'CPAP is found to be very effective in keeping the airway open in people with sleep apnea. The benefits include' Normal sleep patterns Improved sleep quality Better concentration and memory Alertness during the day Elimination of snoring Lowering of hypertension Improved general health Improved quality of life
What are the complications and side effects of CPAP?,"'CPAP therapy is quite safe and can be used even for infants. It may take a little while to get used to the CPAP machine and its noise; however, most of the latest machines are almost silent.''The CPAP may have a few side effects that include''Some of the effects can be mitigated by:' Claustrophobia Nasal congestion and runny nose Nosebleeds Eye irritation Dryness of mouth Redness or soreness where the mask fits Chest muscle discomfort Upper respiratory infections Using the CPAP for short periods initially and acclimatizing Using padding and making sure the mask fits well Keeping the equipment clean Using humidifiers Using nasal saline spray"
What is dacryocystorhinostomy surgery?,"'Abnormal watering of eyes (epiphora) occurs because of an obstruction of the tear drainage system (tear ducts), either due to structural problems or infection. This impairs normal tear drainage into the nose. Regular infection may also occur because of the stagnation of tears.''Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure that involves restoration of the normal flow of tears through the tear ducts to the nose and alleviates the excessive tearing.\xa0''The surgical approach may be external or endoscopic through the nose.\xa0''The success rate ranges from 82-96%.' "
What is the anatomy of the tear ducts? ,"'The eyes consist of a system of glands and ducts (called the lacrimal system) which produces tears to keep eyes from drying out, to clean them and to protect them against infections.\xa0''Tear-producing (lacrimal) glands secrete the watery part of tears. These glands are located behind the upper eyelids. The tears drain out of the eyes through two openings (puncta, or lacrimal ducts), located on the upper and lower inner corner of the lids.' "
Why is dacryocystorhinostomy done?," Congenital problems (a person may be born with an underdeveloped tear duct system or defects Recurrent dacryocystitis (infection of the lacrimal sac) Canaliculitis (inflammation of the canaliculus, a short channel near the inner corner of the eyelids through which tears drain into the sac) Dacryolithiasis (inflammation due to formation of small stones in the tear duct system) Lacrimal system tumors Nasal pathology obstructing drainage Trauma Previous surgery  Unidentifiable causes "
What are the signs and symptoms of epiphora (watery eyes)?,'One or both eyes can be affected with:' Increased socially and personally unacceptable watering of eyes Pain Discharge of pus  Swelling in the inner corner of the eyes Inflammation or redness of the skin and eyelids  Crusting  Fever Ulceration of the eyes 
When should dacryocystorhinostomy be avoided?,'People with the following problems should not have this surgery:' Conditions associated with dry eyes (Sjogren’s syndrome) Bleeding disorders Systemic diseases 
What diagnostic tests do you need before dacryocystorhinostomy?,'Your surgeon may administer one or more of the following diagnostic procedures:' Dacryocystography CT scan  MRI Diagnostic nasal endoscopy  Metal probing and irrigation (with/without fluorescein dye irrigation) of the lacrimal drainage system
What happens during the dacryocystorhinostomy procedure?," Surgery can be performed under local or general anesthesia. The surgical approach to the sac may be external or endoscopic through the nose. External approach is performed by ophthalmologists (eye surgeons). Endoscopic approach may be performed by ENT surgeons (otorhinolaryngologists) or ophthalmologists using rigid telescopes or microscope. A tube or stent may be inserted into the lacrimal apparatus to keep it open, maintain the drainage and prevent recurrence.  External approach is performed by ophthalmologists (eye surgeons).  Endoscopic approach may be performed by ENT surgeons (otorhinolaryngologists) or ophthalmologists using rigid telescopes or microscope.  A tube or stent may be inserted into the lacrimal apparatus to keep it open, maintain the drainage and prevent recurrence.  Better aesthetic result with no external scars Allows a one-stage procedure to also correct associated nasal pathology Avoids injury to other structures and scarring Preserves function of eye muscles Surgery can be done even with an active infection of the lacrimal system Superior to external approach in revision surgery Less bloody and messy  Shorter operative time  Good success rate Requires the surgeon to have specialized training in nasal endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic equipment is expensive; hence surgery cost may be higher."
What happens after the DCR procedure?," Pain killers and antibiotics may be administered. In the endoscopic approach, the nose may be packed with gauze or tampon and dressed for 24-48 hours, during which patient would have to resort to mouth breathing. Dressing may be applied over the operated area in external approach. Advised to rest with head elevated above the feet for 48 hours. Patient can be discharged from the hospital after 24-48 hours  Minimal watering of eyes, swelling and bruising.   Patient can resume normal activities following discharge.  It is advised to stay indoors for around a week to avoid exposure to pollution or infection. Avoid forcefully blowing the nose, spicy food/drinks, swimming, exercise, sports, lifting heavy objects, yoga, bending for long, eye makeup or over the counter creams and lotions for 2 weeks. Surgeon would prescribe eye drops/ointment and saline wash 2 to 3 times a day for around 2 weeks.  Follow up with the surgeon may be required after 7-10 days during which the nose may be cleaned. Follow-up may be required again after 2-6 months to remove the tube."
Is DCR surgery painful?," The surgery is performed under local or general anesthesia, hence there is no pain during the surgery. Pain during the postoperative period may be present. The degree may vary based on the patient’s pain tolerance.  The pain can be managed by oral or injectable pain killers."
How long is the recovery from DCR surgery?," It is normal to have watery eyes until the swelling and inflammation settles, which may take around two weeks.  Swelling and bruising can involve eyes, nose and cheek and may take two to three weeks to resolve.  Follow-up in the clinic is necessary to monitor healing and cleaning.  Maintenance of hygiene using prescribed medication and saline washes promotes faster healing.   Most patients return to all their preoperative activities after two weeks, including swimming, exercise and sports.  The tube would be removed after two to six months, during which it may cause mild discomfort or pain, usually without any more serious post-procedure issues. "
What are the complications of DCR surgery?, Bleeding through the nose Swelling Bruising Infection Adhesions in the nose Persistent watering due to scarring Sump syndrome: Tears and mucus accumulate in the sac and discharge into the eye
What is a distal gastrectomy?,'Antrectomy (distal gastrectomy) is a procedure that involves surgical removal of the lower 30% of the stomach (antrum). Distal gastrectomy is a type of partial gastrectomy that involves the surgical removal of only a portion of the stomach.\xa0\xa0''A partial gastrectomy surgery is followed by a surgery to create a connection (anastomosis) of the remaining portion of the stomach to the duodenum (gastroduodenostomy) or the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy) of the small intestine.' 
Why is antrectomy (distal gastrectomy) performed?,'Antrectomy is mainly indicated in the treatment of gastric ulcers that are:''Antrectomy is also indicated in the treatment of noncancerous tumors or for the early stages of ''cancer'' involving the lower part of the stomach.' not responsive to medication complicated by holes (perforation) bleeding or obstructing recurring

What happens during the antrectomy surgery?,"'Before the treatment, you will be counseled regarding the surgery, its complications and its risk and benefits.\xa0''Also, some of the instructions which you need to follow before and on the day of surgery are:''During the surgery\xa0' You need to undergo certain tests including an electrocardiogram (EKG), a chest x-ray and blood tests. Inform your doctor, if you are on blood thinners such as Coumadin (warfarin) or heparin or any prescription medicines. You should refrain from alcohol, cigarette smoking or recreational drugs before the surgery. You should stop taking aspirin, herbal remedies, vitamin E and other supplements, seven days before the surgery. You need to follow a liquid diet the day before the surgery. The surgeon makes a cut extending from the chest to the belly button.  Once the abdomen is open and accessible, the surgeon conducts a thorough evaluation to assess the extent of disease.  After the assessment, the lower portion of the stomach (antrum) is surgically removed. The remaining portion of the stomach is connected with the duodenum or the jejunum of the small intestine."
What are the complications of distal gastrectomy?,"'Complications of the antrectomy include' Leakage from the newly connected area Infection Bleeding  Blood clots or edema in the newly connected site Recurring ulcer disease Inflammation in the pancreas Dumping syndrome: When the small intestine has to digest a large amount of food at once, it can lead to nausea, diarrhea or vomiting. Gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach) Increasing blood sugar level Fast heart rate Feeling lethargic Confusion"
What is Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome'' is a type of ''genetic disorder'' in which a person has an extra chromosome (rod-like structures that contain genes) inside the cells. The syndrome is named after the English physician John Langdon Down who provided the first accurate description of this condition. ''Down syndrome'' is the most common chromosomal condition affecting approximately one in every 700 ''babies'' born in the United States. Around 6,000 babies are born with Down syndrome each year in the United States.''Each cell in the ''human body'' has a structure called a nucleus in which the genes are present. The genes are arranged in certain rod-like structures called chromosomes. They can be described as small “packages” of genes in the body. They control the ''inherited'' traits such as how a baby develops inside the womb and how the baby’s body functions as it grows in the womb and after birth. Normally, each cell contains 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs. In the case of a baby with Down syndrome, there is an extra copy of one of these chromosomes, that is, chromosome 21. This condition where instead of two chromosomes three are present is called trisomy, or ''trisomy 21'',\xa0 in the case of Down syndrome.\xa0''The presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 changes how the baby’s body and brain develop in Down syndrome. This may cause some physical and mental abnormalities such as low intelligence quotient (IQ), poor muscle tone, ''short stature'', an upward slant to the eyes and a single deep crease across the center of the palm. Each person with Down syndrome, however, is a unique individual and may have these characteristics to a different extent or not at all.' "
What are the symptoms of Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome poses mental and physical challenges for the affected individual. Although individuals with this condition may look or act similarly, each has different abilities. A person with Down syndrome generally has an intelligence quotient (IQ), which is a measure of intelligence, in the mild-to-moderate low range. Children with this condition are slower to speak than other children.''Some of the common physical ''signs of Down syndrome'' include' Flattened face, especially the bridge of the nose Almond-shaped eyes slanting upward Short neck Small ears Protruding tongue where the tongue  tends to stick out of the mouth Small hands and feet Single palmar crease, which isa line across the palm Broad and short hands with small pinky fingers that may curve toward the thumb Low muscle tone or loose joints Shorter stature for their age Tiny white spots on the iris, the colored part of the eye"
Is Down syndrome curable?,"'Down syndrome is not curable. It is a lifelong condition. Supportive therapy early in life can often help babies and children with Down syndrome to improve their physical and mental abilities. Early screening of babies with Down syndrome can also help in managing associated conditions such as ''heart'' defects and ''hearing'' problems. Supportive therapy helps children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. The therapy includes speech, occupational and physical therapy besides extra help and support in school.\xa0' "
What is elbow arthrocentesis?,"'Arthrocentesis'' is a procedure to remove fluid from a joint (synovial fluid) using a sterile needle and syringe. ''Your doctor may perform this procedure if your joint has a limited range of motion because of ''pain'' and swelling. Arthrocentesis, when properly performed, may alleviate pressure and relieve ''joint pain''.\xa0 ''Elbow arthrocentesis ''is a minor procedure that involves removing the fluid (synovial fluid) from the elbow joint ''cavity'' through a needle (aspiration) The aspirated fluid is then sent to a lab for further analysis. This aspirated fluid helps to diagnose the cause of elbow swelling and underlying diseases.' "
What conditions are treated using elbow arthrocentesis?,'Elbow arthrocentesis is usually recommended in patients who have:' Severe injury Hemarthrosis (Blood collection in joints) Septic arthritis (Infection of elbow joints) Excessive joint fluid collection (inflamed synovial fluid and synovial fluid analysis for diagnosis) Swelling of the elbow joint (Gout or rheumatologic disorders)
Which patients are not recommended for elbow arthrocentesis?,"'Elbow arthrocentesis is not suitable for the following conditions:' Severe skin infection (Cellulitis and known cases of bacteremia) Overlying skin lesions (dermatitis or psoriasis) Bleeding disorders Patients who are on anticoagulation medication (heparin, aspirin)"
What is the recovery period after elbow arthrocentesis?,"'Patients are usually discharged on the same day after the procedure. Local anesthetics, such as ''lidocaine'', typically wear off within two to four hours, so patients may feel an increasing ''pain'' shortly after the procedure.\xa0''Doctors usually give painkillers and anti-inflammatory medications for three days. It is common to have mild soreness for a day or two after the procedure. The doctor may recommend periodically icing the joint and wrapping it with a bandage to prevent swelling.''Patients usually recover well after the third day of the procedure.\xa0' "
What happens during elbow arthrocentesis?,"'Elbow arthrocentesis is usually done under local anesthesia.\xa0' The skin around the puncture site is cleaned with an iodine solution. Once anesthetized (numbed), a 1.5-inch-long needle with an 18-22 gauge is attached to a 5- to 10-mL syringe is advanced into the joint space with aseptic precautions. The needle is simultaneously retracted to observe the blood return. Once the joint space is accessed, the synovial fluid, blood, or infectious material is aspirated. With the needle held in place, multiple syringes may be used to aspirate all the contents of the joint. Occasionally, glucocorticoid may be injected before withdrawing the needle from the joint space to prevent the relapse of swelling. The needle is withdrawn and the bandage is applied at the area. The collected fluid is then sent to a lab for further analysis. The procedure is usually completed within an hour."
What are the advantages of elbow arthrocentesis?,"'Besides relieving pain and improving joint movement, arthrocentesis is a valuable procedure to determine the etiology of joint effusion, including infection, inflammation, or other factors. This helps the doctors to diagnose and treat the patients accordingly.' "
What are the possible risks during elbow arthrocentesis?,"'The possible risks following elbow arthrocentesis include:' Bleeding Swelling Joint infection Negative reaction to anesthesia (headache, nausea, and drowsiness) Infection at the needle entry site"
Is elbow arthrocentesis painful?,"'Patients undergoing elbow arthrocentesis experience mild pain after the anesthesia wears off. The doctor may prescribe painkillers for reducing the pain and making the patient more comfortable.''Apart from painkillers, doctors recommended anti-inflammatory medicines and antibiotics as a precautionary measure after the procedure.' "
What is electrocautery?,"'Electrocautery or thermal cautery is a procedure that uses heat from an electric current (direct or alternating current) to destroy abnormal cell mass, such as a tumor or other lesion. It is often used to achieve hemostasis (control bleeding during surgery) or after an injury. The electrode is placed on or near the tissue to be treated and the heat generated from the tip of the electrode can be used to ''burn'' or destroy the target tissue.''Electrocautery is a safe procedure. It does not involve passing the current through the patient. Hence, it can be safely used in patients with implanted electrical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, implantable ''cardioverter''-defibrillators, and deep-brain stimulators.''Electrocautery is not synonymous with electrosurgery because electrosurgery involves the passage of high frequency alternating electrical current through the patient’s body to achieve varying degrees of tissue destruction.\xa0' "
What are the complications of electrocautery?,"'Like every procedure, the electrocautery bears some risks to the patient and the operating doctor. These include:' Burns: Electrocautery bears the risk of fire or explosion if flammable materials, such as alcohol, oxygen, and bowel gases, are near the treatment site. Spread of infections: Infection can spread via the treatment electrode, surgical smoke, and aerosolized blood microdroplets. There are reports of Staphylococcus (bacteria), Hepatitis B virus, and human papillomavirus spreading due to electrocautery. During electrocautery, aerosolized blood droplets can be propelled up to 30 cm and can be infectious if inhaled. Surgical smoke generated during the procedure can spread viruses and bacteria. The smoke also carries hazardous chemicals and cancer-causing substances (carcinogens). The risk of infection can be lowered by using a smoke-evacuation system, along with facial masks, protective eyewear, and surgical gloves. Disposable or sterilized electrodes also help to prevent the spread of infections"
What does electrosurgery mean?,"'Electrosurgery is a procedure that uses electric current at various voltages (200 to 10,000 V) through the skin to generate heat. It may be used to stop bleeding (hemostasis) or destroying abnormal skin growths. Electrosurgery requires a power supply and a handpiece with one or more electrodes. A switch on the handpiece or a footswitch controls the device.''Electrosurgery includes various modalities that use electricity to cause thermal destruction of tissue through ''dehydration'', coagulation, or vaporization.\xa0High-frequency electrosurgery and electrocautery are the two most commonly used types of electrosurgery.''Electrocautery or thermocautery differs from the other types of electrosurgery since it does not involve passing the current through the patient. Hence, it can be safely used in patients with implanted electrical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers, implantable ''cardioverter''-defibrillators, and deep-brain stimulators.''Electrosurgery includes different modalities:' Electrofulguration (acts by generating sparks) Electrodesiccation (acts by causing dehydration of superficial tissue) Electrocoagulation (acts by causing bleeding blood vessels to clot) Electrosection (involves cutting through tissue) Thermocautery (electric current is passed through a resistant metal wire electrode, generating heat. The electrode is placed on or near the tissue to be treated) Radiofrequency devices (very high frequency, more than 1,500 kHz, is used for cutting)"
What are the risks of electrosurgery?,"'The risks associated with electrosurgery can affect both the patient and healthcare professionals. They include:' Electric shock: It can be minimized using the earthing of indifferent electrodes. The surgeon should wear plastic surgical gloves to prevent an electric shock. Electric/thermal burns: Electrosurgery bears the risk of fire or explosion if flammable materials, such as alcohol, oxygen, and bowel gases, are near the treatment site. Burns can be minimized by various measures, such as the use of nonflammable cleansers like chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine, and making sure that the person being treated is not in contact with metal objects, and ensuring that the electrode is not placed over a bony prominence, scar tissue, or implanted metal. Spread of infection and production of toxic gases: Infection can spread via the treatment electrode, surgical smoke, and aerosolized blood microdroplets. Aerosolized blood droplets can be propelled up to 30 cm and can be infectious if inhaled. Surgical smoke generated during the procedure can spread viruses and bacteria. The smoke also carries hazardous chemicals and cancer-causing substances (carcinogens). The risk of infection can be lowered by using a smoke-evacuation system, along with facial masks, protective eyewear, and surgical gloves. Disposable or sterilized electrodes also help to prevent the spread of infections. Malfunction of cardiac pacemaker and defibrillators: There is a risk of malfunctioning of implanted cardiac devices due to the passage of electric current through the patient’s body."
What is end-tidal capnography?,"'End-tidal capnography or end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) monitoring is a non-invasive technique that measures the partial pressure or maximal concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) at the end of an exhaled breath. The normal values are 5-6% CO2, which is equivalent to 35-45 mmHg. When CO2 diffuses out of the ''lungs'' into the exhaled air, a device called a capnometer measures the partial pressure or maximal concentration of CO2 at the end of ''exhalation'' and depicts it graphically as a capnogram. It provides information on ventilation, perfusion, and metabolism, which is important for ''airway'' management.' "
What are the four phases of the capnogram?,"'Capnogram (measured by the capnometer) is used in airway management to monitor the ''respiration'' levels. Below are the four phases of capnography:' Phase I: It is called the beginning of exhalation or baseline, and there is no carbon dioxide (CO2) present. In this phase, no gas exchange occurs; hence, it is usually called a dead space (air in tubing and bronchus). Phase II: In this phase, CO2 from the lungs reaches the upper airway and mixes with dead space air, which causes a rapid increase in CO2. Carbon is detected using capnogram in exhaled air. It is also called an ascending phase or early exhalation. Phase III: In this phase, there is CO2 recorded uniformly in the nose/mouth and lungs. Phase IV: It is called an end-tidal phase. It shows the start of inspiration. Normal end-tidal CO2 values are 35-45 mmHg. This phase is also called a descending phase because oxygen fills when inhalation begins and CO2 concentration decreases."
When is end-tidal capnography recommended?,"'Usually, end-tidal capnography is used by emergency physicians and paramedics to determine the respiration of the patient. End-tidal capnography can also be used in the following settings:' General anesthesia administration Procedural sedation, including sedation with monitored anesthesia care Analysis of ventilation (e.g., in the intensive care unit [ICU]) Monitoring patients with heart and breathing diseases Sleep studies for patients having sleep apnea (breathing problem during sleeping) Monitoring the position of an endotracheal tube (ETT) or a blind insertion airway device."
In which conditions end-tidal capnography readings are abnormal?,'Patients with below conditions have abnormal end-tidal capnography readings:' Abnormally high body temperature Shivering Severe infection conditions like sepsis Endocrine disease Slow breathing patients Low heart rate patients Blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism)
Is capnography really useful?,"'Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood are incredibly important for proper oxygenation and metabolism, that’s why capnography is very useful. An irregular amount of CO2 in a patient’s breath and the degree of that irregularity can tell healthcare providers a great deal about the condition and treatment required. It can inform you about the ''human body''’s functions in an emergency situation, and it can often do so before any other measurement. Because its utility expands beyond just hospitals into pre-hospital emergency settings, its advantages become increasingly clear, and it becomes easier to consider capnography as a valuable tool that it is for emergency medical services. It helps paramedics to help critically ill patient’s condition by giving readings during chest compressions and breathing assessments.' "
What is endometrial ablation?,"'Endometrial ablation involves surgical removal (ablation) of the lining of the uterus (''endometrium'') to stop or diminish heavy bleeding, bleeding between ''menstruation'', or periods that last for a long time. It does not stop heavy bleeding completely but reduces it to normal or lighter levels. Endometrial ablation is useful in women who do not plan to have children in the future.''Usually, the physician inserts small tools through the vagina to reach the uterus and performs ablation; hence, this procedure doesn’t require incisions, unlike surgeries.' "
How is endometrial ablation performed?,"'Endometrial ablation involves several techniques, which include:''In some cases, the physician uses a tool called a hysteroscope to examine the uterus. The hysteroscope has a camera attached to it.' Electrocautery: The physician uses an electric current that travels through a wire loop or rollerball to destroy the lining of the uterus. This method isn’t as commonly used as others. Hydrothermal: Heated fluid is pumped into the uterus to destroy the endometrial lining. Balloon therapy: A thin tube or catheter with an attached balloon is passed through the vagina to reach the uterus. The physician fills the catheter with fluids and heats it. The heated fluids destroy the lining. Radiofrequency ablation (high-energy radio waves): The physician inserts an electrical mesh into the uterus and expands it. The physician sends strong radio waves that ultimately get converted to electrical current to destroy the lining. Cryoablation: The physician uses a probe with a very cold temperature to freeze the lining. Microwave ablation: The physician sends microwave energy through a thin probe to destroy the lining."
What are the complications of endometrial ablation?,'The potential complications of endometrial ablation include:''Call the doctor if you experience' Bleeding Infection Rupturing of the uterine wall Overloading of fluid into the bloodstream Strong-smelling discharge from the vagina. Fever. Chills. Intense cramping or stomach pain. Trouble peeing. Bleeding that doesn’t stop two days after ablation.
What is endoscopic brow lift surgery?,"'A brow lift is an aesthetic surgical procedure to correct the loss of soft tissue elasticity in the upper third of the face. Excess sagging skin around the forehead causing drooping (''ptosis'') of the brows and wrinkling of the forehead is removed by repositioning the underlying muscle and tissue. It creates a more refreshed, youthful appearance in the upper third area of the face. It can also be combined with a ''facelift''. A brow lift is usually performed by a ''plastic surgeon''.''Endoscopy''\xa0is the insertion through a surgical incision of a flexible tube with a lighted camera and surgical instruments. The endoscope is now used in a variety of reconstructive and cosmetic surgical procedures. Endoscopic brow lift surgery has gained widespread acceptance, is minimally invasive, and heals faster than traditional brow lift surgery.' "
Why do people seek endoscopic brow lift surgery?,"'Aesthetically, the face is divided into three equal parts, of which the forehead (from the top of the eyebrow to the anterior hairline) occupies the upper third. In males this area averages 7 cm and in females it averages 5 cm.''The male eyebrow is less arched than the female eyebrow. The top of the eyebrow lies approximately 2.5 cm from the mid pupil.\xa0 With ''aging'', these parameters may shift. A lesser distance denotes eyebrow drooping (ptosis).''Loss of forehead skin elasticity from genetics, sun damage, and gravity causes eyebrow drooping, with resultant upper ''eyelid'' drooping and dissatisfaction with the appearance.''Aging'' causes depletion of the subcutaneous fat. This leads to forehead wrinkling, the direction of which depends upon the underlying muscle.' "
Why is endoscopic brow lift surgery done?," Aged appearance: Patients may worry they have a tired, surprised, worried, or an annoyed look, appearing older than their actual age Eyebrow drooping: Patients may feel an uncomfortable weight of tissue on their eyes Forehead wrinkling Eyebrow elevation Improve eyebrow symmetry Change eyebrow shape Decrease the function of muscles causing brow wrinkling"
When should endoscopic brow lift surgery be avoided?,'Endoscopic brow lift surgery should be avoided with:' Conditions causing dry eyes Excessive brow elevation after upper eyelid surgery A tendency for keloids or thick scarring Psychological instability Unrealistic cosmetic expectations Poor general health and systemic conditions
What happens during the endoscopic brow lift procedure?," Routine blood and radiological investigations will be done. Patients may be advised to shampoo their hair with antibacterial soap/shampoo the night before or morning of surgery. Hair does not need to be shaved. An endoscopic brow lift is performed under general anesthesia or with intravenous (IV) sedation and local anesthesia. Multiple small incisions are made just behind the hairline (most surgeons make 3- to 5-cm incisions), through which the endoscope and instruments are inserted. Brow tissue is gently released and elevated. Excess tissue is removed. The muscles are elevated, pulled up and anchored to the bone using anchors made of titanium which look like small screws of 2 mm width. They may be temporary or permanent and do not cause permanent damage. The incisions are sutured and dressed. A small surgical drain may be inserted — a clear tube is inserted through a small incision below the main incision. Post-operative pain can be managed with painkillers. Antibiotics may be necessary. Patients are advised to rest with their head elevated for two weeks. Patients are usually discharged the same day or 24 hours after surgery. The drain may be removed after 24 hours. The dressing may be removed after 48 hours. Patients can shower and wash their hair after 48 hours, using mild shampoos prescribed by the surgeon. The surgeon may prescribe medicated ointments to apply to the wounds. Patients should not use any hair products for at least seven days. Depending on the type of suture used, the surgeon will set a removal appointment. Temporary bruising and swelling around the forehead and eyes may occur. Wound healing takes approximately two weeks. The scars generally heal well and are barely visible. In the first few weeks after surgery, the brows may appear to be excessively elevated, but this will settle with time. The final brow results may take four to six months to appreciate. Patients can return to work, resume all usual activities including sports and exercise after 10 to 14 days."
How long do endoscopic brow lift results last?,"'The results last for an average of five to seven years. Traditional brow lift surgeries last longer, around 10 to 15 years.' "
What are the complications of endoscopic brow lift surgery?,'Complications from this procedure are rare. They include:' Swelling and bruising Hematoma (collection of blood) Seroma (collection of fluid) Mispositioning or change in shape of the brow Recurrence of brow ptosis Forehead contour irregularities Alopecia (loss of hair) Scarring Numbness around surgical site (usually temporary) Temporary or permanent paralysis of the forehead muscle Injury to the eyes  
What are the alternatives to endoscopic brow lift surgery?,"'Botox'' (botulinum toxin) injections may be used, but the results are temporary and must be repeated every four to six months. This is less expensive and less invasive, and it does help to decrease forehead wrinkling. The results of surgery are longer-lasting and can be more dramatic.' "
What is endotracheal intubation?,"'Endotracheal intubation'' is the procedure to insert a flexible tube into the ''airway'' (trachea) through the mouth or the nose. The endotracheal tube is most often placed through the mouth, especially in emergencies. Endotracheal ''intubation'' is usually performed prior to surgeries with general anesthesia or in patients under critical care.' "
Is sedation required for intubation?,"'Intubation procedure can cause discomfort, ''stress'' and ''pain'' for patients, so sedation and painkillers (analgesics) are usually mandatory during intubation. A rapid-acting, short-duration sedative is administered along with other medications to block ''pain'' and reflex actions like gagging.' "
What anatomical landmark is used for tracheal intubation?,"'The tip of the ''epiglottis'' is the anatomical landmark doctors look for when performing tracheal intubation. The epiglottis is a flap of cartilage located below the root of the tongue, on top of the voice box (larynx). The epiglottis covers the tracheal opening while swallowing food or drink to prevent them from getting into the trachea. The epiglottis remains open at other times to allow ''breathing''.' "
What is endotracheal intubation used for?,"'Endotracheal intubation may be performed for the following reasons:' Keeping the airway open and preventing inhalation of gastric contents (aspiration) during surgeries with general anesthesia Providing a pure oxygen supply to the lungs (as opposed to the mixed-gas ratios in the general atmosphere) Administration of anesthesia and certain medications Clearing blockage in the airway Supporting breathing in critically ill patients who are unable to breathe or have difficulty breathing because of illness or trauma Many people with severe COVID-19, the respiratory conditions caused by the pandemic coronavirus, must spend weeks intubated and receiving oxygen via ventilation machines."
How is endotracheal intubation done?,"'Endotracheal intubation before a planned surgery may be performed with sedation alone. Patients should fast in preparation to reduce the risk of ''vomiting'' and aspiration.\xa0''Mechanical ventilation with an oxygen mask (bag-valve-mask) is started before anesthesia and ''paralysis'' are induced.''When endotracheal intubation is performed in an emergency, preparatory fasting is not possible. A protocol known as rapid sequence intubation is followed, which induces unconsciousness and paralysis rapidly.''Bag-valve-mask ventilation is avoided after induction of anesthesia and paralysis, in order to prevent aspiration and stomach insufflation (filling with air).\xa0''Mechanical ventilation starts only after completion of the intubation procedure.''Rapid sequence intubation is not performed if the patient is already unconscious or not breathing. The patient is intubated with immediate bag-valve-mask ventilation.''An anesthetic team performs the tracheal intubation, coordinating with the physician/surgeon and nurse. The intubation steps are as follows:''Rapid sequence intubation involves administration of specific medications in three stages before the tube insertion.''Preoxygenation''Preoxygenation is performed to maximize the oxygen saturation levels in the blood and create an oxygen reservoir in the lungs. Preoxygenation provides continued oxygen for circulation for the duration of intubation procedure, when the patient remains in a state of anesthetic paralysis and cannot breathe for themselves.''Preoxygenation is accomplished by delivering high-flow oxygen for three minutes using a face mask. Nitrogen constitutes about 80% of ambient air in the general atmosphere. Preoxygenation replaces the nitrogen in the lung’s air sacs (alveoli) with oxygen.''Preoxygenation allows eight minutes to complete tracheal intubation before the oxygen blood saturation starts to fall below 90%. Oxygen desaturation may be more rapid in children and acutely ill patients with respiratory problems. If oxygen saturation falls below 90%, start bag-valve-mask ventilation.''Premedication''Premedication involves preventive administration of medications two to three minutes prior to intubation to prevent pain (analgesia) and control physiological responses induced by the insertion of the laryngoscope into the airway.''Intubation can induce:''The induction phase of intubation involves the administration of an anesthetic agent. A rapid-acting, short duration sedative is administered intravenously to induce unconsciousness and unresponsiveness.''The final step before tracheal intubation is to induce temporary paralysis in the muscles to prevent them from contracting and hindering the procedure. After the induction of anesthesia, a paralytic agent is used to relax the skeletal muscles.''The motor function of the muscles is controlled by the brain through transmission of signals through the nerves. The nerve endings, where they join with the muscles, release a neurotransmitter known as acetylcholine which activates the muscles.''Paralytic medications are neuromuscular blockade agents which interfere with acetylcholine’s activity and prevent muscular activation. Paralytic agents prevent gagging and coughing reflexes during intubation.' Administer anesthesia and muscle relaxant. Apply pressure on the cricoid cartilage located in the throat to block the esophagus and prevent the tube’s entry into it. Use a laryngoscope to see the epiglottis and the opening to the trachea. Gently insert the tube into the trachea and secure the tube in place. Pressor response: Pressor response is the sympathetic nervous system’s reflex to the insertion of laryngoscope. The laryngoscope’s edge stimulates the pharynx, larynx and the trachea, inducing stress response and release of stress hormones, which leads to elevation of blood pressure and heart rate. The pressor effects may last for about five minutes, and may be unsafe for critically ill patients. Intracranial hypertension: Intracranial hypertension is elevated pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain, which can result in cerebral edema or reduced blood supply (ischemia) to the brain. In addition to the pressor response the laryngoscope causes reflexes such as coughing and gagging, which together can lead to transient intracranial hypertension. "
What is esophagoscopy?,'Esophagoscopy'' is a procedure to examine the inner lining (mucosa) of the ''esophagus''. During ''endoscopy'' a flexible tube with a lighted camera (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth and throat along the length of the esophagus.' 
What are the types of esophagoscopy?,"'Transnasal and capsule esophagoscopy are useful tools for diagnosis, but not for performing any surgical treatment or taking biopsy samples.' Rigid esophagoscopy: The doctor inserts a rigid tube through the mouth into the cervical esophagus. An eyepiece and light in the tube help the doctor visualize the esophagus. A rigid esophagoscopy was primarily performed to diagnose head and neck cancers and for removal of foreign bodies from the cervical esophagus. This procedure requires general anesthesia and typically not in use now. Flexible esophagoscopy: This is the most common procedure, using a flexible tube that can go through the entire upper gastrointestinal tract. The micro-camera transmits high-resolution images, and there is less risk of esophagus laceration compared with a rigid esophagoscopy. It may be performed with mild or no sedation. Transnasal esophagoscopy: This procedure is performed with an ultrathin tube inserted nasally into the esophagus. This procedure does not require sedation and is easily tolerated by most people.  Esophageal capsule endoscopy: The patient swallows a capsule-sized camera which transmits high-resolution images as it passes through the esophagus."
What is the difference between esophagoscopy and endoscopy?,"'Esophagoscopy is a type of endoscopy in which only the esophageal mucosa is examined. Esophagoscopy, only examining the esophagus, is not often performed alone; generally the entire upper gastrointestinal tract is examined.''Other types of endoscopy are' Gastroscopy, which examines the esophagus and the stomach Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which examines the esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine (duodenum) Enteroscopy, which reaches further into the small intestine"
What Is Esophagoscopy Used for?,"'An esophagoscopy may be performed as a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. This procedure may also be performed as part of a full upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.''The doctor may recommend esophagoscopy for patients with symptoms such as' Persistent pain in the upper abdomen Chronic heartburn Chronic cough Chest pain (not of heart origin) Difficulty or pain swallowing Feeling full with small quantity of food Nausea and vomiting Vomiting blood Anemia and weight loss Feeling of food stuck in the throat An esophagoscopy may be performed for Removal of food or foreign object stuck in the esophagus Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Screening and surveillance for diseases, such as Barrett’s esophagus Treatment of swollen veins (varices) in the esophagus Dilation of strictures in the esophagus Screening for neck, throat or head cancer Evaluation after abnormal imaging studies"
How is an esophagoscopy performed?,"'An esophagoscopy is usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' as an outpatient procedure. The procedure may take about 20 to 30 minutes.' The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests. The patient must not eat or drink 8 hours before the procedure. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications and inform them of any allergies. The patient lies on their left side. The doctor administers pain medication and light sedation, and numbs the patient’s mouth and throat with a topical anesthetic. The doctor may place a mouthguard between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting the scope or their own tongue. The doctor may use air pressure to inflate the esophagus. The doctor gently inserts the esophagoscope through the mouth and passes it slowly through the esophagus. The doctor examines the esophagus on a monitor and may take a biopsy sample for testing or perform any treatment as needed. The esophagoscope is slowly withdrawn. The patient is monitored in the recovery room and will be able to leave in about an hour. The patient must not eat or drink till they are able to swallow without gagging."
What are the side effects of esophagoscopy?,'Esophagoscopy may cause side effects such as''These side effects usually resolve on their own within 24 hours.' sore throat gas and bloating cramping
What are the risks and complications of an esophagoscopy?,'Esophagoscopy is a fairly routine and safe procedure for most people. Complications may include:' Perforation of the esophagus Bleeding Infection Breathing problems Drop in blood pressure and heart rate Excessive sweating Spasm of the throat Allergic reaction to the medication
What is excisional surgery?,"'Excisional surgery or shave excision is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of growths, such as ''moles'', masses and tumors, from the skin along with the healthy tissues around the ''tumor''. The doctor uses this technique to treat ''skin cancers'', where they use a scalpel or razor to remove the tumor. After removing the tumors, the doctor may send the specimen to the laboratory for examination.' "
When is a surgical excision of skin cancer recommended?,"'Surgical excision is recommended in the treatment of various types of skin ''cancers'', which include' Low-risk basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma Patients with thin melanoma High-risk basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma Merkel cell carcinoma Kaposi sarcoma"
What can I expect during a surgical excision?,"'Before the procedure''During the procedure''After the procedure' Let your doctor know your medical and medication history. Mention any conditions that may interfere with wound healing, such as diabetes, smoking and heart disease. Mention any drug allergies or substance allergies to the doctor. You may have to undergo a physical examination before the surgery. Blood thinning agents such as Coumadin (warfarin) should be stopped with a doctor’s permission. Exceptionally sick patients should be operated on where specialized emergency services are available. The physician may recommend antibiotics before the surgery. The doctor may clean the surgery site with an antiseptic solution, such as povidone-iodine. The doctor may inject a numbing solution or local anesthetics to numb the surgical site.  Next, the physician uses a sharp razor or scalpel to make an elliptical incision covering the tumor and several millimeters of surrounding healthy tissue. After making an elliptical incision, the physician removes the tumor with the help of a scalpel and forceps. The physician may perform cauterization to close the blood vessels. It is a heated probe that burns and seals the blood vessels to stop bleeding. Finally, the physician closes the wound with sutures. They may also perform some electrosurgical feathering using an electrode to shape the edges of the wound. Feathering helps to remove the remnants of tumors and minimizes scars. After closing the wound, the physician will apply a chemical such as aluminum chloride hexahydrate to stop bleeding. After cleaning the surgical site, the physician applies antibiotics. The physician covers the site with a sterile bandage to prevent the risk of infection. Keep the excision site dry for 24 hours. Protect the wound site from bright sunlight to prevent conspicuous scar formation. You may have a burning sensation around the wound. Apply antibiotics ointment on the wound to promote healing. You should remove the dressing in 24 to 48 hours. You should avoid laborious activity for at least two weeks after the surgery. You should refrain from smoking for at least a week as it impairs wound healing. Painkillers such as Tylenol may be given, if necessary. You may need to follow-up with the doctor for one to two weeks.  You may notice the following complicationsExcessive scarringSigns of infection such as fever and chillsDrainage from the wound siteNerve damageBleedingSwellingPain and discomfortIncision reopening Excessive scarring Signs of infection such as fever and chills Drainage from the wound site Nerve damage Bleeding Swelling Pain and discomfort Incision reopening"
What is facial fat grafting?,"'Facial fat grafting, also known as facial fat transfer or lipofilling, is a cosmetic procedure. In facial fat grafting, a surgeon transfers fat from thighs and hips to facial areas. The transferred fat tissue has a good blood supply with high regenerative capacity making it ideal for this grafting procedure.''Patients dissatisfied with various age-related facial changes may seek this technique to restore their youthful appearance.' "
Why is facial fat grafting done?,"'Facial fat grafting is usually a cosmetic procedure to enhance and rejuvenate the face. It can also be used in the following conditions:''Patients with ''diabetes'' and other diseases that generally delay ''wound'' healing are not good candidates for facial fat grafting.' For treating scars For treating age-related degeneration of facial muscles For reducing wrinkle lines For enhancing lip volume To treat areas of the face not successfully covered by other surgeries For treating undesirable facial changes caused by cigarette smoking, post-trauma scars, and acne"
How is a facial fat grafting procedure performed?," Discuss with your surgeon the areas to be treated, details of the procedure, post-surgery care, goals and possible adverse effects List your medical and medication history for the surgeon Your surgeon might ask for ‘before’ photographs of your face for assessment purposes Don’t wear any make-up or jewelry on the day of surgery The areas to be treated will be marked. The site from which the fats are taken (harvest site), usually thighs and hips, and the site, where it is injected (recipient site) are sterilized and draped. Local anesthesia numbs the harvest site. Through an incision, a long needle syringe is inserted to extract the fat. After extraction of fat, the incision is closed. The fat extracted is washed free of oil and blood. It is then purified and injected slowly into the recipient sites in the face."
What is the recovery time for facial fat grafting?,"'The cosmetic benefits of facial fat grafting don’t last as long as some more invasive cosmetic facial surgeries. Nevertheless, it is the most popular facial rejuvenation technique.' Avoid massaging the face, to prevent the migration of fat from the treated areas. This will ensure the longevity of treatment. Compression dressings are applied to prevent migration. Some amount of edema and bruising may be visible during the first week. You will be asked to follow-up for six to eight weeks. If you need to repeat the procedure, a three-month waiting period is mandatory. If you notice undercorrection or overcorrection compared to the desired correction, notify the physician. If you experience bleeding, edema for more than two weeks, infections, and damage to any other site, immediately contact the physician."
What is a fascia?,"'The fascia is the fibrous connective tissue that is present throughout the entire body. There are three main types of fascia:' Superficial fascia (Camper’s fascia): It is associated with the skin and is a thick fatty layer. It is divided into top and bottom layers. Deep fascia (Scarpa’s fascia): It is associated with the muscles, bones, nerves, and blood vessels. Visceral fascia: It envelops various organs and glands."
What is fascial closure?,"'Fascial closure is the closure of the inner layers of the abdomen after a major surgery involving an incision on the abdomen. Fascial closure prevents ''hernia'' formation.''The fascial closure technique is of two types:' Layered closure: It is the closure of each fascial layer individually. The primary advantage of this technique is that multiple suture strands exist so that even if a suture breaks, the others remain intact by the remaining sutures. Mass closure: It is continuous fascial closure with a single suture. This prevents tissue strangulation due to the even distribution of tension across the entire length of the suture. Fascial closure is usually indicated for surgery on the abdominal cavity and trauma."
How is fascial closure performed?,"'There are three steps to performing a fascial closure, which includes fascial closure, subcutaneous closure, and skin closure.''Nonabsorbable sutures are used in fascial closure. The surgeon pulls apart the fascial layer with two clamps. A looped synthetic material known as polydioxanone (PDS) is used for suturing. The surgeon passes the PDS through the tip of the fascia.\xa0''Next, the surgeon passes the needle through the loop to tie the knot. The surgeon then ''stitches'' the incision. Sufficient tension should be applied without strangulating the tissues.''Once the center of the incision is reached, the surgeon starts to stitch the opposite end of the incision. When the two ends are at a distance of 1 cm from each other, the surgeon ties 6-10 knots to secure the sutures.''After closing the fascial layer, the surgeon closes the subcutaneous layer of the abdominal wall. Because the subcutaneous layer has a limited blood supply, there is an increased risk of infection to this layer.''The purpose of subcutaneous closure is to prevent fluid accumulation (''seroma''). The surgeon may stitch the incision in a continuous or interrupted fashion.''As a final step, the surgeon closes the skin either using a stapler or sutures. The surgeon may also use adhesive tapes or synthetic glues to cover the ''wound''.' "
What to expect after the surgery?,"'The surgeon removes the suture or staples 7-14 days after wound closure.\xa0''The patient should avoid lifting, pushing, or pulling anything heavier than 4.5 kg.''The patient should avoid straining too much for four to six weeks after wound closure.''Complications of fascial closure include the following:''Call the surgeon immediately if the following conditions persist:' Wound infection Opening of the stitches Uncontrolled pain Redness around the site Bulging at the incision Pus drainage Long-lasting nausea or vomiting Bleeding from the incision site"
How long does it take for abdominal fascia to heal?,"'Abdominal fascia generally takes about one to two months to heal completely. The healing completely depends upon successful wound closure. Hence, it is necessary to be vigilant from the start of the closure technique.' "
What is a fasciocutaneous flap?,"'Fasciocutaneous flaps are tissue flaps, which consist of skin and underlying tissues including fascia (a collagen-rich lining tissue). Fasciocutaneous flaps are used to provide coverage to bones and tendons in surgery when skin graft coverage is insufficient.''Advantages of using fasciocutaneous flaps over other flaps:''Disadvantages of fasciocutaneous flaps include that they are less resistant to infections compared to muscle flaps.' Fasciocutaneous flaps are less bulky so they are used for most of the surgery. There is no functional loss with fasciocutaneous flaps, unlike muscle flaps. They are quick and reliable in healthy patients. It is easy to design and construct large fasciocutaneous flaps that are safe due to good circulation. The operating time is relatively short with an experienced surgeon, and no extra equipment is needed."
What are the types of fasciocutaneous flaps?,"'Cosmetic surgeons classify fasciocutaneous flaps based on blood vessels:' Type A: Multiple perforations extending throughout the length. Type B: A single perforation which is moderate in size. Type C: Multiple, small perforations. Type D: Similar to Type C, but also involves a portion of an adjoining muscle and bone."
What are the different kinds of fasciocutaneous flaps?,"'Based on where fasciocutaneous flaps are harvested, there are different flaps used:' Fasciocutaneous flaps of the head, neck and trunk (torso)Temporoparietal flap: It is situated above the membrane covering the temporalis muscle (a muscle on the side of the head). It is used to cover defects of the ear and the upper portion of the face.Scapular and parascapular flaps: Taken from the shoulder. They are used to cover hand wounds. Temporoparietal flap: It is situated above the membrane covering the temporalis muscle (a muscle on the side of the head). It is used to cover defects of the ear and the upper portion of the face. Scapular and parascapular flaps: Taken from the shoulder. They are used to cover hand wounds. Fasciocutaneous flaps of the legs:Groin flap: Taken from the pubic area; useful in covering upper leg defects.Lateral and medial thigh flap: Taken from the sides of the thigh.Anterolateral thigh flap: Taken from the front of the thighs.Posterior or gluteal thigh flap: Taken from the back of the thigh or near the biceps.Dorsalis pedis flap: Taken from the upper portion of the feet. Groin flap: Taken from the pubic area; useful in covering upper leg defects. Lateral and medial thigh flap: Taken from the sides of the thigh. Anterolateral thigh flap: Taken from the front of the thighs. Posterior or gluteal thigh flap: Taken from the back of the thigh or near the biceps. Dorsalis pedis flap: Taken from the upper portion of the feet."
What are the complications involved in using fasciocutaneous flaps?,'Complications of fasciocutaneous flaps include:' Numbness on the site where the flaps are placed Infections Complete or partial paralysis
What is a free flap breast reconstruction?,"'Breast ''mastectomy'' is the surgical removal of the breast, usually due to ''breast cancer''. ''Breast reconstruction'' involves rebuilding the shape of the breast. Breast reconstruction is often performed after breast mastectomy. Breast reconstruction with the complete removal of a piece of tissue (flap) from a healthy site to the site of mastectomy is known as free flap breast reconstruction.''The advantages of free flap breast reconstruction are:''The advantages of immediate reconstruction after a mastectomy are:' Flap reconstruction provides a more desirable look and feel Flap reconstruction can be performed immediately after a mastectomy Flap reconstruction has fewer chances of infection Breast sensitivity is not lost Cost-efficient Remarkable improvement in the shape and projection of the reconstructed breast Secondary wounds and scar formation can be prevented"
What are the different free flaps used?,'Free flaps are usually named after the area of the body that the flaps are harvested from. Three different types of free flaps used in breast reconstruction are:''It is usually used in patients who had previously failed breast reconstruction or who are lean and have less ''abdominal fat''.' Gluteal free flap uses the flap from the hips (around the buttocks) for the reconstruction of breasts. Gluteal free flaps are of two types:Superior gluteal free flap: Flap is taken from the upper hip to reconstruct the breast.Inferior gluteal free flap: Flap is taken from the lower hip to reconstruct the breast. Superior gluteal free flap: Flap is taken from the upper hip to reconstruct the breast. Inferior gluteal free flap: Flap is taken from the lower hip to reconstruct the breast. Latissimus dorsi flap: Latissimus dorsi is a muscle present between your shoulder and the armpit at the back. An oval flap is taken from the upper back to reconstruct the breast. Latissimus dorsal flap is considered as a muscle-transfer type of flap because it involves a considerable amount of muscle. This flap type is advised in patients:Who had failed breast reconstructionWho are lean and have less abdominal fat Who had failed breast reconstruction Who are lean and have less abdominal fat Lateral transverse thigh free flap: Flap is taken from the upper thigh to reconstruct the breast. This flap type is advised in patients:Who had failed breast reconstructionWho have deformity following a lump removal or a radiation therapy Who had failed breast reconstruction Who have deformity following a lump removal or a radiation therapy
How is free flap breast reconstruction done?,"'The technique varies in different free flap reconstruction:''Gluteal free flap:''Latissimus dorsi flap:''Lateral transverse thigh free flap:''The surgical cut at the reconstruction site and donor site are closed using ''sutures''.''Post-surgery monitoring is important for a successful free flap breast reconstruction.' A surgical cut is made in the hip/buttock area, to expose the buttock muscle (gluteus maximus) The two buttock muscles (gluteus maximus and gluteus medius) are retracted from each other, exposing the underlying blood vessels The flap is then harvested by including one-third of the muscle The flap is placed on the site of mastectomy A surgical cut is made in the upper back along the brassiere line The flap is raised and moved under the skin of the chest A surgical cut is made from the pelvis to the inferior buttocks to reveal the hip muscle The flap, which is of 6-7 cm wide and 20-25 cm long, is raised and placed at the site of mastectomy"
What are the complications of free flap breast reconstruction?,"'The complications of free flap breast reconstruction are as follows' Partial or complete tissue breakdown or death of flap (5-15%) Seroma (fluid collection, usually in abdominal donor site) Hematoma (bleeding at chest or abdomen) Infection Hernia (noticeable bulge in the abdomen) Abdominal bulge without hernia (5-15%) Deep venous thrombosis (clots in the deep vein of the leg) and/or pulmonary embolus (diffused clots in the lungs) (< 1%) Death (< 1%) Breast sensitivity may be affected"
What is a Hartmann procedure?,"'A Hartmann procedure is a type of surgery that is performed for bowel problems. The most common reasons are bowel ''cancer'' and ''diverticular disease''. Surgery involves removing the affected section of the bowel (colon) and creating an alternative path for the excrement to be passed. Once the affected part of the colon has been removed, the healthy end of the large bowel is brought to the surface of the abdomen to form a ''stoma'' (an opening for the waste). This type of opening is called a ''colostomy'', which could be temporary or permanent. The non-functioning end of the bowel is usually sealed inside the abdomen. This procedure is usually performed during an emergency but can also be part of a planned surgery. The surgery can be performed either\xa0 laparoscopically or as an open surgery depending on the patient’s condition.' "
How is the Hartmann procedure performed?,"'The Hartmann procedure is major surgery and can take about 90 to 180 minutes for the surgeon to complete the procedure.' It is usually done under spinal or general anesthesia. The patient may be monitored throughout the procedure. This operation can be performed in one of two ways, either by laparoscopic method (keyhole surgery) or laparotomy (open procedure). A laparotomy involves making a large cut in the abdominal wall that allows the surgeon to operate on the bowel or intestine. Laparoscopic surgery is completed using a system of scopes inserted through three or four much smaller cuts in the abdomen. During the operation, the surgeon will remove the affected area of the bowel and create a colostomy. A colostomy is the end of the colon brought to the surface and stitched to the skin through a small cut in the abdomen. Fecal matter is then passed through the colostomy and collected in a bag that is fixed to the skin (stoma bag)."
What are the complications of the Hartmann procedure?,"'A Hartmann procedure is a major surgical procedure, which carries the risk of complications.' Anesthesia risks like vomiting or aspiration Bleeding from the wounds or operation site Breakdown of the surgical wounds Chest infection due to aspiration during anesthesia Sepsis due to infection at the site of operation Deep vein thrombosis (clots in the veins of the legs) Pulmonary embolism (if the clot moves, it can travel to the lungs) Damage to the bowel Damage to the tubes that bring urine from the kidneys to the bladder Injury to the urinary bladder (organ that stores urine) Bruising or damage to the nearby organs or nerves, which may affect sexual function"
Is the Hartmann procedure reversible?,"'Yes, the Hartmann procedure is reversible. The procedure is usually dependent on how much colon tube is remaining and the presence of any ''scar tissue''. A short colon tube may lead to bowel management problems post surgery. These management problems can include increased frequency of passing ''stool'', feeling of urgency or difficulty during evacuation. For most people, these symptoms will settle with time, but some may need medication and ''diet'' advice to manage their bowels post reversal.' "
What is the Hartmann reversal procedure?,"'The surgical procedure involves joining the part of the bowel (from which the colostomy is formed) and the rectal remnant together. This can be carried out by open or laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. Usually, the procedure is done under general anesthesia.''The open surgery involves larger cuts over the abdomen and manipulating through the abdominal ''scar'' formed at the time of the initial operation.''Laparoscopic surgery involves minimal abdominal scarring and generally a quicker recovery.''The method used will depend upon the patient and surgeon. The reversal of the Hartmann procedure will allow the patient to pass excrement via their anus.' "
How soon can a patient recover after the Hartmann procedure?,'Most people make a good recovery. It is usual for the bowel to stop working for a few days. The patient may be able to go home after 5 to 10 days. It can take up to 3 months to return to normal activities. Regular ''exercise'' may help the patient to return to normal activities sooner depending on their condition.' 
What are the different types of blood pressure?,"'There are two main types of ''high blood pressure'': primary and secondary high blood pressure.' Primary high blood pressure: Also known as essential high blood pressure, this is the most common type of high blood pressure. Primary high blood pressure does not happen as a result of some underlying medical condition. This type of blood pressure develops over time as one gets older. Secondary high blood pressure: It is caused by another medical condition or due to the use of certain medications. It gets better once the condition is treated or when the medication is stopped."
Who is at risk of high blood pressure?,'People associated with the following risk factors are more likely to get high blood pressure:' Family history of high blood pressure African-American race Male gender Women aged above 55 years Stress Obesity Consumption of a fat-rich and sodium-rich diet Tobacco use Oral contraceptive use Heavy alcohol drinking Physical inactivity Diabetes Tumors in adrenal or pituitary glands Pregnancy Production of excess growth hormone Problems with parathyroid gland Reactions to medicines for other medical problems
How does high blood pressure affect the body?,"'High blood pressure affects the body in the following ways:' It hardens the arteries because the excess pressure in the arteries causes the muscles lining the walls of the artery to thicken, leading to the narrowing of the passage. It increases the workload of the heart causing the heart to enlarge. The bigger heart demands more oxygen-rich blood but is unable to obtain it. As a result, the person may feel weak and tired. It damages the kidney as the blood supply gets affected due to prolonged high blood pressure. It affects the retina of the eye by causing the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) to bleed."
What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?,"'Most of the time, people do not experience any symptoms at all. In some cases, people with high blood pressure experience the following symptoms:' Pounding feeling in the chest or head Lightheadedness Dizziness"
How is high blood pressure treated?,"'Lifestyle changes, regular exercises, and blood pressure medications help to treat high blood pressure. Some of the suggested lifestyle changes are as follows:''Blood pressure medications include the following:' Quit smoking Lose weight Avoid alcohol or at least limit the intake Eat a low-sodium, low-fat diet such as the DASH diet Avoid stress Eat foods rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium such as bananas and milk Regular monitoring of blood pressure after reaching the age of 35 Practice meditation and other stress-relieving exercises Cut down on caffeine Diuretics help the body to eliminate the excess sodium and water ACE inhibitors block the enzyme responsible for increased blood pressure Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other vasodilators help to relax and widen the blood vessels to relieve the pressure."
What is hip arthroscopy?,"'Hip ''arthroscopy'' is a surgical procedure that allows doctors to view the hip joint by inserting a specialized instrument (arthroscope) through a small surgical cut (incision) made on the skin and other soft tissues over the hip joint.\xa0 ''Hip arthroscopy is used to ''diagnose and treat several hip problems'' without the need for a big incision. Although the initial investigations on the procedure began in the early 1930s, it was not until the 1980s that the hip arthroscopy became a mainstream hip treatment.''During the procedure,'' the surgeon inserts a small instrument with a tiny camera, called an arthroscope, into the hip joint. The camera displays the pictures of the inside of the hip joint on a video monitor. The surgeon uses these images to guide miniature surgical instruments for treating certain diseases of the hip joint.\xa0''Because the instruments are thin and the incision is small, hip arthroscopic management results in ''less ''pain'', less ''joint stiffness'', and often a faster recovery'' so that the patient may return to their normal and active lifestyle.' "
Who needs hip arthroscopy?,"'Hip arthroscopy is performed for the management of various conditions related to the hip joint. Your doctor may recommend hip arthroscopy when conservative treatment such as rest, physiotherapy, and oral medications or injections fail to improve your condition.''The indications for hip arthroscopy are as follows:' Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and associated labral tears: This is a disorder in which an extra bone grows in the hip joint; the bony overgrowths are called spurs. They damage the soft tissues of the hip during movement. It may cause labral tears on the labrum (cartilage ring) that follows the outside rim of the hip joint socket Degenerative diseases of the hip joint (e.g., arthritis) Loose bodies in the hip joint: These are fragments of the bone or cartilage that become loose and move around within the joint Dysplasia of the hip joint: It is a condition in which the hip socket is abnormally shallow. Avascular necrosis (death of the bone tissue due to interruption in blood supply) Snapping hip syndromes: They cause a tendon to rub across the outside of the joint and may damage the tendon due to repeated rubbing Synovitis (inflammation of the tissues that surround the joint) Hip joint infection Certain muscle tears around the hip joint"
How successful is hip arthroscopy?,"'Hip arthroscopy generally has ''a success rate of approximately 80%,'' although the individual success rates may vary from case to case. The surgery is safe and successful in providing relief in many people who enjoy full and unrestricted activities after the procedure.\xa0''Lifestyle changes to reduce the impact of activities (e.g., switching from ''running'' to ''swimming'' or ''cycling'') may be necessary for some people. In some cases, however, if the damage is severe, it may not be completely reversed, and the procedure may not be successful.''Complications, although uncommon, include' injury risk, numbness, infections and blood clot formation in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)."
What is muscle hypertrophy?,"'Muscle hypertrophy is an increase in and growth of the muscle size. Skeletal muscle has two fundamental functions:''Muscle hypertrophy can either be achieved through exercise or acquired through genetic, neurologic, or muscular disorders.''In a healthy individual, the muscles are pushed to their limits through an exercise to increase muscle mass and the cross-sectional area. Ultimately, there is an increase in the size of the individual muscle fibers.''There are two ways to achieve muscle hypertrophy:''Differences between myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic muscle hypertrophy are enlisted below:' To contract to generate body movements To provide strength for body posture Myofibrillar: The growth of muscle contraction parts Sarcoplasmic: Increased muscle glycogen storage"
How is muscle hypertrophy achieved?,"'Hypertrophy depends on three primary factors:''The intensity of mechanical tension from weight training is determined by the following factors:''Intense weight training that creates an overload causes muscle damage and inflammatory response, thus releasing various growth factors.''Anaerobic system exercises cause metabolic stress and lactic acid buildup, leading to muscle ''fiber'' degradation. Finally, the body repairs the damaged tissue above and beyond its ability to prevent the damage caused by the same workout. The body repairs the damaged tissue while sleeping; hence, it is necessary to get seven to nine hours of ''sleep'' every day.' Mechanical tension Muscle damage Metabolic stress Intensity of the weight lifted Time under tension (duration of the applied load)"
What are the different techniques to promote hypertrophy?,"'The different techniques to promote muscle growth include:' Increasing the time under tension to yield higher levels of mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue Working to fatigue using drop sets. Fatigue means the muscle is no longer able to work anymore Increasing energy expenditure by doing multi-joint exercises such as the squat, deadlift, or standing shoulder press Alternating workouts between using heavy weights for a few repetitions and lighter weights for more repetitions will help in muscle growth Changing the exercises to use a different bundle of muscle fibers, for example, alternating between dumbbells and barbells Limit the number of cardiorespiratory exercises Get a good night’s sleep for optimal results"
What causes hypokalemia?,"'Some common causes of hypokalemia include:''Certain diseases can be associated with ''low potassium'', such as:' Excessive vomiting Excessive diarrhea  Eating disorders (Anorexia nervosa) where the person eats less to lose weight and this results in severe starvation and dehydration.  Chronic kidney disease causing increased loss of potassium in the urine Certain medications like diuretics (they decrease fluid level in the body and increase urination) used for blood pressure control, antibiotics and chronic use of laxatives Poor nutrition seen in extreme starvation Alcoholism  Diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of acids called ketones in the blood in uncontrolled diabetes) Cushing’s syndrome Gitelman syndrome Liddle syndrome Bartter syndrome Fanconi syndrome Seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, mental retardation, and electrolyte imbalance (SeSAME syndrome)"
What are the signs and symptoms of hypokalaemia?,"'Temporary low potassium levels in the body may usually not present with obvious symptoms. Long term low levels of potassium can produce the following signs and symptoms:' Weakness Fatigue Muscle cramps Constipation (due to non-functioning of electrolytes) Tingling in the fingertips and toe tips Numbness over the body Breathing difficulties because of paralysis of muscles of respiration Mood changes like irritability or drowsiness. Cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm). This may be felt as unconsciousness, feeling giddy or chest pain. This requires immediate medical attention. Constant thirst and the urge to go to bathroom. Severe cases can cause muscle paralysis. This may be a temporary condition reversible on replacing the lost potassium."
How is hypokalemia diagnosed?,'The doctor will obtain a detailed history and perform a clinical assessment. Blood and urine analysis indicate the level of potassium in the body and can confirm the diagnosis of hypokalemia. An ''electrocardiogram'' may be done to rule out heart complications.' 
How is hypokalemia treated?,"'The treatment options include:' Treating the underlying cause. E.g. Dehydration, underlying any kidney condition, hormonal imbalance. Mild dehydration can be corrected by increasing the fluid intake and  Intravenous solution like ringer lactate may be required in case of required in the case of cardiac arrhythmias. Stopping medication that may be causing hypokalaemia with the doctor’s advice. Psychological support to manage alcoholism and eating disorders. Always talk to your doctor before starting any supplement. Accumulation of potassium in the body may be dangerous to health."
What is an intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure?,"'Intradiscal ''electrothermal therapy'' (IDET) or intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty (IDEA),'' is a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of ''low back pain'' caused due to problems with the spinal disc.\xa0''IDET introduces a flexible catheter into the disc under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter is composed of a thermal coil heats the posterior part of the disc, causing contraction of collagen fibers and destruction of the ''pain'' receptors.''Studies have shown that 70% of patients with chronic ''low back pain'' benefit from IDET. Physical function and quality of life outcomes have improved in selected patients. IDET is minimally invasive and has a low complication rate.' "
Who can benefit from an intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure?,"'As with other interventional procedures, proper patient selection increases the chances of a favorable outcome. IDET may be considered in patients who have had ''low back pain'' that does not radiate to the limbs for more than six months, without improvement from conservative treatment.''Ideal candidates are patients with a single affected disc. The status of the spinal disc can be assessed by X-ray and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''). Major spinal disc damage like disc collapse may not respond to IDET because it would also affect the accurate placement of the catheter during the procedure.\xa0''Patients older than 55 years may have lower success rates because of poorer healing. ''Cigarette smoking'' may affect collagen tissue and delay recovery following the procedure.' "
How is an intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure performed?,"'The procedure is performed under local anesthesia.\xa0''IDET is thought to decrease discogenic ''pain'' through two different mechanisms, as follows:''Once the catheter is inserted and in a satisfactory position, it is heated from 98.6 to 167 °F. After the temperature has remained at 167 °F for one minute and the patient does not complain of excessive pain or discomfort, the temperature is increased by 1°F every 30 seconds it reaches between 176° to 194 °F.\xa0''Breakage of heat-sensitive hydrogen bonds of the collagen fibers causes collagen contraction. The heat causes the destruction of disc nociceptors.\xa0' Thermal modification of collagen fibers Destruction of disc nociceptors (a type of pain receptor present in various parts of the body that are stimulated by mechanical or physical damage like bruises, burns, fractures, and joint damage like arthritis and sprains)"
What happens after an intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure?,"'The recovery after IDET is gradual. During the first week after the procedure, patients might experience a significant increase in pain. It may take 8-12 weeks for patients to experience significant pain relief.\xa0''The healing process reaches its peak four months after the procedure. During the four months of recovery, the patient is advised to limit physical activity and follow a rehabilitation program. A gradual increase in daily activities is recommended.\xa0''The patient should do only minimal sitting or standing during the first few days after the procedure. The patient would be advised to wear a back brace during the first six weeks.\xa0''After six months of the IDET procedure, patients can gradually resume all pre-procedure activities, including athletics.''The typical progression of activities after IDET is given below.''Activities in week 1 are as follows:''Activities in weeks 2-6 are as follows:''Activities in weeks 6-12 are as follows:''Activities beyond week 12\xa0are as follows:' Walking allowed Wearing a brace during all activities Siting for only 35-45 minutes at a time No lifting, twisting, bending, or driving No work No physical therapy Wearing a brace during all activities Increasing sitting time as tolerated Lifting no more than 10 lbs. Driving is allowed No twisting or bending Patients may return to light or sedentary work No physical therapy Lifting no more than 25 lb No twisting or bending Physical therapy may begin Lifting 25-50 lb Patients may return to full work Physical therapy and home exercise program can begin"
What is intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring?,"'Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is the continuous evaluation of a patient’s nervous system during surgery, especially procedures involving the brain and spinal cord. Electrical and electromagnetic sensors connected to the patient via adhesive electrodes or needles transmit information from the nervous system that can be monitored on a computer screen.''Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring keeps the surgeon and the anesthesiologist aware of the proper functioning of the patient’s nervous system during surgeries in real time. The neurophysiological monitoring devices alert the surgeon to any change in the patient’s nervous system to prevent irreversible nerve damage.' "
History and development of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring,"'Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring was first used in the 1930s during an ''epilepsy surgery''. Since the 1980s, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring techniques have been widely used during many surgical operations.''Before the advent of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, nerve functions were assessed by “wake up” tests during spinal surgeries. The anesthesia levels were periodically reduced to check the nerve function, but this did not provide continuous information.''With technological advancement in the monitoring devices and computerized analysis, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring now has evolved into an integral part of many surgical procedures. It has become possible to access and selectively remove and treat even deep-seated tumors and lesions, which was not possible before these refined techniques.' "
Why is intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring performed?,'Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is performed mainly to prevent permanent damage to the nervous system from surgeries involving the nervous system.''Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is performed to:' Continuously monitor the functional integrity of neural pathways  Map and identify the affected region requiring surgery Avoid injury to the adjacent nerve tissues Detect and repair any nerve injury before the damage becomes irreversible Minimize risks of permanent post-surgical functional impairments such us:ParalysisMuscle weaknessTinglingChronic pain NumbnessLoss of bowel and bladder control Paralysis Muscle weakness Tingling Chronic pain  Numbness Loss of bowel and bladder control
How does intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring work?,"'Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is usually performed by a technician who operates the device and is supervised by a neurophysiologist. Electrodes or needles attached to the patient’s relevant anatomy continuously transmit information to the device which can be viewed in a monitor.''During the surgery the neurophysiologist constantly observes and analyzes the information on the monitor and alerts the surgeon when any abnormality is observed. This helps the surgeon in real time, to navigate in the operative area and avoid accidental damage to the normal neural tissues and other vital organs and blood vessels in the area.' "
What are the methods used for intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring?,"'Various modalities are used to monitor the patient’s neurophysiological function during an operation.' Electromyography (EMG): Recording of a muscle’s electrical activity in response to electrical stimulation, which makes the muscle contract. Evoked Potentials: Recording of the time taken for the brain’s response to sensory stimulus through sight, sound or touch. Electroencephalography (EEG): Recording of electrical activity in the brain with electrodes placed on the scalp. Electrocorticography: Recording of the brain’s electrical activity by placing electrodes inside the brain’s cortical region."
What is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspiration'' (''arthrocentesis'')'' is a diagnostic procedure that involves the extraction and analysis of the synovial fluid in the joints. It is an important procedure used for diagnosing ''arthritis'' and differentiating inflammatory arthritis from noninflammatory arthritis.\xa0''Joint aspiration is a relatively quick and inexpensive procedure to perform. It can be done in a clinic or hospital. Any trained physician, physician’s assistant, or nurse can perform the procedure.' "
When should you have joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspiration may be indicated for any patient with an inflamed joint or joints that do not have an established diagnosis. Inflamed joints are recognized by being red, warm, tender, swollen, and painful during movement.\xa0''Some conditions that may require joint aspiration and analysis are:''Joint aspiration may be performed as a treatment in certain conditions, such as:' Acute and chronic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis  Gout Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) Repeated aspirations can be part of the management of the septic joint to relieve discomfort and prevent joint damage. Aspiration can be considered in cases of hemarthrosis (blood in the joints) to prevent adhesions.  Aspiration can be performed while injecting intra-articular medications such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid to improve efficacy. Steroid injections help reduce joint inflammation, reduce pain, preserve joint structure, and function. Hyaluronic acid lubricates the joint, decreases impact, delays joint aging, and reduces pain and stiffness."
When should joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) not be done?,'Joint aspiration should be performed with caution in patients with a ''bleeding disorder'' or those on ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs''. Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may be advised to stop the medications a few days before the procedure and resume again after the procedure.' 
How is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) done?,"'Any joint in the body can be aspirated. Some joint aspirations require the use of radiological guidance, as it may be required to confirm the presence of fluid before aspirating. Radiological imaging can help aspirate deep and technically difficult joints like the hip joint or spine.\xa0''Joint aspiration is a relatively quick procedure but may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain.\xa0' A sterile needle of appropriate size and length is introduced into the joint and the synovial fluid is collected in syringes.  The fluid collected is then analyzed microscopically.  Apart from microscopic analysis, the appearance of the aspirated synovial fluid can indicate certain features.  Normal fluid is clear or light yellow and viscous.  Inflammatory fluid appears darker yellow to cloudy and loses its viscosity.  Purulent fluid (pus in the fluid) is brownish to whitish and opaque. After the procedure, the patient is asked to rest for a few minutes, and then they can resume normal activities. Some patients may experience pain and bruising, which resolve in a few days. Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and bruising."
What are the complications of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspiration is a relatively safe procedure and complications are rare. The common complications are''In rare cases, infection of the joint may occur, which is called ''septic arthritis''.\xa0''If medications like steroids are simultaneously injected, though rare, it may cause localized shrinkage or hypopigmentation of the skin. Long-term use of steroid injections may cause systemic side effects like' localized bleeding, pain, swelling, and sometimes a reaction to local anesthesia. weight gain, puffy face, stretch marks, and easy bruising. "
What is laparoscopic Hartmann procedure reversal?,"'The laparoscopic Hartmann procedure reversal is done to close the ''colostomy'' (large bowel opening onto the skin) that was previously\xa0 done. This is followed by reconnecting the two parts of the intestine that were previously separated.\xa0''Laparoscopic Hartman procedure:'' It is an operation in which part of the large bowel (the sigmoid colon) is removed due to recurrent disease or ''cancer''. At that time of the surgery, it was not possible to re-join the bowel, so the rectum or anus was sealed off. The upper part of the large bowel was brought out to the skin as an opening of the bowel. This procedure is known as a colostomy.''Laparoscopic Hartmann reversal:'' In this procedure, a surgeon will restore the normal structure of the large bowel so that the patient may pass the fecal matter via the anus. The colostomy ''wound'' will be closed with ''stitches''. The surgery aims to restore the continuity of the bowel. For most patients, this may improve their bowel function/quality of life because they will no longer have a colostomy and the need to wear a ''stoma'' bag.' "
How is Hartmann procedure reversal performed?,"'Hartmann reversal procedure is major surgery and can take about 180 minutes for the surgeon to complete the procedure. Laparoscopic Hartmann procedure reversal is a challenging operation.' It is usually done under spinal or general anesthesia. The patient may be monitored throughout the procedure. This operation can be performed in one of two ways, either by laparoscopic method (keyhole surgery) or laparotomy (open procedure). A laparotomy involves making a large cut in the abdominal wall that allows the surgeon to operate on the bowel or intestine. Laparoscopic surgery is completed using a system of scopes inserted through three or four much smaller cuts in the abdomen. The laparoscopic approach offers significant advantages over the open approach in terms of decreased complications (e.g., surgical site infection) and reduces the duration of postoperative hospitalization. It requires a shorter operating time and can achieve more rapid normal bowel function. The surgeon may re-join the bowel either using special stapling instruments or sutures (stitches). This will restore the normal function of the large bowel. The colostomy hole is closed and sealed off and the patient’s stoma bag is usually removed during the procedure."
How much time interval is usually required between a Hartmann procedure and a Hartmann reversal?,"'The interval between the primary Hartmann procedure and subsequent Hartmann procedure reversal should be considered depending on the patient’s recovery. For optimal outcomes, the reversal should be performed at least 6 months after the primary procedure is performed.' "
What are the risks involved in the Hartmann reversal procedure?,"'Surgery to re-join the bowel is a challenging operation and there are some risks associated with it. Undertaking this surgery does not guarantee that the stoma will actually be reversed.' Anastomotic leak or leak from the re-join of the bowel: In a small number of patients, 4%, the area where the bowel has been stitched together can leak. This can be a serious complication and sometimes an operation is needed to reform a stoma. However, if the leak is small, resting the bowel by not drinking or eating may be enough for the area where the bowel was joined together to heal. Ileus (paralysis of the bowel) and small bowel obstruction: Sometimes, the bowel is slow to start working again after surgery (ileus). If this happens, the bowel may need to be rested and a drip (a tube into a vein in the arm) is used to replace fluids. In addition, the patient may need a nasogastric tube (tube in the nose that passes into the stomach), which in most cases will prevent vomiting. These will remain in place until the bowel recovers. Sometimes, if the bowel is obstructed, an operation may be required. Infection: Infection at the site of operation or nearby areas like the chest is one of the risks of this procedure. Bleeding and blood clots are other complications that may arise after or during the procedure. Risk of life: Reversal of Hartmann procedure is classified as major surgery. It can carry a risk to the patient’s life. Most people will not experience any serious complications from their surgery. However, risks do increase with age and for those with heart conditions and diabetes."
How soon can a patient recover after the Hartmann reversal procedure?,'Most people make a good recovery. It is usual for the bowel to stop working for a few days. The patient may be able to go home after five to ten days. It can take up to three to four months to return to normal activities. The patient may be on painkillers and antibiotics for a few weeks.' 
What is the colon?,"'The colon'' is part of the ''digestive system''. It is also called the ''large intestine'' or large bowel. The colon is situated inside the abdominal ''cavity'' and travels down the left side of the abdomen and ends at the anus.\xa0 ''One of the main'' functions of the colon'' is to regulate water levels in the body. The colon absorbs water from food. It also absorbs some\xa0''vitamins''\xa0and processes waste for expulsion from the body.\xa0''The colon consists of four parts that include\xa0' descending colon,  ascending colon,  transverse colon, and  sigmoid colon."
What are the reasons for laparoscopic colectomy?,"'Laparoscopic colectomy is used to treat and prevent diseases and conditions that affect the colon, such as:' Bleeding that can’t be controlled. Severe bleeding from the colon may require surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon. Bowel obstruction: A blocked colon is an emergency that may require total or partial colectomy, depending on the situation. Colon cancer: Early-stage cancers may require only a small section of the colon to be removed during colectomy. Cancers at a later stage may require more extensive removal of the colon. Inflammatory intestinal diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Preventive surgery: If a patient has a very high risk of colon cancer due to the formation of multiple precancerous colon polyps, the patient may choose to undergo total colectomy to prevent cancer in the future. Colectomy may be an option for people with inherited genetic conditions that increase their colon cancer risk."
What is laparoscopic left colectomy? ,"'A colectomy'' is a surgical procedure that involves removing a segment of the colon. During a colectomy, a surgeon removes a damaged section of the intestine and reattaches the healthy parts of the colon. Removal of a section of the colon will not affect a person’s ability to digest food.\xa0''Left colectomy'' is performed under general anesthesia.\xa0' In this procedure, a surgeon usually removes the descending colon before reattaching the transverse colon.  The surgeon makes small incisions in the abdominal wall and inserts a thin scope. The scope has a lens and light for viewing purposes.  The surgeon then inserts surgical instruments through the small cuts in the abdomen and removes the diseased part of the colon and reattaches the healthy colon.  The instruments are removed and incisions are stitched with absorbable stitches. This type of procedure is also known as keyhole surgery.  Left colectomy usually lasts less than three hours. "
What are risk factors of laparoscopic colectomy?,"'Risk of complications is based on the general health of the patient.

What happens during this surgery?," Before the surgery, you will be given anesthesia for sedation. Two to three small keyhole incisions are made on your belly near naval. A laparoscope (a thin flexible tube with a camera) is inserted into your belly, usually at the sight of your navel through small keyhole incisions. Air will be used to inflate the belly for a better view and to create more space. Both the fallopian tubes are cut and the ends are folded back and then tied off. The laparoscope is withdrawn, and incisions are closed with stitches or a special tape. The wound is bandaged."
What should I expect after surgery?,"'After the procedure,' You will be monitored for a short time. You will be discharged within two to four hours after the surgery. You will need someone to take you home. You can return to your normal routines within one week of surgery. You may have other symptoms that can last a few days such as Dizziness, Discomfort Soreness in your navel and belly Bruises Weakness Tiredness Nausea Shoulder and back pain (because of gas used during the procedure) Belly cramps Gassy or bloated feeling A sore throat (from the breathing tube if given general anesthesia) Some vaginal discharge or spotting Your incisions will be closed with skin adhesives and bandages that will be removed after 24 hours. Stitches will get dissolved on their own. You can take a bath the next day. However, do not soak your incision in a bathtub or go swimming. You can gradually increase your activity level with short walks and light activity. You can start sexual activity when you feel comfortable."
What are the benefits of laparoscopic tubal ligation? ," Permanent birth control Most effective Immediately effective Minimum invasive Safe Convenient Less failure rate Quicker recovery Fewer complications Outpatient surgery Short hospital stay (same-day discharge) Resume to work shortly Do not cause any change in your menses or cause menopause After the procedure, no further steps, little or nothing to do or remember"
What are the risks?,"'There is a small risk of' General anesthesia-related issues. Injury and damage to the surrounding organs such as the bladder, gut, and womb. Bladder infection. Surgical site infection. Bleeding. Failure of birth control (very rare). Ectopic pregnancy (the baby grows outside the womb). The possible need for further surgery."
Can you get pregnant after laparoscopic tubal ligation?,"'After tubal ligation, if you want to reverse the surgery, it may not work. Even after reversing tubal ligation, many women are still not able to get ''pregnant''. Additionally, the risk of ''ectopic pregnancy'' (''pregnancy'' outside the womb) is increased.' "
What is rectal prolapse?,'Rectal prolapse is a protrusion of the rectum (end chamber of the ''large intestine'' where feces collect before release by the anal sphincter)\xa0 is called rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse is thought to occur due to the loss or ''weakness'' of the normal support structures for the rectum.''\xa0Patients with rectal prolapse have symptoms such as:' Change in bowel habits Rectal bleeding Mucus drainage Anorectal pain Fecal incontinence (inability to control bowel movements)
What is laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy?,"'Laparoscopic rectopexy is a surgery to repair rectal prolapse. In this surgery, the rectum is restored to its normal position by using ventral mesh.\xa0' This procedure is done under general anesthesia, and vitals are monitored throughout. The surgeon will make a small cut (about 1/2 inch) near the belly button. A laparoscope will be inserted into the abdomen through this incision. Images taken by the laparoscope will be projected onto monitors. Once the laparoscope is in place, the surgeon usually makes several smaller incisions in the abdomen. The number and position of these incisions depend on the size and shape of your abdomen, the preference of the surgeon, and other factors.  Long, thin surgical instruments will then be placed through these incisions to complete the surgery. The surgeon will begin the surgery by locating the colon and rectum (parts of the large intestine).  Next, the rectum will be freed from its surrounding structures and gently lifted into its original position. Stitches will be placed around the rectum to secure it in place. Mesh may be used along with the stitches to hold the rectum in its position. In some cases, the surgeon may remove a portion of your colon. Finally, the area will be rinsed, and the incisions will be closed by dissolvable stitches. "
How long is rectopexy surgery?,"'Rectopexy surgery is one of the major abdominal surgeries. Usually, the procedure is done under 60 minutes, however, in rare cases, it may extend up to 120 minutes depending on complications.' "
What are the risks of rectopexy surgery?,"'Rectal prolapse surgery carries serious risks that vary depending on the surgical technique. Below are a few common risks involved with the procedure:' Bleeding Infection Bowel obstruction Damage to nearby structures, such as nerves and organs Narrowing (stricture) of the anal opening Fistula: an abnormal connection between two body parts, such as the rectum and anus Recurrence of rectal prolapse Development of new or worsened constipation Mesh erosion Hernia (protrusion of organs)"
What are the results of rectopexy surgery?,"'In most people, rectal prolapse surgery relieves symptoms and improves ''constipation'' and ''fecal incontinence''. However, in some cases, ''constipation'' can worsen or become a problem when it was not one before surgery.\xa0''Recurrence of rectal prolapse after surgery occurs in about 2-5% of people. The incidence of complications is less in a laparoscopic procedure.\xa0' "
What is laparoscopy in gynecology?,"'Laparoscopy'' in gynecology (gynecological laparoscopy) is a less invasive alternative to open surgery. The procedure involves using a laparoscope (a long, thin tube with a light connected to a camera) to look inside the pelvic area to diagnose gynecological disorders or to perform surgery to treat gynecological conditions. A small incision is made over the abdomen through which the laparoscope is inserted. Two to three other small incisions may be made to insert specialized surgical instruments. Open surgery is more invasive and usually requires a large incision. Healing is also generally faster with laparoscopic procedures.' "
Why is laparoscopy in gynecology done?,"'Laparoscopy in gynecology may be performed for diagnosis, treatment or both.''Indications for diagnostic laparoscopy include''Gynecological conditions that may be diagnosed by performing a laparoscopy include''Laparoscopy may be used in the treatment of the following gynecological conditions' Chronic pelvic pain Difficulty getting pregnant History of pelvic infection Ovarian tumors or cysts Uterine fibroids Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy occurring outside the uterus) Pelvic adhesions Pelvic abscess Cause of infertility Pelvic inflammatory disease Cancer of the reproductive organs Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) Removal of tumors from the ovary or uterus Endometriosis (presence of endometrial tissue, the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus, at sites outside the uterus) Removal of adhesions and scar tissue Tubal sterilization (permanent sterilization) Surgery to treat prolapsed uterus (when the internal supports of the uterus become weak making it descend towards or outside the vagina)"
How is laparoscopy in gynecology performed?,"'During the procedure''Laparoscopy is usually performed under general anesthesia. Hence, there is no ''pain'' during surgery. This means you will be unconscious for the procedure. A needle is inserted into the abdomen to fill the abdomen with carbon dioxide ''gas''. The gas widens the abdominal ''cavity'' by allowing a clearer view of the organs, keeps the abdominal wall away from the organs and reduces the risk of injury to the abdominal organs. The surgeon makes a small incision below the umbilicus (''belly button'') through which the laparoscope is inserted. The camera attached to the laparoscope transmits the video to a screen giving a clear and magnified view of the pelvic structures. The video can also be recorded for future reference. If the procedure is being performed only to make a diagnosis, only one incision is required to insert the laparoscope. If a surgical procedure is to be performed, additional small incisions would be required through which the surgical instruments would be inserted. Once the procedure is over, the incisions are sutured (stitched) and dressed.''After the procedure''After the procedure, the patient would have to stay in the hospital until the anesthesia wears off, but the patient needs to have someone drive them home. Patients are usually discharged on the same day or 24 to 48 hours after the procedure, depending on what was done. Patients can resume their daily activities in 1 to 2 days but are advised to avoid straining, heavy lifting, sports, ''exercise'' and other specific activities until the surgeon allows it. Recovery time depends on the procedure performed. It varies from a few days to a few weeks. Patients may experience ''pain'', swelling and ''bruising'', which usually resolves in a few days. Painkillers and antibiotics are usually prescribed. Recovery following laparoscopic procedures is faster than recovery after open surgery.' "
What are the complications of laparoscopy in gynecology?,"'Serious complications of laparoscopic procedures are rare. Some possible complications include''The risk of complications increases in the following cases' Bleeding Infection Pelvic pain Hematoma (blood clots) Blood clots within the blood vessels, especially in the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) Difficulty urinating Improper wound healing Scarring and adhesions Damage to the surrounding structures like the bowel, bladder, muscles, nerves, major blood vessels and other tissues Reaction to anesthesia Previous history of major pelvic or abdominal surgery History of pelvic infections Bowel disease Chronic smoking Adhesions Obesity Poor nutritional status Diabetes and other major systemic illnesses"
What is laparoscopy used for?,"'Laparoscopy'' is a minimally invasive surgery or keyhole surgery that helps diagnose and treat many health conditions. A\xa0laparoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a light and small video camera on the end. The tube is put into a small surgical cut made through the abdominal wall near the ''belly button''. A second or third incision may also be made in other parts of the belly to put in other operating instruments. By making the small incision, the surgeon can see images of the required organ on the video monitor and treat the organs without being invasive to the ''human body''. There are a few reasons why laparoscopy may be used' Having problems in the abdomen (belly) and pelvis: Laparoscopy helps to look for the problems that may be causing discomfort in the belly and pelvis. Suspicious area that might be cancer: Laparoscopy can be used to remove or take biopsy samples of lymph nodes in the pelvis or abdomen. It is commonly used for people with gynecologic cancers (cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer). To treat a small cancer: Laparoscopy can be used to treat small cancers in areas such as the  ovaries, uterus , cervix , colon and kidney."
What are the medical conditions that laparoscopy helps diagnose?,"'Laparoscopies are widely used to diagnose many different conditions''Cancers that can be diagnosed using laparoscopy include' Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): This is a bacterial infection of the female upper genital tract, including the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. Endometriosis: This is the presence of endometrial tissue, the womb lining, outside the womb. Ectopic pregnancy: This is a pregnancy that develops outside the womb. Ovarian cyst: This is a fluid-filled sac that develops on a woman's ovary. Fibroids: These are non-cancerous tumors that grow in or around the uterus (womb). Undescended testicles: This is a common childhood condition where a boy is born without one or both testicles in their scrotum.

What are the benefits and risks of laparoscopy?,"'Laparoscopy has many benefits which include\xa0''Risks include' Pain after laparoscopic surgery is less. Recovery from laparoscopic surgery is generally faster. Smaller incisions allow the patient’s wounds to heal faster and have smaller scars.  The risk of infection and complications is lower. Laparoscopy may sometimes take longer to perform than open surgery.  Patients may be under anesthesia for a longer time, which may increase the risk of complications.  Sometimes, complications do not appear right away but occur a few days to a few weeks after surgery.  Bleeding or a hernia (a bulge caused by poor healing) at the incision sites Internal bleeding Infection Damage to a blood vessel or other organ, such as the stomach, bowel, bladder or uterus"

What is medical thoracoscopy?,"'Medical thoracoscopy'' is a procedure that helps a physician view the chest ''cavity'' and the ''lungs''\xa0by inserting an endoscope/thoracoscope (camera with light source) through the chest wall. Thoracoscopy may be performed as a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. It is also called a pleuroscopy.\xa0\xa0 ''The major indications for thoracoscopy are pleural and lung biopsies for lung diseases. Thoracoscopy is performed as a therapeutic procedure with the help of video technology. This is called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and is performed by thoracic surgeons.''During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the ''trachea (windpipe).'' The trachea further divides into two tubes called ''bronchus (bronchi).'' The bronchi open into the lungs.\xa0''Within the ''lungs,'' the bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. ''The end of bronchioles opens into little air sacs called ''alveoli,'' which aid in gaseous exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels through which the exchange of gases, oxygen, and carbon dioxide take place.''Pleura'' is\xa0a thin membrane that lines the outer surface of the lungs (visceral pleura) and the inner surface of the chest wall (parietal pleura). The space between two pleura is called the ''pleural space or pleural ''cavity''. ''The pleural space is filled with fluid. When this space is affected by pathologic disorders, it can lead to medical consequences.' "
Why is a medical thoracoscopy performed?,'Some common indications for medical thoracoscopy include the following:' Diagnosis of pleural effusions (excess fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity) Lung cancer staging Pleurodesis (adhesion of the visceral and parietal pleura) Biopsy of parietal pleura Staging for mesothelioma (the cancer of the lining of the lungs and chest wall)
How is medical thoracoscopy performed?,"'The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, intravenous sedation, or general anesthesia.' A trocar (a thick needle) and cannula together are introduced into the pleural space.  The trocar is removed and the thoracoscope is passed through the cannula (passage through the cannula ensures that no tissue residue covers the camera).  This is a single-puncture technique, through which a thoracoscope (camera with light source) is introduced.  There are two types of scopes: the rigid and the semi-rigid scopes. The choice of instrument depends on the indication of the procedure. In VATS, multiple small incisions are made on the skin above the chest cavity to insert a thoracoscope and surgical instruments."
What are the complications of medical thoracoscopy?,'The procedure is relatively safe. Some complications that can occur are:' Air leakage Respiratory failure Pneumonia (lung infection) Bleeding Atelectasis (collapse of the lung) Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat/ abnormal heart rhythm) Myocardial infarction (heart attack) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Blood clot in deep lying veins Pulmonary embolism (PE): Blood clot in the lungs Pain and/or infection at the incision site Reaction to anesthesia

Metabolic encephalopathy is usually diagnosed through the blood, urine, and spinal fluid samples. Blood tests may also show if there is an infection or if there are drugs or toxins in the blood. Computed tomography (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') may be used to rule out any brain-related problems. ''Electroencephalogram'' (''EEG'') examination may also be done to rule out any abnormalities in the brain.' "
How can we treat metabolic encephalopathy?,"'The treatment of metabolic encephalopathy requires the management of underlying diseases that emerge from the evaluation of neurological symptoms and signs. Early recognition of the preexisting factor may be essential:' Delirium should be treated as a medical emergency.  Monitoring of respiratory and circulatory functions is a priority, with neurological, laboratory, and neuroimaging evaluations.  The patient should be usually placed in a placid, stress-free environment and encouraged to engage in cognitive activities. An analgesic may be given for pain control.  Antipsychotics such as haloperidol may be given in low doses; however, there may be limitations for this drug. Drugs such as quetiapine or olanzapine are being used (without FDA approval). Benzodiazepines may be used in cases of alcoholism and cocaine withdrawal.  As per research, dexmedetomidine, midazolam, or lorazepam reduces the occurrence and episodes of delirium. Patients are maintained on a low-protein diet to lower their blood ammonia levels because ammonia is a by-product of protein metabolism. Liver transplantation may be considered in patients with chronic liver cirrhosis."
Do patients with metabolic encephalopathy recover?,"'The recovery of patients with metabolic encephalopathy depends on the cause and type of encephalopathy. Recovery usually varies among patients, and poor prognosis could lead to complete loss of brain function or death. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important as exemplified in the management of ''hypoglycemic'' patients. Patients given glucose at the onset of symptoms recover completely. Delayed treatment may lead to\xa0''seizures''\xa0or\xa0coma,\xa0which may be reversed within hours or days with partial recovery. However, long or multiple delays can be fatal.' "
What is metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis?,"'Joint aspiration'' (''arthrocentesis'') of the metacarpophalangeal joint is a diagnostic procedure involving the extraction and analysis of the synovial fluid of the joints.\xa0''It is an important component in diagnosing ''arthritis'' and differentiating inflammatory arthritis from non-inflammatory arthritis. Arthrocentesis can also be performed therapeutically (for ''pain'' relief, drainage of\xa0fluid, or injection of medications).''Any joint in the body can be aspirated. Joint aspiration is a relatively quick and inexpensive procedure to perform. It can be done in a clinic or a hospital. It can be done by any physician, physician’s assistant or nurse who has the training and equipment.\xa0' "
When is metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis done?,"'Metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis may be indicated for any patient with inflamed metacarpophalangeal joints who do not have an established diagnosis. Inflamed joints cause redness, warmth, tenderness, swelling, and ''pain'' during movement.\xa0''Some conditions that may require joint aspiration and analysis to establish diagnosis are:''Joint aspiration may be performed as a treatment in certain conditions, such as:' Monoarticular arthritis (inflammation of the joint) Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) Joint effusion (swelling due to fluid accumulation in the body) Intra-articular fracture (fractures which involve the joint space)  Crystal arthropathy (accumulation of calcium crystals in the joint and surrounding areas) Repeated aspirations can be part of the management of septic joints to relieve discomfort and prevent joint damage. Aspiration can be considered in cases of hemarthrosis (blood in the joints) to prevent adhesions.  Aspiration can be performed along with injecting intra-articular medications such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid to improve efficacy. Steroid injections help reduce joint inflammation, reduce pain, and preserve joint structure and function. Hyaluronic acid lubricates the joint, decreases impact, delays joint aging, reduces pain, and stiffness. "
When should metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis not be done?,'Metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis should be done with caution in patients with ''bleeding disorders'' or those on ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs''. Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may be advised to stop the medications a few days before the procedure and resume again after the procedure.' 
How is metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis performed?,"'Sometimes, metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis may be performed using radiological guidance, as it may be required to confirm the presence of fluid before aspirating. Radiological guidance can help in aspirating other deep and technically difficult joints like the hip joint or spine.\xa0''Metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis is a relatively quick procedure but may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain.\xa0''After the procedure, the patient would need to rest for a few minutes, soon after which they can resume normal activities. Patients may experience pain and ''bruising'' which resolves in a few days. Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and ''bruising''.' A needle of appropriate size and length is introduced into the joint and the synovial fluid is collected in syringes.  The fluid is then sent for analysis under the microscope.  Apart from microscopic analysis, the appearance of the aspirated synovial fluid can indicate certain features.  Normal fluid is clear or light yellow and viscous. Inflammatory fluid appears darker yellow to cloudy in appearance and loses its viscosity.  Purulent fluid (pus in the fluid) is brownish to whitish and opaque."
What are the complications of metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis?,"'Metacarpophalangeal arthrocentesis is a relatively safe procedure and complications are rare. The common complications patients usually face are:''If other medications like steroids are simultaneously injected, though rare, it may cause localized shrinkage or hypopigmentation of the skin. Long-term use of steroid injections may cause systemic side effects like ''weight gain'', swollen face, ''stretch marks'', and ''easy bruising''.\xa0' Localized bleeding Pain and swelling Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) Reaction to local anesthesia"
What is morning sickness?,"'Morning sickness'' is the term used to refer to the symptoms that a ''pregnant'' woman may have during her 1st, 2nd, or\xa03rd trimester of ''pregnancy''.\xa0''Common symptoms of ''morning sickness'' in early pregnancy that\xa0can occur at any time of day are;'  nausea, and  vomiting"
What does morning sickness feel like? When does it start?,"'Morning sickness usually begins by the 9th week after ''conception''. The ''nausea'' can occur any time of day, not just in the morning. It may be triggered or worsened by certain odors or foods, or there may be no specific triggers. Most women experience relief in their ''second trimester'', but for some women, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' persists throughout the pregnancy.' "
What causes morning sickness?,"'Morning sickness is likely caused by the changes in hormone level that take place in a woman’s body in early pregnancy. It is more likely to occur if you have had morning sickness with;'  a previous pregnancy, multiple gestations like twins or triplets,  if you tend to develop nausea from;migraines,birth control pills, ormotion sickness. migraines, birth control pills, or motion sickness."
7 lifestyle changes to relieve morning sickness,'There are a number of ways to relieve morning sickness through lifestyle changes.''Make sure that you are cleared by your OB/GYN before participating in any ''exercise'' program.'  Diet. Excercise. Yoga. Meditation. Stress management techniques. Certain antihistamines are safe to use in pregnancy and have been shown to help relieve nausea and vomiting. Other medications to control nausea in severe cases.
11 natural home remedies to help nausea and vomiting from morning sickness,"'Natural or home remedies for morning sickness include;''Avoid foods that produce;''Other tips for relief include;' eating smaller portions more frequently throughout the day, avoiding foods that trigger or worsen the condition, and sipping ginger ale. gas, greasy or fatty foods, and spicy foods. sucking on hard candies, nibbling crackers, or nibbling pretzels. Aromatherapy with the smell of citrus fruit or mint may produce some relief. Regular exercise may help control morning sickness symptoms, and other mild discomforts of early pregnancy."
What drinks and foods cause morning sickness?,"'The experience of morning sickness is different for every woman, so not all women will be triggered by the same foods. In general though, spicy, greasy, or fatty foods, as well as foods with strong aromas, are more likely to provoke morning sickness.' "
What drinks and food help relieve morning sickness symptoms?,"'As with foods that cause morning sickness, foods that provide relief vary among women. A food that helps one woman may worsen nausea in another. ''Ginger'' is one food that many women find helpful, so sipping ginger ale can often help relieve symptoms.' "
When does morning sickness end?,"  Morning sickness ends for most women in the second trimester. When nausea and vomiting are severe and cause dehydration, a condition called hyperemesis gravidarum may be present.This is a more severe condition in which a woman runs the risk of becoming severely dehydrated or loses over 5% of her pre-pregnancy weight.Hyperemesis gravidarum may require hospitalization and may be treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and medications. This is a more severe condition in which a woman runs the risk of becoming severely dehydrated or loses over 5% of her pre-pregnancy weight. Hyperemesis gravidarum may require hospitalization and may be treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and medications."
When should you call a doctor for morning sickness?,"'You should always call a doctor if the nausea and vomiting is so severe that you are becoming dehydrated. Signs of ''dehydration'' include becoming dizzy or faint when you stand up, passing a small amount of ''dark urine'', and a racing ''heart''. Call your healthcare provider if you cannot keep liquids down or if you are having any symptoms that concern you.' "
What is mucus?,"'Mucus'' is a normal, slippery and stringy fluid substance produced by many lining tissues in the body. It is essential for body function and acts as a protective and moisturizing layer to keep critical organs from drying out. Mucus also acts as a trap for irritants like dust, smoke, or bacteria. It contains antibodies and bacteria-killing enzymes to help fight off infections.'""The body produces a lot of mucus -- about 1 to 1.5 liters per day. We don't tend to notice mucus at all unless its production is increased or the quality of mucus has changed, as may happen with different illnesses and conditions."" "
What causes mucus production to increase?,"'Respiratory infections like colds, the ''flu'', and ''sinusitis'' are common causes of increased mucus production and ''coughing'' up mucus. ''Allergic'' reactions are another reason that mucus production can increase. Even consumption of spicy foods can spark excess mucus production in the nasal passages.''When you are sick from ''respiratory infection'', you may notice thickened mucus that may appear darker than normal. This thickened mucus is harder to clear than typical mucus.  This mucus is associated with many of the characteristic symptoms of a ''cold'' or ''flu''. The mucus may also appear yellow-green in color when you are ill. ' "
What areas of the body produce mucus?,"'Mucus is produced in many sites in the body by mucus glands in the lining tissues of multiple organs, including the:' lungs, sinuses, mouth, throat, nose, and gastrointestinal tract."
What is the difference between mucus and phlegm?,"'Phlegm'' is the term that is used to refer to mucus produced by the respiratory system, particularly when excess mucus is produced and coughed up. During an infection, the mucus contains the ''viruses'' or ''bacteria'"" responsible for the infection as well as infection-fighting cells of the body's immune system (white blood cells).""'Phlegm itself is not dangerous, but when present in large amounts, it can clog the airways. Phlegm is usually expelled by ''coughing'', and this is typically accompanied by symptoms like ''nasal congestion'', ''runny nose'', and ''sore throat''.' "
What do different colors of mucus and phlegm mean?,"'While a small amount of blood in mucus is normal, you should see a health-care professional if there is excessive bleeding. '  The thickened mucus that accompanies many illnesses is often darker and yellow-colored compared to normal, clear, thin mucus. Greenish mucus means that the mucus contains infection-fighting white blood cells. Blood-tinged or brownish mucus is also common with upper respiratory infections, especially if the inside of the nose has become irritated or scratched."
When is excessive mucus a problem?,"'Excessive mucus is rarely a serious medical problem, but it is uncomfortable and a nuisance, particularly when it blocks sinuses or causes coughing fits. Thickened mucus and excess mucus production cause many unpleasant symptoms including:' runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, sinus headache, and cough.    "
How do you get rid of mucus?,"'Saline nasal rinses, including neti pots, are an option for those who would like to get rid of excess mucus without taking medications. Bulb syringes and squeeze bottles are other methods to do ''nasal irrigation''. Saline nasal sprays may also be helpful.''All these techniques thin out the mucus and help clear the airways and sinuses. Always use sterile saline rinses that can be purchased, or use distilled, previously boiled, or sterile water to make up the solution. Using nonsterile tap water has the small chance of introducing an infection into the airways and sinuses.'""Certain medications are also able to help thin mucus and enhance the body's ability to remove it.""  "
How does a neti pot help you get rid of mucus?,'Neti pots and other methods for ''nasal irrigation'' work using the same principle:''Be sure that any solution you use for nasal irrigation is made with sterile (such as previously boiled) water. ' A saline (salt water) solution is injected into one nostril. This loosens up all the mucus in the nasal cavity. The water drains out the other nostril.
Which medications treat or get rid of mucus?,"'A number of ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications can help reduce mucus production or help with removal of mucus. Decongestants and ''antihistamines'' are two kinds of ''drugs'' that may help relieve symptoms of a ''cold'' or flu.''Decongestants reduce blood flow to the lining tissues of the nose and throat, so your body may produce less mucus. They may help you breathe easier when you have a stuffy nose, but because they are drying, they may have the unintended effect of thickening the mucus that is present. Decongestants should be used only under physician supervision in persons with ''high blood pressure'' or ''heart disease''.''Antihistamines'' block or limit the action of histamines, substances produced during ''allergic'' reactions that cause the lining tissues in the nose to produce more mucus. Older or first-generation antihistamines can be sedating, but newer types of antihistamines can be taken during the day with little sedating effect.''An additional kind of medication that can help thin out mucus is ''guaifenesin''. ''Guaifenesin'' is a type of drug called an expectorant. Expectorants make the mucus thinner so it is easier to ''cough'' up. ' "
What is multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) by damaging and destroying the protective myelin sheath around the nerve fibers. Someone with ''multiple sclerosis'' might develop problems with muscle control, vision, bladder control and other body functions. The distinctive feature of ''multiple sclerosis'' is symptoms may affect different parts of the body months or sometimes years apart.' "
What are usually the first signs of multiple sclerosis?,"'The effects of multiple sclerosis are often different for everyone who develops the disease. Some people have fewer symptoms and do not need treatment. Others will have trouble getting around and doing daily tasks. Below are a few common signs; the first five signs are the most common in patients with multiple sclerosis.' Abnormal sensations (tingling sensation or paresthesia) are the most common and early symptom where a patient feels pricking sensation. Weakness Fatigue Muscle pain;  Nerve pain.  Blurred or double vision.  Speech and swallowing problems Bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction Body balance, thinking, and emotional problems Muscle cramps  Heat intolerance"
What age do people get MS?," Multiple sclerosis is diagnosed in females from ages 20 to 40. It may occur at any age and can involve both genders. It is possible to have MS begin in childhood or over 40 years of age, but it occurs less frequently in these age groups.  Multiple sclerosis in children and teens is difficult to diagnose."
What are the causes of MS?,"'Doctors and researchers don’t fully understand the causes of multiple sclerosis, however there are few common risk factors:\xa0' Viral infection: Some patients develop MS after viral infection (especially after Epstein-Barr virus or the human herpes virus 6 infection) Environmental factors Stress: Patients with increased stress are at risk of developing MS  Smoking: Patients with history of smoking tobacco are at greater risk. "
How to diagnose multiple sclerosis,"'Multiple sclerosis is difficult to diagnose due to highly variable symptoms. \xa0It is important to rule out other conditions when diagnosing MS. A ''neurologist'' usually takes medical history and orders the tests below:' Blood test EEG (tests to measure electrical activity in brain and other areas) MRI Lumbar puncture (test to analyze spinal cord fluid).  A few other tests help distinguish MS from stroke, thyroid-caused illness, or other diseases that cause similar symptoms to MS."
What is the treatment for multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis has no cure, however; multiple treatments available may improve body function and debilitating symptoms. Doctors might prescribe ''pain'' killers, ''antidepressants'' and other ''drugs'', like muscle relaxers,\xa0tranquilizers, or\xa0botulinum toxin\xa0(''Botox''), to ease\xa0''muscle spasms''\xa0and to make MS attacks shorter and less severe.\xa0''Several drugs\xa0that may slowdown the disease and help in preventing\xa0nerve damage are used in treatment for MS which\xa0include:''Some studies suggest that\xa0''vitamin D'', which you synthesize from sunlight exposure, may strengthen your immune system and protect you from MS.

Can the nose be reconstructed?,"'The nose is one of the most important aspects of facial aesthetics. Fortunately for people with severe injuries, congenital deformities or concerns about their appearance,\xa0 nose reconstruction surgery techniques are common and well-established. The reconstruction of a defect in the nose is more difficult than other parts of the face, however, because of the three-dimensional structure of the nose.''The nose is made up of three layers:''Nasal bones and cartilage create the shape of the nose, with the tip entirely defined by the cartilage.' Skin Bone and cartilage framework Mucosal lining"
When is nasal reconstruction done?,'The typical indications for nasal reconstruction include the following:' Defect or loss of function of the nose following trauma or surgical removal of tumors Aesthetic concerns
When is nasal reconstruction not done?,"'Absolute contraindications include:''Relative contraindications should be managed prior to surgery and include the following:' Poor general health Serious systemic diseases Residual disease or poorly defined reconstruction site. Bleeding disorders  Blood supply problems at the operative site Malnutrition Systemic diseases that delay wound healing, like uncontrolled diabetes Previous surgical procedure to the nose  Radiation therapy Issues such as prior existing asymmetry, functional deficiencies and the possibility of skin mismatch need to be discussed with the patient before surgery."
How is nasal reconstruction performed?," Nasal reconstruction is usually done with the patient under general anesthesia. In case of trauma or defect after surgical removal of a tumor, the wound is thoroughly examined.  The location, size and extent of the defect is carefully studied.  Small wounds may heal without any surgical intervention. Larger wounds require an extensive, detailed multi-staged plan.  The quality and viability of the surrounding skin is assessed for tissue death, presence of scars from prior surgeries or radiation therapy. Identification of adjacent tissue to create a flap to fill the defect is done. This flap is used to repair the defect. A flap with similar texture, color and sebaceous gland density improves the aesthetic appearance. These factors dictate the type of flap or graft needed for reconstruction.  Identification of adjacent tissue to create a flap to fill the defect is done. This flap is used to repair the defect.  A flap with similar texture, color and sebaceous gland density improves the aesthetic appearance. These factors dictate the type of flap or graft needed for reconstruction.  There are various surgical approaches in nasal reconstruction which depend on the extent of defect and the surgeon’s discretion.  Functional loss, such as reduced airway causing nasal obstruction, is also corrected during the reconstruction surgery. This should be identified and addressed prior to graft or flap placement. "
What are the complications of nasal reconstruction?,"'Some potential complications are:' Pain, swelling and bruising Infection Bleeding  Hematoma (blood clot) Seroma (collection of fluid) Flap necrosis (tissue death) Asymmetry of the nose "
What is nasogastric intubation procedure?,"'Nasogastric ''intubation'' is the insertion of a flexible tube into the nasal passage, through the throat and ''esophagus'' into the stomach. It is a minor procedure that provides access to the esophageal passage and the stomach.' "
For what is nasogastric intubation used?,"'Nasogastric intubation may be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.' Evaluation of upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract bleeding Extraction of gastric fluid content for testing Identification of the esophagus and stomach on a chest radiograph Administering radiographic contrast dye in the upper GI tract Identification of cancer cells in patients with gastric cancer Gastric decompression to decrease abdominal pressure and prevent esophageal regurgitation during or after a surgery with general anesthesia Relief of symptoms, and bowel rest in case of small bowel obstruction or pancreatitis Stomach pumping (gastric lavage) after recent ingestion of toxic substances Bowel irrigation to prevent the absorption of ingested toxic matter Administration of medication For feeding before or after certain surgeries To enable the development of an open tract in the esophagus after ingestion of corrosive material Nasogastric intubation cannot be performed in patients with Severe injury in the middle of the face Recent nasal surgery Nasogastric intubation may be performed with due precautions in patients with Coagulation disorder Enlarged veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices) Recent banding for esophageal varices Anastomosis in the esophagus or stomach (creation of a connection between unconnected parts of GI tract) Ingestion of alkaline substance"
How is nasogastric intubation performed?,"'The nasogastric intubation is mostly performed with topical anesthesia, while the patient is awake. The patient needs to follow instructions as the doctor performs the procedure. The procedure may also be performed when a patient is under general anesthesia or unconscious from an ingested substance or ''trauma''.' There usually is no requirement of any preparation by the patient before the procedure. The patient is seated in an upright position, if conscious. The doctor first examines the patient’s nose for presence of septal deviation before deciding which nostril to insert the tube in. The patient sniffs and swallows a local anesthetic which numbs the nasal passage and the throat. The doctor may also spray the anesthetic inside the nasal passage and the throat. The doctor inserts the lubricated tube through the nostril gently. As the tube is slowly advanced through the nasal passage and the throat, the patient follows instructions from the doctor. Typically, the patient has to flex the neck and swallow sips of water through a straw. The doctor continues to advance the tube into the esophagus until it reaches into the stomach. In sedated or unconscious patients the doctor uses direct or video-assisted laryngoscope (a device to view the throat and voice box [larynx]) for guidance. The doctor verifies the correct placement of the nasogastric tube with a chest X-ray. If the nasogastric intubation is done for diagnostic purposes, the patient will be able to leave shortly after completion of the procedure. In therapeutic situations, the removal of the tube and recovery of the patient will depend on the reason for the nasogastric intubation, and the condition of the patient."
Is nasogastric intubation painful?,"'Nasogastric intubation is not painful for most people though it does cause a certain amount of discomfort. ''Pain'' is usually prevented with local anesthesia and gel lubrication of the nasogastric tube. In some people, the insertion may cause' Irritation of nose and throat Gagging sensation Watery eyes"
What are the complications of nasogastric intubation?,"'Nasogastric intubation is a commonly performed procedure and complications are rare. There are a few mild side effects such as''These side effects usually resolve in a short while, and throat lozenges and salt water gargle help with throat irritation.''There may be a few rare complications such as' Sore throat Stuffy nose Minor nosebleed Bleeding in the nasal cavity (epistaxis) Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Drop in heart rate and blood pressure (vasovagal episode) Bronchial spasm Inhaling gastric contents into the airway (aspiration) Perforation of the esophagus Insertion of tube into the larynx and the airway"
What is nasotracheal intubation?,"'Intubation'' is a bedside procedure in which a tube is inserted either into your nose or mouth to help you breathe better. It is a life-saving procedure done in emergency situations.\xa0''Intubation through the mouth is known as orotracheal intubation and through the nose is known as nasotracheal intubation.''When you are unconscious, your ''breathing'' is affected. Your oxygen levels may fall, which can be dangerous. At such times, external breathing support is provided with the help of a machine known as a ventilator. The ventilator acts as breathing support by enabling you to breathe through intubation.' "
When is nasotracheal intubation used?,"'Nasotracheal intubation is used in various conditions such as:' Surgeries of the neck and headOral surgeries: Surgeries involving the teeth, gums, and jaw.Maxillofacial surgery: Reconstructive surgery of the faceTonsillectomy: Removal of tonsils Oral surgeries: Surgeries involving the teeth, gums, and jaw. Maxillofacial surgery: Reconstructive surgery of the face Tonsillectomy: Removal of tonsils Oral route of intubation is not possible due to lockjaw (trismus) Severe cervical spine disease"
What makes you unfit for nasotracheal intubation?,'Doctors may not plan nasotracheal intubation on you if you have' A previous history of old or new skull fractures Bleeding disorders  Coagulopathy (clotting disorders) Apnea (a condition in which breathing stops due to obstruction in the upper respiratory system) Large nasal polyps (fleshy growths in the nose) Suspected nasal foreign bodies Recent nasal surgery Infection in your upper neck History of frequent episodes of epistaxis Prosthetic (artificial) heart valves
How is nasotracheal intubation performed?," Nasotracheal intubation is generally performed by an anesthetist. You will be given general anesthesia, which makes you numb and sleeps throughout the procedure. If you are unfit for anesthesia, you will be given sedatives to make you sleep. The anesthetist will first check if you are fit to be put on a ventilator. This is done by inflating a balloon-like structure known as a bag-mask into your nose through a lubricated tube (endotracheal tube). You might be given oxygen from the bag-mask to increase the levels of oxygen in your blood before the intubation. Certain medicines will be sprayed inside your nose to numb it and prevent bleeding. To prevent bleeding in your nose, a medicine like epinephrine or adrenaline will be sprayed inside your nose. The anesthetist will check if there is any obstruction in your nasal cavity by inserting a small tube-like structure, a nasal trumpet, in your nose. After checking the nasal cavity, the nasal trumpet will be removed, and an endotracheal tube will be inserted into one of your nostrils. A tube-like structure known as a laryngoscope will be inserted into the oral cavity to visualize your local cords (larynx). The laryngoscope will be used as a guide to correctly insert the endotracheal tube through the vocal cords into your windpipe. The windpipe is the part of your airway that is connected to your lung. Your doctor may still need to check if the tube has been placed correctly. To confirm this, they will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope. The endotracheal tube will then be connected to the ventilator."
What are the complications of nasotracheal intubation?,"'The complications that can arise while performing the nasotracheal intubation include:' Damage to nasal cavity: Your nose might bleed (epistaxis) when it is accidentally damaged during intubation. Damage to teeth: Teeth may get injured during laryngoscopy. Vocal cord damage: You may experience a sore throat or difficulty speaking due to vocal cord damage. Infection of trachea or lungs: You may find it hard to breathe due to infection of the trachea or lungs.  Pneumothorax: This complication involves the leaking of air in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. Obstruction of the endotracheal tube: Foreign bodies, polyps, or blood clots might partially or completely obstruct the endotracheal tube. Aspiration: Whatever you eat may get pulled into the lung."
What is an occipital nerve stimulation procedure?,"'Occipital nerve stimulation is a therapeutic procedure to implant an electrical device that diminishes the function of the occipital nerve. The device consists of electrodes connected with insulated leads to a pulse generator that delivers small electrical impulses to the occipital nerve. The electrical impulses produce a tingling sensation and block the transmission of ''pain'' signals to the brain.''Occipital nerve stimulation is a minimally invasive procedure developed in the early 1990s, for management of certain intractable ''pain'' syndromes that do not respond to treatments with medication. The stimulation can be tailored to suit individual needs and is reversible.' "
What does the occipital nerve control?,"'The occipital nerves provide sensation to the entire back of the head and the ears.''The occipital nerves are a group of nerves that arise from the top of the spine and pass under the neck muscle, up the ''scalp''. to the top of the head. Three sets of nerves with several branches emerge out of the ''spinal nerve'', on each side of the back of the head:' Greater occipital nerves: two great nerves that are on either side of the back of the head, covering most of the scalp right up to the top of the head. Lesser occipital nerves: two nerves on the side of the neck running behind each ear. Third occipital nerves: two short nerves located centrally just above the neck."
Why is occipital nerve stimulation performed?,"'Occipital nerve stimulation is performed to provide pain relief from chronic, intractable daily ''headaches'' that do not respond to treatment with medication. ''Headaches'' that occur 15 days or more in a month are considered chronic.''Occipital nerve stimulation is used treat''Occipital nerve stimulation has been found to be beneficial in reducing pain for conditions that include' Headaches that lack a clear underlying cause (chronic, intractable primary headache disorder) Headaches that result due to underlying causes (chronic, intractable secondary headache disorders) such as:Medication overuseOpioid overusePost-traumaInflammationSinus infectionBrain infectionSystemic illnessesIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (Pressure buildup in the cranium)Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (Drop in pressure in the cranium)Temporal arteritis (inflammation of artery in the head) Medication overuse Opioid overuse Post-trauma Inflammation Sinus infection Brain infection Systemic illnesses Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (Pressure buildup in the cranium) Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (Drop in pressure in the cranium) Temporal arteritis (inflammation of artery in the head) Neuropathic pain (neuralgia) in the occipital area Intractable occipital neuralgia Occipital headaches Intractable migraine Postherpetic neuralgia (persistent neuralgia after shingles) Cervicogenic headache (originating from the neck) Tension headaches Cluster headaches Posttraumatic headache Chronic daily headaches (transformed migraine) Chronic headache due to whiplash injury Newly developed persistent headache with no history (new daily persistent headache) Hemicrania continua (persistent one-sided headache)"
When do you need adrenalectomy?,"'Most of the time, your doctor accidentally discovers enlarged adrenal glands or abnormal growth (mass) on adrenal glands. This may be observed on your ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') and computed tomography (''CT scan'') done for other conditions.''Currently, ''laparoscopy'' is a commonly used technique for adrenalectomy. However, open adrenalectomy will be performed in those conditions where laparoscopic adrenalectomy is not possible. These conditions include the following:' Your doctor will plan adrenalectomy on you if Your adrenal mass is greater than 6 cm. He suspects adrenal cancer such as pheochromocytoma. Your adrenal gland is secreting hormones in excess such as in Cushing’s syndrome. Obesity Multiple previous abdominal surgeries Large cancerous growth Suspicion of the spread of adrenal cancer to adjacent structures"
What is done before open adrenalectomy?,"'Your doctor can order for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the location and size of the adrenal mass. Routine blood tests will also be done.''Before the surgery, you will be informed regarding the procedure, and your consent will be taken. The following information will be provided to you:' Adrenalectomy approach that has been decided Approximate length and location of your incision Risks involved in removing the suspected cancer mass Care that needs to be taken after the surgery Why an ipsilateral nephrectomy (removal of the kidney from the same side) may be required and consent for the same"
How is open adrenalectomy performed?,"'Open adrenalectomy still plays an important role in the armamentarium of adrenal surgeons.' The surgery is performed under general anesthesia so that you remain asleep throughout the procedure. A large incision of about 6-12 inch will be made in the upper abdomen or flank just below the ribs. The adrenal gland will be located and delicately separated from its attachments.  Once the adrenal gland has been dissected free, it is then removed through the incision. The entire adrenal gland needs to be excised (cut) to remove the tumor safely. The surgical wound is closed with surgical threads (sutures) and bandaged."
What are the side effects of having an adrenal gland removed?,'Removal of adrenal glands may lead to the following side effects:' Headache Sweating Palpitations (rapid heartbeats) High blood pressure Low blood sugar Loss of libido
How long does it take to recover from open adrenalectomy?,"'Most patients take 5 to 6 weeks to recover from an open adrenalectomy.' If there are no complications, you will be discharged from the hospital three to five days after the surgery. You will be prescribed painkillers to help relieve your surgical wound pain. You can resume normal activities after recovery including driving, light lifting, and work, or as advised by your doctor. In case of bilateral adrenal gland removal, your doctor may start you on lifelong medications to compensate for the low hormonal levels of steroids that are secreted by the adrenal glands."
What is done before resection rectopexy?, The diagnosis of rectal prolapse is made through physical examination. Your doctor will take your complete history and examine you to check if you are fit for the surgery. You might have to undergo a special test known as defecography where the doctor can capture (X-ray) or see the movements (video) of your sigmoid colon and rectum while you defecate.  You may also be asked to undergo a procedure known as colonoscopy where a tube-like camera will be inserted into your rectum to check if there is any bleeding. Your doctor will counsel you about the risks and complications of the surgical procedure. You will be given medicated enema a night before the surgery to clear your bowels. You must not eat anything for six to 12 hours before your surgery. Take only necessary medicines with sips of water.
What happens during resection rectopexy?," You’ll receive fluids through a needle inserted in your veins (IV). Next, you will be put under general anesthesia that makes you sleep throughout the procedure. Depending on the type of surgery—open or laparoscopic—incisions will be made on your abdomen. Your surgeon will retrieve the sigmoid colon and cut (resect) it. The rectum will be lifted and stitched (anastomosis) to the open end of the colon (descending colon) to restore it to its normal position. The rectum will also be stitched adequately to secure it in place. The surgical wound will be sutured closed with absorbable surgical thread and bandaged."
What happens after resection rectopexy?," You will be transferred to the surgical ward and observed for several hours after the surgery. Only oral medicines with a few sips of water will be allowed right after the surgery. You will be instructed to eat only a soft diet (no raw fruits and vegetables) as tolerated from the next day of your surgery. Pain medications will relieve your surgical wound pain. You will be able to get out of bed the same night of your surgery. If there are no complications, you will be discharged after one to seven days post-surgery.  The length of your hospital stay also depends on how early you are able to pass gas and stool. Upon discharge, your surgeon will give you specific instructions for your early recovery while at home.  Follow-up with your surgeon will be scheduled for around 14 days after surgery. You can resume your normal activities once you are home.  If you become constipated or have any other concerns, contact your doctor."
Is resection rectopexy major surgery?,'Resection rectopexy is a major surgery that comes with the following possible complications:' Infection (external and internal) Injury to adjacent structures like ureter or vagina Prolonged paralytic ileus (loss of muscle functioning of the colon) Leakage of feces from the colon Recurrence of rectal prolapse  Bowel obstruction Hernia Diarrhea Bowel incontinence Damage to surrounding nerves resulting in sexual and urinary problems
When do you need open pleural drainage?,'You need pleural drainage if you suffer from the below conditions:''You will need open pleural drainage when you are so debilitated that you cannot undergo an extensive surgical procedure for draining your pleural fluid.''Your doctor will prefer open pleural drainage over other techniques if' Pleural effusion: It is an excessive collection of the pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. Pneumothorax: It is leakage of air in the pleural activity. Hemothorax: It is a collection of blood in the pleural cavity. Empyema: It is a collection of pus in the pleural cavity. If you suffer from severe nutritional deficiency. If you need pleural drainage for long term. If you have developed pus in the pleura after lung procedures (post-pneumonectomy empyema).
What is done before open pleural drainage?,"'Before the procedure, these steps will be administered:' Your doctor will examine and look for your present signs and symptoms. He will order an X-ray and computed tomography (CT scan) of your chest to decide the best approach for your open pleural drainage. You and your family will be explained about the procedure and its complications, and your written consent will be taken officially for the same."
How is open pleural drainage performed?,"'Once examination is complete, the procedure will be performed.' You will be told to sit at 45° angle with your arm raised behind the head to expose the armpit area (in a forward lean position). The skin of your back will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. Anesthetics solution will be injected locally to numb the area where the drain will be inserted. This will make the procedure less painful for you. Your doctor may also give you painkillers and sedatives. The doctor will make a large U-shaped incision (5 cm wide and 6-7 cm long) known as an Eloesser flap. Optionally, doctors can make an H-shaped or inverted U-shaped incision. Through the incision, a segment of the rib will be removed, and the skin flaps will then be sutured to the pleura and the remaining edges of skin sutured together. This is done to prevent pneumothorax (air entry in the pleura). The wound will be left open to allow the drainage as required (for several days) or permanently."
What is done after open pleural drainage?,"'After the procedure is complete, without complication, follow up is then performed.' A chest X-ray will be performed regularly followed by chest computed tomography (CT scan) to confirm the resolution of your original disease."
What are the complications of open pleural drainage?,"'Generally, open pleural drainage will be well-tolerated by you. Some of the complications that may arise include:' Pneumothorax (collection of air in the pleura) Inadequate drainage of pus in empyema Irritation of the surrounding skin"
When is operative hysteroscopy indicated?,"'Operative hysteroscopy is indicated to correct the following uterine conditions:' Polyps and fibroids Asherman syndrome (a condition where bands of scar tissue form in the uterus that may lead to infertility and menstrual changes) Septums (a malformation of the uterus that is present from birth) Abnormal bleeding (characterized by heavy or lengthy menstrual flow, as well as bleeding between periods or after menopause) Blockage of the fallopian tube Removal of residual fetal tissue after the termination of pregnancy Sterilization"
When should be operative hysteroscopy avoided?,'Operative hysteroscopy should be avoided in:' Pregnancy Cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) Active infection of the pelvis Cancer of the cervix or endometrium Underlying conditions that may be exacerbated due to volume overload Allergy to nickel or radioactive contrast dye
What to expect during an operative hysteroscopy?,"'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' The physician will take details of your medical and medication history. Inform the physician about any medical conditions, pregnancy, or active infection of the reproductive system. The physician will enquire about your menstrual cycle and the last menstrual date. You may get medications to induce the thinning of the endometrial lining (inner lining of the uterus). The physician will obtain your consent before the procedure. Before the procedure, the doctor may prescribe a sedative to help you relax. You will be positioned on an operating table. A urinary catheter may be placed before entering the operating room. An IV line will be established in the arm or hand. The hair around the surgical site may be shaved. The cervix will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. You may get local anesthesia, either an epidural or spinal block to numb you from the waist down. The doctor uses a speculum to view the cervix. Next, the doctor uses a type of forceps, called a tenaculum, to hold the cervix throughout the procedure. The doctor may dilate the cervix for the hysteroscope to enter. Once the hysteroscope reaches the uterus through the vagina and cervix, it pumps out carbon dioxide gas or a liquid solution to expand it and to clear away the blood and mucus. The light from the hysteroscope helps the physician to view the uterus and detect any abnormalities. Next, small instruments are inserted into the uterus through the hysteroscope to perform surgery. You may be able to go home the same day if the procedure is performed in an outpatient setting. You can resume your regular diet. For extensive surgery, you may experience cramping or mild spotting following the procedure. After the removal of the polyps, women can attempt pregnancy in the next menstrual cycle. In other surgeries, pregnancy should be delayed by 3 months or as directed by the doctor. You may have to follow up for 2-4 weeks after the procedure. You may develop some rare complications after the surgery, which include:InfectionBleedingHeavy bleedingScarring of the uterusInjury to the cervix, uterus, bowel, or bladder Infection Bleeding Heavy bleeding Scarring of the uterus Injury to the cervix, uterus, bowel, or bladder"
What is operative laparoscopy?,"'Operative ''laparoscopy'' is a type of minimally invasive surgery that is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of abdominal disorders. Laparoscopy involves the insertion of a thin, flexible, tube-like instrument into the patient’s abdomen. While performing operative laparoscopy, the physician inserts additional instruments, such as''Operative laparoscopy may be indicated in''The operative laparoscopy approach has several advantages, such as' Probes Scissors Grasping instruments Biopsy forceps Electrosurgical or laser instruments Suture materials Treatment of scar tissues around the fallopian tubes and ovaries (adhesions) Removal of ovarian cysts Treatment of ectopic pregnancy (embryo implants somewhere other than the uterus) Blocked fallopian tubes Removal of fibroids from the uterus Removal or destruction of the endometrium that grows outside the uterus, ovaries or peritoneum Removal of diseased ovaries and damaged fallopian tubes Removal of the appendix Removal of the gallbladder Tubal ligation (permanent sterilization procedure for women) Short hospital stays Better cosmetic result Fast recovery and earlier return to daily activities Less risk of postoperative scar tissue formation"
When should operative laparoscopy be avoided?,'People with the following conditions shouldn’t undergo operative laparoscopy' Raised intracranial pressure (extreme pressure within the skull) Shock Retinal detachment (a condition where the retina pulls away from supportive tissue) Pregnancy Large pelvic masses (tumors in the area between the two hip bones) Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (surgery to remove excess cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain) Compromised cardiopulmonary status (heart conditions that affect the heart’s ability to pump a sufficient amount of blood to the rest of the body) Obesity Abdominal hernia Cancer Previous laparotomies (a surgical incision into the abdominal cavity for diagnosis or in preparation for major surgery)
How do you prepare for an operative laparoscopy?,"'Before the surgery, take care of the following things' Don’t take aspirin or any medications that have aspirin in it. Inform the physician about allergy to any medicines, latex, tape, iodine or anesthesia. Inform the physician about all the medicines that the patient takes. Do not use tampons, vaginal creams, douche or have sexual intercourse before the procedure. Inform the physician about any history of bleeding disorders. This procedure is usually done when the patient is not menstruating. Inform the doctor if the patient is pregnant."
How is operative laparoscopy performed?,"'Operative laparoscopy is performed under general anesthesia. The physician makes three to four small incisions in the abdomen. Next, the physician inserts a specialized instrument with a video camera attached, known as a laparoscope, into the abdomen through the incision near the navel. The physician also inserts additional instruments, such as''With the help of a laparoscope, the physician examines the pelvis including the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder and appendix to identify the issue. After identifying the issue, the physician may treat the disorders and close the incision.' Probes Scissors Grasping instruments Biopsy forceps Electrosurgical or laser instruments Suture materials"
What can you expect after operative laparoscopy?,"'Following operative laparoscopy, the patient may expect the following things''Contact the physician if the patient observes' The navel area may be tender and bruised. Anesthesia may cause nausea and dizziness. Daily activities can be resumed after a few days. Abdominal pain Worsening nausea and vomiting A temperature of 101° F or greater Drainage of pus from an incision Significant bleeding from an incision"
What is the optic nerve?,"'The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that are part of the central nervous system. They are located at the back of the eye and serve as communication cables between the eyes and brain. They use electrical impulses to transfer visual information from the retina to the vision centers of the brain. When the optic nerve is squeezed due to tumors or ''cancers'', the blood supply and ability to send the messages and signals through the nerve may be impaired.' "
What are the causes of ONSM?,"'The cause of optic nerve sheath meningioma is still unknown, and research is still being conducted.' Exposure to ionizing radiation: Ionizing radiation may cause two types of harm to humans: direct tissue damage and cancer, which also include ONSM. Neurofibromatosis type 2: It is a condition in which the nervous system develops noncancerous tumors. It is mostly hereditary. Chromosome abnormality: A few people with ONSM has improper chromosome 22 abnormality, including the region containing the NF2 gene."
How is optic nerve sheath meningioma diagnosed?,"'Vision examination, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), ''ultrasonography'', and computed tomography (CT) imaging of the head is usually considered for diagnosing optic nerve sheath meningioma. The findings include:' Vision loss: Vision is measured by testing on a vision chart. This is usually reduced or may be mildly affected. The doctor may notice that there is less amount of light going into the affected eye by swinging a bright light from one eye to the other. Change in optic nerve vessels: The back of the eye often shows changes including swelling of the beginning of the nerve or relative thinning of the optic nerve due to calcification. Enlarged blood vessels also called optociliary shunt vessels are usually seen in imaging. The eye may have been pushed forward by the optic nerve sheath meningioma."
How is optic nerve sheath meningioma treated?,"'Treatment may not be required if the tumor is slow-growing and not causing symptoms. In younger patients, however, the tumor is more likely to be aggressive and fast-growing, which may be an indication for surgery. Treatment plans include:' Wait and watch: Orbital meningioma is typically a slow-growing tumor. Once diagnosed, meningioma can be observed for growth prior to considering intervention. Observation is the acceptable management in cases where the visual function is intact or remains stable, especially in patients who maintain a better vision. Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy has been used both pre-operatively and postoperatively for many years. Stereotactic radiotherapy delivers the appropriate amount of radiation to the tumor in a localized fashion. However, damage to the optic nerve and retina are the side effects. Endoscopic procedure: Transnasal endoscopic optic nerve decompression has shown stabilization of the disease and in some cases, improvement in the vision. Tumor resection: In rare cases, the tumor is surgically removed, especially if the tumor is spreading and an individual lost most of the vision. Tumor resection is also considered in conditions when the patient has a bulging eye. Unfortunately, surgery may damage the nerve and cause vision to get worse. Sometimes, radiotherapy is given after surgery to reduce the risk of it coming back later in life. Unfortunately, radiotherapy may also damage the vision."
What is paracentesis?,"'Paracentesis is a procedure for removing fluid from a body ''cavity'' or a ''cyst'' with a hollow needle or catheter. Paracentesis commonly refers to peritoneocentesis, which is removal of fluid from the abdominal (peritoneal) ''cavity''. Paracentesis of the chest cavity is known as thoracentesis.' "
What is abdominal paracentesis?,'An abdominal paracentesis is a procedure done to remove fluid from the abdominal cavity. This may be a sample removal for testing purposes or a treatment for patients who have fluid in the abdomen (''ascites'').' 
What is ascites?,"'Ascites is a condition in which excessive fluid collects in the patient’s abdominal cavity, causing symptoms including:''Ascites is usually a result of pressure buildup in the veins of the ''liver''. When the liver is unable to function normally, the kidneys can’t ''flush'' excess salt and fluid. As a result, fluid builds up in the abdominal cavity.\xa0''Ascites may be caused by' feeling of fullness distension of stomach pain or a dull ache in the stomach rapid weight gain loss of appetite and nausea indigestion and vomiting swelling or edema of legs and ankles liver cirrhosis, failure and other liver diseases blood clot in the liver’s veins (portal vein thrombosis) kidney failure heart failure peritoneal cancer inflammation of pancreas or the biliary system peritonitis or inflammation of the peritoneum from bacterial infection impaired blood supply or blockage in the bowel"
Why would someone need a paracentesis?,"'Paracentesis may be performed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. It is usually considered when treatment with diuretics -- known as water pills -- that flush out the fluid, and restriction in fluid and salt intake do not stop the fluid buildup. Some patients may need repeated fluid draining.''Fluid is removed for diagnosis in patients with:''Paracentesis is avoided in patients with:' New-onset ascites to determine the cause Suspected bacterial peritonitis Refractory ascites, or ascites that recurs despite treatment Paracentesis is performed as a treatment when ascites induces Impaired breathing Abdominal pain or pressure An acute abdomen that requires surgery Low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia) Bleeding or clotting disorders It has to be done with extra caution in certain situations such as: Pregnancy Distended bowel or bladder Adhesions from previous surgery Cellulitis in the abdominal wall"
How long does a paracentesis take?,"'A paracentesis usually takes about 30 minutes to complete. If a large amount of fluid needs to be drained, it might take longer.' "
How is a paracentesis done?,"'A ''gastroenterologist'' usually performs a paracentesis as an outpatient procedure. People with refractory ascites or severe complications from the underlying disease are likely to be hospitalized.' The doctor goes through the medical history of the patient and evaluates them physically. The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests. The patient must inform the doctor of any allergies or regular medications taken. The patient’s bladder is emptied with a catheter, if necessary. The entry point is usually at the midline of the stomach, 2 cm below the navel, or 5 cm from the navel on either side of the stomach. Doctors use ultrasonography to select the entry site and insert the needle, avoiding blood vessels and abdominal organs. The doctor numbs the stomach wall with local anesthesia. The doctor makes a tiny incision in the skin. The doctor then inserts a hollow needle with a syringe till fluid starts appearing in the syringe. The doctor will fill vials with samples for testing, or insert a catheter and drain the excess fluid. After the procedure the puncture site is closed with a bandage. Typically patients are under observation for about 30 minutes and given painkillers as needed. The patient may require a low-fluid and low-salt diet."
Does paracentesis hurt?,"'The anesthetic injection might cause a brief sting, and there might be a little ''pain'' or pressure when the catheter is inserted.' "
What are the risks of paracentesis?,"'Paracentesis is generally a safe procedure, life-saving in some. There are some associated risks and complications, depending on the patient’s condition also to some extent. The risks may include:' Failure in attempt to collect or drain fluid Infection at the puncture site Dizziness when large volume of fluid is removed Persistent leak from the puncture site Hematoma in the abdominal wall Injury to stomach, bladder or intestines Injury to blood vessels and bleeding Low blood pressure and low sodium Kidney failure"
How would I know if I have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?,"'The diagnosis of ''polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS'') can be most accurately made by a doctor who will examine you and order certain blood tests and other investigations. The symptoms of ''PCOS'' may or may not be definitive at times. If you have PCOS, you may experience the following:''For the diagnosis of PCOS, your doctor will look for the presence of at least two of the following three symptoms:''Two of the aforementioned three criteria are essential for the diagnosis of PCOS. The mere presence of cysts is not enough because many women without PCOS may have ''ovarian cysts''. Additionally, many women who have PCOS may not have cysts in their ovaries.' Irregular or absent monthly periods Acne Thinning of scalp hair Hirsutism (excessive hair growth on the face and body) Acanthosis nigricans (darkening of the skin, especially along the neck creases, in the groin, and under the breasts Skin tags (small excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area) Weight gain or difficulty in losing weight Infertility or difficulty in conceiving Irregular or absent monthly periods, which is caused by the lack of ovulation Higher-than-normal levels of androgens (male hormones), which can cause excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne, or thinning of scalp hair Multiple small cysts on the ovaries seen on ultrasonography (imaging studies)"
What exactly is PCOS?,"'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the commonest treatable causes of ''infertility''. It is a medical condition that causes imbalances in the reproductive hormones in women. Ovaries are almond-shaped organs that are part of the reproductive system in women. They make the egg that is released every month during the ''menstrual cycle''. Hormonal imbalance in PCOS affects the ovaries. Thus, in PCOS, the egg may not develop or may not be released normally.''PCOS is a common condition affecting 1 in 10 women. It is also one of the most common causes of infertility in women, affecting around five million women in the United States. Women with PCOS may have irregular periods, infertility, ''acne'', thinning of hair, and weight gain. Irregular periods affect the ability to conceive and cause the development of small fluid-filled sacs (cysts) in the ovaries.' "
Can a woman with PCOS get pregnant?,"'Yes, a woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can get ''pregnant''. PCOS is a very common but treatable cause of infertility affecting around five million women in the United States. With proper lifestyle management (healthy ''diet'' and physical activity) and medications, women with PCOS can get pregnant and give birth to a healthy baby.\xa0''Hormonal imbalance in women with PCOS interferes with the growth and release of the ovum (egg) from the ovaries (ovulation). Ovulation is necessary for a woman to get pregnant. If you have PCOS and wish to conceive, you must consult your doctor. They may prescribe you treatment to help you ovulate and increase your chances of conceiving.\xa0''You can use an ovulation calculator to know the days you are most likely to be ''fertile''. During the typical menstrual cycle of around 28 days, although it varies in different women, there are about six days when you can get pregnant (the fertile window). The ovulation calculator helps you to know your fertile window and increases your likelihood of ''getting pregnant''.' "
What is PDA heart surgery?,"'Ductus arteriosus is a normal connection or opening in a fetus between the descending thoracic ''aorta'' and the pulmonary artery. In normal development, the ductus arteriosus closes after birth. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure surgery is a procedure to close this connection if it persists (remains patent) after birth.''The procedure may be performed as' Open surgery: the surgeon accesses the thoracic cavity through a large incision in the chest (thoracotomy) and uses standard surgical instruments to perform the procedure. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): the surgeon makes tiny incisions and performs the procedure with tiny surgical instruments inserted through a flexible tube that has a lighted camera (thoracoscope). Catheter closure: A plug or coil-like metal device is inserted to block the PDA. The device is advanced through the femoral vein in the groin, into the heart and the PDA, using a flexible tube (catheter)."
What is PDA (patent ductus arteriosis)?,"'In an unborn baby, the mother supplies oxygen and the ''lungs'' are deflated and nonfunctional. The lungs receive only 5% to 8% of the blood that enters the pulmonary artery. Most of the blood is diverted back through the ductus arteriosus, into the ''descending aorta'' for circulation in the body.''The ductus arteriosus closes normally within three days after birth in full-term and normal-birth-weight ''babies'', beginning as soon as the lungs expand and start functioning. When the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth, the condition is known as patent ductus arteriosus. PDA is mostly diagnosed soon after birth or in childhood but can sometimes go undetected until adulthood.' "
Why is a PDA surgery performed?,"'PDA causes extra blood to be pumped into the pulmonary artery. This forces the heart and lungs to work harder to pump the blood out. If the PDA is untreated, it can lead to\xa0''People with PDA are at high risk for bacterial infection of the heart’s inner layer (bacterial ''endocarditis''). A small PDA may cause no symptoms other than a ''heart murmur'', but a large PDA can result in conditions such as''PDA may take longer to close in preterm and low-birth-weight babies. In a premature baby, the doctor may elect to wait and monitor the PDA if there are no symptoms of congestive ''heart failure''. The doctor often administers nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') to induce PDA closure.''PDA closure surgery is performed when medications do not help in closing the PDA in premature infants, and they develop symptoms of congestive heart failure. Catheter closure is not suitable for premature babies as their blood vessels are too small.''In asymptomatic children and adults, the PDA surgery may be delayed if the PDA is small and does not cause any health issues. All PDA will, however, eventually require intervention since they can be potentially fatal.' high pressure in the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), pulmonary obstructive disease, lung congestion, and congestive heart failure. Rapid breathing Difficulty breathing Respiratory infections Fatigue Poor growth in children"
Who should not get PDA surgery?,'PDA closure is not undertaken in the presence of certain vascular or heart abnormalities because survival may depend on the blood pumped through the PDA. The abnormalities include:' Reversed position (transposition) of the aorta and pulmonary artery Severely narrowed aorta (coarctation of aorta) Underdeveloped or blocked heart valves (heart valve atresia) Underdeveloped lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) Underdeveloped pulmonary artery (pulmonary artery hypoplasia) Underdevelopment of the left ventricle (hypoplastic left ventricle)
What is percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage?,"'Percutaneous transhepatic ''biliary drainage'' or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD) is a procedure to drain bile to relieve pressure in the bile ducts caused by a blockage.\xa0''The ''liver'' makes bile which helps in ''digestion'' of the ''fats''.\xa0The bile passes through a series of small tubes (called ducts) that drain into a large duct, called the common bile duct. The common bile duct empties into the first part of the small bowel (duodenum).\xa0The bile produced in the liver is also stored in the gallbladder.\xa0\xa0\xa0''If the bile duct(s) gets blocked, the bile cannot drain normally and gets collected before to the site of the blockage.\xa0The signs of blocked bile ducts are ''jaundice'' (yellowing of the skin and white of the eye), ''dark urine'', light- or clay-colored stools, ''itching'', ''nausea'', and ''loss of appetite''.\xa0This condition is potentially serious and needs to be treated.\xa0\xa0\xa0''In percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage a small, flexible, ''plastic'' tube is placed through the skin into the liver to drain a blocked bile duct system. ''Ultrasound'' and x-ray of the abdomen locate the blockage of bile flow. Thereafter, the images made by ultrasound guide the placement of small plastic or metal tube (''stent'') in the liver to drain bile. The bile drains via the stent into the small bowel or in a collection bag outside the body. This procedure may relieve the obstruction symptoms before surgery is done.' "
Who needs percutaneous biliary drainage?,"'The commonest indication for percutaneous biliary drainage (PBD) is blockage or abnormal narrowing (stricture) of the bile ducts.\xa0Many conditions can cause this, including:''Percutaneous biliary drainage provides an alternative pathway to the bile to exit the liver.\xa0The drainage may be needed in preparation for surgery or other procedures on the bile ducts, such as removal of a bile duct stone or ''tumor''.''PBD should, however, be avoided if there is:' Gallstones (stones in the gallbladder or within the bile ducts) Tumors of the bile ducts, liver, gallbladder or pancreas Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Sclerosing cholangitis (a type of inflammation of the bile ducts) Enlarged lymph nodes in the region of the liver and pancreas Postoperative strictures (narrowing of the bile ducts or perforation due to injury to the bile ducts during surgery) Perforation  Infection Massive ascites (excessive collection of fluid in the abdomen) Multiple obstructions within the liver Bleeding disorders"
What are the complications of percutaneous biliary drainage?,'The complications of the procedure may include:' Bile leakage Hemobilia (bleeding from or into the biliary tree) Cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts) Hemothorax (collection of blood between the chest wall and the lungs) Pancreatitis Infection
How long can I live with a biliary drainage bag?,"'The duration for which you will have the drainage bag attached varies, so your treating doctor can best answer this question. You must learn to take care of the biliary drainage bag. Avoid making any sudden movements and make sure that the drainage bag can move freely with you.\xa0 You will be able to lead a fairly normal life with the drainage bag. The bag, however, needs to be emptied frequently so that it does not become too heavy.' "
What does percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation mean?,"'Percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation (PTJV) is a procedure to deliver oxygen to the ''lungs''. Oxygen is delivered at a high pressure\xa0by inserting a thin flexible tube (catheter) through the skin (percutaneously) into the windpipe (trachea) using a high-pressure ''gas'' source.\xa0''The technique was introduced in the 1950s. By the early 1970s, it was successfully used for ''airway'' management during routine general surgical procedures lasting up to two hours. PTJV is specifically useful for life-threatening situations, such as sudden respiratory failure, where quick access to the airways by conventional techniques (such as tracheal ''intubation'' and\xa0bag-mask-valve ventilation)\xa0cannot be performed.\xa0''In such circumstances, PTJV with a wide (large-bore) needle gives quick oxygenation and ventilation by providing adequate gas exchange and ensuring the patency of the airway until a definitive procedure (e.g., oral intubation with ''bronchoscopy'' followed by\xa0surgically gaining access to the trachea) can be performed. The procedure requires fewer instruments and can be performed more quickly than the ones mentioned above.''PTJV is suitable in any situation where intubation (inserting a tube for ''breathing'' in the trachea) cannot be achieved or should be avoided. The procedure is typically helpful in the following cases:' As a means of ventilation during surgery and procedures on the upper airway.   PTJV can force aspirated secretions out of the upper part of the trachea (proximal trachea) and may force a foreign body out of the proximal trachea (in cases of partial airway obstruction). It is a fast means for obtaining airway control in both planned and emergency surgeries for patients of all ages and varied clinical situations.  PTJV is the surgical airway of choice for children younger than 12 years because their small tracheal diameter makes intubation difficult."
What happens during percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation?,"'During a PTJV procedure' The doctor administers local anesthesia.Anesthetic medicine may be sprayed in the patient’s trachea to suppress the cough reflexes. Anesthetic medicine may be sprayed in the patient’s trachea to suppress the cough reflexes. The patient lies with the neck exposed. The head may be in a “sniffing” position (hyperextended) to make Adam’s apple prominent. The doctor feels the dip/notch just below Adam’s apple where the needle has to be inserted. A wide-bore needle attached to a syringe containing saline is inserted through the skin while exerting negative pressure on the barrel of the syringe. Air bubbles in the fluid-filled syringe indicate entry into the larynx (voice box).  After entering the larynx, a thin tube (cannula) is advanced into the larynx and trachea and then the needle is removed. The doctor secures the cannula by suturing it to the skin or by placing a circumferential tie around the neck. An oxygen source is connected to the cannula. A trial of several bursts of oxygen flow is done to ensure that the cannula is correctly placed and the setup is ventilating the patient properly"
What are the complications of percutaneous transtracheal jet ventilation?,"'The following complications may occur with PTJV:' Aspiration (accidental entry of food or secretions into the trachea) Bleeding Pneumothorax (the presence of air or gas in the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall) Subcutaneous emphysema (air or gas under the skin)  Injuries Catheter-related problems (e.g., obstruction or blockage of the catheter, kinking of the catheter, catheter displacement or misplaced or unsuccessful needle or catheter placement)  Inadequate ventilation  Infection"
What is pericardiocentesis?,"'Pericardiocentesis is an invasive procedure to remove fluid from the protective sac (pericardium) around the ''heart''. Pericardium is a thin, two-layered sac with a small amount of fluid. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure by which excessive ''pericardial'' fluid (''pericardial effusion'') is drained. Fluid removed is then tested for causes.' "
What are the types of pericardiocentesis?,"'Pericardiocentesis may be performed with three main approaches.\xa0''Traditionally, the subcostal approach was considered the safest. This may not always be practical, as the fluid may not be present evenly in the pericardial space. The advent of imaging guidance has made it possible for doctors to use other approaches more safely, depending on where the fluid is accumulated.' Subxiphoid or subcostal: This is the most common angle for the needle insertion, from just below the breastbone. Parasternal: The needle is inserted in the fifth left intercostal space (space between the ribs), close to the edge of the sternum. Apical: The needle is inserted 1-2 cm lateral to the apex of the left ventricle."
Why is pericardiocentesis performed?,"'Pericardiocentesis is performed to remove fluid from the pericardial space for either diagnosis or treatment. It may be performed' As an emergency procedure for cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening accumulation of fluid affecting heart function To relieve symptoms of pericardial effusion such asshortness of breathrapid breathing shortness of breath rapid breathing To extract samples for diagnosing the cause of pericardial effusion"
What causes pericardial effusion?,"'Pericardial effusion may be caused by' Chest injury from stabbing or gunshot Trauma to the chest from an accident Heart attack and heart failure Rupture of aortic aneurysm Cardiac and other surgeries in the chest region Accidental perforation due to procedures like placement of pacemaker or catheter, and angiography Anticoagulant treatment like blood thinners Certain drugs which cause fluid to accumulate Final stages of lung and other cancers Radiation treatment to the chest and radiofrequency ablation Inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) caused by viral or bacterial infections High level of urea in the blood (uremia) due to kidney disease/failure Still disease Hypothyroidism Connective tissue diseases such as Lupus Rheumatoid arthritis Dermatomyositis Genetic muscle degeneration disease (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection"
How is pericardiocentesis performed?,"'Pericardiocentesis is usually performed by a cardiac surgeon. The actual procedure may take up to an hour, but drainage may go on for a few hours as required. The surgeon uses one of the following guiding techniques:' Fluoroscopy-guided: This is performed in heart catheterization labs using a contrast medium in the needle which indicates the correct position for needle insertion. Echo-guided technique: The surgeon inserts the needle guided by images in the echocardiography monitor. CT-guided: This technique is not widely available and not useful in emergencies. It is used to decide the needle position and does not allow continuous visualization. A final scan is useful in diagnosing the underlying disease. The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests. The patient may need to avoid eating or drinking for 6 hours prior. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medication and inform them about allergies. The patient lies in a semi-reclining position at 30- to 45-degree angle. The doctor may give a mild sedative. The doctor will attach an IV line for medications. The patient will receive supplemental oxygen. The patient’s blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate will be continuously monitored. The doctor will choose the puncture site guided by the imaging monitor. The doctor will administer a local anesthetic to numb the area. The doctor will insert a hollow needle with a syringe into the pericardium. The doctor will draw fluid for testing and attach a catheter to the needle to drain the excess fluid. The catheter may stay attached for a few hours. After excess fluid is drained the doctor will remove the catheter and needle and apply a bandage on the puncture site. The doctor will monitor the patient’s vital functions until they stabilize. Recovery time depends on the underlying cause for the pericardial effusion."
When should a pericardial drain be removed?,"'The pericardial drain may be left in place for as long as a day, but is typically removed as soon as possible to reduce chances of infection.' "
What are the risks and complications of pericardiocentesis?,"'Pericardiocentesis is a major invasive procedure on a vital organ. It is potentially life-saving, but risky, and the severity of complications may depend on the underlying condition. The risks include:' Irregular heartbeat Heart attack Cardiac arrest Injury to major blood vessels Puncture of the heart, lung, liver or stomach Infection Unsuccessful procedure requiring more invasive surgery"
What is perineal reconstruction?,'Perineal reconstruction is rebuilding of damaged or deformed tissue between the genitals and anus. Perineal reconstruction is typically done for acquired and congenital deformities or reconstruction following ''cancer'' surgery in genital and urinary parts of the body.\xa0It is usually performed by a ''plastic surgeon'' using tissue flap techniques.' 
Why is perineal reconstruction done?,"'Perineal reconstruction is indicated when the anticipated defect is large and cannot be enclosed with simple ''sutures''.\xa0Hence, it is performed to close defects and restore perineal function. It may also include penile or vaginal reconstruction.''The surgeon assesses the patient’s nutritional status, blood parameters, the degree and nature of the expected perineal ''wound'' or defect and function. This assessment often follows traumatic procedures such as ''cancer'' ablation. Based on the assessment of the individual, the surgeon decides the particular flap type used for reconstruction.' "
What are flaps in reconstructive surgery?,"'Flap is a tissue lifted from a donor site and moved to a site of defect with an intact blood supply.''Types of flaps include' Cutaneous flaps contain full thickness of skin and superficial fascia. Ideal for small defects. Fascio-cutaneous flaps contain full thickness of skin, superficial fascia, subcutaneous tissue, deep fascia and more blood supply with ability to fill a larger defect. Musculocutaneous or myocutaneous flaps contain an addition of muscle layer to fascio-cutaneous flap. Provides bulk to fill deeper defects and restore function. Muscle flaps contain only muscle tissue to fill defects and restore function. Skin may be used to cover it if needed. Bone flaps contain bone tissue and are used with bony defects. "
What are the flaps used in perineal reconstruction?,'Many regions of the body are suitable to be used as flaps in perineal reconstruction. The choice of flap depends on the defect that needs to be covered and the surgeon’s discretion.''The following flaps may be considered:' Gracilis myocutaneous flaps (most commonly used)   Abdominal flaps  Thigh flaps Groin flaps Gluteal (buttocks) flaps Rectus femoris flaps Perforator flaps
What is the gracilis myocutaneous flap?,"'The\xa0gracilis muscle\xa0is one of the\xa0muscles\xa0found in the groin. It starts at the upper area of the pubic bone and extends down to the upper middle shaft of the shinbone (tibia).''Gracilis myocutaneous flap uses the gracilis muscle -- along with skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fat with a rich blood supply. It is used for reconstruction of small- to medium-sized soft\xa0tissue defects in the perineum, upper and lower extremities, as well as head and neck.\xa0' Muscle provides a well-vascularized (rich blood supply) soft tissue that is relatively resistant to infection and helps wounds heal. It is commonly used and preferred to eradicate infection, fill defects following trauma or surgery and restore function. An expendable muscle; its absence rarely causes lower extremity weakness Ability to transfer only a part of the muscle Good contractile force Reliably accessible for the surgeon  Rich blood supply  Low incidence of infection or other problems from the donor site  Excessive bulk Skin tethering (skin dimpling from the adhered muscle’s tension) Wide donor site scar, which may require treatment Secondary refining procedures are often necessary."
Is the perineal reconstruction surgery painful?," The surgery is performed with anesthesia, hence there is no pain during the surgery. Post-operative pain may vary based on the patient’s tolerance.  The pain can be managed by oral or injectable pain killers successfully."
How long does it take to recover after perineal reconstruction surgery?," Post-surgical swelling, pain and bruising subsides in a week or two. After five to seven days, patients are usually able to walk around comfortably. The results may take a few months following surgery. Patients are generally able to resume pre-operative activities including sexual intercourse and exercise after four to six weeks. Patients may feel weak or tired in the first six weeks. Regular follow-up is required to monitor healing."
What are the complications of perineal reconstruction?,"'People suffering from ''vascular disease''\xa0in the lower extremities (limbs) should avoid this surgery because the condition may cause or exacerbate complications.\xa0\xa0''Complications of perineal reconstruction surgery include:' Ischemia (loss of tissue oxygen) of the overlying skin causing delayed healing or partial or complete skin loss.  Local wound problems: pain infectionbleedingdelayed healing pain  infection bleeding delayed healing Temporary sciatic nerve palsy (largest nerve in the body running from the lower back to the toes) Issues related to scarring:Pruritus (itching)DiscolorationScar widthSensitivity Pruritus (itching) Discoloration Scar width Sensitivity Tingling Pain Hypoesthesia (diminished sensation of touch)  Temporary weakness lasting an average of six months Persistent weakness that may interfere with running, walking, or sports Poor reaction to anesthesia "
What are the benefits of lip implants?,"'Permanent ''lip augmentation'' is a procedure of choice. Patients usually go for temporary methods and later switch to the permanent solution for lip enhancement. Some opt for lip implants or permanent lip augmentation because of the benefits that include:''When performed by a skilled cosmetic surgeon, lip implant surgery can take less than 30 minutes with very minimal scarring.' Long-lasting results Less downtime (one to three days) Natural look and feel Cost-effective compared with repeated injectable fillers applications Few complications than injectable fillers applications"
What is the recovery period for a permanent lip augmentation procedure?,"'Recovery after a permanent lip augmentation procedure is relatively quick and easy.\xa0''There is mild ''pain'' around the lip area that can be minimized by taking ''pain'' medications. Ice packs help reduce the redness and swelling on the lips and around the mouth.''Patients are advised to ''sleep'' with the head elevated for nearly one week.''They should avoid manipulation of the lip area. They should avoid massaging the area for several days after the surgery.''Vigorous activities such as lifting heavy weights and heavy workouts should be avoided for two weeks. Care should be taken while chewing food.''Follow-up is usually scheduled at one and two weeks after the implant surgery to check for the healing of the lip ''wound''.''The cosmetic surgeon may advise oral exercises such as wide mouth opening, smiling, and puckering lips to be performed daily from three weeks to three months after the surgery.''Visible swelling and ''bruising'' of the lip region usually subside by the end of two weeks.' "
What are the risks involved in a permanent augmentation procedure?,"'Surely, lip implants are an excellent option for patients who wish to get a permanent or semi-permanent solution to their thin or wrinkled lips. However, patients need to be aware of the following possible risks:''Patients should thoroughly discuss with their cosmetic surgeon the benefits and risks of the procedure before going for permanent lip augmentation surgery.' Malposition Infection  Dissatisfaction Dissatisfaction requiring removal  Prolonged edema and bruising"
What are the risks associated with phacoemulsification surgery?,"'Phacoemulsification is a very safe surgery. Among all other cataract operations, phacoemulsification is associated with better vision at six weeks after surgery.''However, like every procedure, it has a few risks. These are as follows:''The ideal candidates for phacoemulsification are patients with ''cataracts'' with no other medical conditions. The outcomes of patients with ''diabetes'' who undergo phacoemulsification are not that good.' Postprocedural pain and redness: Pain and redness post the procedure are mostly minor and bearable. Swelling of the cornea: The cornea becomes swollen when the cut is made near its surface. This generally settles on its own. Endophthalmitis: This is a serious complication of cataract surgery. The entire eye becomes red and swollen. This may result in a permanent loss of vision. Retinal detachment: The probe may heat up during the procedure causing damage to the surrounding structures. The vibrations during the procedure may cause the separation of the retina (layer of the eye responsible for transmitting signals to the brain) from its surrounding structures. Cystoid macular edema (CME): The appearance of cystoid (cyst-like) swellings on the macula (the central part of the retina) is called CME. This may also cause vision loss. Glaucoma: Damage to the drainage system of the eye during the surgery can cause glaucoma. In this, the pressure inside the eye increases. It adversely affects the optic nerve (the nerve responsible for sight)."
What happens after the surgery?,"'After the surgery, the cut will be covered with an antiseptic ointment and a sterile dressing. You will be shifted to a ward for observation. You must lie down and avoid sudden head movements. You may have mild-to-moderate ''eye pain'' after the surgery. If throbbing in the eye is severe, you must notify your doctor.''The day after the procedure, the doctor will remove the bandage and check for ''eye redness'' and ''eye discharge''. He will check the pupil reaction to light and for the position of the inserted lens in the eye. He will give you antibiotics and anti-inflammatory eye drops to reduce redness and promote healing.''You will be called for a follow-up visit at one month and three months after the surgery.''At both these visits, your visual screening will be done. The eye will be examined for discharge, pain, and redness. The eye pressure will be measured. The pupil will be dilated with eye drops to check for the lens position. The retina will be examined for swelling or detachment.' You must not carry weights or do strenuous exercise until advised by the doctor. You must avoid straining, coughing, or any other activity that may increase pressure in the eye and delay wound healing. You must avoid dusty areas in the house or outside. You must avoid driving because this may put extra strain on the eyes. Moreover, your vision may not fully recover until around six weeks after surgery. You must discontinue swimming until your doctor okays it. You may wash your head and face after the operation but be careful not to let the soap or shampoo get into the eye. You must not rub your eyes. You must wear an eye patch or eye shield if possible."
What is phenol used for?,"'Phenol is a widely used chemical solvent used in numerous places, including chemistry, biology and medical laboratories. It is extremely toxic toward living cells. Phenol is readily absorbed through intact skin. It is essential that phenol users understand its properties and know correct handling procedures. Proper training for using phenol and personal protection equipment such as aprons and eye wear is recommended while handling phenol. Phenols are widely used in household products and as intermediates for industrial synthesis. The uses include' Phenols are used in over-the-counter treatments for sore throats (1.4% concentration). Phenol is present in numerous consumer products that are swallowed, rubbed on or added to various parts of the body. These include ointments, ear and nose drops, cold sore lotions, mouthwashes, gargles, toothache drops, analgesic rubs, throat lozenges and antiseptic lotions. Phenol has been used traditionally for sterilization of surgical areas before performing any procedure. Small amounts of phenol in water have been injected into nerve tissue to lessen the pain associated with certain nerve disorders. Phenol destroys the outer layers of the skin if allowed to remain in contact with the skin. Small amounts of concentrated phenol solutions are sometimes applied to the skin to remove warts and treat other skin blemishes and disorders. Phenol-containing products are used as chemical peels to remove skin lesions and treat severe pain. Phenol in low concentrations is used as a disinfectant in household cleaners and mouthwash. Phenol used as a slimicide (a chemical toxic to bacteria and fungi characteristic of aqueous slimes) is a type of disinfectant. The largest single use of phenol is as an intermediate in the production of phenolic resins. It is also used in the production of caprolactam (which is used in the manufacture of nylon 6 and other synthetic fibers) and Bisphenol A (which is used in the manufacture of epoxy and other resins). It is used in molecular techniques in the DNA labs."
What precautions should I take while using phenol as a topical solution?,"'Phenol is extremely poisonous and corrosive. It can be absorbed across intact skin. Because it initially may have anesthetic effects, phenol may cause extensive tissue damage\xa0before\xa0the patient feels any pain. Use phenol topical solution as directed by your doctor. Follow all instructions closely.' Do not use phenol topical solution orally. Keep it away from your nose and eyes (may burn). In the event of eye contact, there will be severe pain and redness. Irrigate the affected eye with copious amounts of running water and the immediately to to the hospital. Wash your hands with plenty of water before and after handline phenols. Clean the affected area before use. Make sure to dry the area well. Put a thin layer on the affected skin and rub gently. Do not use coverings (bandages, dressings and makeup) unless cleared by  the doctor."
Why is photocoagulation of the retina done?,"'Indications for retinal photocoagulation include the following:' Panretinal (all over the retina) photocoagulation (PRP) for neovascular diseases (diseases with new blood vessel) and proliferative diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, sickle cell retinopathy, and venous occlusion disease local or grid photocoagulation, in which a laser is targeted at a specific area. It is done for macular edema from diabetes or vein occlusion Retinopathy of prematurity Abnormalities of the blood vessels in the retina such as microaneurysms (weakening and ballooning of the small blood vessels), telangiectasia (dilation of the small blood vessels), and blood vessel leakage Removal of retinal adhesions formed around retinal tears and detached areas Targeted treatment of pigment abnormalities Treatment of eye tumors Treatment of certain types and causes of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye)"
How is photocoagulation of the retina performed?,"'During the procedure:''The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, using anesthetic eye drops. A mild sedative may be administered. The patient is seated in front of a slit lamp delivery system (a setup with a microscope and bright light used by an eye doctor to examine the eye and perform outpatient procedures). The pupils are dilated. The ''lens'' in the slit lamp is used to focus a beam of laser light onto the retina. The laser beams are targeted at the affected areas of the retina. The laser beams create thermal energy causing laser ''burns'' over the targeted areas of the retina. The patient may see bright flashes of light during the procedure. There is no significant ''pain'' or discomfort during the procedure. Patients may experience a mild pricking sensation or pressure over the eye during the procedure.''After the procedure:''The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, and the patient can go home soon after the sedative wears off. Patients would need someone to drive them home after the procedure because the pupils would be dilated for a few hours after surgery. Patients may experience blurring of vision, ''pain'', and discomfort for two to three days after the surgery. Pain can be managed with painkillers. There is a very low risk of infection after the procedure, so antibiotics are usually not prescribed. Most patients can resume daily activities immediately. Driving can be resumed after two to three days once vision becomes clear. Patients may be advised to avoid vigorous ''exercise'' and sports for one to weeks after surgery.' "
What are the complications of photocoagulation of the retina?,"'The procedure is quite safe, and complications are rare. Some possible complications are as follows:' Bleeding  Retinal detachment  Decreased vision or loss of vision  Accidental laser burns to other important structures in the eye "
What is a posterior long arm splint?,"'Posterior long arm splint is used in the management of multiple upper long arm injuries. A splint is a type of medical equipment made of wood or other rigid material. It is used to immobilize a fractured or dislocated bone. A splint usually helps to maintain any part of the body in a fixed position. The most common use of splints is in emergency settings to keep a detached bone in position until it heals. Posterior arm splinting is often the treatment of choice in the emergency department (''ED'') because they reduce swelling that may be present at the site of injury and thereby reduce the further risks. After a splint is placed, follow-up for definitive care with an orthopedist should occur within one to five days.' "
When is a posterior long arm splint recommended?,'A posterior long arm splint is usually recommended for upper arm injuries such as' The lower end of the upper bone fracture  Forearm fracture Radial bone fractures Olecranon fracture (body part of elbow fractures)  Severe ligament injuries of the elbow
When can a posterior long arm splint not be used?,"'Certain injuries require immediate evaluation or intervention by a consultant (e.g., an orthopedic surgeon, a hand surgeon, a ''plastic surgeon'', etc.), and splinting alone cannot be the treatment. Such injuries include the following:' Complicated or multiple fractures Open fractures Injuries associated with nerves and blood vessels"
How is a posterior long arm splint performed?,"'Splinting is usually tolerated without the use of anesthesia. However, if a significant manipulation of the injury is required during the splinting process, anesthetic techniques may be used.' These splints are made of plaster, fiberglass, or a low-temperature thermoplastic material with sufficient padding or cotton. The elbow is positioned at a 90° bend, and the splint is applied to the back of the arm, covering half the length of the upper arm bone, ending above or below the wrist. Elbow bending and straightening are prevented by a posterior long arm splint, and rotation of the forearm is limited but not completely restricted. With the patient adequately positioned, a web roll is started at the wrist and extending past the elbow to the upper arm. The number of layers is determined by the amount of expected swelling, but many splints will use two to four layers. At the elbow, a web role must be carefully applied to ensure adequate padding of the body part of the elbow. A web roll may be extended till the upper arm bone: humerus. A splint may be applied around the elbow and major aspects of the wrist. Care should be taken to allow moments in fingers. A mold is applied with a splint to keep the fractured bone in position. An elastic bandage is wrapped over the splint materials to keep the splint in position."
What are the complications of a posterior long arm splint?,"'As with any splinting technique, a posterior long arm splint can have few possible complications that include''The Patient can experience discomfort if the splints are wrapped too tight. Over padded splints can become too loose and inadequately immobilize an injury.' Skin burns if excess heat is used during splinting Pressure sores Skin infection Swelling and pain Joint stiffness Skin breakdown in case of improperly padded splints "
What is the outcome after a posterior long arm splint?,"'Long arm splints are a valuable tool in the treatment of various upper arm injuries. This form of splinting can provide excellent immobilization while allowing a decrease in swelling. Typically, a long arm splint is the initial form of immobilization. It is removed, and patients are transitioned into more definitive immobilization such as a cast.' "
What is a posterior long leg splint?,"'Posterior long leg splinting is a type of splint used to stabilize injuries by reducing movement and providing support to prevent further limb damage.

What are the different types of presbyopia?,'There are five types of presbyopia:' Premature presbyopia: Presbyopia occurring before the age of 40 years. Incipient presbyopia: It is the earliest stage when it may be a bit more difficult to read small prints. Functional presbyopia: This occurs when patients begin to notice more problems with near sight. Absolute presbyopia: Eyes cannot focus on near objects at all. Nocturnal presbyopia: Eyes cannot focus on near objects in low light conditions.
What are different presbyopia correcting procedures?,"'The different types of presbyopia-correcting procedures include:' Corneal inlay: The inlay typically is implanted in the nondominant eye. This allows both eyes to be used for distance vision while the inlay sharpens near vision in the non-dominant eye. The procedure takes around 15 minutes and can be performed in a treatment room. No stitches are needed. Healing time may vary but most people are able to resume their normal activities within 24-48 hours. Monovision LASIK: LASIK stands for Laser-Assisted In situ Keratomileusis. This is the most popular form of laser eye surgery and is a means of altering the refractive power of the cornea. This modified LASIK procedure creates the same effect as monovision with contact lenses but without the need to wear contacts. Surgery: It is a refractive lens exchange, also referred to as RLE. A refractive lens exchange is virtually the same procedure as cataract surgery, but in this instance, the natural lens being replaced has not yet become clouded by a cataract. After thoroughly examining the patient and consulting with the patient regarding their lifestyle and vision preferences, the surgeon selects a special multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) or an accommodating intraocular lens to restore near vision."
How frequently should I check my eyesight?,"'Eyesight testing frequency depends on the patient’s age, family history, and any pre-existing medical conditions. People at high risk of sight problems need more frequent eyesight checks especially people with''Low-risk people with no symptoms of an eyesight problem do not need to have their eyes tested so frequently.' Diabetes Raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma) Family history of eye problems Older age High myopia Hypertension A patient who is under the risk category may need to have at least 2 yearly (biennial) eye examinations. Patients over 50 years and more age without risk factors may require a yearly (annual) eye examination If patients have more than one risk factor, then an eyesight check is recommended at least every 3 years once they reach 40 years of age."
Why is pyeloplasty done?,"'Pyeloplasty is done to repair an obstruction in the tube that drains urine from the kidney into the bladder (ureter). Pyeloplasty can help fix the problems due to urine flow obstruction, which include:' Ureteropelvic junction blockage that develops before birth Blockages caused by polyps, tumors, or scarring Hydronephrosis Recurrent flank pain Nausea Vomiting Recurrent urinary tract infections Pyelonephritis (inflammation of the kidney) Deterioration in kidney function Kidney stones"
When should pyeloplasty be avoided?,'Pyeloplasty is generally avoided in:' Strictures (narrowing) longer than 2 cm Entrapment of ureter by the renal vessel (crossing renal vessel) Untreated coagulopathy (defect with blood clotting)
What to expect during a pyeloplasty?,"'Before the surgery:''During the surgery:''After the surgery:' As this surgery is generally a planned one, the surgeon prepares you for the surgery. The surgeon may examine to assess the obstruction and function of the kidney. You may have to undergo a renal scan. The surgeon will assess your hemoglobin values and bleeding parameters. They may obtain your informed consent. You may receive antibiotics such as cefazolin. Pyeloplasty is performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes three small incisions in the abdomen. Next, the surgeon inserts a telescope and small instruments through these holes. The surgeon removes the narrowed or obstructed part of the ureter and reconnects the healthy portion to the kidney’s drainage system. A stent is placed inside the ureter to drain the kidney. You may be given intravenous fluids. You may be given painkillers to control pain. You may continue antibiotics, until the drain is removed. Recovery is faster in laparoscopic procedure than in the open procedure. You may be discharged from the hospital within two to three days. You can return to a regular diet after surgery. Avoid contact sports or cycling for six weeks. You may have to undergo imaging studies approximately six to eight weeks after the procedure."
What is liver ablation surgery?,"'Liver'' ablation surgery is a procedure that destroys liver tumors without surgically removing them. The technique can be used in people with:''Ablation may be avoided if:''Although ablation techniques are less likely to cure ''cancer'' than surgery, they can be helpful for people who are unfit for major surgery. Liver ablation treatments may also sometimes be used in patients waiting for a ''liver transplant''.''Tumors less than 3 cm across (a little over an inch) are most suitable for treatment by ablation. If the tumor is slightly larger (1-2 inches, or 3-5 cm across), ablation may be used along with embolization (surgically blocking the blood supply to the tumor).\xa0\xa0''Depending upon the technique used to destroy the tumor cells, the various ablation techniques can be categorized as:' Early-stage liver cancer Primary liver tumor that cannot be operated Poor general health and metastatic growths Multiple small tumors waiting for liver transplantation Reduced liver function  Liver tumors that are metastatic (spread to other organs), who are not fit for surgery There are multiple and/or large tumors.  Tumors near important structures like major blood vessels, the diaphragm or major bile ducts. Ablation is not a good choice in such cases as it often destroys some of the normal tissue around the tumor. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) uses high-energy radio waves to destroy the tumor. Microwave ablation (MWA) uses the energy from electromagnetic waves to heat and destroys the tumor. Cryoablation (cryotherapy) destroys a tumor by freezing it. Ethanol (alcohol) ablation destroys tumors by injecting concentrated alcohol directly into them."
Is liver ablation a major surgery?,"'Liver ablation is not a major surgery. For this surgery, you may need to stay a few hours in a hospital. Usually, ablation of liver tumors can be done without open surgery (a large incision).\xa0A needle or probe is inserted into the tumor through the skin (percutaneous ablation of liver tumor). Rarely, however, to be certain the treatment is aimed at the right place, the ablation may be done under general anesthesia. Some cases may need a surgical incision to remove the part of the liver containing the tumor\xa0(partial hepatectomy).' "
What is radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors?,"'Radiofrequency ablation of liver tumors is one of the commonest ablation methods for small tumors of the liver.\xa0In this technique, high-energy radio waves are used to destroy the tumor cells. The procedure involves inserting a thin, needlelike probe into the tumor through the skin (percutaneously). The needle is guided to the tumor under image guidance (''ultrasound'' or ''CT scan''). This is followed by passing high-frequency current through the tip of the probe to heat the tumor and destroy the ''cancer'' cells. This procedure is an accurate, quick and cost-effective method for managing tumors in the liver.\xa0' "
What are the side effects of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumors?,'Several studies report that RFA is a relatively low-risk procedure with fewer complications. The possible side effects of RFA include:' Fever Abdominal pain Bodyache Nausea Vomiting Shoulder pain Cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) Damage to the bile ducts Damage to the bowel Bleeding Hemoperitoneum (collection of blood in the peritoneal cavity- the space between your abdominal organs and inner abdominal wall) Pneumothorax (presence of air in the space between the lungs and the chest wall) Hemothorax (abnormal collection of blood in the chest) Hydrothorax (abnormal collection of watery fluid in the chest) Pleural effusion (collection of pus between the lungs and their covering [pleura]) Ascites (abnormal collection of fluid inside the abdomen) Blood clot formation Infections  Liver abscess (collection of pus in the liver) Needle-tract seeding (spillage and growth of cancer cells along the path of the ablation needle) Injuries
Why do you have foot reconstruction surgery?,"'Foot reconstruction\xa0is a\xa0surgery\xa0performed to correct the anatomy of the\xa0foot\xa0and restore function lost due to ''trauma'', ''birth defects'', infection and other illnesses.''Foot diseases may make parts of daily life difficult and frustrating.\xa0Severe foot conditions often require long-term care and rehabilitation. They may affect one’s ''mental health'', personal and social life, making them dependent on others for physical and emotional support.''The foot is divided into four regions:''Foot reconstruction considers the tissue reconstruction, function restoration, cosmetic rehabilitation and whether the foot can or should be saved by reconstructing.''The final choice of different reconstructive options relies on the extent of the disease and the surgeon’s preference.' Ankle Sole Upper surface (dorsum) Toes"
What are the causes of foot defects?,"'Foot defects typically occur\xa0in six key conditions:''Major injuries''Many foot injuries result from motor vehicle or work-related accidents. The severity of such cases depends on how much of the tissue is damaged and whether the bones in the foot have been affected. Foot trauma is classified by severity as follows:''Type I: ''soft tissue loss less than three square centimeters''Type II:'' soft tissue loss greater than three square centimeters without bone involvement''Type III: ''significant tissue loss with bone involvement''Diseases of the foot''Vascular diseases (blood vessel related): ''Destruction to the blood vessels; artery or vein leading to ulcers or tissue death and infection.''Metabolic diseases:'' Metabolic diseases like ''diabetes'', ''gout'' and ''alcoholism'' induce alteration of blood and nerve supply to the whole body causing painless, crater-like ulcers on the foot''Tumors including:''\xa0''Infection:'' Infected ulcers often are from trauma, ''vascular disease'', or ''diabetes'' due to low tissue oxygenation of tissues''Malformation: ''Birth defects such as the\xa0clubfoot\xa0or ''spina bifida''.' Melanomas Epitheliomas Sarcomas of the bone or of soft tissues"
What are the methods of foot reconstruction?," Small wounds with living soft tissue can be treated medically. Open wounds with dead soft tissue and/or bone often require surgical debridement (removal of foreign bodies/ damaged/ infected/ dead tissue and bone from wounds). Once all dead tissue is removed, skin grafts or flaps may aid in wound healing. Depending on the depth of the defect and extent, the flap type is decided. Three kinds of flaps could be considered based on the use of skin, muscle and bone during reconstruction:Fasciocutaneous flap: tissue flaps that include skin and the underlying tissuesMusculocutaneous flap: includes skin, underlying tissue, fat, and muscle along with rich blood supplyOsteocutaneous flap: bone-containing flap with elements of skin, underlying tissue and with blood supply Fasciocutaneous flap: tissue flaps that include skin and the underlying tissues Musculocutaneous flap: includes skin, underlying tissue, fat, and muscle along with rich blood supply Osteocutaneous flap: bone-containing flap with elements of skin, underlying tissue and with blood supply Tendon transfers, tendon release and tendon lengthening procedures are also performed to restore anatomy and function. Amputation may be required if reconstruction is not recommended or when function can be improved by use of prosthetics."
When should foot reconstruction surgery be avoided?,'People who have the following are not good candidates for foot reconstruction surgery:' Bacterial or fungal contamination and necrosis (tissue death) Large tumors Severe trauma or degeneration Severe vascular or metabolic disease Poor general health A severe tobacco smoking habit
What are the complications of foot reconstruction surgery?,"'The risks, complications and side effects of foot reconstruction surgery include:' Reaction to anesthesia Hematoma (blood clot) Infection Partial or complete loss of the flap or graft Pressure sores Clots in the arteries and veins"
How long does it take to recover from foot reconstruction surgery?," Recovery time depends on the extent and type of reconstructive surgery. The patient may require complete bed rest for two to three weeks, after which they can start walking slowly with or without support. The leg should stay elevated the first two weeks and may be in a cast. Stitches may be removed after 10 to 14 days. It is not advised to apply weight on the operated foot for six to eight weeks. Around 12 weeks after surgery, patients may be able to wear normal shoes with or without a foot or ankle brace. Complete recovery can take up to a year depending on the surgery performed. Regular follow-up and physical therapy may be necessary"
What are the causes of a rectal foreign body?,"'The Rectum is the part after your bowel where the stools get collected before expulsion from the anus.\xa0''A rectal foreign body is an object that has been introduced manually through the anus and that gets stuck in the rectum. It is quite rare that an ingested object passes through the entire gastrointestinal tract and gets stuck in the rectum.''Examples of rectal foreign bodies include:''The reasons for the insertion of objects in the anus include:' Bottles Sex toys like dildos and vibrators  Fruits and vegetables Balls Toothbrushes Sports equipment Cell phones Wooden rods Aerosol canisters Christmas ornaments Cocaine pockets Thermometers Autoeroticism: Sexually arousal by oneself. Concealment: Drug addicts conceal the drugs in their anus during police raids. Attention-seeking behavior: Usually found in psychiatric patients. Accidental: Objects may be inserted out of shame or guilt, rectal thermometer while checking the temperature.  Assault: Objects may be inserted into the victim’s anus during sexual assaults."
What are the symptoms of a rectal foreign body?,"'Most of the people who have a rectal foreign body do not experience any signs or symptoms.\xa0''Some patients present to the clinic immediately after they realize that they cannot remove the rectal foreign body by themselves, whereas others turn up to the clinic when they start facing the following problems:' Rectal pain Abdominal pain Constipation Obstipation (unable to pass stools and gas) Bleeding through anus Bowel incontinence"
What are the exams and tests to diagnose a rectal foreign body?,"'The doctor will take the patient’s complete history to know if the cause of the problems is a rectal foreign body.''The doctor will perform the following examinations on the patient:''If the patient says he/she has inserted an object in his/her rectum, but above examinations do not yield any sign of the object’s presence, the doctor will ask for an X-ray of the abdomen to visualize it.' Abdominal examination. The abdomen will be checked if there are any complications due to the object. Digital rectal examination. Fingers will be inserted in the rectum to feel the object."
What is rectal foreign body removal procedure?,"'Once the presence of the rectal foreign body has been confirmed, the doctor will attempt at removing it in the emergency department. This can only be done if the object is felt by the digital rectal examination or is within 10 cm of the anal margin.''If the foreign body cannot be removed safely, the patient needs to consult a surgeon. The surgeon may advise the patient to go for removal of the foreign body either by inserting a long tube into the anus which goes into your intestine (''colonoscopy'') or by opening the abdomen (laparotomy)\xa0' Painkillers or sedatives will be given to the patient so that he/she feels less pain throughout the rectal foreign body removal procedure. A local anesthetic (lignocaine jelly) that numbs the anus will be applied just before inserting fingers or any instrument into the patient’s anus. The doctor will insert one or two of his fingers into the anus and gently move them toward the rectum until he feels the rectal foreign body (digital manipulation) and removes it. If the foreign body cannot be removed from the rectum with digital manipulation, the doctor will insert a special instrument known as a retractor or speculum device. If the foreign body cannot be visualized with a retractor or speculum instrument in place, the patient will be asked to bear down. This will help in visualizing the foreign body and smoothen the removal procedure."
What are the risks of a rectal foreign body?,"'Delay in the removal of rectal foreign bodies can turn out to be very risky. The risks include:' Perforation (hole in the rectum or bowel) Infection or sepsis (organ failure due to widespread infection) Ulcerations, lacerations, or swelling in the rectum or bowel Obstruction in the rectum or bowel Bleeding in the rectum or bowel Peritonitis"
What causes finger dislocation?,"'Forceful injury to any of the joints of the fingers can result in ''finger dislocation''. Finger dislocation is the shifting of a bone away from its original position resulting in the misalignment of the joint.''Your finger (except for your thumb) is made up of three joints that allow it to bend forward, downward and sideways. These joints are:''Finger dislocations are usually caused by bending the finger backward beyond its normal range. They are the most common type of hand injuries that happen in athletes of football and basketball while catching or blocking the fast-moving ball.\xa0''Though finger dislocation is not a medical emergency but delaying its treatment might increase the swelling in the finger making the treatment difficult.' Distal interphalangeal joints: located closest to the fingernails Proximal interphalangeal joints: the middle joints of the fingers Metacarpophalangeal joints: located where the fingers meet the rest of your hand (knuckles)"
What are the signs and symptoms of finger dislocation?, Moving the dislocated finger is extremely painful. A dislocated finger is crooked and swollen.  There may a bruise or cut on the dislocated finger.  The dislocated finger may feel abnormally loose or unstable.
How is a finger dislocation diagnosed?,"'Your doctor will ask you about how you injured your finger. He will look for the signs and symptoms of a dislocated finger, and if he suspects finger dislocation, he will order an X-ray of your injured finger.''A finger dislocation is usually confirmed on X-ray, but ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') of your finger may also be needed if your doctor also suspects injury to the finger joint’s adjacent structures like nerves.' "
What is the reduction of finger dislocation procedure?,"'If your finger dislocation is not severe, the doctor can immediately fix your finger dislocation by externally manipulating and putting your bone back in its original position. This is known as a closed reduction. Before they do this, you might get a local anesthetic medication to numb your finger.''During the procedure, the doctor will gently restore your finger to its correct position by gently pushing or pulling it. The doctor will do another X-ray to confirm the success of the reduction procedure.''A splint will be wrapped around your affected finger or taping of your affected finger will be done to its adjacent finger to secure the alignment. You need to wear the splint/tape for three to six weeks.\xa0''If your finger dislocation is severe that it cannot be manipulated externally, your dislocated finger may need to be repaired surgically. The same reduction will be performed by opening your finger surgically, and the procedure is known as open reduction.\xa0' If you have an open fracture in the dislocated finger, you will be put on antibiotics and given a tetanus vaccine."
How long does it take to recover from finger dislocation?, You can return to your sport once your doctor has confirmed that your dislocated finger joint is now stable. Recovery from a surgery like closed reduction usually takes at least four to six weeks before you can return to your sport. You might also require physical or occupational therapy to strengthen your affected joint and help you recover faster.
Why is robotic gynecologic surgery performed?,"'Robotic gynecologic surgery is indicated in:' Uterine cancer Cervical cancer Endometriosis (a condition in which the tissue that makes the inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium, is found at places outside the uterus) Tubal anastomosis (joining of any two parts of the fallopian tube) Transabdominal cerclage (incision in the lower abdomen near the bikini line to place a small woven synthetic band high up on the cervix to prevent it from opening) Benign (noncancerous) gynecological tumors Uterine prolapse (sagging of the uterus) Painful periods and heavy bleeding Abdominal or pelvic pain"
Who shouldn’t undergo robotic gynecologic surgery?,'Robotic gynecologic surgery should be avoided in:' Elderly patients Patients unable to tolerate a particular positioning or the length of the procedure Severe obesity Severe scar tissues inside the abdomen
How is a gynecologic robotic surgery performed?,"'A robotic system includes:''Robotic-assisted procedures are usually performed when the patient is under general anesthesia. Seated at the console, the surgeon controls even the complex procedure through one or more small incisions with extreme perfection. The surgeon (console surgeon) controls the robotic system for any movements because it is not programmable.''Another significant part of this type of surgery is the assistant surgeon, who stands at the operating table next to the patient and manually controls additional tasks, such as fine stitching.''Robotic surgery is useful in:' A console at which the surgeon controls the scope and instruments using hand controls and view’s the scope’s images on a screen. A robotic cart with arms that holds the instruments. A camera that gives a 3D view of the surgical site, especially of the blood vessels Wristed instruments that interpret the surgeon’s hand movements into precise micromovements to perform surgery. Treating endometriosis Performing hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) Performing myomectomy (removal of uterine fibroids, sparing the uterus) Sacrocolpopexy (repair sagging down of pelvic organs, which involves usage of surgical mesh to keep the organs in their place) Oophorectomy (surgical removal of one or both the ovaries)"
What are the complications of robotic gynecologic surgery?,'The complications of robotic gynecologic surgery include:' Stroke Heart attacks Blood clots in the legs Injury to the surrounding organs Heavy bleeding Infection
What are the advantages of robotic surgery?,"'The advantages of robotic surgery include:' Greater surgical precision Increased range of motion Improved dexterity Enhanced visualization Better access to the surgical area Faster recovery: With minimally invasive procedures, patients can expect shorter hospital stays, allowing patients to recover at home. This tends to speed recovery time. Less blood loss: Smaller incisions and more precise surgery can greatly reduce blood loss incidence, eliminating the need for blood transfusions in certain operations. Less pain: Because incisions are smaller, they tend to heal faster and are not as painful as larger incisions made in more traditional surgeries. Less need for narcotic pain medications: Less pain requires less need to control it. This means patients can minimize the use of pain medications, which is especially important for patients using narcotics. Lower risk of infection Less scarring Lower chances of disturbing other organs Less time in the hospital Faster return to normal daily activities Better clinical outcomes (in many cases) A highly magnified, higher-resolution image of the operating field may be much helpful for doctors. Instead of being on foot for several hours for a single surgical case, doctors may be able to sit at the robotics computer console throughout the surgery, while maneuvering the robotic technology and performing the operation."
What are the possible disadvantages of robotic surgery?,"'Below are a few common possible disadvantages of robotic surgery:' Robotic systems have highly complex software, and it is very difficult to program and debug them. Costs, maintenance, and the training of surgeons are considerably high. It is highly dependent on the security and reliability of the network, which may be problematic during emergency situations. Excess bleeding Problems from anesthesia, such as wheezing or sore throat Infection Damage to nearby organs or structures The need to switch to traditional surgery types, such as traditional laparoscopic or open surgery"
What is the outlook of robotic surgery?,"'Robotic technology may bring major changes in surgery by enhancing and expanding laparoscopic procedures, advancing surgical technology, and thus, bringing surgery into the digital age. It possesses the potential to expand surgical treatment beyond the limits of human ability. The benefits of robotic surgery outweigh the costs. Robotic surgery may be at an early stage but this does not mean that it has not demonstrated its potential and significance, particularly in areas that were previously inaccessible by traditional procedures. However, we are yet to see if robotic surgery will completely replace conventional instruments in less technically demanding procedures. Fortunately, robotic surgery using high-resolution cameras is one of the most substantial technological advancements in modern medicine.\xa0The robotic surgery space is being transformed by declining costs, due to the rise of technologies like artificial intelligence and better network capability with 5G.' "
What is LASIK?,"'LASIK eye surgery is the most commonly performed laser refractive surgery to correct vision problems. LASIK improves vision and eliminates the need to wear glasses or ''contact lenses''.''LASIK\xa0surgery may be done to correct one of these vision problems:''LASIK is a short procedure and usually completed in 30 minutes or less. Medication may be given to sedate extremely anxious patients. Numbing eye drops are placed in the eye, and the eyelids are held open with an instrument. A small blade or cutting laser is used to make a small flap in the cornea. The cornea is the clear layer covering the ''iris'' (colored part of the eye). The flap is folded to give access to the part of the cornea that has to be reshaped. A programmed laser beam is used to reshape the cornea, and a small amount of corneal tissue is removed. The flap is then repositioned and heals on its own without ''stitches''. LASIK\xa0surgery can be done in both the eyes simultaneously. Patients can resume most normal activities soon after LASIK. Complete healing of the eyes takes two to three months. Vision may not be clear for two to three months after surgery. After surgery, patients may feel ''itching'', watering, redness, and dryness of the eyes.' Myopia (nearsightedness): Difficulty seeing distant objects Hyperopia (farsightedness): Difficulty with near vision Astigmatism: Uneven curvature of the cornea or lens, leading to distorted or blurred vision"
What is SMILE?,"'Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) is a newer type of laser refractive eye surgery based on LASIK. SMILE is most commonly used to treat ''myopia'' or nearsightedness in people who are not ideal candidates for LASIK. SMILE is less invasive than LASIK because it does not involve making a flap in the cornea to reshape. SMILE involves using a single laser to flatten and reshape the cornea.''The setup, time is taken, anesthesia used, and cost for SMILE surgery are very similar to those for LASIK. Healing and recovery time in SMILE surgery is about the same as those in LASIK, but the risk of scarring and dryness of eyes is lesser in SMILE than in LASIK. You will also not be moved from one device to another because there is only one laser involved, so SMILE is a good option for people with myopia who have thin corneas.' "
What are the similarities between LASIK and SMILE?,"'The similarities between the two procedures include:''The basic eligibility criteria for both the surgeries are the same; they include the following:' Both are performed by an ophthalmologist (eye surgeon). Both involve using a guided laser. Both are performed under local anesthesia. Both are performed under 30 minutes. Many of the side effects are similar such as blurry vision till the eyes heal, glares, halos, difficulty with seeing in the dark, increased light sensitivity, and dry eyes. The recovery time is the same. Postoperative care is the same. Age over 21 years No significant change in vision over the past one year Possibility of vision improvement to at least 20/40 Myopic prescription between −1.00 and −12.00 diopters Not pregnant, breastfeeding, or on hormonal therapy at the time of surgery Average pupil size about 6 mm in the dark"
What are the differences between LASIK and SMILE?,"'Main differences between small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) vs LASIK include:' LASIK can be used to treat all types of refractive errors, whereas SMILE is used to treat myopia with or without astigmatism. However, SMILE cannot treat isolated astigmatism. LASIK involves a flap to be surgically made in the cornea, so the excimer laser reaches the deeper parts of your eye. SMILE is used as a single laser to flatten and reshape the cornea. The risk of scarring is higher in LASIK than in SMILE. LASIK is not ideal in those with thin corneas. SMILE can be done in those with thin corneas. Both the procedures have good patient satisfaction, but the patient satisfaction of SMILE is slightly better. Because SMILE is a newer surgery, fewer number of surgeons specialize in SMILE."
What is a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube?,"'A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (SB) tube is a red tube that prevents or slows bleeding from the ''esophagus'' or stomach caused due to gastric or esophageal varices. Gastric or esophageal varices are enlarged veins in the esophagus or stomach.''The three major parts of an SB tube are:''A variation of the SB tube known as a Minnesota tube has the addition of an esophageal suction port to help prevent additional suction of fluid (aspiration) of esophageal content.' Gastric balloon port, which inflates a small balloon in the stomach Esophageal balloon port, which inflates a small balloon in the esophagus Gastric suction port, which removes fluid and air out of the stomach"
What is Sengstaken-Blakemore tube placement?,'Sengstaken-Blakemore (SB) tube placement involves the insertion of an SB tube either through the nose or mouth to slow or stop bleeding from the esophagus or stomach caused due to varices.\xa0\xa0''Following are the indications for SB tube placement:' Acute bleeding from the varices that fail to respond to medical therapy Acute life-threatening bleeding from esophageal or stomach varices when endoscopic hemostasis and vasoconstrictor therapy are unavailable

How is Sengstaken-Blakemore placement done?,"'The physician inserts the Sengstaken–Blakemore (SB) tube either through the nose or mouth. The oral route is the preferred route. Before inserting the tube, you would be intubated and mechanically ventilated to control your ''breathing''. The physician administers an intravenous (IV) fluid to maintain your blood circulation and volume.\xa0''The physician tests for any leaks in the balloon by inflating the balloon and submerging it underwater. The physician then deflates the balloon and coats it on a tube with a lubricating jelly.\xa0''Next, the physician inserts the SB tube to at least a 50 cm mark. To ensure the tube reaches your stomach, they inflate the gastric balloon with a small amount of air. Once the inflated balloon is correctly placed, the physician inflates it with additional air to reach the desired pressure.''Once the SB tube is inserted, the physician connects it to weight for traction. They gently pull the tube back until the resistance is felt. They apply suction to the SB aspiration port to remove any ''blood clots''. If bleeding persists from gastric aspiration, after inflation of the balloons, they increase the weight on the tube.''Once the bleeding is controlled, the physician reduces the pressure in the esophageal balloon.\xa0''Once the bleeding has stopped, the physician performs the following steps to remove the SB tube:' Deflate the esophageal balloon Take out weight from the SB tube Deflate the gastric balloon Take out the SB tube"
Are there potential complications to using the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube?,"'You can expect a few risks from using a Sengstaken-Blakemore (SB) tube. If placed improperly, the SB tube can affect your ability to breathe. Complications that may arise due to improperly placed tube or ruptured balloons include:' Aspiration (the contents of the food pipe leak into the trachea) Sore throat Discomfort Hiccups Pain Recurrent bleeding Esophageal rupture (rupture of the esophagus) Asphyxiation (deprivation of oxygen resulting in unconsciousness) Esophageal or stomach ulcers"

What are the health benefits of spirulina?,"'Spirulina provides many health benefits, which include:' Improves chronic fatigue: Spirulina has polysaccharides and essential fats that can be easily absorbed by the body to release energy instantly. Spirulina also promotes healthy lactobacillus in the intestine leading to the production of vitamin B6 and subsequent release of energy. Treats allergy and rhinitis: Spirulina has anti-inflammatory properties because it inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells. It also boosts the immune system by covering nutritional deficiencies. Acts as antiviral agents: Spirulina destroys specific viruses by modifying the immune system. It can be helpful even after establishing the infection. Spirulina may help to treat the following:InfluenzaHerpesHuman immunodeficiency visus (HIV) Influenza Herpes Human immunodeficiency visus (HIV) Reduces cholesterol and diabetes: Spirulina reduces diabetes, blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and bad or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increases good or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Cancer prevention: Immune modification and antioxidant effects of spirulina may have a greater role in cancer prevention. Spirulina reduces precancerous lesions in people who chew tobacco. Removes toxins from the body: Because spirulina has antioxidant properties, it helps remove toxins from the body. Protects against liver disorder: Spirulina may help to protect against liver damage and cirrhosis. However, more research is required to establish the same. Reduces the risk of eye diseases: The zeaxanthin component of spirulina may be a useful nutrient associated with eye health. Studies have suggested that spirulinamay reduce the risk of cataracts and age-related eye diseases. Good source of nutrients for vegans and vegetarians: Because spirulina has nearly all the essential nutrients, vegans and vegetarians should consume it. Maintains healthy blood pressure Effective against anemia"
What are the side effects of spirulina?,"'Spirulina is not free from contaminants or toxins. They might have toxins, such as microcystins, toxic metals, or harmful bacteria. It is necessary to select spirulina products that are free of contaminants.''Spirulina consists of an amino acid called phenylalanine that may make ''phenylketonuria'' (a disorder of amino acid metabolism) worse. Avoid spirulina products in patients with phenylketonuria.''Spirulina can also have the following side effects:' Worsens auto-immune diseases Bleeding disorders"
What is a splint?,'A splint is a medical device that immobilizes the injured body part and protects it from further injury. It heals the fractured bones by keeping the broken ends together and in alignment. Splints also reduce ''pain'' and swelling.''Splints are applied to treat the following conditions:' Sprains Fractures Dislocations Control of pain Carpal tunnel syndrome: A condition characterized by numbness and tingling in the hand or arm caused by a pinched nerve in the wrist. Complex bone fracture Tendonitis (inflammation of the tissue connecting the muscle and bone)
What is the purpose of splinting?,"'The main purpose of splinting is to immobilize the joints and bones above and below the fracture site. This is to prevent bone edges from moving and damaging other muscles, vessels or nerves and further complications. Splinting will be effective when the adjacent joints and bones remain immobilized.' "
When should be splint application avoided?,"'Splint application should be avoided in the following conditions:' Open fracture (the broken bone that tears the skin) Impending compartment syndrome (a potentially life-threatening condition in which the pressure builds up in the legs, abdomen or arms) Neurovascular compromise (malunion of the nerves and blood vessels) Active or developing reflex sympathetic dystrophy (chronic arm or leg pain caused due to injury, surgery, stroke or heart attack)"
How is a splint applied?,"'Before applying a fiberglass or ''plastic'' splints, the ''caregiver'' places cotton padding as a protective layer to the skin. Splints come in either strips or rolls. The caregiver dips the rolls or strips in water and applies it over the padding covering the injured area. Sometimes, the caregiver even covers the joint above and below the broken bone. The splint must fit the shape of the fractured arm or leg to provide adequate support.''The caregiver usually applies a splint to a fresh injury. Once the swelling subsides, the caregiver replaces the splint with a cast. Gradually, as the fracture starts to heal, the caregiver may again replace the cast with a splint.' "
What to expect after the application of splint?, Swelling may cause pressure in the splint or cast for the first 48-72 hours. You need to elevate your swollen arm or leg for the first 24-72 hours. Gentle movements of the swollen arm or leg prevent stiffness. You need to apply ice to the splints or cast. You need to consult your physician if you experience any of these symptoms around the splints:Increased painNumbness or tingliness in your hand or footBurning and stingingExcessive swelling below the splintLoss of active movement of toes or fingers Increased pain Numbness or tingliness in your hand or foot Burning and stinging Excessive swelling below the splint Loss of active movement of toes or fingers
How long does a splint stay on?,"'A splint usually stays on for several days to weeks. A splint is usually preferred in case of swelling. Once the swelling resolves, the doctor will remove the splint and apply a cast. Splints need to be adjusted in the first few days if the injury is swollen.' "
What else do I need to know about splints?,'You need to take good care of the splints for proper healing. You should also remember to:' Never insert objects inside the splint. They can stick inside or scratch the skin. Not allow dirt or sand to get inside the splint. Not apply powder or deodorant inside a splint.
What is cholangioscopy?,"'Cholangioscopy is a procedure in which a flexible tube, called an endoscope, allows the doctor to visualize the inside of the bile ducts. It is used to treat related medical conditions, such as removal of bile duct stones.\xa0''When coupled with the visualization of the pancreas, it’s called cholangiopancreatoscopy. Your doctor may choose to perform a cholangioscopy if other imaging techniques\xa0are insufficient to make an adequate diagnosis or therapeutic intervention is needed to direct visualization.\xa0''In addition to the visualization of the bile ducts, cholangioscopy will help your physician to visualize and examine the hepatic (''liver'') and pancreatic ducts.' "
What is SpyGlass cholangioscopy?,"'SpyGlass cholangioscopy is a recently developed technique for the visualization of the bile ducts. It allows your doctor to see your biliary duct system and difficult-to-reach, small ducts in the pancreas, with a 6,000-pixel, ''fiber''-optic probe attached to a tiny camera.\xa0''The procedure can be performed by a single doctor or endoscopist. Unlike the SpyGlass system, the previously used endoscopes were fragile and difficult to use. The newer versions of the SpyScope (the endoscope used in SpyGlass cholangioscopy) provide better and easier visualization.''Before the SpyGlass cholangioscopy, your doctor may:''During the cholangioscopy:''After the procedure:' Order blood tests and imaging studies Ask you about any chronic health conditions Ask you about any medications you are on Ask about any allergies you may have Explain the procedure in detail, including possible complications and address your doubts and concerns related to the procedure Obtain your written consent Ask you to not eat anything for at least eight to 12 hours before the procedure You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. The anesthesiologist will give you a sedative and make your throat numb with a little local anesthetic. Your vital signs will be monitored during the procedure. A mouthpiece will be placed between your teeth to protect your mouth. You will not have any feeling of gagging or choking. The endoscope does not hinder or interfere with your breathing. Your vital signs will be monitored in the recovery room. You will stay in the recovery room until you are weaned off the effect of the sedative.  You may be asked to not eat anything until the next day. Because you will be under the effect of sedatives, you will need someone to drive you home."

Why is suction dilation and curettage done?,"'Dilation and curettage (D&C) may be performed to diagnose or treat a uterine pathology.''D&C may be performed to obtain a uterine tissue sample to diagnose the cause of the following:''D&C may be performed to confirm the diagnosis of the following:''D&C may be performed to' Abnormal uterine bleeding, such as heavy bleeding during periods Uterine bleeding after menopause Abnormal endometrial cells found during a pap smear (a routine test done to detect cervical cancer) Uterine polyps Uterine tumors (cancerous and non-cancerous) Endometrial hyperplasia (a precancerous condition characterized by a thick uterine wall) Clear out tissues from the uterus after a miscarriage or planned abortion. Remove a molar pregnancy (a tumor forms instead of a normal pregnancy). Treat excessive bleeding after delivery to remove remnants of the placenta from the uterus. Remove cervical or uterine polyps (benign, non-cancerous growth)"
How is suction dilation and curettage performed?,"'During the procedure:''Dilation and curettage (D&C) may be performed in a clinic or hospital, depending on what D&C is being done for. The doctor may start the process of opening of the cervix a few hours or the day before the procedure. A medication called ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec'') is usually given orally or vaginally to soften and ready the cervix, which helps the cervix gradually opens. The amount the cervix needs to be dilated depends on what is being done. Certain procedures require the diameter of the cervix to be more than standard D&C. A slender rod may be gently inserted into the cervix to aid in dilation.''The procedure is performed under anesthesia (general, regional, or local anesthesia). The choice of anesthesia depends on the reason for D&C and your medical history. The doctor removes the dilation rods and inserts the necessary instruments or a suction device to remove the uterine tissue.''After the procedure:''Patients would usually be discharged the same day or the next day after the procedure. Patients may experience mild ''pain'', discomfort, cramping, and slight ''vaginal bleeding'' (patients may have to use a sanitary napkin for a few days). Tampons can increase the risk of infection, hence are avoided. Patients would be prescribed painkillers and antibiotics. Patients can resume their daily activities the next day after the procedure. Sexual activity, ''exercise'', and sports may be resumed after consulting with the doctor.' "

Are sulfates and sulfites the same?,"'Both sulfates and sulfites are chemicals that contain the element sulfur. They are, however, different from each other. Sulfates are mineral salts that are derivatives of sulfuric acid. Sulfites are chemically different from sulfates and are often used as food preservatives. Sulfites may cause severe ''allergic'' reactions in some people, particularly people who are suffering from ''asthma''.' "
What are the various sulfate-containing personal care products?,"'Sulfates may be found in various bath and body care products. These include:''Owing to the potential harm to the body and environment, several sulfate-free products are now available for personal care and cleansing in the market. The only concern with sulfate-free products is that they produce little to no lather, which may make cleansing a bit tedious and an unsatisfying task.' Shampoos Face washes Soaps Laundry detergents Bath bombs Liquid soaps Hand washes Dish-washing detergents Toothpastes"
Are sulfates bad for you?,"'Being chemicals, sulfates beyond a particular concentration can harm your health and environment. Chemicals containing sulfates are generally used for various purposes including making bath and personal care products, fertilizers, chemicals, dyes, glass, paper, and textiles. Sulfates in these products may finally find their way in water bodies. Sulfates in excess amounts can make the water get an offensive taste and harm its quality for drinking purposes. Intake of large quantities of sulfates can trigger ''diarrhea'' and ''dehydration'', particularly in infants and children. Excess sulfates in the air may react with water vapors to form sulfuric acid that can irritate the eyes, skin, and mucus membranes. Excess sulfates in water bodies and soil can harm the animals also.''Although shampoos containing sulfates are good for cleansing the hair and ''scalp'', they may take away the natural oils from your hair making them rough and dry with repeated use. Long-term use of sulfates can also irritate the skin, eyes, and mucus membranes of the ''lungs''. Products containing sulfates such as shampoos and soaps can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions on repeated usage. Some people are particularly sensitive to sulfate-containing products and may develop ''skin inflammation'' (''dermatitis'') due to these products.\xa0''Due to the growing concerns about the harmful effects of sulfates on health and the environment, it is advisable to use sustainable products such as sulfate-free cleansers and home-made products for bath and personal care purposes.'

Where are sulfates found?,"'Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are most commonly found in the following products (the percentage of these compounds in the product depends on the manufacturer and can vary from 0.5% up to 50%):''Naturally occurring sulfites are present in the following:' Liquid soap Detergents (laundry and dishes) Shampoos Toothpaste Bath bombs Drinking water, improving their taste Fertilizers Pesticides Fungicides"
Are sulfates safe?,"'There is no evidence of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) being associated with ''cancer'', ''infertility'', developmental abnormalities, and other diseases; hence, sulfates aren’t particularly unsafe or dangerous. However, in recent times, there has been a lot of controversy over sulfate products because of their impact on the skin, hair, and environment. The compounds may slowly build up in the body with prolonged use, but the amount is usually minimal and does not cause any serious health problems.''The risks of using products with SLS and SLES include:' Using products with SLS and SLES causes irritation to the skin, eyes, mouth, and lungs. It causes clogged pores and acne in people with sensitive skin. Dull, dry, and damaged hair because sulfate compounds strip away natural oils from the hair. It causes an allergic reaction, in which case the products containing these products should be avoided. Sulfate compounds negatively impact the environment. Sulfate compounds are made from palm oil, for which tropical rainforests are destroyed for palm tree plantations. Sulfate products that get washed down the drain can be toxic to animals.  Sulfates are also derived from petroleum. Petroleum products are associated with climate change, pollution, and greenhouse gases.  Sulfate products are tested on animals to determine the appropriate percentage to be used in human products. These compounds can have serious side effects on animals, causing skin, eye, and lung damage. "
Should you stop using sulfate products?,"'Going sulfate-free depends on the individuals. Those who have worrisome side effects due to sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) in their cleaning and personal care products may opt for sulfate-free products. Additionally, how sulfate affects the skin and hair often depends on the brand and manufacturer because all sources are not the same. The lather created by sulfate products gives a clean feeling, but sulfate-free products can also effectively clean the skin and hair. Sulfate-free products are also better for the environment. Sulfate-free products are generally priced higher as well. Hence, if it’s convenient for the individual, they can try switching to sulfate-free products.' "
What is tendon transfer surgery?,"'Tendon transfer surgery is a type of ''hand surgery'' that is performed to improve the lost function of the hand. In this surgery, a functioning tendon is shifted from its original attachment to another site in the hand for restoring the lost action.\xa0''If the nerve supplying the muscle is damaged beyond repair, the action of the muscle is lost. Tendon transfer from a functional site may be performed in such cases to restore the lost function.''A tendon is a cord-like fibrous band that attaches a muscle to a bone to aid movement during muscle action.''The hand has two groups of tendons:' Extensor tendons: They run from the forearm across the back of the hand to the fingers and thumb, allowing you to straighten your fingers and thumb. Flexor tendons: They travel from the forearm through the wrist and across the palm, allowing you to bend your fingers. A tendon transfer surgery may be performed to repair damage to both these groups of tendons."
Who needs a tendon transfer surgery?,"'You may require a tendon transfer surgery to restore your lost function of muscles or tendons due to the following:' Nerve injury (torn, cut, or stretched nerve) Muscle injury  Neuromuscular disorder (such as cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and spinal muscle atrophy) Birth defect (babies born without certain muscle functions) Rheumatoid arthritis (a long-term inflammatory disease affecting various parts of the body including the muscles, joints, and bones)"
How does a tendon transfer work?,"'The hand has various muscles attached to the bone by tendons. A muscle may lose its functions because of an injury; for example, if the wrist gets broken during an accident, the movement of some muscles of the hand may be hampered.\xa0''A tendon transfer surgery ''restores the lost function by replacing non-working muscles and tendons with working ones. The surgery may be performed under mild sedation or under general anesthesia (you ''sleep'' during the procedure) depending on the severity of the injury and the extent of repair required.\xa0''During this surgery, the surgeon makes a surgical cut (incision) and harvests the tendon of an extra muscle that is moved from another place and ''stitches'' it to the tendon of the non-working muscle. Thus, the muscle attached to the transferred tendon is now a functional muscle. More than one tendon transfers may be required to repair some injuries.''The newly transferred tendon is protected by a cast or splint until the tendon heals to its new position in one to two months. During this period, the person must undergo physical therapy to attain optimal function and quick recovery.' "
What are the risks of tendon transfer surgery?,"'The risks of tendon transfer surgery are as follows:' Infection Pain Repair failure Tendon adhesion (tendons become stuck to the surrounding tissue and lose their range of movement) Hand deformity Bleeding Injury to nearby nerves, tendons or blood vessels Hand stiffness Hand weakness Swelling Rupture of the transferred tendon and the need for another corrective surgery"
What is otoplasty?,"'Otoplasty'' is a type of cosmetic ear surgery to reshape the ear, improving its structure and/or function.\xa0''Some of the early otoplasty surgeries were done mainly to improve the appearance of the ears after ''trauma''. The surgery may also restore confidence in children with unusually prominent ears.\xa0' "
How big is the ‘big-ear’ problem?,"'Large or protruding ears may function perfectly, but psychologically they can affect the individual’s confidence and day-to-day life.\xa0''Furthermore, protruding ears may be a sign of concealed ''birth defects'' related to the genitals and urinary system that may require medical attention.' "
Who considers otoplasty surgery?,'Otoplasty is for individuals who:' Are dissatisfied with the appearance of their protruding ears Feel their ear size is too large in proportion to their heads Have ear disfiguration because of trauma or previous surgery
When should otoplasty be avoided?,"'You should avoid seeking otoplasty if' You have unrealistic expectations about the cosmetic improvement after surgery. You are not committed to provide yourself the prescribed postoperative care.  You are prone to the formation of big scars or keloids, and cannot accept the probability of these occurring.  "
What is the best age for otoplasty?,"'The ear is fully shaped at birth. By age three, the ear is almost 85% of the adult size. By age five or six, the adult size is nearly achieved. Further increase in size with ''aging'' is due to the elongation of the earlobe and not actual growth. Thus, the best age for otoplasty is after the adult ear size is achieved, which means after the age of five.\xa0' "
How long does it take to recover from otoplasty?,"'Most people can appreciate the results of the surgery soon after the bandages are removed. Some, especially adults, may need a bit of psychological adjustment to their new appearance. Although recovery varies from patient to patient, you can expect to get back to your routine activities in a week or two.' Your doctor will examine you on the first post-operative day.  Your bandages will be removed to inspect your ears and look for any collection of blood underneath the skin of the ears.  The ears will then be rebandaged until the next exam a day later.  After inspection of the ears, an elastic headband is placed over the head and ears.  You must wear this continuously for the next five days and during sleep for the following two weeks.  On the seventh postoperative day, stitches are removed.  There might be some amount of bruising and swelling that subside in 14 days."
What are the complications of otoplasty?,'Otoplasty can lead to unwanted results:' Incomplete correction of prominent ears  Telephone ear: This results if the mid-portion of the ear is corrected more than the upper and lower poles  Reverse telephone ear deformity: This is a result of inadequate correction of the central portion of the ear relative to the upper and lower poles. Overcorrection of a prominent ear can lead to abnormal appearance of the ear Scarring Swelling Disfigured ears Infection
What is the best cure for migraine?,'The best cure for ''migraine'' involves preventive medications and lifestyle changes. Some newer medications and therapies are effective in controlling the ''symptoms of migraine''. Avoiding or controlling triggers may provide considerable benefit. ''Migraine'' can be prevented mainly by' Daily use of medications Avoiding triggers Lifestyle changes
What is migraine?,"'Migraine is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent, intense, throbbing ''pain'' on either one side or both sides of the head. Most people with migraine feel the ''pain'' in one eye or ear or the temples.''Migraine can occur at any time of the day, although in some cases, it usually starts in the morning. Pain may last for a few hours or up to one to two days. The frequency of a migraine attack varies from individual to individual. In some, it may occur once or twice a week, whereas in others it may occur once or twice a year. Migraine significantly diminishes the quality of life.''Migraine is the third most prevalent disease and affects one billion people worldwide.' "
What are the medications that are useful in migraine?,"'Migraine medications do not cure migraine; instead, they treat or relieve the symptoms. Migraine can be treated using ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) painkillers or prescription medications, which include' Pain medications: OTC medications such as aspirin or Advil (ibuprofen) are useful in relieving pain. Triptans: Imitrex (sumatriptan) or Maxalt (rizatriptan) are prescription drugs used for migraine. Reyvow (lasmiditan): This is a new oral tablet used for the treatment of migraine. Lasmiditan has been effective in relieving pain. Ubrelvy (ubrogepant): This is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist useful for the treatment of acute migraine with or without aura. Opioid medications: Narcotic medications that contain codeine are effective in treating migraine. Antiemetic drug: Reglan (metoclopramide) and Compro (prochlorperazine) are useful in treating nausea and vomiting accompanying the migraine."
Which preventive medications are useful in the treatment of migraine?,"'Individuals experiencing frequent ''headaches'' or ''headaches'' lasting for a long time may require preventive medications. Different medications used as preventive medications involve' Blood pressure medications such as Inderal (propranolol), Corgard (nadolol), Covera (verapamil) and flunarizine Antiseizure medications such as Topamax (topiramate), Neurontin (gabapentin) and Depakote (divalproex sodium) Antidepressant medications such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline Botox injections such as Onabotulinium toxin A may be useful in patients who experience 15 headache days every month. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists such as Aimovig (erenumab), Ajovy (fremanezumab) and Emgality (galcanezumab) are beneficial to reduce migraine frequency. These medications are injected monthly or quarterly."
Which new devices are useful in the treatment of migraine?,"'There are now four new devices that allow patients to self-administer electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve, which has proven to be effective in treating migraine and ''cluster headaches''.' Cefaly: This device is worn as a headband around the forehead. The headband is connected to the electrode and then to the forehead for about 20 minutes. GammaCore: This device uses electrodes to send signals to the vagus nerves. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sTMS): This device sends a magnetic pulse that excites a part of the brain. Nerivio: This device transmits electrical pulses to the vagus nerve at the start of a migraine headache. It is worn on the arm."
What are some of the lifestyle changes useful in the treatment of migraine?,'Some lifestyle changes that can help prevent the attack include' Staying hydrated Maintaining a healthy diet Exercising regularly but avoiding exertion Keeping track of all the triggers Taking preventive medicines to avoid migraine headaches around the time of periods Eating at regular intervals Reducing stress Avoiding foods that trigger attacks Rubbing or applying pressure to the spot where you feel pain Placing a cold cloth on the head during a headache Getting counseling sessions
What is the best exercise for back pain?,"'We are often a bit negligent toward our back while doing chores or physical ''exercise''. The back is such an important part of our bodies, and any issue with it can affect our posture, mobility and ability to perform daily tasks. Unfortunately, the attention toward the health of the back usually goes when there is some discomfort or ''pain'' associated with it. ''Back pain''\xa0 is perhaps one of the most common reasons people visit their doctors. Several conditions may cause or put you at risk of ''back pain''. These include''While the causes for ''back pain'' may vary, regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial for keeping the back healthy. ''Smokers'' are also more vulnerable to get ''back pain''. ''Smoking'' can give you a long-term ''cough'', which may cause bulging or rupture of intervertebral discs. ''Smoking'' can also compromise blood supply to the bones, increasing the chances of ''osteoporosis''.\xa0''If your back ''pain'' does not subside with routine measures such as stretching, physical therapy or pain medications, you must visit your doctor. Also, before starting any exercise or dietary regimen, you must ask your doctor. It is very important to warm up and stretch before any exercise.''Three of the easy exercises that can be done at home to strengthen your back and ease back pain include''Glute ''bridges'': ''To do this exercise''Knee to chest: ''To perform this exercise''Superman:'' For this exercise' Old age A strain in the muscles or ligaments  Arthritis Osteoporosis (a condition in which bones become weak and brittle) Bulging or ruptured intervertebral disc (the cushions present between the bones of the back or vertebrae) Poor posture Being overweight or obese Lifting heavy weights Lack of exercise Period cramps (felt in the lower abdomen and back) Smoking Tumors  Lie face upwards on a mat on the floor. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the ground with heels touching the floor. While you dig your heels into the ground, simultaneously squeeze your hip muscles. Lift the hips until your shoulders, hips and knees come in a straight line. Hold this position for about five to six seconds. Bring your hips back to the floor slowly.  Rest for five to ten seconds and repeat. Avoid any jerky movements. You may repeat this exercise eight to 15 times or as advised by your healthcare professional. Lie with your back toward the floor. Bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the floor. Draw your right knee toward your chest while keeping the left foot flat on the floor. Hold this posture for around 15 to 30 seconds making sure that your back is flat on the floor. Avoid the temptation of lifting your lower back or putting pressure on it. Gently lower your right knee. Relax. Now repeat the exercise with your left knee. Avoid any jerky movements. Repeat for four to five times on each knee or as advised by your healthcare professional. Lie on the floor or exercise mat with your face down. Stretch your arms in front of you so they lie parallel to the floor. Raise your arms, legs and chest simultaneously off the floor. Hold for about two seconds. Remember to breathe out during this movement. Slowly inhale and lower your arms, legs and chest back onto the ground. Repeat for eight to 10 times or as advised by your healthcare professional."
What are the different types of birth control?,"'Birth control or ''contraception'' is any method, medicine or device used to prevent pregnancy in a sexually active woman.\xa0Each method works differently, like preventing sperm to reach an egg or not allowing the body to release eggs. The primary goal of any birth control is to avoid an unwanted pregnancy. Below are different types of birth control:''Short-acting hormonal contraception\xa0''Long-term contraception\xa0''Long-term contraception can be a good choice because of long-lasting birth control without much maintenance. Choices include an implant inserted into an arm or an\xa0''intrauterine device'' (IUD)\xa0inserted into the uterus.\xa0''One-time barrier contraception''Permanent contraception''Emergency contraception' Common methods include everyday oral birth control pills, a skin patch that needs replacement every week, a vaginal ring that needs to be changed every month or a birth control injection given by the doctor every three months. All of these methods require a prescription.  Short-acting hormonal contraception is about 91% to 95% effective in preventing pregnancy. Hormonal birth control side effects can vary. However, one beneficial side effect that many women notice is the reduction in period pain, frequency or flow. These methods are 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.  They can work for 3 to 10 years, depending on the particular method you choose.  The implant (Nexplanon) and hormonal IUDs (such as Skyla, Mirena and Kyleena) work by adjusting the body’s progestin levels over time. Copper IUDs (ParaGard) do not use hormones. Instead, the copper stops sperm from fertilizing your eggs. Side effects include discomfort when the device is put in place, and some people can experience a few temporary or (less commonly) ongoing side effects such as weight gain, headaches and soreness. However, many women find the benefits of low-maintenance, long-term birth control to be well worth it. Condoms, sponges, diaphragms, cervical caps and spermicide are all barrier birth control methods. Each of them works differently, but they all create a sperm “barrier” during sex to physically prevent sperm from reaching an egg. Barrier contraception methods don’t require a prescription and are available at many stores or online. Additionally, condoms help protect against sexually transmitted infections, the only birth control method to do so. They prevent pregnancy in 71% to 88% of the time depending on the method.  Tubal ligation (for women) and vasectomies (for men) are surgical procedures intended to make pregnancy impossible.  They’re almost 100% effective at preventing pregnancy. If you’re very sure you don’t want to have children in the future, they’re a great option to consider. Recovery time from these procedures usually takes only a few days. Sexual functions of patients and their partners are not affected. Permanent contraception is one of the most convenient birth control options only if a patient is confident that they don’t want children in the future.  Reversing a tubal ligation or vasectomy is possible; however, there isn’t any guarantee that fertility will return. If a patient had sex without using birth control or birth control fails, emergency contraception can help prevent pregnancy. Pills and copper IUD are the two types of emergency birth control that are available.  One type of pill often called “Plan B” is available from most pharmacies without a prescription; it can prevent pregnancy up to three days after sex. A more effective pill often called “Ella” does need a prescription but can prevent pregnancy up to five days after sex.  Copper IUDs also require patients to see a doctor, but they’re almost 100% effective when inserted within five days of intercourse."
How are migraines diagnosed?,"'To make the diagnosis of ''migraine'', your doctor will take your complete medical history.

What is arthritis?,"'Arthritis'' refers to the inflammation of the joints. It presents as ''pain'' and swelling of the joints in the body. Arthritis can develop in any joint such as joints of the fingers, hips, and knees.\xa0''The cartilage (a rubbery tissue covering the ends of the bones) breaks down over time, leaving the bones without anything to cushion them. This causes the bones in the joints to rub against each other resulting in painful swelling.\xa0''Arthritis is a very painful condition without a permanent cure. However, there are many treatment options available to curb the complications of arthritis.\xa0' "
What is the best treatment for arthritis?,"'Painkillers, along with physical therapy, is usually considered the best treatment for arthritis in the early stages. However, if the patient is unable to continue their daily activities, then the surgical option is recommended at the particular ''painful joint'' to give relief to the patient.\xa0' Physical therapy: Physical therapists can work with patients on exercises to reduce pain and improve their range of motion. Patients with arthritis have a hard time performing physical activities, but exercise can relieve arthritis pain and lessen joint damage.Exercise can also help to lose weight that will put less stress on the joints. Exercises such as stretching, muscle strengthening and aerobics can help patients to stay fit. It also increases flexibility, range of motion and lubrication in their joints.Exercises involving lifting weights can build muscle strength, which can help a person to manage daily activities.Exercises also strengthen the heart and lungs and can reduce fatigue besides increasing the patient’s stamina.Typical aerobic exercises such as walking, running, riding a bicycle, swimming, or using a treadmill can cut down calories.

Another option is a corticosteroid injection at the site of joint pain, which is only given if the pain is very severe. Natural remedies: Natural remedies are usually considered by the patient because they believe them to have limited side effects. Some herbs and supplements (capsaicin, flaxseed, ginger, ginkgo, and turmeric) may relieve arthritis.However, the most popular ones for pain relief are chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine. Both are made of compounds found in the cartilage. They may help the body regenerate the cartilage on the joints. Studies have shown that they may provide modest pain relief and could be tried if the patient is unable to tolerate other pain medications.The American College of Rheumatology does not currently recommend the use of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine.Other natural remedies include acupuncture, massage, heating pads and ice packs.Reducing stress by maintaining a positive outlook may also help to manage the disease.

Procedures to treat AFib: Sometimes, if medicines do not work or if they cause side effects, patients are treated with procedures such as cardioversion or ablation. Electrical cardioversion: In this procedure, the doctor administers a shock to the heart to regulate the heartbeat. Usually, paddles or stick patches called electrodes are placed onto the patient’s chest or on their back. A mild electrical shock is given to the heart to get the heart's rhythm back to normal. Prior to the procedure, the patient may be given sedation. Cardiac ablation: In this procedure, the doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into a blood vessel through the patient’s leg or neck. Then they guide it to the heart. When it reaches the area that’s causing irregular heartbeats, it sends out electrical signals that destroy those cells. The treated tissue helps to get heartbeat regular again.Surgical ablation involves cutting into the chest: This surgical procedure can be done in two ways depending on the patient’s condition. Maze procedure: This procedure is usually done during an open-heart surgery for another problem (bypass or valve replacement). The surgeon generally makes small cuts in the upper part of the patient’s heart. They’re stitched together to form the scar tissue that stops abnormal signals.Mini maze: This is a less invasive procedure. The doctor usually makes several small cuts between the ribs and uses a camera to guide catheters (flexible tube) for cardiac ablation.

In this condition, the bladder sags only a short way into the vagina.''Grade 2:'' This is a more severe condition in which the bladder slips down further to reach the opening of the vagina.''Grade 3: ''This is the most severe condition in which the bladder sags so low that it comes out of the vagina.' Uterine prolapse: This refers to the prolapse of the uterus and cervix (neck of the uterus) down the vagina. In severe cases, the prolapsed parts may come out through the vaginal opening. Vaginal vault prolapse: This type of prolapse can occur in women who have had a hysterectomy (surgery for the removal of the uterus). Following hysterectomy, the top of the vagina is repaired to form a vaginal vault. During vault prolapse, the vaginal vault drops down into the vaginal canal. Cystocele: In this condition, the bladder bulges into the vagina. Rectocele: When the rectum (the last part of the large bowel) bulges into the vagina, it is called rectocele. Enterocele: This refers to the bulging of the small bowel against the vaginal wall. This can occur along with vaginal vault prolapse."
What are the symptoms of cystocele?,"'The symptoms of cystocele may vary. Some women with this condition may not have any symptoms or ''pain''. The most common symptom is a bulge through the vagina that may be felt or seen. Other symptoms of cystocele may include' Frequent urge to urinate Inability to empty the bladder Loss of bladder control or urinary incontinence Feeling pressure or fullness in the vagina Discomfort or pain while passing urine  Discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse Frequent urinary tract infections  Pain in the vagina, lower belly, groin, pelvic area or lower back Feeling some mass jutting out of the vagina"
What is the best treatment for cystocele?,"'The treatment of cystocele may vary depending on various factors such as the severity of the disease and the presence of symptoms or any underlying medical conditions. Treatment options include' Watchful waiting: In the absence of symptoms, the doctor may suggest no treatment. They may keep the patient under observation for the development of any symptoms or complications.  Conservative (nonsurgical) therapy: This may includeKegel exercises (pelvic floor strengthening exercises)Physical therapyVaginal pessary (a vaginal support device)Medications such as estrogen replacement therapy Kegel exercises (pelvic floor strengthening exercises) Physical therapy Vaginal pessary (a vaginal support device) Medications such as estrogen replacement therapy Surgery: Surgery options includeOpen surgeryLaparoscopic surgery (using a long flexible instrument called a laparoscope)Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery  Open surgery Laparoscopic surgery (using a long flexible instrument called a laparoscope) Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery "
Is diverticulitis dangerous?,"'Diverticulitis is a potentially serious condition involving infection or swelling of the pockets or bulges (called diverticula), which may form in the large bowel (colon). These pockets or diverticula push out through the weak spots in the colon. Diverticulitis needs treatment through medications and, in some cases, surgery as it can lead to many dangerous complications:' Abscess: It is a painful, swollen, infected, and pus-filled area just outside the colon wall. It may cause fever with chills, nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Bowel obstruction: Diverticulitis may cause partial or complete obstruction of the intestine.  Perforation: It refers to a small hole or tear in the colon. Peritonitis: It is the inflammation or infection of the lining of the abdomen. It presents as fever and severe abdominal pain. Fistula: It refers to an abnormal passage between two organs or between an organ and the outside of the body."
Can diverticulitis be prevented?,"'Some lifestyle and diet modifications can definitely reduce the risk of diverticulitis. Preventive measures include the following:''Avoid refined or processed foods such as white rice, pastries, white flour and other processed foods.' Eat plenty of fiber: One of the most important factors that may prevent diverticulitis is having regular bowel movements and avoiding constipation (hard stools and straining). A fiber-rich diet draws more water inside the stool, making it move more easily and swiftly through the gut. Drink lots of water: A high-fiber diet pulls more water. Thus, drinking plenty of water is important for regular and comfortable bowel movements. Many experts suggest drinking at least eight ounces of water each day. Regular exercise: Staying physically active keeps your weight under check besides aiding digestion and healthy bowel movements. Around 30 minutes of exercise each day or on most of the days is recommended by most experts."
How is osteoarthritis diagnosed?,"'Osteoarthritis'' (OA) is diagnosed primarily on X-Ray. ''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') may be done later to check for the extent of bone erosion and other injuries to the joint structure. For diagnosing OA, doctors ask for your medical history and look for the signs and symptoms. This is generally done by ''rheumatologists'' and orthopedic surgeons.\xa0' "
How is osteoarthritis different from rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') can affect all the joints of your limbs—hands, fingers, elbows, knees, and hips. Meanwhile, ''osteoarthritis'' (OA) frequently affects your knees, hip, and spine.\xa0''RA'' always affects multiple joints on both sides of the body, whereas OA may only affect one particular joint or area of the body.\xa0''Most often, ''RA'' is frequently accompanied by signs such as ''joint swelling'', tenderness, and ''fever''. ''RA'' may also involve the ''lungs'', eyes, and other organs. These signs are usually not seen in OA.' "
What is the best treatment for osteoarthritis?,"'Once osteoarthritis (OA) starts developing, you can only slow down the progression of the disease and not reverse it. The best treatment for OA varies from person to person. Most often, a combination of various therapies gives the best results. These therapies include the following:' Excess weight puts pressure on your knee joints, hips, and lower back. Weight loss can reduce your chances of disability due to OA.  Exercise can improve your muscle strength and reduce joint pain and stiffness.  Supportive devices, such as a walking cane, can help you walk with ease.  Heating pads/bags or cold therapy can help relieve OA symptoms temporarily. Alternative/complementary therapies such as hot fomentation (spa), massage, acupressure, and acupuncture can help relieve pain for a short time.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetaminophen can help relieve the pain and swelling in patients with OA. These can be in the form of topical gels, oral pills, or injections.  Some medications work to change how your body responds to pain. Popular options include prescription opioids containing oxycodone or hydrocodone. Opioids can be addictive. Cymbalta (Duloxetine) is also one of the effective drugs for pain associated with chronic OA.  Narcotics such as oxycodone and hydrocodone are prescribed if you have extreme joint pain or fail to respond to NSAIDs and analgesics. Sometimes, a steroid drug or lubricant, such as hyaluronic acid, is injected into the painful joints. These shots may help delay the need for knee replacement surgery by a few years in some patients with OA. Surgical treatment becomes an option for severe cases that do not get any relief from the aforementioned treatments. This can be in the form of arthroscopy or knee replacement surgery. Arthroscopy helps in repairing the joint damage by inserting a long camera like a tube in your knee. Knee replacement surgery is mostly advised in severely damaged knee joints, particularly if you are obese. Many over-the-counter dietary supplements, such as calcium, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, glucosamine, and chondroitin, are used in the treatment of OA. However, first, you need to consult your doctor if you are on some other medicines to avoid drug interactions."
What happens if osteoarthritis is left untreated?,'Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees or hips can lead to the following complications:' Deformities such as a bow-legged appearance due to knee joint involvement Chronic pain due to joint erosion affecting the quality of life Pinched nerves causing pain and muscle weakness causing restricted movements Stress fractures over weakened bones Poor quality of life
How can I prevent tendinitis?,"'To prevent future tendinitis events, you should' Vary your exercises and gently stretch all the muscles before the starting actual exercises. Include warm-up (5 minutes) and cool-down exercises during your planned 30 minutes exercise routine. Try to prevent repetitive use of the same joint and provide rest to the same joint after certain repetitive movements. Wear appropriate footwear or other equipment. Slowly increase your exercise load to avoid significant risk. Avoid overuse of any part of the body such as repetitive movements. Keep all the muscles flexible, movable, and strong."
How to live with tendinitis?,"'Your shoulder may become stiff because of chronic tendinitis or ''bursitis'' if you don’t move it. Therefore, it is very necessary to do some motion exercises such as stretching every day to preserve the movements of those affected joints. Stretching exercises can be painful due to tendinitis or bursitis. Therefore, early medical help should be taken to avoid ''joint stiffness'' and chronic issues. It is necessary to give rest to your affected limb or joint until you can move it without any pain. If you cannot provide enough rest to that affected joint, the healing process may delay. Therefore, to fasten the healing process, you must' Provide rest to your painful joint or tendon. Avoid heavy activity or any activity that causes pain in that joint or tendon. Apply ice on that area 10-15 minutes twice daily. Avoid overusing any part of the body such as repetitive actions. If pain worsens or swelling and redness reappears or if it does not fully recover in three to six weeks, you must see your doctor for help. Before starting any strenuous exercise or activity, you must do warm up exercises."
What are the possible complications of tendinitis?,'Possible risks include:' Risk of further injury to the same tendon or joint  Tendon rupture Return of tendinitis symptoms
What is astigmatism?,"'Astigmatism'""\xa0is a type of vision problem due to imperfection in the curvature of the eye's ""'cornea'' or ''lens''. Hence, the cornea is unable to evenly focus light on the retina (the inner light-sensitive layer of the eye). Those with ''astigmatism'' typically have blurred or distorted vision, ''eye strain'' and ''headaches''.\xa0''Astigmatism'' can coexist in combination with other refractive errors, such as ''myopia'' (''nearsightedness'') and hypermetropia (''farsightedness'').' "
What are the signs and symptoms of astigmatism?,"'Signs and ''symptoms of astigmatism'' may include''Children and adolescents''Young children may not realize their vision is blurry, so a regular eye test is required. School-aged children may have difficulty reading, writing or seeing the blackboard/whiteboard.' Blurred or distorted vision Eyestrain Squinting Headaches Decreased vision at night"
What causes astigmatism?,"'The eye has two curved structures, the cornea and the lens. The cornea is the clear layer on the outer surface of the eye. The lens is a clear structure inside the eye that helps focus light for clear vision. The cornea and lens bend (refract) and focus light on the retina, which makes the images required for vision. In a normal eye, these curved structures are smooth so they can create sharp vision. In astigmatism, the surface of the cornea or lens is not smooth. If either the cornea (corneal astigmatism) or the lens (lenticular astigmatism) is shaped differently, then these mismatched curves bend the light rays at different angles, forming two different images. This results in distorted or ''blurred vision''. Astigmatism is a type of refractive error. The blurred vision may occur in different directions - vertically, horizontally or diagonally.''Astigmatism is usually present from birth, which could be due to genetic predisposition. It can also develop after any eye ''trauma'', disease or surgery. Astigmatism is not caused or worsened by reading in the dark, watching TV for too long or squinting.' "
How is astigmatism diagnosed?,'An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) diagnoses astigmatism by performing a complete eye examination with the help of various kinds of diagnostic equipment.' 
What is the best way to correct astigmatism?,"'The goal of treating astigmatism is to improve vision and eye comfort. Treatments options are corrective lenses or refractive surgery.''Corrective lenses''Wearing corrective lenses is the simplest way to treat astigmatism by counteracting uneven curvatures of the cornea or lens. Corrective lenses may be worn as ''eyeglasses'' or ''contact lenses''.''Refractive surgery''Refractive surgery improves vision and replaces the need to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. Types of refractive surgery for astigmatism include' Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): The eye surgeon creates a thin flap in the cornea. An excimer laser is then used to change the shape of the cornea. The flap is then repositioned. Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK): Instead of creating a flap, the cornea is loosened using alcohol. A laser is then used to alter the curvature of the cornea and then the loosened epithelium is repositioned. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK): The epithelium is removed and allowed to grow back naturally, according to the cornea's new shape. Epi-LASIK: This is similar to LASEK, but this uses a mechanized blunt blade instead of the alcohol to loosen the cornea. Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE): This is a newer type of refractive surgery that reshapes the cornea by using a laser."
What are the complications of surgery for astigmatism?,'The surgeries are relatively safe. Some of the possible complications that may occur after refractive surgery are' Under correction or overcorrection of the initial refractive error Appearance of halos or starbursts around lights Dry eyes Eye infection Scarring Vision loss
Can astigmatism be prevented?,"'Astigmatism is usually present from birth, which could be genetic or may develop after any eye trauma, disease or surgery. Astigmatism is not caused or worsened by reading in the dark or poor lighting; watching TV or other screens for too long; sitting too close to the screen or squinting.''Maintaining a healthy, nutritious ''diet'', avoiding excessive screen time or straining the eyes and protecting the eyes from pollution and injuries can maintain overall eye health. However, there are no specific preventive measures for astigmatism.' "
What is the body mass index (BMI)?,"'Body mass index (''BMI'') is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of the body’s height in meters. It indicates whether the weight is appropriate for the person’s height. Another way to calculate BMI is to multiply the person’s weight in pounds by 703 and divide it by the height (in inches) squared.''BMI is the most inexpensive screening tool to measure ''obesity''. Although it does not directly measure body fat, it can be correlated with more direct measures of body fat.''The various categories of BMI include the following''Example: If a person weighs 68 kg and is 165 cm (1.65 m) tall, BMI is calculated as 68 ÷ (1.65)2\xa0= 24.98 kg/m2, which means that the person has a BMI of 24.98 and is considered to bea healthy weight.' BMI values of less than 18.5 kg/m2 are considered underweight. BMI values between 18.5 kg/m2 to 24.9 kg/m2 are healthy. BMI values between 25 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2 are overweight. BMI values greater than 40 kg/m2 are considered obese."
How is BMI used?,"'Body mass index (BMI) is a screening tool. It does not reflect body fat or the health status of an individual. Moreover, the physician will also assess the individual’s ''diet'', physical activity and family history to determine if BMI is a health risk.' "
What are the BMI trends for adults in the United States?,"'Since the 1970s, the prevalence of adult body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m2 has been increasing. Although recently, there is a decline in this trend except for older women\xa0 Women over the age of 60 years old have continued to remain obese all these years.' "
Are there any issues with using BMI?,"'Healthcare professionals often use body mass index (BMI) as a screening tool to identify weight problems. Although it gives a good estimation of body fat for most of the individuals, it may be erroneous to use in the case of bodybuilders and other muscular people who have high muscle mass. High ''bone density'' may also result in high BMI. BMI may underestimate body fat in people who have lost muscle mass, especially in the older population. At the same BMI, body fatness may differ among the following populations:' Men and women Blacks and whites Older people and younger adults Athletes and non-athletes"
What is the ideal weight?,'The ideal weight has been mentioned in the below table' 
What are the advantages of maintaining a healthy weight?,"'By maintaining a healthy weight, an individual enjoys the following advantages' Reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers Better sleep quality Less muscle and joint pain Reduced risk of high blood pressure and diabetes Better regulation of bodily fluids Reduced burden on the heart and circulatory system Increased energy and ability to complete the desired activities Reduced cholesterol levels Reduced risk of gallbladder disease"
What is Cotard’s syndrome?,"'Cotard’s syndrome, also known as ''walking'' corpse syndrome, is a neuropsychiatric condition in which people develop false beliefs that their body parts are missing, or they are dying or they don’t exist. This condition is rare because only 200 known cases are present worldwide.''This condition typically exists in people with ''depression'', ''schizophrenia'', or other mental illnesses and is often associated with ''dementia'' (''memory loss'').' "
What are the symptoms of Cotard’s syndrome?,"'People with Cotard’s syndrome manifest the following symptoms:' Negation of the mind, brain, and intellect Denial of pregnancy Denial of the existence of various body parts Denial of being alive Denial of self-movement Self-starvation Less sociable One of the symptoms is nihilism, in which a person believes that nothing has any value or meaning."
What is the cause of Cotard’s syndrome?,"'The exact cause of Cotard’s syndrome is unknown. There are certain conditions that more likely cause this syndrome:' Dementia (loss of memory and judgment) Encephalopathy (a condition, where a virus or toxin affects the brain) Multiple sclerosis (serious disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord) Parkinson’s disease (nerve cell damage in the brain leading to shaking, stiffness and gait difficulty) Stroke Subdural bleeding (bleeding outside the brain) Epilepsy Migraine"
Who is at the risk of getting Cotard’s syndrome?,'People in their early 50s are at the risk of getting Cotard’s syndrome. People with the following conditions are at higher risk:' History of mental illness Depression Schizophrenia Substance abuse Brain tumor Stroke Blood clot in the brain Injury to the brain Bipolar disorder in teens
How is Cotard’s syndrome diagnosed?,"'Because Cotard’s syndrome is not a disease, it doesn’t have standardized diagnostic criteria. The physician may rule out other conditions to confirm the diagnosis of Cotard’s syndrome. The physician might ask about the symptoms or any risk factors.' "
How is Cotard’s syndrome treated?,'The management of Cotard’s syndrome involves medication therapy and a form of talk therapy called ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') or ''psychotherapy''.''These therapies can treat Cotard’s syndrome to a great extent.''Medications used to treat Cotard’s syndrome include the following:''Electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can be the preferred choice of therapy in the case of failed medication and talk therapy. ECT therapy involves sending small currents through the brain. This alters the brain’s chemistry to relieve some of the symptoms.' Antipsychotics Antianxiety drugs Antidepressants
Is Cotard’s syndrome curable?,"'Although the symptoms are severe, Cotard’s syndrome is curable with treatment. Generally, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) therapy is beneficial compared to medications in treating Cotard’s syndrome.' "
What are the types of hemangiomas?,'Hemangiomas are the most common in the skin.' Infantile hemangioma: Hemangiomas of the skin are common in infants and are known as infantile hemangiomas. They can be present at birth but most typically appear within the first weeks or months of life. Most infantile hemangiomas subside at puberty. Intramuscular hemangioma (hemangiomas in the muscle tissue): It can occur at any age but most often occur in young adults.  Bone hemangioma: Bone hemangiomas occur in the skull or spine and are most common in older people.  Internal organ hemangioma: These are most common in the liver and intestines. They can also occur in the respiratory system and brain.
What are the signs and symptoms of hemangiomas?,"'Hemangiomas of the skin initially appear as small red ''bumps''. Gradually, as the blood vessels multiply further, hemangiomas look like big, burgundy-colored bumps. Their color resembles the deep red color of strawberry, and hence, they are also called “strawberry marks.”''Hemangiomas generally do not produce any symptoms unless they are multiple or located in a sensitive area such as near the eye.''Hemangiomas that grow in the internal organs such as the liver and other organs of the ''digestive system'' can cause problems such as:''Deep hemangiomas in the muscles may be painful and swollen. The ''pain'' and swelling increase with activity.' Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite Abdominal discomfort"
Which tests are used to diagnose hemangiomas?,"'Doctors usually diagnose the ''hematoma'' by performing physical examinations and taking your medical history.\xa0''Other tests that help in knowing more about the exact location, size, and depth of hemangioma include:' X-ray Ultrasonography (USG) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Computerized tomography (CT) scan Angiogram (injection of dye into the surrounding bloodstream to make the hemangioma show up in an X-ray image) Biopsy (removal of a small tissue from the hemangioma to check if it is cancer) Blood tests (such as genetic analysis for multiple hemangiomas)"
How are hemangiomas treated?,"'Although hemangiomas may not require any treatment, you need to give regular follow-ups to monitor any changes in it.''Treatment of hemangioma can include any of the following:' Beta-blocker medication (timolol and propranolol) Anti-inflammatory medications (steroids) Compression (using of inflatable sleeves or leggings to apply pressure to the hemangioma) Embolization (a procedure to cut off the blood supply to large hemangiomas) Laser treatment (used for removing hemangiomas or alleviating the symptoms) Surgical treatment (surgical removal of hemangiomas)"
Which endoscopic techniques are done for treating colon cancer or polyps?,'The main endoscopic techniques that are available for the removal of colon (part of the ''large intestine'') polyps or ''cancer'' are as follows:' Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR): This procedure removes early-stage cancer and precancerous growths from the lining of the digestive tract. It works better with superficial masses. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD): This procedure removes large tumors from the gastrointestinal tract. Polypectomy: This procedure is used to remove polyps (an abnormal collection of tissue) from the inside of the colon.
What is the difference between dissection and resection?," Resection: This is a surgical procedure used to remove a part of an organ or a structure, possibly because of disease or cancer (e.g., the tumor resected after chemotherapy). Dissection: This is a procedure of cuts apart or separates tissue for further study or diagnosis. It helps in removing a complete part that is affected by the disease (e.g., autopsy)."
How is an endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) performed?,"'Endoscopic mucosal resection is performed with a target to capture the diseased tissue. An electrosurgical current is used to cut the tissue that has been grasped.\xa0''An injection is usually administered in the submucosal space (a lining in the colon) to elevate the lesion but is not always necessary; some techniques, such as underwater endoscopic mucosal resection, do not require an injection into the submucosa.\xa0''If the lesion is larger than 15 to 20 mm, it typically must be removed in a nonsystematic fashion. The main use of an endoscopic mucosal resection is to remove polyps that are larger than 10 mm.' "
How is an endoscopic submucosal dissection performed?,'An endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is performed by injecting fluid into the submucosa (a lining on the colon) and creating an incision around the perimeter of the diseased part or lesion and then carefully dissecting the lesion from the deeper layers. Various specialized instruments (ESD knives) are utilized to perform the procedure.\xa0''An ESD is endorsed for lesions that have a high likelihood of aggressive cancer that have high chances to invade other parts. It is used when lesions cannot be removed by an endoscopic mucosal resection or when lesions reoccur after the endoscopic mucosal resection procedure.' 
What is the difference between an endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)?," EMR is easier to learn and perform, has a lower risk of adverse events, and carries a low-cost burden. It continues to be the more commonly performed endoscopic resection procedure. Endoscopists have limited experience with an ESD, and there is no reimbursement for this procedure in few parts of the world. There is limited incentive to learn and perform this more complex and high-risk procedure by endoscopists. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. EMR is relatively simple to perform, uses a limited number of devices and has a long track record of being successful for most precancerous lesions. Its main disadvantage is that some patients who are treated with this procedure may require additional surgery. However, if they had been treated with ESD, they may have been cured. The other major disadvantage of EMR is that it has a high lesion recurrence rate in the range of 15% to 20%, which necessitates further therapy. The main advantage of ESD is that it allows complete dissection of any type of lesion regardless of size. Removing the entire lesion in a single piece is a basic oncologic principle and carries the benefits of accurate histological assessment and staging, determination of curative resection and a very low recurrence rate of less than 1%. However, it is technically more demanding than EMR and requires advanced endoscopy skills. Furthermore, ESD is a relatively complex procedure associated with a higher perforation rate compared with EMR. Fortunately, most perforations caused by an ESD can be successfully treated by endoscopy without the need for surgery."
What is HIV?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') attacks the cells of the immune system. CD4+ cells help the body to resist any infections. When the number of these cells is reduced, the body is less resistant, which makes it vulnerable to other infections and diseases. ''HIV'' spreads mainly via body fluids (blood and semen) from the infected person.''If untreated, ''HIV'' can lead to ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS''). Hence, treating HIV with antiretroviral therapy (ART, HIV medicine) is necessary to reduce the viral load and prevent transmission of HIV to the patient’s sexual partners.' "
What is the difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2?,"'There are two main types of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HIV-1 and HIV-2. The difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2 are as follows''Currently, only one antibody test can distinguish between antibodies to HIV-1 or HIV-2.' HIV-1 is the most common type of HIV and accounts for 95% of all infections, whereas HIV-2 is relatively uncommon and less infectious. HIV-2 is mainly concentrated in West Africa and the surrounding countries. HIV-2 is less fatal and progresses more slowly than HIV-1."
How is HIV transmitted?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted by coming into direct contact with certain body fluids of the person infected with HIV. These fluids are as follows''Transmission occurs only when the fluid gets into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through open sores or ''cuts'', by direct injection or a mucous membrane.''The most common ways of spreading HIV are as follows' Blood Semen Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk Having anal or vaginal sex with an HIV-positive person Sharing needles with a person who has HIV Less common ways are as follows During pregnancy or breastfeeding Having oral sex Receiving blood products that are contaminated with HIV Getting stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle"
What are the symptoms of HIV?,"'Not everyone will have identical symptoms, as it depends on the person and what stage of the disease they are in.''There are three stages of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Each stage has a unique set of symptoms. These include''This stage starts around two to four weeks after getting HIV. The symptoms are similar to those of the ''flu'', which lasts for a week or two. Symptoms include''In this stage, the virus multiplies at a low level and people may not experience any symptoms at all. Without HIV treatment, the person can remain in this stage for 10 to 15 years. However, the virus remains active during this stage.''If left untreated, HIV leads to ''AIDS''. ''AIDS'' can weaken the immune system causing several opportunistic diseases. Symptoms include' Fever Rash Sore throat Swollen glands Headache Upset stomach Joint aches and pains Muscle pain Unexplainable weight loss Recurring fever Getting tired easily Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin or neck Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week Sores of the mouth, anus or genitals Pneumonia Memory loss, depression Purplish spots on the skin that don’t go away Night sweats Bruises or bleeding of unknown reason"
What are the types of HIV tests?,"'There are three types of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests used to diagnose HIV infections, which are as follows' Antibody tests: These check for HIV antibodies in the blood or oral fluid. Antigen/antibody tests: These help to detect both HIV antibodies and antigens in the blood. Nucleic acid tests: These look for HIV in the blood."
What is the treatment for HIV?,"'The treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) involves a combination of medications known as antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART cannot cure HIV; however, it can increase the survival rate of patients.''ART halts the multiplication of the virus and reduces the amount of virus in the body to help the patient stay healthier.''Once the treatment has been started, the patient must remain compliant with the dosage for the medicines to be effective. Noncompliance can result in developing resistance to the medicines.' "
What is a Chalazion?,"'Stye'' is painful inflammation and swelling on the ''eyelid'' with the accumulation of pus. ''It is an infection commonly caused by the bacterium, ''Staphylococcus''. With appropriate treatment, it resolves without any complications. There are two main types of ''stye'': ''hordeolum and ''chalazion''. They have different causes and treatments.' Hordeolum: This occurs due to a blockage in the sweat gland found in the skin of the eyelid at the base of the eyelashes or a small sebaceous gland present at the base of the eyelashes. Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, a waxy, oily substance that moisturizes and protects the skin and hair. Chalazion: This occurs due to a blockage of a meibomian gland, a special sebaceous gland that is present only in the eyelid. It is located inside the eyelid and opens at the rim of the eyelid, behind the lashes."
What are the signs and symptoms of a chalazion?,"'Some signs and symptoms associated with chalazion include' It appears as a swollen bump over the upper or lower eyelid. Multiple swellings may be present. Puffiness of the eyes Pain and tenderness Increased temperature over the affected area Increased pressure over the eyes Heaviness of the eye Epiphora (watering of eyes) Crusting around the eyelids and eyelashes Crusting may cause the eyelids to stick to each other Itching Pus discharge may occur, with or without blood"
What is the fastest way to get rid of a chalazion?,"'It is usually not possible to get rid of a chalazion completely overnight or “fast” because there are no shortcuts to the treatment. One must avoid trying to pop the chalazion and constantly touching and rubbing the eyes. There are several ways to hasten healing including' Avoid using makeup, over-the-counter beauty products, masks or contact lenses. Protect the eye from dust and pollution. Warm compresses and gentle massaging: This can be done by using a clean washcloth dipped in warm water and gently placing it over the affected eye for 5 to 15 minutes. This can be repeated several times a day. A warm gel eye mask can also be used instead of a washcloth. You can combine gentle massage with a warm compress. A warm compress helps to reduce pain and swelling, moves the pus to the surface, dissolves pus and removes crusts. Applying a warm tea bag: Using a warm tea bag as a warm compress helps to reduce inflammation, infection and pain. You can do it several times a day. Gentle cleansing: Use a mild antibacterial soap to gently cleanse the eyes and to remove crusts, reduce infection and maintain hygiene. Medical treatmentPainkillersOral antibiotics, antibiotic ointments or eye drops prescribed by a physician helps quicken healingSteroid injections administered by your healthcare provider may help  reduce swelling Painkillers Oral antibiotics, antibiotic ointments or eye drops prescribed by a physician helps quicken healing Steroid injections administered by your healthcare provider may help  reduce swelling Surgical treatment: In case the chalazion is persistent and does not resolve, the eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may perform a minor surgery under local anesthesia. This procedure typically takes a day and patients can resume their normal activities soon after. A chalazion can sometimes recur."
How do you  prevent chalazion?,"'The following tips can help prevent a chalazion' Maintain hygiene of the eye, eyelids and eyelashes Avoid harsh face products around the eyes Use dermatologically-tested makeup and beauty products Eat a healthy and nutritious diet Avoid touching the face with unclean hands"
What does an open wound mean?,"'An open wound is an injury that includes an external or internal break in your body tissue, usually the skin. Nearly, everyone experiences an open wound at some point in their life. Mostly, they are minor and can be treated with home remedies. You may have''Mostly, simple minor cut wounds do not need stitches to help them to heal. These wounds are left open to heal. Wounds that cause skin tears may require special care with bandages or dressings that keep the wound bed moist without sticking to the wound. Wounds that cause deep lacerations and abrasions may need to be closed by using stitches, staples, or adhesive glue.' Incisions (cuts): These are caused by a sharp object slicing the skin, such as a knife or during surgery. Lacerations (rugged cuts): These are blunt trauma that splits the skin such as being hit with a heavy object. Abrasions (grazes and scratches): These are caused by rubbing or grazing of the epidermis (surface layer of the skin), especially the knees, shins, ankles, and elbows."
When to see your doctor?,"'See your, doctor, if you have''Signs of infection such as' A deep open wound that looks challenging and requires stitches. Wounds due to animal, insect, or human bites. Puncture wound. Unclean wounds contaminated with feces, soil, saliva, glass particles, dirt, and dispersed. Profusely bleeding wound, even after applying continued pressure. The necessity to evaluate for a tetanus immunization.  Wound with redness, swelling, and oozing. Fast heart rate. Confusion. Disorientation.  High heart rate.  Fever or shivering.  Breathlessness.  Extremely severe pain despite taking pain relievers.  Clammy or sweaty skin."
What to expect?,"'Most open wound treatments for minor injuries start healing by forming new skin tissue within one to three weeks if it is managed through periodic cleaning and dressing changes.''All wounds will be swollen, red, and painful but may vary in degree of pain. They may bleed. Usually, the pain is mild, and symptoms get better within two to three days. You can take ''over-the-counter'' pain medications such as paracetamol or ''ibuprofen'' if required or the one which your doctor has prescribed you.' "
Will I have a scar?,"'All wounds leave a scar. At first, your scar will be red and thick, but over time, it will become white, thin, and smaller; sometimes, it almost disappears. Everyone’s skin heals at different rates depending on their health, age, ''diet'' and wound infection. In some, the scar rises and becomes thicker called a ''keloid'' scar. After your wound heals, apply ''sunscreen'' to control scarring. Your doctor may advise some treatment options for the ''keloid'' ''scars''.' "
What are the complications?,"'Serious bacterial wound infection-causing' Gas gangrene (decomposition of the tissue due to gas, forming bacterial infection). Tetanus (fatal bacterial infection). Heavy scarring that causes contractures (bands), reducing movement of the joints Life-long disabilities Chronic wound infection Deep bone infection  Death"
What is hypoxia?,"'Hypoxia'' is a condition in which there is decreased oxygenation in the body tissues. It can be generalized, affecting the entire body, or local, affecting a specific part of the body. Hypoxia can cause damage to multiple organs and lead to fatal complications.''Hypoxemia'' is decreased oxygen in the blood. Hypoxemia can lead to hypoxia.' "
What are the causes of hypoxia?,"'Common causes of hypoxia include:''Causes of hypoxia in a ''newborn'':' Anemia Asthma Heart failure  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Lung infection Fluid accumulation in the lungs Damage, scarring, or collapse of the lungs Respiratory distress Drugs like narcotics Obstructive sleep apnea (manifests with loud snoring) Anesthesia Severe blood loss Obstruction of the airway due to tumors or foreign body  Anaphylactic/allergic reactions Toxic chemicals like Maternal smoking and/or anemia Trauma to the brain at birth Twisted or knotted umbilical cord  Poor fetal monitoring, for example, during home births"
What are the four types of hypoxia?,"'Hypoxic hypoxia (or arterial hypoxia):''Anemic'' hypoxia:\xa0''Ischemic/Stagnant hypoxia:\xa0''Dysoxic/Histotoxic/Tissue hypoxia:\xa0' Reduced or lack of oxygen, leading to insufficient air available to the lungs. It can occur due to high altitude, closed breathing space, etc. Asthma and other disorders of the lung, heart, or brain can also cause hypoxic ischemia. Decreased hemoglobin levels in the blood, hence there is decreased oxygen capacity of the blood. Hemoglobin is a protein present in the red blood cells (RBC). It binds to oxygen and supplies oxygen to the entire body. They also give blood its characteristic red color. Anemic hypoxia can be caused due to heavy blood loss, decreasing the number of RBCs or decreased hemoglobin level due to severe iron deficiency or hemoglobin deformity.  Inadequate blood flow to the body tissues because the velocity of blood flow decreases.  This could be due to heart failure, severe blood loss, or clots in the blood vessel. The oxygen delivered to the tissues is normal, but the cells are unable to use the oxygen. For example, cyanide poisoning.  Cyanide binds to the oxygen-binding proteins and other parts of the cells in the tissue, preventing the interaction and consumption of oxygen in the tissues. "
What is the first sign of hypoxia?,"'The earliest signs of hypoxia are:''The other signs and symptoms of hypoxia include:' Confusion Restlessness  Shortness of breath  Bluish discoloration of skin, lips, and oral cavity Decreased level of consciousness  Cough  Difficulty breathing Decreased heart rate Palpitations  Sweating"
What is the treatment of hypoxia?," Oxygen therapy is required as soon as possible. Treatment of the underlying condition with intravenous steroids or antibiotics. Acclimatization: This occurs in those who are exposed to high altitude for a while, wherein the body adapts to the state of decreased oxygen in the air."
What are the complications of hypoxia?,"'Hypoxia causes decreased oxygenation of multiple organs such as the brain, ''liver'', kidneys, etc., damaging them, and ultimately leading to organ failure. It can potentially lead to death. Hypoxia during ''pregnancy'' may also result in fetal death. Hypoxia in newborns is associated with a high mortality rate.''If hypoxia is identified and treated early, patients can recover without any complications.' "
How is malignant hyperthermia caused?,'Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is caused because of a genetic mutation (genetic defect). The genetic defect is usually not ''inherited'' and usually the result of random gene mutation. Mutations of different genes can cause MHS. The most commonly affected gene in MHS is the RYR1 gene; other genes that may be affected are CACNA1S and STAC3.' 
What happens if malignant hyperthermia is not treated?,"'If not treated right away, malignant hyperthermia (MH) can lead to serious and fatal complications such as:' Brain damage Rhabdomyolysis (muscles can break down and release its contents into the blood) Kidney failure Clotting and bleeding problems  Severe muscle rigidity  Death"
How is malignant hyperthermia treated?,"'Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is required to be treated right away to avoid life-threatening complications. With appropriate treatment, MH resolves in a few days.\xa0''Treatment of MH involves:' Halting the procedure and offending anesthesia agent as soon as possible Medication: A medication called Dantrium (dantrolene) inhibits the release of calcium into the muscle, which reduces muscle spasms and rigidity. Medications to correct the body's metabolic imbalance are usually administered. Oxygen: Oxygen therapy is required to increase oxygen levels in the body and reduce carbon dioxide levels. Measures to reduce body temperature: Ice packs, cooling blankets, cold air, and a fan with cool mist and administering chilled intravenous (IV) fluids can help reduce body temperature. IV fluids: Extra fluids would usually be administered intravenously. Close monitoring: The patient is usually admitted for around two days in the intensive care unit (ICU) or longer till their condition improves and the vitals and lab tests (to assess muscle and kidney damage) are normal."
How can malignant hyperthermia be prevented?,"'If a person is suspected to have malignant hyperthermia (MH), based on family history or medical history, the doctor would use anesthetic medications that don’t cause MH, avoid prescribing triggering medications, and advise certain lifestyle modifications such as avoiding exercising in intense heat or humidity.' "
What is throat cancer?,"'Throat cancer'' involves the development of malignancies of the throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx) and ''tonsils''.''Approximately, 17,590 people in the United States will develop ''cancer'' of the pharynx, and 12,370 will develop ''cancer of the larynx'' in the year 2020, according to the American ''Cancer'' Society.''The three main types of ''throat cancer'' are:''The throat is a small part of the body, which is a passageway for both the digestive and respiratory systems. The throat helps with:''The pharynx is behind the mouth and above the ''esophagus''. The pharynx includes:''The larynx is made up of three parts:' Oropharyngeal cancer: Develops in the oropharynx area of the pharynx Laryngeal cancer: Forms in the larynx Hypopharyngeal cancer: Forms in the hypopharynx area of the pharynx Swallowing Breathing Speaking The oropharynx: This includes the base of the tongue, the roof of the mouth (palate) and the tonsils. The nasopharynx: The superior part of the throat behind the nose, above the palate. The hypopharynx: Also known as the laryngopharynx, forms the base of the throat. The glottis: Contains the vocal cord. The supraglottis: Is present above the vocal cords. The subglottis: Is present between the vocal cords and the trachea."
What is the first sign of throat cancer?,"'The early ''symptoms of throat cancer'' may be similar to a ''cold'' in the early stages (e.g., a persistent ''sore throat''). ''Sore throat'' and ''hoarseness'' that persists for more than two weeks, should be immediately reported to a physician.' "
What does throat cancer feel like?,"'The advanced stage symptoms of throat cancer are:''Throat cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body (metastatic cancer), leads to specific symptoms depending on the location:' Difficulty swallowing Persistent cough A lump in the mouth, throat or neck Ear or jaw pain Headaches Difficulty breathing White patches or sores in the mouth Unexplained weight loss Bleeding in the mouth or nose Swelling of the eyes, jaw, throat or neck Throat discomfort Chronic sore throat Constant phlegm production If cancer has spread to the lungs, symptoms include:Difficulty breathingCoughing up blood Difficulty breathing Coughing up blood If cancer has spread to the bones, symptoms include:Bone or joint painFractures Bone or joint pain Fractures"
How does a physician diagnose throat cancer?,"'Tests that are commonly performed by the physician to diagnose throat cancer are:' A biopsy involves the removal of tissue to look for any cancerous cells. Imaging tests such as computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), barium swallow or positron emission tomography (PET) can help in diagnosing throat cancer. Scoping procedures such as laryngoscopy, panendoscopy or laryngoscopy involve inserting an instrument (scope) into the mouth or nose to examine the throat."
How do you treat throat cancer?,'Treatment of throat cancer involves:''Treatment options for throat cancer are:' The specific type of cancer Location of cancer Stage of cancer Surgery Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Proton therapy Cancer clinical trials Palliative care for metastatic cancer
How do you manage the side effects of throat cancer treatment?,'The side effects of throat cancer treatment may impact the quality of life. Supportive care helps manage symptoms and side effects:' Pain management Nutritional support Mind-body support Spiritual support
What is the endocannabinoid system?,"'The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a complex nerve cell signaling system that modulates the central nervous system’s function and helps maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis is the state of equilibrium in the body in which all the organs function optimally, maintaining physiological, cognitive and emotional balance.''The endocannabinoid system is made up of three key components:' Endocannabinoids: Chemical compounds that carry signals between nerve cells (neurotransmitters). The two main identified endocannabinoids are:Anandamide (AEA)2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) Anandamide (AEA) 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) Endocannabinoid receptors: Proteins embedded on the cell membrane which bind to the endocannabinoids and react, initiating neural activity. The two main identified endocannabinoid receptors are:CB1-RCB2-R CB1-R CB2-R Endocannabinoid recycling: Enzymes in the nerve cells break down the endocannabinoids back into their components for reuse when the next neurotransmission is required. The two principle enzymes found in the endocannabinoid system are:Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that breaks down AEAMonoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) that breaks down 2-AG Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) that breaks down AEA Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) that breaks down 2-AG"
What are endocannabinoids?,"'“Endocannabinoid” derives its name from phytocannabinoids -- “phyto” meaning “plant-based” -- a class of psychoactive substances first discovered in Cannabis sativa (''marijuana'') plants. Endocannabinoids are cannabis-like compounds naturally produced by the body in the nerve cells.''Two endocannabinoids, AEA and 2-AG and their functions have been studied to a great extent. Several more endocannabinoids have been discovered, though their functions and roles in the endocannabinoid system are yet to be determined.' "
How are endocannabinoids released?,"'Unlike other neurotransmitters, endocannabinoids are not stored in the nerve cells. Endocannabinoid precursors are present in the fat molecules in the cell membrane and are released upon demand, when the endocannabinoid receptors are activated.' "
What is the function of endocannabinoids?,"'Endocannabinoid receptors are concentrated in the brain, but are also present in nerve tissues all over the body. When a condition such as injury, ''fever'' or infection disrupts the body’s homeostasis, the endocannabinoid system helps restore the body’s homeostasis.''The endocannabinoid system plays a significant role in the normal functioning of the body’s systems that include:''The endocannabinoid system is an important mediator in regulating:\xa0''The functions of the endocannabinoid system are not fully understood. Some studies suggest endocannabinoid deficiency and a disturbed homeostasis may be the cause for certain diseases such as ''migraine'', ''fibromyalgia'' and ''irritable bowel syndrome''. Research continues on the gamut of roles endocannabinoids play, and their potential therapeutic uses.' Central nervous system Cardiovascular system Gastrointestinal system Reproductive system Skeletal system Immune system Metabolic processes Memory and learning Appetite Stress response Pain sensation Mood Sleep Inflammation Drug addiction"
What are the therapeutic uses of cannabinoids?,"'The Cannabis sativa plant contains hundreds of compounds. Two of them, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), bind to the human endocannabinoid receptors CB1-R and CB2-R. Both THC and CBD have medical benefits, but only THC produces euphoric effects.''The cannabis plant contains other minor cannabinoids that interact with the human endocannabinoid system, but their effects are far weaker and they are present in lower concentrations.''Medications can target the ECS therapeutically in two ways:''The potential therapeutic uses for cannabinoids include:' Cannabinoid receptor agonists: These drugs bind to the CB1-R and CB2-R and stimulate their activity (for example, CBD). Cannabinoid receptor antagonists: These drugs are used to suppress cannabinoid receptor activity (for example, rimonabant).

Three cannabinoid receptor agonist drugs are approved by FDA.''Approved for use as''Side effects include:''Antiemetic for chemotherapy when other therapies are unsuccessful''Side effects include:''The FDA in 2018 approved this first-ever CBD-based drug for childhood ''seizure disorders'' like Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients 2 years of age and older.''Side effects include:' Antiemetic (anti-nausea and vomiting) for chemotherapy Appetite stimulant for people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) Dizziness Drowsiness Confusion Feeling high Lightheadedness Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Central nervous system toxicity Dizziness Drowsiness Dry mouth Feeling high Lightheadedness Headache Trouble sleeping Memory problems Liver problems Sedation and sleepiness Suicidal ideas Allergic reactions Withdrawal symptoms of increased seizures upon sudden discontinuation"
What is the function of the ovaries in the body?,'The ovaries release at least one egg each month for possible ''fertilization''. Ovaries are an important part of the\xa0''female reproductive system'' and they produce the female hormones estrogen and ''progesterone''.' 
What is an ovarian cyst?,'Ovarian cysts'' are fluid-filled pockets that form in the ovaries during childbearing years. A ''cyst'' is usually formed when the egg is not released or when the sac holding the egg does not dissolve after the egg is released at the time of ''ovulation''.' 
What does it feel like when you have a cyst on your ovary? ,'Many women with ''ovarian cysts'' do not have any symptoms as the ''cysts'' are small and foundincidental to an unrelated diagnosis. The following symptoms may seen in patients with ovarian cysts:' Irregular periods Unexplained weight gain Pain during periods Abdominal pain (lower). Dull ache in the lower back and thighs Problems emptying the bladder or bowel completely (larger cysts) Unusual (not normal) vaginal bleeding Breast pain on touching Needing to urinate more often Severity in pain is increased if the cyst is ruptured. Ovarian cyst complication (Sometimes a cyst can cause twisting of an ovary during which a patient may have severe pain with nausea and vomiting)
Are ovarian cysts dangerous? ,"'Ovarian cysts are usually harmless. The majority disappear without treatment within a few months. However, a large ovarian cyst can cause severe symptoms which include sudden, severe ''abdominal pain'' with ''fever'', difficulty ''breathing'' and ''weakness''. Medical attention would be needed if there is a large ovarian cyst found during clinical examination; in rare cases, cysts might turn into a ''cancer''. ''Malignancy'' (aggressive ''cancer'') is a common concern among patients with ovarian cysts, but malignancy risk is less than 1% in simple and small cysts.' "
How are ovarian cysts diagnosed?,"'Ovarian cysts are usually an incidental finding in clinical examination, but if the patient has symptoms, below are two methods to specifically diagnosis ovarian cyst.\xa0' Abdominal examination/pelvic examination: During this physical examination a lump with pain on massage/palpitation may be noted in the pelvic area. Ultrasound examination: An ultrasound scan may reveal the size and location of ovarian cyst. "
What are the treatment options available for ovarian cyst?,"'Generally doctors usually advise the patients to wait and watch as the cyst might go away without any treatment, but if the patients have persistent symptoms below are the treatment options:' Oral contraceptives or birth control pills: They protect against the development of functional ovarian cysts by preventing ovulation and reducing the chances of forming new cysts. Laparoscopy: This surgery is done when the cysts are small and patient has persistent symptoms. A small scope (camera) is inserted via a small cut, and the cyst is punctured and removed. Laparotomy: This surgery is done when the patient has large cysts with persistent symptoms. A larger cut is made over the abdomen and the cyst is taken out. Bilateral oophorectomy with hysterectomy: This surgery is usually advised to patients after menopause. The surgery removes the entire uterus with ovaries and decreases the chance of ovarian cancer. "
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas, which is about the size of a hand, is located in the abdomen, just behind the stomach. It is surrounded by other organs including the small intestine, ''liver'', and spleen. The pancreas plays a vital role in converting the food into energy. It mainly performs two functions: an exocrine function that helps in digestion and an endocrine function that controls blood sugar levels. Because of the deep location of the pancreas, tumors of the pancreas may be difficult to locate.''The exocrine pancreas produces natural juices called pancreatic enzymes to break down food. These enzymes travel through the tubes or ducts to reach the duodenum. The pancreas makes about eight ounces of digestive juices filled with enzymes every day. The different enzymes are as follows:''Unlike enzymes, hormones are released directly into the bloodstream. Pancreatic hormones include:' Lipase: Along with bile, these enzymes break down fats. Poor absorption of fats leads to diarrhea and fatty bowel movements. Protease: It breaks down proteins and builds immunity against the bacteria and yeast present in the intestine. Poor absorption of proteins can cause allergies. Amylase: It helps to break down starch into sugar, which is then converted to energy to meet the body’s demand. Undigested carbohydrates can cause diarrhea. Insulin: This hormone is produced in the beta cells of the pancreas and helps the body to use sugar as the energy source. Lack of insulin can increase blood sugar levels in the blood and cause serious diseases such as diabetes. Glucagon: Alpha cells produce the hormone glucagon. If blood sugar gets too low, glucagon helps to increase it by sending a message to the liver to release the stored sugar. Amylin: A hormone called amylin is made in the beta cells of the pancreas. This helps in controlling our appetite (eating behavior)."
What are the diseases of the pancreas?,"'The diseases of the pancreas involve the following:' Pancreatitis: It is the inflammation of the pancreas due to the buildup of the pancreatic enzymes.  Diabetes: Lack of insulin due to insufficient production from the beta cells can increase the blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer: Most cancers of the pancreas begin in the exocrine cells. Weight loss, diarrhea, and stomach pain can be presenting symptoms."
Can you live without a pancreas?,"'You can live without a pancreas. If the entire pancreas is removed, there would be no insulin-producing cells to control the blood sugar levels. This can lead to ''diabetes'', which may be hard to manage because it requires insulin shots. People may also have to take certain pancreatic enzyme pills to help them digest certain foods.' "
What foods irritate the pancreas?,"'Foods rich in fats can cause pancreatitis. Constant intake of sugary foods is also known to affect the beta cells.''Foods that may irritate the pancreas include:''Because most of the fats are processed by the pancreas, overloading with fats may make it difficult for the pancreas to process them.' Red meat Organ meat French fries Potato chips Mayonnaise Margarine and butter Full-fat dairy Pastries Sugary drinks"
Why do some people have golden blood type?,"'The golden blood group seems to be a result of genetic mutation (spontaneous change in the gene). It is commonly seen with mutations in the\xa0RHAG\xa0gene,\xa0which codes the\xa0Rh-associated glycoprotein. This protein is required for directing the Rh antigens to the RBC membrane.''RHAG\xa0mutation is often associated with a disease called hereditary stomatocytosis. These individuals can have long-term, mild, hemolytic ''anemia'' and increased RBC breakdown. The Rh-null phenotype can also be seen in the case of certain anemias a person may be born with.''The following conditions may put you at a higher risk of golden blood group:' Consanguineous marriage (marriage between cousins, brother-sister, or anybody who is a near or distant relative) Autosomal genes (abnormal genes, which have disease traits, passed down through families) Changes or complete deletion of certain genes, which are RHD and RHCE or RHAG"
What are the complications of golden blood type?,"'The people with Rh null or golden blood type usually may have' Mild to moderate hemolytic anemia since birth: This leads to faster destruction of RBCs. This may cause low hemoglobin levels causing paleness and weariness. This occurs due to structural defects in RBCs likeMouth-like or slit-like shapeLess elastic structure of red cellsAbnormal red cell coveringIncreased fragility due to the lack of Rh antigenAltered blood cell volume Mouth-like or slit-like shape Less elastic structure of red cells Abnormal red cell covering Increased fragility due to the lack of Rh antigen Altered blood cell volume Blood transfusion challenges: These people might face challenges during a blood transfusion. If this person’s blood is exposed to Rh antigens (proteins on the surface of RBC) from other’s blood, they readily form corresponding autoantibodies and there may be severe transfusion reaction. Therefore, for these types of patients, hospitals need to have special protocols set and quick response management. Rh incompatibility during pregnancy: If the mother has Rh null and the baby has Rh-positive blood type and if the mother’s blood gets sensitized by the baby’s positive blood. Then mother’s blood may produce protective proteins called antibodies that could target future pregnancies or lead to abortion or miscarriage. Hemolytic crisis: Several studies have found that any infection or sepsis in such individuals has precipitated massive hemolysis, subsequent kidney failure, and other complications."
Can golden blood type be donated?,"'Yes, golden blood can be donated. Because of the absence of antigens on RBCs, a person with Rh null blood is considered to be a universal donor, and this blood can be donated to anyone with rare ''blood types'' within the Rh systems.''This blood is excellent for transfusion because it lacks common antigens, and it can be accepted by anyone who needs a transfusion without the risk of a blood transfusion reaction. However, due to its rarity, it gets extremely difficult to find this type.''Conversely, Rh null is usually not so good for the people who have it. If they ever require a blood transfusion, receiving any blood that does have the Rh antigen may inevitably cause a transfusion reaction.' "
How is BMI interpreted for adults?,"'BMI can be a screening tool for deciding the ideal weight for you and letting you know if your weight is on the higher side. But it does not tell us about your total body fat content or health status. This is because weight is a measure of water content + fat content + bone + muscle mass. Out of these things, the muscle mass varies the most amongst individuals. If you are someone who does muscle-strengthening exercises daily, you will have more muscle weight than others.\xa0''Being overweight and obese puts you at risk for many health disorders such as ''type 2 diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), ''heart'' diseases, ''stroke'', and ''cancer'' amongst many others. To determine if a particular BMI exposes you to health risks, the healthcare provider will assess other factors such as your waist-circumference, waist-hip ratio, skinfold thickness, ''diet'', physical activity, and family history.''Other methods to measure body fatness include skinfold thickness measurements, bioelectrical impedance, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). However, these methods are not always easily available, and they are either costly or need the expertise to conduct them.' "
What is the importance of the waist-hip ratio? ,"'Your waist-to-hip ratio is another good parameter to check if you have a healthy weight or not. To calculate this ratio, you should first measure your waist circumference at its smallest part and your hip circumference at its widest part.''According to the World Health Organization (WHO), women should not have their waist-to-hip ratio greater than 0.85. A waist-to-hip ratio over 1.0 puts women more likely to get diseases such as ''type 2 diabetes'', ''heart disease'' and ''breast cancer''.\xa0''To achieve a healthy weight or a healthy BMI and normal waist-hip ratio, it is vital to adopt healthy lifestyle choices such as a healthy dietary pattern and regular moderate- or high-intensity exercises (at least 30 minutes/day for most days of the week). A visit to a doctor or dietician will help you decide the best, feasible options for you.' "
What to expect during a Kestenbaum procedure?,"'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' The surgeon decides on the muscle that needs to be repositioned. The number of muscles, amount of surgery, and muscle selection depend upon the type and amount of deviation. The surgeon carries out an eye examination to assess the eye’s movement.  The surgeon may ask you to undergo certain eye tests, such as:StereoacuityWorth four-dot testTest for binocular single visionEvaluation for postoperative diplopiaDouble Maddox rodLancaster red/green test for torsionAmbyloscope/synoptophore testing Stereoacuity Worth four-dot test Test for binocular single vision Evaluation for postoperative diplopia Double Maddox rod Lancaster red/green test for torsion Ambyloscope/synoptophore testing The surgeon might give a muscle relaxant along with general anesthesia for sustained muscle contraction for up to 20 minutes. You may have to stop blood thinners before the surgery after consulting the physician. Once the anesthesia becomes effective, the physician retracts the lids and the lashes out of the field.  Next, the physician makes a small cut near the eyeball that penetrates the inner layer of the eyeball. The physician with the help of a hook isolates the desired muscles. After isolating the muscles, the physician recesses (detaches) the affected muscle from the eye and resects (reattaches) it farther back on the eye to weaken the strength of the muscle if it is too strong. In some cases, if the muscle is too weak, the surgeon may use a recession procedure to reduce the strength of the opposing muscle to achieve a balanced function of the eye muscles. Monitoring for one to two weeks after surgery is necessary. The physician may prescribe oral antibiotics, corticosteroids, or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. It would take around one to three months for stabilization. Complications of the Kestenbaum procedure include:Ptosis (eyelid drooping)Misalignment of the eyes that may recover after sometimeInfectionBleedingDetachment of retina Ptosis (eyelid drooping) Misalignment of the eyes that may recover after sometime Infection Bleeding Detachment of retina"
What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') is a group of diseases with the chief symptom of breathlessness and ''cough''. ''COPD'' is a slowly progressive disease and affects approximately 32 million Americans.''COPD'' leads to airflow obstruction due to the following reasons:''The diseases in the COPD spectrum are as follows:' Tiny air sacs in the lungs that are responsible for oxygen transfer to the blood lose their capacity to stretch and shrink back. The walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed.  Oversecretion of the mucus blocks the airflow. Chronic bronchitis Emphysema Irreversible asthma
What are the signs and symptoms of COPD?,"'In the initial stages of ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD), there may be no symptoms. Later, the following non-specific symptoms are seen:''When the disease progresses, the symptoms include:' Smoker’s cough (nagging cough) Chest discomfort Shortness of breath Wheezing (whistling sound while breathing) Weight loss Swelling in the feet and ankles Gasping for breath Feeling of missed beat or palpitations Respiratory failure Blue or gray lips and/or fingernails  Disorientation"
Who is at a risk of getting COPD?,'Patients with the following conditions are at a risk of ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD):' Continuous exposure to air pollution Smokers Exposure to second-hand smoke Infectious diseases that destroy the lung tissue Chronic asthma Immune deficiency syndromes Vasculitis syndrome (inflammation in the blood vessels) Connective tissue disorders (diseases that affect the parts of the body that connect the structures of the body) Genetic problems such as Salla disease
Which tests do physicians use to diagnose COPD?,"'Physicians use the following methods and tests to diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):' Taking a through history History of tobacco smoking, occupational exposure to dust and chemicals Information about exposure to air pollutants or history of any lung disease Chest X-rays Spirometry (lung function tests) Computed tomography (CT) of the lungs Measurement of the saturation level of oxygen in the blood with the help of arterial blood gas or a pulse oximeter"
How is COPD treated?,"'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) management involves various therapies, which include:''Medications to treat COPD include the following:''Patients with severe COPD may require a surgery to remove the diseased portion of the lung or even lung transplantation.' Cessation of cigarette smoking Taking vitamin and nutritional supplements Exercise training and breathing exercises Nutritional counseling therapy Energy-conserving therapies Psychological counseling  Bronchodilators relax muscles around the airways Oxygen therapy Steroids to reduce swelling in the airway Antibiotics to treat a respiratory infection Vaccination Drugs that thin the mucous plug"
What is the life expectancy of someone with COPD?,"'Depending on the disease severity, the five-year life expectancy for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranges from 40%-70%. That means 40-70 out of 100 people will be alive after five years of diagnosis of\xa0 COPD.\xa0''COPD is a chronic, gradually progressing lung disease that is not completely curable. Timely medical treatments can slow the progression of this disease.' "
What is the Magnuson-Stack procedure?,"'Magnuson-Stack procedure is one of the surgical procedures performed to correct shoulder instability. It is named after the two surgeons who first performed the technique, Paul B. Magnuson and James K. Stack, in 1943.\xa0''This surgery involves tightening of the ligament and capsule of the shoulder joint and altering the insertion site of the ligament. This surgery has a good success rate, but a complete range of motion may not be possible and may not be ideal for athletes or laborers.''The shoulder joint (glenohumeral joint)'' is a ball and socket joint. It is formed between the scapula (shoulder blade) and the humerus (the upper arm bone).\xa0''The outer end on the scapula (shoulder blades)'' is called the glenoid; it meets the head of the humerus (the upper arm bone) to form the glenohumeral ''cavity''. This functions as a flexible ball and socket joint. It is surrounded by a fibrous capsule.\xa0''The joint ''is stabilized by a ring of cartilage called the labrum. The capsule is reinforced by the ''rotator cuff'' (a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint) and ligaments.\xa0''Shoulder dislocation'' occurs when the head of the humerus separates from the scapula at the shoulder joint. The shoulder joint has a rich blood and nerve supply.' "
What are the causes of shoulder instability?,'Patients with shoulder instability present with ''pain'' and an abnormal range of motion of the joint. Some common causes of shoulder instability are:' Extraordinary range of motion of the shoulder  Shallow glenoid Injury to the upper limb or shoulder joint  Underlying conditions causing ligament or muscle laxity Medical conditions such as seizures or electric shock
How is the Magnuson-Stack procedure performed?,"'Prior to the surgery, the surgeon performs a complete physical assessment. In addition, the surgeon performs X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') to assess the joint status. A complete blood analysis is done, and consent for surgery is obtained.''The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. It is an open surgery. During the surgery, the anterior capsular and muscular wall is tightened by advancing the capsule and tendon in the shoulder joint. This provides a “sling effect.” The surgeon carefully preserves the nerve and blood supply.''The surgeon administers painkillers and antibiotics. The patient is usually discharged 24 to 72 hours after the surgery. Immobilization is necessary immediately following the surgery and is continued for three to six weeks.\xa0''Rehabilitation follows immobilization, but complete rotation is limited for four to six weeks following the surgery. ''Pain'', swelling, and ''bruising'' is expected in the postoperative period and usually resolves within two weeks.' "
What are the complications of the Magnuson-Stack procedure?,'Complications that are possible with this procedure include the following:' Loss of functional abilities due to a significant loss of external rotation Recurrence of instability Injury to nerves and blood vessels Bleeding Infection Secondary osteoarthritis  Hematoma (blood clot) Seroma (collection of fluid)

How does scoliosis affect the body?,"'The curves in scoliosis make the spine look more like the letter ""C"" or ""S” instead of a straight line down the middle of the back. They occur most commonly in the upper and middle back (thoracic spine) but can also develop in the lower back.''Scoliosis results in an abnormal posture, and hence, it can be of cosmetic concern for people who are affected by it. Otherwise, mild scoliosis is not bothering to many. If scoliosis is severe and untreated, it can give rise to other problems that include:' Stiffness or soreness of the back after sitting or standing for prolonged periods Tingling or numbness in the legs Permanent, noticeable deformities Difficulty in breathing (severe deformity can put pressure on and damage the lungs) A pelvis that thrusts forward on one side"
Can scoliosis get worse as you age?,"'\xa0Several factors can worsen scoliosis. These include:''Degenerative changes of the spine (spondylitis and ''osteoporosis'') that appear commonly with ''aging'' can worsen scoliosis by increasing the curve and the symptoms.''In most children with scoliosis, the curvature stays as it is and does not progress further. However, follow-up with a doctor is vital to ascertain the status of scoliosis. Earlier treatment can help prevent the development of a permanent deformity.' The severity of the curve: More severe the curve, the higher the chances of its worsening. Pubertal age: Curves tend to worsen in the early stages of puberty in children affected with scoliosis. Increase in symptoms: More is the development of symptoms, the more are the chances that scoliosis will worsen."
What is the management of ectopic pregnancy?,"'Ectopic pregnancy'' is usually managed through medications, surgery or observation. The type of management depends on the severity of the condition.''Conservative/observation management''The wait and watch approach is a safe and appropriate way to manage ''ectopic pregnancy''.\xa0Managing the condition without treatment can feel quite scary, but it is good to give the body the best chance to resolve naturally. If a doctor suggested this method of treatment, then there is an almost 90% chance that the ectopic ''pregnancy'' will resolve all by itself. The patient would be observed closely until ectopic pregnancy is absorbed and there are minimal or no symptoms (like ''pain'' or bleeding). Nothing needs to be done in these circumstances except to ensure that the pregnancy hormone levels quickly return to normal. If monitored correctly, it may not be dangerous. However, there is still a very remote chance that the ectopic pregnancy may cause the fallopian tube to rupture and bleed. The observation management can be recommended when ectopic pregnancy has the following characteristics''Medical or pharmacological management''Methotrexate'' is a ''chemotherapy'' drug that stops the pregnancy from growing. It is the medical treatment used to dissolve the ectopic pregnancy. If the ectopic pregnancy is small and the pregnancy hormone levels are not high, there is a 90% to 95% chance that using medical treatment would be safe. Methotrexate is given by a single injection in the arm. In certain situations, an infusion via a drip into the vein may be required. Pregnancy hormone levels would be monitored simultaneously. Side effects are temporary, which include ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''indigestion'', ''mouth ulcers'', ''sensitivity to light'' or feelings of ''fatigue''. Very rarely it can affect the ''liver'' or blood counts.''Surgical management''An operation is one way of treating an ectopic pregnancy. In emergency circumstances, this may be the only choice. The operation is usually performed under general anesthesia.' There is no or minimal pain. There is no blood in the abdomen. The embryo has already died. The embryo is very small. The pregnancy hormone level (HCG) is low and falling. In this procedure, the surgeon usually makes three small incisions in the abdomen. One is made inside the belly button and one or two incisions are made lower down on the abdomen. A thin, flexible instrument with a camera and light source on its end (laparoscope) is inserted through the incision in the belly button to allow the surgeon to see what they are doing. If an ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, the tube is usually removed. Sometimes, it may be possible to make a cut in the tube and remove the pregnancy leaving the tube intact. The downside of this is that sometimes not all the pregnancy tissue is removed. Further, this tube may be damaged and there is an increased chance of another ectopic pregnancy occuring in that tube in the future. While most operations for ectopic pregnancy are done using a laparoscopic or keyhole surgery, sometimes an open operation needs to be performed. This is more likely if the patient has had a lot of bleeding or if the keyhole surgery is not technically possible. For keyhole surgery, the patient may need to stay for just a day in the hospital. For open surgery, the patient may need to stay for 2 to 4 days."
What is an ectopic pregnancy?,"'Ectopic pregnancy is the medical condition in which the implantation of an embryo occurs outside of the uterine ''cavity'' (the womb), most commonly in the fallopian tube. Hence, an ectopic pregnancy is also called a ''tubal pregnancy''. It is a potentially serious condition affecting at least one in 1,000 ''pregnancies''. Sadly, there is no possibility that pregnancy can survive.\xa0Below are a few risk factors''The early symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy may be very similar to typical ''pregnancy symptoms'' which include''If the fallopian tube ruptures, the pain and bleeding could be severe enough to cause additional symptoms. These can include''When a tube bursts, the patient may feel sharp lower ''abdominal pain''. This is a medical emergency and the patient may need to seek medical help immediately.' History of infertility History of previous ectopic pregnancy History of pelvic infection or and tubal damage History of pelvic surgery, including sterilization Previously used an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) Undergoing assisted conception, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) Hormonal imbalance, malfunction of the uterus and tube and infection can impair the tube’s normal function and result in ectopic pregnancy.

Liposuction not only helps remove stubborn accumulated fat, but it also produces hormonal changes in the body that help with further ''weight loss''.\xa0' "
What happens during liposuction surgery?,"'A liposuction procedure is generally performed by a ''plastic surgeon''.' The surgeon uses a liposuction machine and special instruments, called cannulas, for the surgery. The doctor gives local or general anesthesia. A medicine-containing solution is injected through a small skin incision. After the medicine in the solution takes effect, fat is vacuumed away through the suction tube. Many skin punctures may be needed to treat large areas. After fat removal, small drainage tubes may be inserted into the defatted areas. The patient wears a compression garment after the procedure."
What are the different liposuction techniques?,"'There are many approaches to liposuction surgery. The technique that is best suited for a person depends on many factors, such as the size of the area being treated, the presence of other health conditions, etc. The four main types of liposuction procedures include:' Tumescent liposuction is the most common type of liposuction and usually a longer procedure than the other types of liposuction. A large amount of medicated solution is injected into the areas before the fat is removed. The amount of fluid exceeds the amount of fat that needs to be removed. The solution is a mixture of a local anesthetic (lidocaine), a drug that contracts the blood vessels (epinephrine), and an intravenous (IV) salt solution. Lidocaine helps numb the area to minimize pain. Epinephrine helps reduce blood loss, bruising and swelling. The IV salt solution helps make the removal of fat easier. The IV solution is suctioned out with the fat. The super-wet technique is like tumescent liposuction except that less fluid is used during this surgery. The amount of fluid injected is the same as the amount of fat that will be removed. The super-wet technique is generally quicker than other liposuction procedures. It often requires general anesthesia or medicines that make the patient sleepy (sedated). This technique uses ultrasonic vibrations to liquefy fat cells. The liquid fat is vacuumed out. UAL may help remove fat from dense, fiber-filled (fibrous) areas of the body such as the upper back or enlarged male breasts. This technique uses laser energy to liquefy fat cells. The liquefied cells are then vacuumed out or allowed to flow out through small tubes. The technique is suitable for small areas such as the chin, cheeks, jowls, and face. The added advantage is that laser energy stimulates the production of collagen. This may prevent the skin from sagging after the liposuction."
Are there any complications of liposuction?,'The complications of liposuction are:' Bleeding Pain Fluid overload Shock Hematoma (swelling that contains clotted blood) Fat embolism (tiny globules of fat in the bloodstream that may block the small blood vessels) Nerve damage Skin and other organ/tissue damage or burns from the instruments used Uneven fat removal Contour problems Skin sagging Scarring Drug reactions
What are the different types of hysterectomies?,"'Depending upon which other reproductive organs are removed along with the uterus, a hysterectomy is of three types:' Total hysterectomy: This is the most common type of hysterectomy that involves the removal of the uterus and cervix. Partial (or subtotal) hysterectomy: In this type, just the upper part of the uterus is removed. Radical hysterectomy: Through this surgery, all the uterus, cervix, ligaments (tissue on both sides of the cervix), and upper part of the vagina are removed. It is performed mostly for cancer of the cervix."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"'The surgeon will explain different approaches to performing a hysterectomy. These are as follows:' Abdominal hysterectomy: Your doctor makes a large cut of about 6-12 inches in the lower abdomen. He cuts the structures that hold the uterus in the abdomen and takes it out. The wound is stitched back. Vaginal hysterectomy: The operation is performed via the vagina. The surgeon detaches the uterus from ovaries, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and blood vessels and connective tissue that support it, before removing the uterus. Laparoscopic hysterectomy: A long and thin camera-like tube is inserted through one of the several small cuts in the lower abdomen. This tube helps in visualizing the uterus. The uterus is then removed either through one of the incisions or vagina. Robotic surgery: The surgeon uses a robotic arm to perform the surgery through small cuts in your lower abdomen."
How long does it take to recover from a hysterectomy?,"'How long a woman will stay in the hospital after her hysterectomy depends on the surgical approach, her age, and her general health status.''With a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy, the woman may be discharged one to four days after the surgery.''If the woman had an abdominal hysterectomy, she will have to stay for four to five days in the hospital.''Follow-up may be scheduled generally within four to six weeks of the surgery. However, in most cases, it is not necessary unless there are any complications.''Full recovery from an abdominal hysterectomy generally takes about four to six weeks, whereas it is earlier in case of a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy.\xa0''Sex can be resumed within four to six weeks, depending upon how soon the vagina heals.''Walking'' can be resumed soon but lifting weights should be avoided for at least to six weeks after the surgery.' "
What are other types of migraines?,"'The other types of ''migraines'' include:' Migraine with aura (complicated migraine): Aura is a neurological symptom of migraine, which is most commonly visual disturbances along with the normal symptoms of migraine. It commonly affects 10-30% of people. The frequency of this type of migraine may range from once a year to several times per year. In this, a person might observe below symptoms (aura) 10-30 minutes before an attack:Seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spotsNumbness or tingling in the face or handsAltered sense of smell, taste, or touchFeeling mentally “fuzzy” Seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spots Numbness or tingling in the face or hands Altered sense of smell, taste, or touch Feeling mentally “fuzzy” Chronic migraine: Experiencing headache on more than 15 days per month for more than three months may indicate a chronic migraine. The symptoms are similar to those of common migraine but may vary in intensity. Some days, the pain would be less severe similar to a tension headache or sinus headache. Hemiplegic migraine: If the migraine attack causes symptoms such as a temporary inability to move the arm or leg, it is more probably a hemiplegic migraine. People with hemiplegic migraine may experience one or more of the following symptoms:Weakness on one side of the bodyPins and needles sensation on one side of the bodyLoss of sensation Weakness on one side of the body Pins and needles sensation on one side of the body Loss of sensation Retinal migraine: Headache causing a temporary loss in vision in one eye is known as retinal migraine. This form of migraine with aura is very rare. The symptoms of retinal migraine include:Seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spotsLoss of some or all vision in one eye onlyThe visual loss followed by a typical headache Seeing flashing lights, zigzag lines, or blind spots Loss of some or all vision in one eye only The visual loss followed by a typical headache Vestibular migraine: Migraine along with prominent vertigo is known as vestibular migraine. Other symptoms of vestibular migraine include:DizzinessBalance problemsNausea or vomitingPhotophobiaPhonophobiaSensitivity to movementOsmophobia (sensitivity to smell)Cranial allodynia (sensitivity to touch on the head or face)Photic allodynia (pain and sensitivity to light) Dizziness Balance problems Nausea or vomiting Photophobia Phonophobia Sensitivity to movement Osmophobia (sensitivity to smell) Cranial allodynia (sensitivity to touch on the head or face) Photic allodynia (pain and sensitivity to light) Menstrual migraines: This type of migraine occurs two days before the menstrual period and continues three days after the start. This type of migraine is usually a migraine without aura. Brainstem aura: Along with migraine symptoms, additional symptoms include:Slurred speechVertigoTinnitus (ringing in the ears)Double visionUnsteadinessSevere sensitivity to sound Slurred speech Vertigo Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) Double vision Unsteadiness Severe sensitivity to sound"
What is depression?    ,"'Depression'' is a type of mood disorder and serious medical illness. It negatively affects the thought and the behavioral process of life. If an individual is suffering from ''depression'' for more than two weeks, it is called a major depressive disorder or ''clinical depression''. ''Depression'' often leads to sadness and loneliness, if untreated, it may lead to death due to ''suicide''. Women are more likely than men to experience ''depression''. Some studies show that one-third of women may experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.' "
What are the symptoms of depression?,"'Depression can strike at any time, but on average, it first appears during the late ''teens'' to mid-20s. Symptoms must last at least two weeks for depression diagnosis. Common symptoms seen in patients with depression:' Sadness. Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. Changes in appetite – weight loss or gain, unrelated to dieting. Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much. Loss of energy or increased weakness. Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others). Feeling worthless or guilty. Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions. Thoughts of death or suicide."
What are the risk factors and causes of depression?,"'Depression is usually caused by an external event; however, environmental and psychological factors can also contribute.''Common risk factors and causes that can trigger depression:' Family history of depression is the most common risk factor seen in patients with depression Stress Serious loss of loved ones Chronic illness Relationship difficulties or failure Exposure to abuse (includes emotional, physical and sexual) Neglect or community violence Financial problems Negative life events or unwelcome changes in life patterns Drug or alcohol addiction as well as withdrawal Pregnancy and post-pregnancy related stress"
What home remedies can help treat depression? ,"'Depressive disorders can make a person feel negative about life. Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect. The following are common remedies to fight depression:' Drink sufficient water and eat a healthy diet. Foods that include folate and vitamin D supplements help fight depression. Proper rest helps with mood elevation. Make a habit to express feelings to close ones during depression. Do not indulge in any stress-related tasks; make small daily goals to cope with depressive mood. Failing to reach expectations should not be considered a failure; it should be seen positively.  Try to socialize more frequently. Motivate yourself by exercising, going for a movie or spending quality time with loved ones. Limit access to things that could hurt you or others (for example, do not keep excess medication of any kind, firearms or other weapons at home)."
What is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant?,"'Antidepressants'' are ''drugs'' used to treat depression.''Some of the most common ''antidepressant'' drug classes are:''However, the best and most commonly used drug for the treatment of depression is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).''SSRIs increase the amount of neurochemical, known as serotonin, in the brain (brain serotonin levels often are low in depression). SSRIs work by selectively blocking serotonin reuptake in the brain.''SSRIs help activate the cells that have been deactivated by depression, relieving the ''depressed'"" person's symptoms.""'Examples of SSRIs are:''SSRIs have few side effects and are generally tolerated well by patients.''The most common side effects are:''However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use.\xa0SSRIs are often the first line and best treatment for depression.' Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors Dual-action antidepressants Atypical antidepressants Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) Tricyclic antidepressants Prozac (fluoxetine) Paxil (paroxetine)  Zoloft (sertraline)  Celexa (citalopram) Luvox (fluvoxamine) Lexapro (escitalopram) Trintellix (vortioxetine) Viibryd (vilazodone) Nausea Diarrhea Anger Insomnia Decrease sexual desire Headache"
What are the treatment options for breast cancer?,"'Depending on the type and stage of cancer,\xa0treatments\xa0can vary. However, there are some common practices doctors and specialists use to combat ''breast cancer'':' Lumpectomy: It is when the doctor removes the tumor while leaving the breast intact. Mastectomy: It is when the doctor surgically removes all the breast tissues including the tumor and connecting tissue. Depending upon the type of mastectomy, the lymph nodes and muscles may be removed with the breast. Chemotherapy: It is the most common cancer treatment, and it involves the use of anticancer drugs. These drugs interfere with the cells’ ability to reproduce. Radiation: It uses X-rays to treat cancer directly. Hormone and targeted therapy: They can be used when either genes or hormones play a part in the cancer’s growth."
What are the four types of breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer usually begins either in glands that make milk (called\xa0lobular ''carcinoma'') or the ducts that carry it to the ''nipple'' (called\xa0ductal carcinoma). The cancer may grow and invade other areas around the breast, such as the skin or chest wall. Different\xa0types of breast cancer\xa0grow and spread at different rates.\xa0''There are several types of breast cancer, and they are broken into two main categories: “invasive” and “noninvasive” (in situ). These two categories are used to describe the most common types of breast cancer, which include:''Apart from the above four types, below are a few more types of breast cancer:\xa0' Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): DCIS is a noninvasive condition. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in the breasts and haven’t invaded the surrounding breast tissue. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): LCIS is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of the breasts. Like DCIS, the cancer cells don’t invade the surrounding tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): It is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in your breast’s milk ducts and then invade nearby tissue in the breasts. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside the milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma: It first develops in the breast’s tubes and invades the nearby tissues. Paget disease of the nipples: This type of breast cancer begins in the ducts of the nipples, but as it grows, it begins to affect the skin and area of the nipples. Phyllodes tumor: This is a very rare type of breast cancer that grows in the connective tissue of the breasts. Most of these tumors are benign, but some are cancerous. Angiosarcoma: This cancer grows on the blood and lymph vessels in the breasts."
What is the survival rate of breast cancer?,"'The 5-year survival rate is predicted to be 90%, which means that 90 out of 100 people diagnosed with breast cancer are likely to live at least five years after their diagnosis. It does not mean an individual will die after five years; it means that a person may live a minimum for five years and more.' "
What does menstruation mean?,"'Menstruation (menses or period or monthly) is the discharge of blood and tissue from the inner lining of the womb through the woman’s vagina every month. The amount of blood that comes out of a woman’s body is called menstrual flow.''In the United States, the average age of girls having their first menses (menarche) is normally between 12 and 13 years. The average length of menstrual flow can be seven days or less in women, and they may normally need to change three to six pads or tampons per day. Some women can predict the day and time of their period if they are very regular. Light, moderate, or heavy blood flow are all considered normal. Women stop menstruating permanently at an average age of 40-45 years; this is called ''menopause''.' "
What does menstrual cycle mean?,"'The menstruation cycle is the cycle of physical changes in a woman’s sex organs (ovary and womb) that begin on the first day of menses and end when the next menses begins.''During the cycle, the ovaries naturally produce chemical substances called hormones (estrogen and ''progesterone'') that are circulated through the body in the bloodstream. These hormones are signals that are sent back and forth between the brain and ovary. It causes various signs and symptoms in a woman (''bloating'', ''acne'', breast tenderness, etc.), and it changes throughout the menstrual cycle. Levels of these hormones can detect fertility in a woman.' "
When to see a doctor?,'You must see a gynecologist if your menses' Have not started within three years after breast growth. Have not started by 14 years of age with excessive hair growth on face and chest or if you have an eating disorder. Have not started within 15 years of age. Occur more frequently in less than 21 days. Occur more than 45 days apart. Occur 90 days apart even for every cycle. Last more than seven days. Are heavy and require a frequent change of pad (>1 every one to two hours). Are related to a history of excessive bruising or bleeding or a family history of a bleeding disorder.
What are the factors that affect the normal menstrual cycle?, Pregnancy Breastfeeding Menopause (menses stops permanently when a woman gets older) Smoking Alcohol consumption Physical activity Thyroid disorder (a neck gland illness) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (multiple sac formation in an enlarged ovary) Birth defect  Contraceptive pills Medications (hormones or steroids) Anemia (low iron in the blood) Immune system disorders
What is the #1 cause of pancreatic cancer?,"'Pancreatic cancer'' occurs when cells begin to grow uncontrollably and form tumors within the pancreas.\xa0''The exact cause of ''pancreatic cancer'' is unknown. However, doctors have identified some risk factors that increase your chances of developing ''pancreatic cancer''. These include:''Other factors that may contribute to the development of ''cancer'' include:' Age >45 years Male gender African American race Cigarette smoking (responsible for about 25% of pancreatic cancers) Alcohol abuse Regular consumption of high dietary fats Obesity (obese people are about 20% more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than non-obese people) Type 2 diabetes  Chronic pancreatitis (often seen with heavy alcohol use and smoking)   Family history of pancreatic cancer Heavy exposure to certain chemicals used in the dry cleaning and metalworking industries Diet (red and processed meats, saturated fats, and sugary drinks) Lack of physical activities Coffee Alcohol Infections (Helicobacter pylori or Hepatitis B)"
How is pancreatic cancer diagnosed?,"'The doctor first asks about the person’s medical history and family history. Then, they look for signs and symptoms of the disease. They might order the tests listed below if they suspect ''cancer''. However, the diagnosis will be confirmed with laboratory examination of a sample of tissue from the ''tumor'' taken during a biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or surgery.''Blood tests: ''Levels of ''bilirubin'' will be checked. Levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), a tumor marker, may be increased in blood if pancreatic ''cancer'' is present.''Imaging tests:'' Imaging tests help doctors find out the location and size of cancer and whether there is ''metastasis'' (spread of cancer in the body). These include:''Other tests include:' Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or PET-CT scan Ultrasound   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) Biopsy (removal of a small sample of pancreatic tissue for examination under a microscope) Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC, insertion of a thin needle into the pancreas to suction out cells)  Core needle biopsy (collecting a larger piece of tissue for molecular or genetic testing of the tumor) Molecular testing of the tumor (examination of tumor sample to look for changes in specific genes and proteins) Germline testing (testing a blood or saliva sample to look for person’s hereditary predisposition to cancer)"
Can pancreatic cancer be cured?,"'If you have pancreatic cancer that has spread (metastasis) to other organs it might be very hard to treat and almost impossible to cure. In this case, the doctor will give you treatment to limit cancer and its symptoms, and help you live longer.\xa0''Treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the stage of cancer and includes:' Surgery: Surgery is an option for patients whose pancreatic cancer is localized, i.e. is present only in the pancreas and has not spread anywhere else.  Only about 20% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer can have surgery because most pancreatic cancers are found after the disease has already spread. Radiation therapy: Once cancer spreads outside of the pancreas, doctors consider local therapy, such as radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays and other high-energy beams to destroy the cancer cells. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. This is usually used if cancer has spread to other organs of the body. In some cases, your doctor might combine other treatments like surgery and radiation with chemotherapy to prevent the future growth of pancreatic tumors. Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets cancer’s specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that help in the growth of cancer. It blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells, but restricts damage to normal cells."
How can you prevent pancreatic cancer?,"'You cannot control risk factors such as age, gender, race, and family history. But there are things you can follow to lower your risk, including the following:' Avoid smoking Follow a diet that contains whole cereals, fruits, and vegetables, but is less in sugar and high fatty foods Keep body weight under control Do regular physical activities Avoid alcohol use Try to avoid exposure to harmful chemicals in the workplace as much as possible"
How do I follow the Mediterranean diet?,"'Below are a few tips to follow the Mediterranean diet:''Research emphasizes that following the number one diet or Mediterranean diet may give an individual stronger bones, a\xa0healthier heart,\xa0 and ''longer life'', along with a\xa0reduced risk of ''diabetes''\xa0and ''high blood pressure''. It can also prevent ''dementia''\xa0and ''breast cancer''.' Switch to olive oil: Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, which may improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which is a good type of cholesterol. HDL cholesterol removes bad low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles out of the arteries. Olive oil may also be used on homemade salad dressings and finished dishes such as fish or chicken to boost flavor. Fish: Fatty fish such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel have good proteins and are rich in heart- and brain-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Vegetables: A good way to eat veggies is to eat one serving at snack time such as crunching on bell pepper strips or throwing a handful of spinach into a smoothie and one at dinner. Aim for at least two servings per day. More is better. At least three servings can help to bust stress. Whole grains: A hot bowl of oatmeal is perfect for breakfast. Even popcorn is a whole grain without butter. Supplement intake with other whole-grain products such as whole-wheat bread and pasta is beneficial. Nuts: Almonds, cashews, or pistachios can make for a satisfying snack. They are lower in calories, added sugar, and sodium. They contain more fiber and minerals, such as potassium, than processed snack foods. Fruits as dessert: They are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants; fresh fruits are a healthy way to indulge a sweet tooth. It is a healthy snack when an individual is hungry. Wine: As per research, women should stick to a 3-ounce serving per day, and men should stick to 5-ounce serving per day."
What is omentoplasty?,"'Omentoplasty is a surgical procedure in which part of the greater omentum is used to cover or fill a defect, improve arterial or venous circulation, decrease effusion (fluid accumulation) or increase lymphatic drainage.\xa0' "
Why is omentoplasty done?,"'Omentoplasty has been used in various settings involving conditions within and outside the abdomen. Omentoplasty is indicated for the following cases:' Gastrointestinal: Hydatid disease of the liver (fluid-filled cyst containing parasites in the liver), perforated peptic ulcer, surgically treatable pancreatic and intestinal conditions Gynecologic: After abdominal hysterectomy, vesicovaginal fistulae, vaginal reconstruction Vascular: Revascularization in vascular diseases Cardiothoracic: Infections in the chest, chest-wall reconstruction Reconstruction: Throat reconstruction, filarial lymphedema of the leg"
When should omentoplasty be avoided?,'Omentoplasty may be contraindicated in the following conditions:' Presence of advanced intra-abdominal tumors Unavailability of a sufficient length of omentum for the procedure being planned. This may be due to prior intra-abdominal infections or previous surgical procedures. This may be due to prior intra-abdominal infections or previous surgical procedures. Poor blood supply of the omentum Poor health status of the patient
How is omentoplasty performed?," The surgeon performs a complete physical assessment.  Complete blood and radiological tests are performed, and the consent is obtained from the patient prior to surgery. Omentoplasty may be classified into the following two types Type I – Single-layered omentumType II – Double-layered omentum Type I – Single-layered omentum Type II – Double-layered omentum The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. In this procedure, part of the colon and stomach are removed from the abdomen through a surgical incision.  The greater omentum is then detached from the colon and stomach.  The arterial pattern of the omental vessels is carefully studied once the omentum has been fully mobilized.  The omentum is then lengthened by dividing it according to the anatomic pattern of the vessels.  The omentum is then transplanted to the site required.  The final step of the procedure is surgical wound closure. The abdomen is closed in layers.  A surgical drain may be inserted to drain fluid and blood accumulation.  After cleaning all of the wounds with an antiseptic solution, sterile dressings are applied. The patient is usually discharged three to seven days after surgery.  The patient is administered with painkillers and antibiotics.  The surgical drain is removed 24 to 48 hours after surgery.  Pain, swelling and bruising is normal in the postoperative period; it usually resolves in about two weeks."
What are the complications of omentoplasty?,'Some complications of omentoplasty are:' Ileus (paralysis of the intestine) Infection Abscess formation (pus accumulation) Intestinal obstruction Necrosis (tissue death) of the omental flap Abdominal hernia (abnormal protrusion of an organ or other piece of tissue through a weakening in the muscle walls of the abdominal cavity)
What is the Pringle maneuver?,"'The Pringle maneuver is a procedure to stop the ''liver''’s blood supply during a liver surgery. A clamp is applied over the hepatic vascular pedicle, the channel that contains the hepatic duct, hepatic artery and the portal vein.''The hepatic artery and the portal vein are the blood vessels that carry blood to the liver. The hepatic artery carries the oxygenated blood to the liver, while the portal vein brings the nutrient rich blood from the digestive tract. The liver processes the blood from the portal vein, absorbs the nutrients and removes the toxic substances.''Pringle maneuver is named after J. Hogarth Pringle who, in 1908, first described the technique to minimize blood loss during a liver surgery. Now it is a standard procedure during any liver surgery. The procedure is performed as an emergency measure in surgeries for abdominal injuries.' "
Why is Pringle maneuver performed?,"'The Pringle maneuver is performed to stop the blood inflow into the liver during a surgery. This minimizes blood loss and the resulting need for transfusion.''The Pringle maneuver is performed as a standard part of the procedure in many surgeries such as:' Traumatic liver injury: The liver is the most commonly injured organ in a trauma to the abdominal region. The Pringle maneuver enables the surgeon toImmediately stop further blood lossDetermine the origin of hemorrhageControl the hemorrhageRepair injured blood vessels Immediately stop further blood loss Determine the origin of hemorrhage Control the hemorrhage Repair injured blood vessels Liver resection: removal of a part of the liver, or the whole liver in case of a transplant, in patients withLiver cirrhosisLiver cancer Liver cirrhosis Liver cancer Living donor hepatectomy: removal of a part of the liver for transplant, from a living donor Biliary tract reconstruction: reconstruction surgery performed for treatment of bile duct diseases Cholecystectomy: removal of gallbladder"
How is the Pringle maneuver performed?,"'The Pringle maneuver is a technique performed during major abdominal surgeries involving the biliary system. The technique may be applied during an open or a laparoscopic surgery. The patient is under general anesthesia during the procedure.\xa0''Before the surgery, the patient' Undergoes physical examination, blood, urine and imaging tests. Must avoid eating or drink anything for 8 hours prior. Must inform the doctor of any allergies. Must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. The anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the vital functions during the surgery. The surgeon usually inserts a tube through the nose into the stomach to decompress the stomach. The surgeon may also insert a urinary catheter to decompress the bladder. The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the stomach depending on the type of surgery. The surgeon finds the hepatic vascular pedicle, lifts it up and applies the clamp. Pringle maneuver may be applied intermittently in 10- to 20-minute cycles, allowing five minutes of blood flow (reperfusion) in between. For surgeries of short duration Pringle maneuver may be applied continuously. After the surgery is completed, the surgeon removes the clamp and ensures that there is no damage to the vessels and blood flow is normal. The surgeon closes the incision with sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia. The patient will be under observation for several hours in the recovery room. Pain medication will be administered for postoperative pain. The patient may need hospitalization for a week or more, depending on the type of surgery and underlying condition of the patient. The patient’s liver function will be monitored with follow-up tests."
What are the risks and complications of the Pringle maneuver?,"'Pringle maneuver has greatly reduced the risks involved with liver surgeries due to excessive bleeding. The complications that may arise from Pringle maneuver include:' Anesthetic side effects such asHeadacheNauseaConfusion Headache Nausea Confusion Surgical risks such asWound infectionPneumoniaBleedingBlood clotsInjury to other organs, blood vessels or nervesReaction to medications Wound infection Pneumonia Bleeding Blood clots Injury to other organs, blood vessels or nerves Reaction to medications Damage to the liver due to ischemia (lack of blood supply) leading to liver dysfunction Ischemia-reperfusion injury to the liver tissue caused when blood supply returns after a period of ischemia Damage to the gallbladder or bile duct Portal hypertension -- increase of pressure in the portal vein Rupture of spleen Bile leakage Complications from the associated surgery Abnormal or erratic blood pressure Sepsis and death"
Process of normal delivery,"'Normal delivery refers to ''childbirth'' through the vagina without any medical intervention. It is also known as a vaginal birth. Every delivery is unique and may differ from mothers to mothers. There are different stages of normal delivery or vaginal birth that include:''Stage I: Early ''labor'' and active ''labor'':'' This stage starts when a regular contraction starts leading to dilation (widening) of the cervix up to 10 cm. Contractions also lead to softening, shortening, and thinning (effacement) of the cervix, allowing the baby to move into the birth canal. It is the longest of all three stages. The substage of this stage includes:''Early ''labor'':'' During this ''labor'', the cervix opens and thins. The mother might feel mild irregular contractions. As the cervix opens, the mother might notice a clear, pink, slightly bloody discharge from the vagina, which is likely the ''mucus'' plug blocking the opening of the cervix. The average length of this stage varies from hours to days for first-time mothers. To promote comfort, the mother can perform these techniques:''Active labor: ''During this stage, the cervix dilates from 6 to 10 cm. Contractions become more powerful and come more frequently. Moreover, you might feel the following symptoms:''Active labor lasts for four to eight hours or more. During this stage, the cervix dilates at approximately 1 cm per hour. To promote comfort, the mother can perform these techniques:''There’s the most painful phase called the transition phase because the cervix dilates to its fullest at about 10 cm. The contractions are powerful and painful, which continue at intervals of two to three minutes, each lasting for 60-90 seconds.''Stage II: Pushing and subsequent delivery of the baby:'' This stage starts once the cervix dilates completely. The duration of this stage may be anywhere between a few minutes and up to a few hours or more. The mother has to push with every contraction, which can lead to ''fatigue''. This stage is also characterized by the following:''Stage III: Delivery of the placenta:'' After the child comes out, the final stage involves the delivery of the placenta. It would take about 5-30 minutes for the doctor to take out the placenta out through the vaginal canal. The mother will continue to have mild contractions that will be close together and less painful. The physician might ask you to take medicines to encourage uterine contractions and prevent bleeding. The physician may also check if the placenta is intact and no fragments are remaining in the uterus, causing infection or bleeding.' Go for a walk Listen to soothing music Take a warm shower or bath Try relaxation techniques Change positions Leg cramps Nausea Increase pressure in the back The feeling of water break Go for a stroll Take a warm bath or shower Breathe in between the contractions Change positions Gently massage between the contractions Intense pain around the vaginal opening as the child comes out The mother feels pressure and gets the feeling that she wants to pass motions The physician making episiotomy (a cut to widen the opening of the vagina) Continuous pushing by the mother to expel the baby out The baby’s head comes out first, then the shoulders, and then the butt Cutting the umbilical cord as a final step after the baby is completely out and has the first cry"
How is a nephrostomy tube placed?,"'Placement procedure:' The placement of a nephrostomy tube is done by a surgeon in an operating room or in the radiology department by an interventional radiologist.  The procedure may be done under intravenous sedation or general anesthesia (the patient sleeps through the procedure). The procedure may take around one hour to complete. The doctor will locate the kidneys under ultrasound guidance. They will insert a special kind of hollow needle percutaneously (through the skin) into the kidney under ultrasound guidance. Under fluoroscopic guidance (using live X-ray), the doctor will guide a catheter (small narrow tube) into the kidney. An X-ray shield is used to protect the patient. The outer end of the catheter will be connected to a urine drainage bag. The catheter will be secured in place on the surface of the skin using a small stitch and/or an adhesive clip or a disc. The doctor will place a gauze and a clear bandage over the catheter site.  The patient will be placed under observation in the recovery area for some time after the procedure. Before discharge, the patient and the caregiver may be given instructions for at-home care such as keeping the bandage area dry all the time and avoiding swimming and contact or rough sports that may displace the tube."
What are the complications of a nephrostomy tube?,"'A nephrostomy tube placement procedure is generally safe. Some of the complications that may arise include:' Pain Bleeding Anesthesia-related reactions Injury/trauma to the kidney, ureter, or bladder Contrast reaction (allergy to the fluoroscopy dye used in X-ray)"
What is a vagotomy?,"'The vagus nerve is responsible for sensory and motor functions of the internal organs such as ''heart'', ''lungs'' and the gastrointestinal system. The vagus nerve runs from the brain, down the neck, alongside the ''esophagus'', and over the stomach and ''intestines''.''Vagotomy is a procedure to surgically remove a part or the whole of the portion of the vagus nerve that controls the ''digestive system''. The vagus nerve stimulates gastrointestinal functions such as acid production for ''digestion'' and moving the food through the gastrointestinal system (peristalsis).' "
What are the types of vagotomy?,"'There are primarily three types of vagotomy:' Truncal vagotomy: The two main trunks (anterior and posterior) of the vagus nerve are cut above the place where the esophagus joins the stomach (gastroesophageal junction). A truncal vagotomy removes the nerve going through the entire gastrointestinal system including the liver, gallbladder, pancreas and bowels. It is usually accompanied by another surgery to widen the stomach outlet (pylorus) into the intestine (pyloroplasty), because the digestive system also loses its peristalsis function. Selective vagotomy: The vagus nerve divides below the gastroesophageal junction and only the portion going to the stomach is cut. The trunk of the nerve going to the remainder of the gastrointestinal organs are left intact. A selective vagotomy is also usually accompanied by a pyloroplasty. Highly selective vagotomy: Only the portion of the vagus nerve connected to the part of stomach that produces acid is removed. The nerve function of the lower stomach and the other organs are preserved."
What is the purpose of a vagotomy?,"'Stimulated by the vagus nerve, the stomach produces acid to digest food. When the stomach produces excessive acid, it can corrode the stomach lining and cause peptic ulcers. The purpose of a vagotomy is to disable the stomach’s acid producing capacity.' "
Is vagotomy still performed?,"'With the development of excellent medications for the ''acid reflux''-inducing bacteria ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection and acid production control, the requirement for vagotomy is greatly reduced. It is mostly performed to treat the following:' Pyloric stenosis, or narrowing of the stomach’s opening into the intestine Peptic ulcers that do not respond to medication, diet and lifestyle modification Chronic, recurring ulcers Emergencies with gastrointestinal inflammation and bleeding due to ulcers"
How is a vagotomy performed?,"'A vagotomy is usually performed under general anesthesia by a gastrointestinal surgeon as an open or laparoscopic surgery.' Before a vagotomy, a patient Undergoes blood, urine and imaging tests, and possibly a gastroscopy. Must not eat or drink 8 hours prior to the procedure. Must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Must inform the doctor of any allergies. May need blood transfusion in case of bleeding peptic ulcers. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient will be intubated for supplemental oxygen. The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the abdomen depending on the type of surgery. Depending on the type of vagotomy, the surgeon cuts the vagus nerve above or below the gastroesophageal junction or just the parts connected to the body of the stomach. The surgeon may remove a part of the lower stomach (antrectomy) or perform a pyloroplasty. The surgeon may remove the duodenum in certain situations and connect the stomach directly to the jejunum, the middle part of the small intestine (gastrojejunostomy). The abdominal muscles and the incision are closed with sutures. The patient will be monitored in the recovery room for several hours. The patient may require up to a week of hospitalization. Complete recovery may take up to six weeks during which the patient may be required tofollow a specific dietavoid spicy and acidic foodsavoid heavy liftingavoid strenuous activities follow a specific diet avoid spicy and acidic foods avoid heavy lifting avoid strenuous activities"
What are the side effects of a vagotomy?,"'A vagotomy may cause side effects such as:' Anesthetic side effects such as headache, nausea and confusion Postvagotomy diarrhea (mainly with truncal vagotomy) Delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) which is usually prevented with a pyloroplasty Change in digestive patterns and need to be on a special diet"
What are the risks and complications of a vagotomy?,"'The vagotomy surgery itself is a relatively safe procedure, but has a few potential postoperative complications including:' Risks of surgery such asWound infectionPneumoniaBleedingBlood clotsDamage to internal organs, blood vessels or nerves Wound infection Pneumonia Bleeding Blood clots Damage to internal organs, blood vessels or nerves Gastric leak Internal hernia Gastric dumping syndrome due to the stomach contents emptying too quickly into the intestine Bile reflux and chronic gastritis caused by gastrojejunostomy Formation of gallstones (mainly after a truncal vagotomy) Bowel blockage due to problems with peristalsis Recurrence of ulcers (a low risk with truncal vagotomy) Stomach or intestinal cancer"
What is fundus photography?,"'Fundus photography is the process of taking serial photographs of the interior of your eye through the pupil. A fundus camera is a specialized low-power microscope attached to a camera used to examine structures such as the optic disc, retina, and ''lens''.' "
What happens during fundus photography?,"'Before the procedure, your ophthalmologist may administer an eye drop to increase the size of the pupil. This allows your doctor to examine the interior surface of your eye much more properly.''During the procedure,' Your doctor will instruct you to sit in front of the fundus camera with your chin on a chin rest (an attachment) and your forehead against the bar. Your doctor will focus and align the fundus camera on the pupil (the black center of your eye). As soon as the doctor presses the shutter release, flash fires that create a photograph of the interior surface of your eye."
What are the benefits of fundus photography?," It is a non-invasive procedure and only takes a minute or two. It is easier to visualize the details of the retina (the interior surface of the eye) in stereoscopic fundus photographs rather than examining your eye directly. It provides a bird’s eye view of entire layers on the retina (the interior surface of the eye) and allows your doctor to provide the most accurate diagnosis. Many times, certain internal eye landmarks are more visible in fundus photography than other eye examinations, for example, fluorescein angiography (an eye examination in which a fluorescent dye is injected inside your eye). Serial photographs of the internal structure of your eye may allow your doctor to study the delicate changes in the eye nerve, and they can recommend the appropriate therapy to you. It allows early and accurate diagnosis, especially changes in the eye of patients with diabetes and blood pressure, which are essential for timely treatment and improvement in the patient’s outcome. You get pictures of the current appearance of the retina (the interior surface of your eye) that is more worthy sometimes than the physician’s notes."
What are the risks of fundus photography?,"'Fundus photography is not an invasive procedure, and it only takes a minute or two. It may not be able to detect the changes in the peripheral retina. Other than that, there is little to no risk. You might not be able to see clearly for some time because your pupils were dilated during the examination with eye drops. However, the images obtained can help to detect your eye diseases in the early stages so that the preventive treatment can be started early. This benefit can outweigh apparent risks. It also provides your ophthalmologist with more information about the progression of your eye illness and allows your doctor to plan further treatment.' "
What is the quickest way to get rid of heartburn?,"'Taking antacids is considered the quickest way to get rid of ''heartburn''. These ''over-the-counter'' medications help neutralize stomach acid. They are one of the first recommended treatments. They may provide quick relief. However, antacid overuse can cause problems such as ''diarrhea'' or chronic ''kidney disease'', especially if they contain aluminum and magnesium.''Other common ways to get rid of heartburn include' H2 receptor blockers: These medications work to reduce the amount of acid that is made in the stomach. While they do not work as quickly as antacids, they provide longer relief for up to 12 hours. Examples of these include Pepcid AC, Tagamet HB, Zantac and Axid AR. Although most people have no problems taking them, long-term use can cause vitamin B12 deficiency leading to an increased risk of bone fractures. Proton pump inhibitors: This class of medications block acid production. They also help to heal any damage caused to the lining of the esophagus. They are much stronger than the H2 receptor blockers and include Prevacid, Prilosec, Protonix and Zegerid. Excessive use of these medications can cause diarrhea and nausea, vitamin B12 deficiency and an increased risk of bone fractures. Baclofen: This medication works to strengthen the muscular valve present at the lower esophageal sphincter muscle. However, it may cause nausea and fatigue in some people. Surgical procedures: In rare cases, these are required to help with severe heartburn symptoms."
What is heartburn?,"'Heartburn or ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') is a condition where acid in the stomach flows back into the esophagus causing irritation of the esophageal lining. The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscle that controls the passage of food and drink between the esophagus and the stomach. Sometimes, this muscle does not close completely allowing acid from the stomach to flow back into the throat or esophagus. This abnormal condition is called gastroesophageal reflux or ''acid reflux''. Its symptoms include ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'' in the voice and a very ''bad taste in the mouth''. When these symptoms become recurrent and severe, it is called ''GERD''. The most common symptom of GERD is\xa0heartburn (''pain'"" in the upper abdomen and chest that sometimes feels like you're having a ""'heart attack'').''Three conditions can cause GERD''Symptoms of heartburn include' Poor clearance of food or acid from the esophagus or throat Too much acid in the stomach Delayed stomach emptying Sensation of burning, pain or discomfort after eating located in the breastbone (middle of the lower chest underneath the sternum). The discomfort may increase when bending over or lying flat on your back.  Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or feeling like food is stuck in the lower esophagus Cough or respiratory discomfort"
How can I relieve heartburn without medications?,"'If you suffer from heartburn, try one of the remedies below' Lose weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle: Weight gain strains the muscular structure that supports the lower esophageal sphincter, reducing the pressure that holds the sphincter closed. This leads to reflux and heartburn. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and losing weight can help reduce symptoms of acid reflux. Don’t smoke: Nicotine relaxes the esophageal sphincter causing heartburn symptoms of heartburn. Quitting smoking may help reduce acid reflux symptoms. Skip carbonated beverages: Carbonated beverages may make a person burp, which sends acid into the esophagus. Skip carbonated beverages and drink water instead of sparkling water to curb acid reflux symptoms. Eat sparingly and slowly: Patients can try grazing (eating smaller meals more frequently rather than three large meals daily) to reduce acid reflux symptoms. Avoid certain foods: People with acid reflux may be instructed to eliminate some foods that are more likely than others to trigger reflux, including mint, fatty foods, spicy foods, tomatoes, onions, garlic, coffee, tea, chocolate and alcohol. Prop yourself up after eating: When standing or sitting, gravity alone helps keep acid in the stomach where it belongs. Finish eating at least three hours before going to bed. This means no naps after lunch and no late suppers or midnight snacks. Don't move too fast: Avoiding vigorous exercise or strenuous workouts for a couple of hours after eating can curb the symptoms of acid reflux. Check your medications: Some medications such as postmenopausal estrogen, tricyclic antidepressants and anti-inflammatory painkillers can relax the sphincter or irritate the esophagus. Identifying and curbing such medication use after discussing it with the doctor may help reduce acid reflux symptoms. Adjust sleeping position: Most acid reflux occurs during sleep. To prevent nighttime attacks, patients may need to position their head above their abdomen. Elevate the head of the bed a minimum of 30 degrees. A firm foam-rubber wedge or bricks placed under the bedposts can help elevate the head of the bed. Avoid lying flat down, especially right after eating."
What happens when you have a nervous breakdown?,"'A nervous or mental breakdown is a general term used to describe a period of overwhelming mental distress. This term is usually used to refer to an intense set of emotions a person experiences in a wide variety of mental illnesses, including ''depression'', ''stress'' disorder, and ''anxiety''. Below are common symptoms of a nervous breakdown:\xa0' Feeling alone and separated from others. A constant feeling that others are not able to understand him or her. A feeling of detachment.  Feelings of guilt or extreme sadness for no apparent cause.  Unable to concentrate on work, school, or daily activities.   Mood swings, feelings of emotional outbursts, extreme anger.  Extreme burn out.  Disturbance in sleep pattern: A change in the sleep cycle is a symptom of a nervous breakdown. They may either sleep too much or maybe sleep deprived.  Extreme tiredness: Activities that were previously handled with ease may become increasingly difficult. And things that used to bring you joy may lose their appeal due to extreme tiredness and weakness due to stress and a nervous breakdown.  Change in appetite: When a person is in the middle of a breakdown, they become less motivated with their diet, leading them to skip meals or overeat.  Physical pain: Headache and stomach aches are the most commonly physical pain experienced during a nervous breakdown, which can hamper the process of digestion.  Trouble breathing: Breathing difficulty is a classic symptom of a nervous breakdown and anxiety. "
What are the causes and risk factors of nervous breakdown?,"'Few factors might increase a person’s likelihood of experiencing a nervous breakdown. These include:\xa0' Personal history or a family history of anxiety disorders.  Stressful job profile and extreme work pressure.  Anxious personality.  Recent injury or illness may have an impact on daily life.  The recent emotional event, such as a death in the family or a divorce.  Poor sleep and inability to relax.  Severe medical conditions. "
How can a nervous breakdown be prevented and treated?,"'A nervous breakdown can be prevented and treated using a few common strategies that include:\xa0' A person may need to discuss with doctor regarding medications (antidepressant, antianxiety or antipsychotic medications).  People may need to avoid excessive use of caffeine, alcohol, illicit drugs, and nicotine.  Setting healthy hygiene, sleeping, and eating schedules and sticking to them.  Creating a distraction-free sleeping environment to encourage quality sleep.  May need to reduce or resolve sources of stress, such as conflicts at home or workplace demands.  Developing new hobbies especially outdoor activities.  Scheduling at least 20 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 10 minutes of high-intensity exercise daily.  Seeking counseling and participating in behavioral therapy. "

What is a lumbar discectomy?,"'A spinal disc is a sponge-like cushion located between the bones of the spine. Discs act as ''shock'' absorbers and allow the spine to flex. When a disc ruptures (herniates) it prolapses and presses on the nearby nerves, causing\xa0''A lumbar discectomy is a surgical procedure in which the surgeon removes the damaged portion of a disc to relieve the pressure on the nerves.' pain,  numbness, and weakness."
What are the types of discectomy?,"'There are three ways a surgeon may choose to perform a discectomy:' Open or conventional discectomy in which the surgeon makes a comparatively large incision to allow clear vision and also removes some muscle and ligament. Microdiscectomy is minimally invasive with a tiny incision. The surgeon does not remove any muscle or bone, but inserts a tube with a tiny camera/instruments to remove the damaged portion of the disc. Laser discectomy is in wider use now. This procedure requires no incision. Instead, the surgeon burns the prolapsed tissue away with a laser inserted through a needle."
When is a lumbar discectomy performed?,'The symptoms of a herniated or prolapsed disc can often improve with:\xa0''A lumbar discectomy usually is performed only when the noninvasive methods listed above have failed to provide relief. It is likely to prove useful to who have a herniated lumbar disc who:' rest pain relievers physical therapy epidural injections feel unbearable pain doing their daily activities have numbness or weakness in their lower limbs have trouble walking or standing lose control over bladder or bowel functions
How is a lumbar discectomy performed?,"'An orthopedic spine surgeon performs a lumbar discectomy under general anesthesia with the patient unconscious, or regional anesthesia with an epidural that numbs the region.''Prior to the surgery the patient undergoes blood tests, a ''CT scan'', ''MRI'', or other imaging tests. All usual precautions taken in preparation for anesthesia and surgery are followed.' An anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia as the patient lies flat on their stomach. The anesthesiologist will continue to monitor the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The surgeon will make an incision in the skin over the affected disc. Muscle and ligaments attached to the disc will be removed in the case of an open discectomy, or the surgeon will insert a tube with a microscope for a microdiscectomy. The surgeon will then remove the damaged tissue from the disc. They may also remove a part of the bone around the herniated disc if necessary. If a whole disc has to be removed, the surgeon might fill the space with bone from the patient’s pelvis or taken from a donor, or with synthetic bone. The surgeon will then suture the incision area. The anesthesiologist will bring the patient out of anesthesia and monitor until the patient’s condition is stable. The patient is usually discharged within a day."
What is the recovery time for a discectomy?,"'Patients are encouraged to start walking within a day or two. It is advisable to take a week or two off from work to allow healing to take place. After the surgery, for at least 2 to 4 weeks the patient should:''The patient will need to follow-up with the doctor for further treatment with physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises. Typically, the patient is able to resume normal life in 6 to 8 weeks.' not lift heavy objects sit for long periods bend or stretch excessively"
How painful is a lumbar discectomy?,"'A lumbar discectomy is completely painless as it is done under anesthesia. The patient will feel nothing except the pinprick of the injection needle. Post-surgery, there is likely to be some amount of ''stiffness'' and pain that can be relieved with painkillers.' "
What are the risks and complications of a discectomy?,"'Discectomy is generally a safe option for patients who get no relief from non-surgical treatments. The risks may include:' anesthesia side effects like headache, nausea and confusion infection bleeding and blood clots damage to nerves or blood vessels leakage of cerebrospinal fluid failure of surgery to provide symptom relief recurrence of disc herniation"
What is the success rate of a discectomy?,'Discectomy works well typically and it offers faster relief than other treatments. It still may not be the best choice for everyone and it is generally appropriate to exhaust all other options before choosing surgery.''Discectomy has been found to have about 90- to 95-percent success rate with only 5 percent of the patients experiencing recurring herniation.' 
What is a mandibular dislocation?,"'A mandibular dislocation occurs when the temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') is displaced on one side (unilaterally) or both sides (bilaterally) of the face.''A mandibular dislocation stretches the ligaments and muscles of the face, giving rise to extreme local oral and facial ''pain''. You may not be able to open your mouth partially or completely.''The mandible with its connection with the skull above, on each side of the face (bilaterally), forms the TMJ.''The TMJ helps in opening and closing your jaw, and the mandible holds the ''teeth'' in place.''A mandibular dislocation is a medical emergency. Delay in its correction may result in ''stiffness'' of the jaw joint due to abnormal joining between tissues of the mandibular bone.' "
What causes a mandibular dislocation?,"'The main cause of a mandibular dislocation is ''trauma''.''Most commonly, a mandibular dislocation happens during yawning and dental procedures where there is an excessive opening of the mouth.''Other instances when a mandibular dislocation can happen because of the opening of the mouth widely are as follows:''Persistent ''muscle spasm'' in the jaw results in ''lockjaw'' (trismus) that can lead to a jaw dislocation. A previous mandibular dislocation also puts you at risk of repeated dislocations.' Passionate kissing Eating Yelling Singing Endoscopy (insertion of a long tube into your mouth that goes into your stomach) Intubation (insertion of a tube into your mouth that goes into your windpipe)"
How is a mandibular dislocation diagnosed?,'Your doctor will know that you have got a mandibular dislocation by taking your complete history and physical examination. He will confirm his diagnosis and rule out any jaw ''fracture'' by looking at the X-ray of your jaw.' 
What is the reduction of a mandibular dislocation?,"'Reduction of a mandibular dislocation is a procedure that aligns the mandible bone correctly—back to its original place—and corrects the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) by pushing or pulling the mandible.''Acute episodes of a mandibular dislocation can be managed with manual reduction (externally), whereas recurrent dislocations require a surgery.''The steps in manual reduction are as follows:' Your doctor will give you painkillers and sedatives to ease your pain and local anesthesia into your jaw to numb it before the procedure. Your doctor or dentist will wrap his/her fingers with a gauze. Subsequently, they will put their thumbs inside the mouth on the lower back teeth and rest of the fingers around the bottom of the lower jaw. They will then press downwards on the back teeth and, at the same time, keep pushing the chin upwards until the mandible bone returns to its normal position."
What is done after reduction of a mandibular dislocation?, Your doctor or dentist may apply a Barton bandage (special bandage) for two-three days to limit the motion in your temporomandibular joint (TMJ). He will ask you for an X-ray of your jaw to confirm the success of the reduction procedure. You may have to wear a soft neck brace for some days. You can apply warm compresses to your jaw and take painkillers to ease the pain. You need to limit opening your mouth for six weeks during certain actions such as yawning and laughing and during dental procedures.
What are the risks involved in the reduction of a mandibular dislocation?,"'The possible risks that come with the reduction of a mandibular dislocation are as follows:' Damage to dental hardware such as dental implants and braces Fracture of the mandible bone Injury to the adjacent nerves or arteries Problems due to sedation such aslow blood pressure,irregular heart rate,apnea (cessation of respiration) andallergy. low blood pressure, irregular heart rate, apnea (cessation of respiration) and allergy."
What causes a patellar dislocation?,"'The ''patella'', commonly known as the kneecap, is one of the four bones (femur, tibia, fibula, and patella) that make your ''knee joint''. When it slips out of the knee joint, the condition is known as a patellar dislocation.''Patellar dislocations are common, particularly in adolescent females and athletes. Having a structural abnormality in the patella puts you at a high risk of patellar dislocations.''A patellar dislocation may be due to direct ''trauma'' to your patella or twisting of your knee. Along with the patellar dislocation, the injury may also result in the ''fracture'' of the patella, tibia, or femur simultaneously.''If you get a patellar dislocation, you would not be able to extend your knee, ''walking'' might feel painful and fluid might get filled in your knee, which can be observed as swelling.' "
How is a patellar dislocation diagnosed?, A patellar dislocation can be usually diagnosed by just looking at your knee joint. Your doctor might gently press on your knee joint and feel the dislocated patella. Your doctor may ask for an X-ray of your knee joint to check if there are any fractures. He may also ask for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee joint if he suspects damage to the surrounding cartilage or tear of the ligament.
What is the reduction of a patellar dislocation?,"'The reduction of patellar dislocation is a simple and safe procedure that aligns the patella correctly in the knee joint and restores it to its normal position. If not associated with fractures, it can be performed manually.''Painkillers are usually not required before the reduction procedure. If you get anxious, your doctor might sedate you or give local anesthesia to numb your knee.' Reduction of patellar dislocation is performed in the following way: Your doctor will cradle your affected leg in one of his/her arms. He will then slightly flex your hip to relax the quadriceps muscle located in front of your thigh. Next, he will gently extend your lower leg that will spontaneously align the patella correctly."
When does your doctor recommend against the reduction of patellar dislocation?,"'Your doctor will not perform a reduction of a patellar dislocation if there is an associated fracture of the tibia or fibula. If you face recurrent dislocations, your doctor may prefer surgery over reduction.' "
What is done after the reduction of patellar dislocation?," Your doctor will examine your knee physically to check if the reduction has been successful. An X-ray of the knee joint will be ordered to confirm whether your dislocated patella has been restored correctly. Next, your knee will be immediately wrapped in a brace, cast, or splint for approximately three to four weeks, or you may need to use crutches for a few weeks. You will need to follow-up with your doctor as advised. After reduction, recovery from the patellar dislocation usually takes approximately six to eight weeks. With the help of a physical therapist, you can learn some exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee and thigh that will fasten your recovery."
What causes a thumb dislocation?,"'A forceful ''trauma'' (e.g., sports injury or fall) to any of the figure joints can result in ''finger dislocation'' (movement of bone out of its original position).\xa0 The thumb consists of only two joints, whereas the other four fingers consist of three joints, which allow it to bend forward, downward, and sideways. These joints are:''Thumb dislocations are usually caused by bending the thumb backward (hyperextension) beyond its normal range. They are the most common type of hand injuries that happen in athletes playing football and basketball while catching or blocking the fast-moving ball.''Although a thumb dislocation is not a medical emergency, delaying its treatment might increase the swelling in the finger, making the treatment difficult.' Interphalangeal (IP) joint: It is located closest to the fingernails. Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint: It is located at the base of the thumb."
How do you know if you have a dislocated thumb?,"'Observe for the following signs and symptoms to know if you have a thumb dislocation:''Your doctor will ask you about how the thumb injury occurred, so look at your thumb and confirm the diagnosis. He/she might order an X-ray of your thumb to observe if there is any associated ''fracture''.' A dislocated thumb is crooked and swollen. There may a bruise or cut on the dislocated thumb. Moving the dislocated thumb is extremely painful. The dislocated thumb may feel abnormally loose or unstable."
What is the reduction of a thumb dislocation?,"'If your thumb dislocation is not severe, the doctor can immediately fix it by externally manipulating and putting your bone back in its original position. This is known as a closed reduction. Before they do this, you might get a local anesthetic medication to numb your thumb and an analgesic to ease your ''pain''.''During the procedure, the doctor will gently restore your thumb to its correct position by gently pushing or pulling it. The procedure will vary depending upon which of the two joints (interphalangeal [IP] and metacarpophalangeal [MCP]) are dislocated. The doctor will perform another X-ray to confirm the success of the reduction procedure.' "
What is done after the reduction of a thumb dislocation?,"'Once your thumb is back in its normal position, it will be wrapped in a splint or spica cast for three to six weeks.''Your doctor will look at the repeat X-ray of your thumb and will confirm the restoration of your thumb joint to its normal position.''Your doctor will teach you some exercises to be performed at home to restore the normal strength and range of motion in your thumb.''If you continue to have severe thumb ''pain'' after closed reduction or if your injured thumb is loose and unstable, you may require surgery to fix your dislocated thumb. The reduction is performed by opening your thumb, and the method is known as open reduction.' "
Will a dislocated thumb heal itself?," Following the reduction of the dislocated thumb, the spica cast and thumb exercises will help your thumb heal fast. You can return to your sports and likewise activities only after your doctor confirms that your dislocated thumb is stable. If a dislocated thumb has been operated upon (open reduction), it requires three to six weeks to heal completely only after which you can return to your sport."
What is an ankle dislocation?,"'An abnormal separation between the bones of a joint is called a dislocation. When this happens to the ankle joint, it is called an ''ankle dislocation''. Ankle dislocations can happen to people of all ages. They occur with ankle ''fractures'' much more often than with just ''sprains''.''The three bones that make up the ankle joint are:''The ankle joint helps the foot move up and down. Below this is another ankle joint called the subtalar joint. This joint is between the talus and another bone in the foot (calcaneus). This joint lets the foot move side to side. Normally, a set of very strong ligaments hold all of these bones tightly in place. The ligaments do not pull away or tear easily.''A severe injury can pull or tear these ligaments out of place, however. This creates an abnormal space between the bones. Ankle dislocations often occur along with a break in one or more of the ankle bones. In some cases, an ankle dislocation can happen without a break in the ankle bones. In these cases, the ankle dislocation occurs along with a severe ''ankle sprain''. A severe sprain is when the ligaments are torn.''In most cases, the injury pushes the talus bone behind the other ankle bones. It may also be pushed to either side, to the front or upwards.' Tibia (shinbone) Fibula (the smaller bone in the leg) Talus (a bone in the foot)"
What is the reduction of an ankle dislocation?," An ankle dislocation is a relatively common type of dislocation encountered in the emergency department. They exist in two forms:A true dislocation without fractureA fracture-dislocation, occurring in the vast majority A true dislocation without fracture A fracture-dislocation, occurring in the vast majority If the surgeon moves the bones back into place without surgery, it is called closed reduction. Sometimes, the surgeon may align the bones back in place through the surgery under general anesthesia to let them heal correctly. This is called reduction.  The surgeon may also use special plates and screws to keep the bones in place. This is called internal fixation.  During the same procedure, the surgeon usually fixes the torn ligaments to keep the bone in place."
What happens after the reduction of an ankle dislocation?," Usually, after the procedure, the patient will be monitored in the hospital.  Patients may be started on pain medications, antibiotics and blood thinners.  Patients might be advised to keep their ankle raised (elevated).  Usually, a cast or splint or boot is used to keep the ankle in position and reduce swelling. Usually, the recovery depends on the patient’s capability.  Most patients recover between six and eight months.  After the leg has healed a bit, the doctor may recommend physical therapy. These exercises will help the patient to restore and keep the range of motion and strength.  Some patients may need to use crutches or a cane for a few months after the injury. The doctor or physical therapist will let the patient know when they can go back to normal activities.  Doctors also recommend patients to eat a diet that is rich in calcium, vitamin D and protein that can help in bone healing."
What are the possible complications of an ankle dislocation?,"'Patients might have the following complications from ankle dislocations:' Stiffness in joints (physical therapy may help) Ankle arthritis causing a lasting (severe) ankle pain Infection, which may need treatment with antibiotics or a follow-up surgery A broken bone that fails to heal correctly, which might need a follow-up surgery Pain from the plates and screws used in the surgery (these may be removed at a later date) Problems with wound healing Blood vessel or nerve damage from dislocations or fractures"
What causes radon to enter in your home?,"'Radon is a naturally occurring invisible radioactive ''gas'' that is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. It is formed from radioactive metals, such as Uranium, Thorium, and Radium, found in groundwater, rocks, and soil.\xa0''Radon quickly dilutes in the air outdoors, which brings down its concentration to very low levels.

How to test your home for radon levels?,"'You can go through the manual, ‘A Citizen’s Guide to Radon,’ produced by the EPA to know in detail how to test your home for radon levels.''Here is some general information about what you can do:''The EPA recommends checking radon levels at least every 2 years.' Hire a professional tester or do it yourself with a kit that you can buy at a hardware store or online. You can keep the kit at your home for a few days and send the kit to the lab to get the results of radon levels in your home. If you have a well in your home, get its water radon level tested. If you get a positive result, treat it before the radon enters your home through it."
How do you get rid of radon in your home?,"'Here is what you can do to reduce air radon levels in your homes:' Increase your underfloor ventilation Install a radon sump system in the basement Seal the gaps in the floors and wall (by plasters and caulk) Improve the ventilation in your home (open windows, use fans, and vent systems) Take precautions to prevent radon from entering from the basement into living rooms"
What is bariatric surgery?,"'Bariatric surgery is an operation on the ''digestive system'' to help an ''obese'' person ''lose weight''. The surgery restricts calorie intake by reducing the size of the stomach. Some types of bariatric surgery restrict the size as well as absorption of nutrients. Regardless of the approach, a successful bariatric surgery results in significant ''weight loss''.' "
Why is a bariatric surgery done?,"'A bariatric surgery helps an obese person lose weight by reducing the capacity of their ''digestion'' and appetite. A person with a body mass index of 30 or more is considered obese. Other factors like muscle mass and waist circumference also factor into a diagnosis of ''obesity''.''People consider bariatric surgery when the ''BMI'' is 40 or above. It might also be recommended for people with a BMI between 30 and 40 if they also have diseases such as ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', ''fatty liver'', or ''sleep apnea''.''Obesity can cause a host of health issues including''Obesity is a major health problem worldwide, and bariatric surgery provides the most significant and sustained ''weight loss'' solution for obese patients. Nevertheless, patients should consider bariatric surgery only after exhausting other options for ''weight loss'' like ''dieting'', ''exercise'', and drug treatments.' diabetes heart disease high blood pressure liver disease digestive issues incontinence sleep apnea back pain  osteoarthritis psychological issues"
What are the types of bariatric surgery?,"'Bariatric surgery may be “restrictive,” which reduces the amount of food intake, or “restrictive/malabsorptive,” which restricts intake and interferes with the digestion as well. Currently, there are four standard types of bariatric surgery procedures as follows:' This is a restrictive surgery in which the surgeon places an inflatable band over the top portion of the stomach.  This divides the stomach into two sections, creating a small pouch on top of the main stomach, connected to it by a small channel. This slows down the passage of food that goes into the main stomach, consequently reducing the quantity of intake. The opening to the main stomach can be controlled by inflating or deflating the band with a port implanted under the skin.  This surgery is reversible as the band and port can be removed if no longer needed. This is a restrictive laparoscopic surgery in which the surgeon removes about 75% to 85% of the stomach and leaves only a small pouch which is stapled. This reduces the quantity of food intake and does not affect the absorption of nutrients. It reduces the production of the stomach hormone that stimulates appetite, and curbs hunger. This is sometimes performed as the first step in a series of weight loss surgeries. This is not reversible. This surgery is restrictive/malabsorptive and involves two procedures. The surgeon first staples the stomach creating a small pouch. Then they cut the small intestine and attach the lower part of it directly to the pouch, bypassing a major part of the stomach and small intestines. The bypassed section is then connected farther down the small intestine to allow digestive juices in. The bypass causes changes in gut bacteria and gut hormones, and induces malabsorption besides restricting calorie intake. It is a difficult procedure to reverse this but can be done if medically necessary. This is a restrictive/malabsorptive surgery performed in two steps. First a sleeve gastrectomy is performed in which 50% of the stomach is removed. Then the surgeon connects the pouch to the end of the small intestine bypassing most of it. The bypassed section is connected farther down to allow entry of digestive juices. This surgery is not reversible."
What is the safest form of bariatric surgery?,"'Each type of bariatric surgery has its own benefits and drawbacks. The surgeon suggests the type of surgery based on the individual’s health and needs. All surgeries carry a certain amount of risk, but restrictive surgeries are safer than restrictive/malabsorptive surgeries as they do not permanently interfere with the digestive system.''This the simplest and safest procedure of the bariatric surgeries. The weight loss is lower than the other surgeries, however. Also, individuals with ''gastric banding'' are more likely to regain weight in the long run. Because the surgery doesn’t affect nutrient absorption, there is less risk of nutrient deficiency.''This is a relatively safe and simple surgery for morbidly obese people who have other health complications. The weight loss is significant and nutrient absorption is not affected. This is a newer procedure and long-term benefits and risks are still under evaluation.''This surgery enables swift weight loss that continues up to 2 years. It is useful for patients suffering with obesity-related conditions to improve their health quickly. It also has good long-term results in keeping weight off. The drawbacks are hernias, and nutrient deficiencies because of malabsorption. It can also cause dumping syndrome where the food is dumped from the stomach into the intestines before it is properly digested.''This is more complicated and riskier than the other surgeries and less commonly performed. It results in quicker weight loss, but the risks of hernias, nutrient deficiency and dumping syndrome are higher.' "
What is a pancreas transplant?,"'A pancreas transplant is a last resort treatment in patients with an established type 1 ''diabetes mellitus''. It involves the replacement of an unhealthy pancreas with a healthy pancreas from a donor. A pancreas transplant helps in:''The pancreas is generally taken from a deceased donor; however, in selective cases, the pancreas will be taken from a living donor. There are four types of pancreas transplant:' Improving type 1 diabetes mellitus Reducing the dependency on insulin shots Treating pancreatic cancer Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant: This type of transplant involves a simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant. Pancreas-after-kidney transplant: Pancreas transplantation takes place after successful kidney transplantation. Kidney after pancreas transplants: Kidney transplantation takes place after successful pancreas transplants. Pancreas transplant alone: It is performed in patients with serious and complicated diabetes."
When should a pancreas transplant be avoided?,"'A pancreas transplant should be avoided in people with:' A history of cancer Human immunodeficiency virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Infections such as hepatitis Lung disease Obesity Severe heart disease Lifestyle habits such as smoking, alcohol or drug abuse Blood vessel disease of neck and leg"
What to expect in a pancreas transplant?,"'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' The surgeon determines if a pancreas transplant is necessary for you. You need to undergo specific tests as a part of the evaluation, which includes:Blood tests or skin tests to check for infectionHeart tests such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, or cardiac catheterizationTissue and blood typing to make sure that the body doesn’t reject the donated organsTest to diagnose early cancer Blood tests or skin tests to check for infection Heart tests such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, or cardiac catheterization Tissue and blood typing to make sure that the body doesn’t reject the donated organs Test to diagnose early cancer You will be placed on a waiting list to receive a deceased donor pancreas. Your name and blood test results will be placed on the United Network for Organ Sharing’s national list. During the wait, follow these steps:Follow a diet recommended by the doctor.Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption.Keep a check on your weight in a range recommended by the physician.Take prescribed medicines. Follow a diet recommended by the doctor. Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption. Keep a check on your weight in a range recommended by the physician. Take prescribed medicines. A pancreas transplant is generally performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision down the center of the abdomen. Next, the surgeon places the donor pancreas on the lower right side of the abdomen attached to the nearby blood vessels. If the pancreas is taken from a deceased donor, then the surgeon removes the pancreas along with a small section of the small intestine. Whereas, if the pancreas is taken from a living donor, the surgeon takes a portion of the body and the tail of the pancreas. The recipient’s existing pancreas usually remains in their body. You have to stay in the hospital for three to seven days. You will need regular blood tests for one to two months. You may need to take several medications post-transplant."
What is pyloroplasty?,"'The pylorus is the lowermost part of the stomach, where it connects to the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum). Pyloroplasty is a surgical procedure to widen the pylorus by cutting and relaxing the pyloric sphincter muscle of the stomach.''The pyloric opening is controlled by the pyloric sphincter muscle, which acts as a valve. The pyloric sphincter relaxes to allow the food flow into the duodenum and contracts to prevent it from flowing back into the stomach.' "
What are the types of pyloroplasty?,"'Pyloroplasty may be performed using one of three techniques:''Alternatives to pyloroplasty are:' Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty: The pylorus is cut lengthwise to make it wider and then sutured across. This is the most commonly performed pyloroplasty procedure. Jaboulay pyloroplasty: The stomach is directly connected to the duodenum (gastroduodenostomy), but the pylorus is not incised. Finney pyloroplasty: A gastroduodenostomy is performed along with an incision of the pylorus. This method is rarely used. Chemical pyloroplasty: Botulinum toxin is injected into the pylorus making it relax. Pyloromyotomy: the muscle surrounding the pylorus is cut lengthwise. The pyloric tract becomes wider because it bulges through the opening in the muscle. Pyloric dilatation: the pylorus is dilated with a balloon passed through a flexible tube (endoscope) through the nose and upper digestive tract or through a tiny incision in the stomach wall (gastrotomy)."
Why is pyloroplasty performed?,"'Pyloroplasty is performed when normal function of the pylorus is affected due to disease, or as an adjunct to certain other gastric surgeries. Pyloroplasty is most commonly performed as a gastric drainage procedure along with a vagotomy (surgical severing of the part of the vagus nerve controlling the ''digestive system''). A vagotomy is performed as treatment for peptic ulcers.''In addition, a pyloroplasty may be performed to treat other conditions that affect the digestive system such as' Bleeding or perforated bleeding ulcers in the duodenum. Abnormally narrow pylorus (pyloric stenosis) Obstruction in the pylorus Pyloric atresia (congenital condition causing pyloric stenosis) Helicobacter pylori infection Vagus nerve damage Delayed emptying of stomach contents (gastroparesis) Diabetes"
What is the surgical procedure for pyloroplasty?,"'A general surgeon usually performs a pyloroplasty under general anesthesia. It may be performed as an open surgery with a large incision in the abdomen or a laparoscopic surgery, which is less invasive with several smaller incisions.' Prior to a pyloroplasty a patient Undergoes blood, urine and imaging tests. Must avoid eating or drinking 8 hours prior to the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Inform the doctor of any allergies. May undergo stomach pumping (gastric lavage) to clear residual gastric contents An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient will be intubated to provide oxygen. The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the abdomen depending on the type of surgery. The surgeon makes a 5 cm-long incision lengthwise starting from the lower stomach (antrum), along the pylorus up to the top part of the duodenum. The incision is stretched into a diamond shape to widen the pylorus. Part or all of the pyloric sphincter muscle may be removed. The pyloric incision is closed with sutures. The abdominal muscles and the incision are sutured. The patient is brought out of anesthesia and administered painkillers for post-surgical pain. The patient is monitored in the recovery room for a few hours. Most people will be able to go home after three to six days in the hospital, depending on the underlying conditions. Complete recovery may take up to six weeks, during which the patient must avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities."
What are the risks and complications of pyloroplasty?,"'As is common with any surgical procedure, pyloroplasty carries certain risks and complications, which include:''Complications of associated surgeries such as vagotomy or gastrectomy (removal of part of the stomach)''Gastric dumping syndrome due to the stomach contents emptying too fast into the intestine''Bile reflux and ''gastritis''Bowel blockage''Inflammation of the stomach lining'' (''peritonitis'')''Weight loss'' and ''fatigue''Infection and ''sepsis''Recurrence of gastric ulcers''Diarrhea'' and malnutrition' Anesthetic side effects such asHeadacheNauseaConfusion Headache Nausea Confusion Surgical risks such asWound infectionHemorrhageBlood clots Wound infection Hemorrhage Blood clots Injury to nearby organs, blood vessels or nerves Pneumonia Incisional hernia"
What is a carcinoid tumor?,'A carcinoid tumor is a rare ''cancer'' of the neuroendocrine system (a system of the nerve cells that also produces hormones in the body). It is usually a slow-growing tumor.''The tumor grows in the following organs:''“''Carcinoid syndrome''” is the advanced form of the carcinoid tumor. It is a term given for a set of symptoms that develop when the carcinoid tumor spreads to other organs and releases hormones such as serotonin that lead to hormonal imbalance.' Appendix (common) Bowels (common) Lungs (common) Stomach Pancreas Breast Kidney Ovaries Testicles 
What are the signs and symptoms of a carcinoid tumor?,"'The signs and symptoms produced by the tumor depend upon the organ on which the tumor has developed. As they are fair general, they can be easily mistaken for illnesses other than the tumor. Hence, the doctor will take your complete medical history and order various tests before diagnosing the carcinoid tumor.''It is also possible that you may have a carcinoid tumor with no signs and symptoms. For example, in a carcinoid tumor of the appendix, the doctor might discover it during surgery a such as removal of the appendix.''Abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and bleeding from the rectum''Cough, blood in the cough, breathlessness, chest pain, and fatigue''Stomach pain, weight loss, tiredness, and weakness' "
What causes carcinoid tumors?,"'Doctors do not know the exact cause of carcinoid tumors. However, they have found out some factors that may increase your chances of developing one. These include:' Having a close family member with a carcinoid tumor Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) Having parents with any of the following cancers:Squamous cell skin cancerNon-Hodgkin's lymphomaCancer of the brain, breast, liver, uterus, bladder, or kidney Squamous cell skin cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer of the brain, breast, liver, uterus, bladder, or kidney Neurofibromatosis (a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on the nerve tissue) Tuberous sclerosis (a rare, multisystem genetic disease that causes tumors or growths in organs)"
Can second cancers develop after carcinoid tumor treatment?,"'Unfortunately, you may develop other cancers (known as secondary cancers) unrelated to the carcinoid tumor even after you get treated for the carcinoid tumor.\xa0''As a survivor of a lung carcinoid tumor, you have a higher risk of''A carcinoid tumor of the digestive system puts you at a higher risk of' prostate cancer and breast cancer. prostate cancer, melanoma, female breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer."
Can you lower your risk of second cancer?,"'A step like quitting tobacco certainly helps in lowering the risk of secondary cancer after treatment for a carcinoid tumor. This is true not only for lung carcinoid tumors specifically but also for carcinoid tumors in other organs.''To help maintain good health, you, as a carcinoid survivor, need to' Keep your weight under check. Stay physically active every day. Consume a healthy diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods, fatty foods, and sugar. Restrict the consumption of alcoholic drinks (one drink per day for women or two per day for men)."
What is hydrocephalus?,"'Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ''cavities'' deep within the brain. The extra fluids cause the ''cavities'' to swell, exerting pressure on the adjacent brain tissues. CSF is a colorless fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The functions of CSF include:''The body, on average, produces one pint of CSF and absorbs it completely; however, a hindrance to the normal flow of CSF and its absorption can result in a buildup of CSF. The extra pressure generated can keep the brain from proper functioning, leading to ''brain damage'' and even death.''There are two major types of hydrocephalus:''Two additional types of hydrocephalus include:''Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo: ''It results from brain damage caused by a ''stroke'' or an injury.''Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): ''It can occur due to' It protects and cushions the brain and spine It acts as a shock absorber It transports the essential nutrients to the brain and spinal cord It regulates changes in pressure within the brain Communicating hydrocephalus: In this type, the flow of CSF is blocked after it exits the cavities or ventricles. Non-communicating hydrocephalus: In this type, the flow of CSF is blocked along one or more passages connecting the ventricles. Bleeding in the brain’s CSF. Head trauma. Infection. Tumor. Complications of surgery."
What are the symptoms of hydrocephalus?,"'The symptoms of hydrocephalus differ from person to person and mainly depend on age. Hydrocephalus commonly affects infants and people aged above 60 years. Symptoms in infants include:''Symptoms in older children, young adults, and middle-aged adults include:''Symptoms in older adults include:' An immediate increase in the head size An abnormally large head A lump on the fontanel (soft spot) on top of the head Vomiting Problems sucking or feeding Sleepiness Irritability Seizures Eyes that are fixed downward Headache Hazy or double vision Nausea or vomiting Problems with balance Problems with vision Poor coordination Sleepiness Difficulty remaining awake or waking up Irritability Personality changes Gait difficulty Mental impairment and dementia Slow movements Poor coordination/balance Loss of bladder control"
How is hydrocephalus treated?,"'The treatment of hydrocephalus includes one of these surgical options:''Similarly, a choroid plexus cauterization uses an electric current to ''burn'' the CSF-producing tissue to produce less CSF.' Placement of shunt or a tube into the brain to drain the excess fluid into either the chest cavity or abdomen where it gets absorbed Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a procedure, where the physician makes a hole in the lower third of the ventricles to divert the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and relieve pressure"
What are the types of non-small cell lung cancer?,"'There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Each type of NSCLC has a different type of\xa0cancer\xa0cells that grows and spreads in different ways:' Squamous cell carcinoma or epidermoid carcinoma: Cancer forms in the flat, thin cells forming the inner lining of the lungs. Large cell carcinoma: Cancer that arises from several types of large cells in the lungs. Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that arises from the cells that produce mucus. They are present in the lining of the alveoli. Other rare types of NSCLC: Include carcinoid tumor, pleomorphic tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma."
What causes non-small cell lung cancer?,"'Risk factors for lung cancer include the following:' Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer. Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars currently or in the past significantly increases the risk of lung cancer. The earlier the age of onset of smoking and the longer the years of smoking, the higher the risk of lung cancer. When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is further increased. Being exposed to passive smoking (second-hand smoke) also significantly increases the risk of lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace increases the risk of lung cancer. Being exposed to radiation as a result of radiation therapy to the breast or chest in the work place or atomic bomb radiation increases the risk of lung cancer. Living where there is high air pollution is a risk factor for lung cancer. A family history of lung cancer is a major factor. Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a risk factor for lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer increases with age."
What are the signs and symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer?,"'In many cases, lung cancer does not cause any\xa0signs\xa0or\xa0symptoms till cancer reaches advanced stages. It may be found incidentally during a routine\xa0''chest X-ray'' or an X-ray\xa0done for another\xa0condition. Hence, if one has risk factors for lung cancer, they are advised to consult a doctor regularly to undergo screening tests to make a diagnosis early, hence increasing the chances of survival.

What causes retinoblastoma?,"'Retinoblastoma occurs when there are genetic mutations in the nerve cells in the retina. The mutations cause the cells in the retina to grow and multiply rapidly. These cells accumulate forming a tumor. Retinoblastoma cells can invade into the eye and destroy the structure of the eye. The structures around the eye get damaged by the tumor. The tumor can spread to other parts of the body (''metastasis'"") and can involve the brain and spine. The exact cause of the genetic mutations causing retinoblastoma is unknown, but it's most likely to be ""'inherited''.''Hereditary retinoblastoma is an autosomal dominant ''genetic disorder'"" that is inherited. This means either one of the parents needs to pass on only a single copy of the mutated gene to the child to increase the risk of retinoblastoma in the child. If anyone of the parents carries a mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that the child will be inheriting the gene. Though the genetic mutation increases a child's risk of retinoblastoma, it does not mean the child would definitely develop ""'cancer''. Hereditary retinoblastoma usually occurs in both eyes. Children who inherit hereditary retinoblastoma may be at risk of developing other ''cancers''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma?,"'Since retinoblastoma usually affects infants and small children, they are usually unable to explain their symptoms. The following signs in the child can indicate retinoblastoma:' White color in the pupil (the dark circular portion within the iris or the colored part of the eye) when light is shone over the eye or while taking a flash photograph. The eyes appear to be looking in different directions Redness of the eye Swelling of the eye"
How is retinoblastoma treated?,"'The treatments of retinoblastoma depend on the size, location, and extent of the tumor, as well as the overall health of patients and their preferences. Treatment options include:''Chemotherapy'':'' Chemotherapy is a medical treatment that uses medication to kill cancer cells. They may be taken orally or intravenously. Chemotherapy is also beneficial for tumors that have spread beyond the eyeball or to other parts of the body. Intravitreal chemotherapy is a type of chemotherapy where the medications are directly injected into the eyes.''Radiation therapy'': ''Radiation'' therapy involved using high-energy radiation beams, such as ''X-rays'' and protons, to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor.''Laser photocoagulation or laser photocoagulation:'' In laser therapy, a laser is used to destroy blood vessels. This ''cuts'' off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor, killing the tumor cells.''Cold treatments'' (''cryotherapy''):'' Cryotherapy involves using substances, such as liquid nitrogen, at an extremely low temperature to freeze and thaw the cancer cells repeatedly to kill cancer cells.''Surgery: ''Large tumors that can’t be treated by other methods require surgery. Surgery for retinoblastoma includes:' Enucleation: This surgery involves the removal of the affected eyeball. Part of the optic nerve, which is the nerve extending from the back of the eye and into the brain, is also removed. Surgery to place an eye implant: Immediately after enucleation surgery, the surgeon places a special implant made of plastic or other materials in the eye socket. The eye implant is connected to the muscles around the eye that control eye movement. The implant does not provide vision but moves like a natural eye. Fitting an artificial eye: A few weeks after surgery and as the eye heals, a custom-made artificial eye is placed over the eye implant, which matches the healthy eye. The artificial eye is clipped onto the eye implant. The artificial eye moves like the natural eye. Vision is not restored but most children adapt to having vision in only one eye, without any significant discomfort."
What is Turner syndrome?,"'Turner’s syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females. The disorder is characterized by the partial or complete loss of one of the second sex chromosomes (XX). The symptoms of Turner syndrome vary from women to women. Women with Turner syndrome can develop a wide variety of symptoms that affect various organs. Most women with Turner syndrome have ''short stature'' and are ''infertile''. They may have some developmental delays, ''learning disabilities'', and behavioral problems.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome?,"'The symptoms and its intensity are quite variable from one person to another. Many symptoms develop slowly over time and can be subtle. Girls with Turner syndrome may have swollen hands and ''feet'' at birth due to a condition known as ''lymphedema''. The symptoms of Turner syndrome include:' Short stature that is evident by the age of 5 Middle ear infections in early childhood and subsequent hearing loss Developmental delays Delayed puberty Infertility Wide, webbed neck Low or indistinct hairline in the back of the head Broad chest and widely spaced nipples Arms that turn out slightly at the elbow Heart murmur Scoliosis (curving of the spine) Kidney problems Underactive thyroid gland Osteoporosis (thinning of bone) Increased risk to develop diabetes Early menopause Delayed bone maturation Anxiety High liver enzymes Fatty infiltration of the liver High blood pressure Retrognathia (a receding chin) Obesity Alopecia (hair loss) Ptosis (drooping eyelid) Vitiligo (blotchy loss of skin color) Heart attack Elevated lipids in the blood Depression Atrial septal defect (opening in the wall separating the top two chambers of the heart) Abnormal fingernails Thick skin folds of the neck"
What causes Turner syndrome?,"'Normally, females have two full X chromosomes in each of her cells whereas women with Turner syndrome have one normal X chromosome and one missing X chromosome in either all cells of the body or some cells of the body. The missing genetic material affects development before and after birth. Depending on the specific genes that are missing, the features of Turner syndrome may or may not be present. Turner syndrome is not ''inherited'' and occurs due to a random abnormality that happens during the formation of an egg or sperm cell in a parent (before ''conception'').' "
How is Turner syndrome treated?,"'The approved medication for Turner syndrome is Somatropin (rDNA) or growth hormone, mainly given through injection. The various brands of Somatropin (rDNA) include:''Estrogen therapy may be recommended to initiate sexual development.' Humatrope Nutropin AQ"
What is septic arthritis?,"'Septic arthritis'' (or ''infectious arthritis'') is the infection of the joints caused by bacteria or ''viruses''. This results in the inflammation of the synovial fluid that surrounds and lubricates the joints. Normally, the synovial fluid is free from microbes, but in ''septic arthritis'', there may be a presence of microbes.''Septic ''arthritis'' usually affects single joints and can affect individuals of all ages. The complications of septic arthritis are as follows:' Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) Fibrous ankylosis (stiffening of the joints due to formation of fibrous bands) Sepsis (severe life-threatening infection) Death"
What is the treatment for septic arthritis?,'Surgical drainage of the septic joint is the treatment for septic arthritis. Drainage method includes the following:''Indications for surgical drainage in patients are as follows:''Surgical drainage should be avoided in patients with ''bleeding disorders'' and those who are on ''anticoagulants''.' Needle aspiration (removing the infectious discharge via a syringe) Tidal irrigation (repeated distention and irrigation of the joint with saline under local anesthesia through a needle) Arthroscopy (if the arthritis is longer than seven days) Arthrotomy (creating an opening in the joint that is used for drainage) Purulent arthritis (pus-filled arthritis) Any underlying joint disease Failure to respond to antibiotics and multiple aspirations Septic arthritis affecting the shoulder Suppressed immunity Infection with an enlarged mass
How is surgical drainage performed?," This technique involves a needle and syringe to drain the synovial fluid.  The surgeon injects the needle to drain the synovial fluid.  After draining the synovial fluid, it is analyzed to identify the presence of microbes.  Needle aspiration can be useful as a treatment too.  This procedure is useful in draining the fluid from the ankles. This technique involves inserting a special pencil-thin instrument through a key-hole incision. The surgeon may also use a tool known as an arthroscope that has a light and camera to view the joints.  This procedure is useful in draining the fluid from the knees, ankles and shoulders. This technique involves the creation of an opening in a joint to drain the fluid. It is reserved for microbes deeply rooted in the joints.  It is especially useful in draining the fluid from the shoulders and hips.  Arthrotomy is the superior choice for septic arthritis of the shoulder. "
What about recovery after surgical drainage?,"'The patient may experience some ''pain'' after the surgery, for which the physician prescribes ''pain'' medications. The physician may also prescribe blood thinners to prevent ''blood clots''. The patient may require crutches or a splint for support during the recovery period.''In the recovery period from a surgical drainage, the patient should perform exercises to increase the flexibility and strength of the joint.' "
What are the complications of surgical drainage?,'The major complication of surgical drainage is infection. Clearing the infection immediately is necessary to preserve the joints. Long-standing infection can lead to joint destruction.' 
How does someone get a widowmaker heart attack?,"'Any ''heart attack'' can be grave. A ''widowmaker'' is a type of ''heart'' attack, which is deadlier than most others.''A widowmaker heart attack occurs when the left ascending artery (LAD) that supplies blood to the front part of the heart (largest part) is clogged-up because of clots in the arterial wall. As a result, there is no blood flow to a major portion of the heart, which results in deprivation of oxygen. This causes the death of heart muscle in this area, medically termed ''myocardial infarction''. Because a significant portion of the heart is affected, this can seriously affect the ''heart function'' and can be fatal.''Factors increasing the risk of widowmaker heart attack are:''Lifestyle modifications for high-risk patients can help to prevent ''heart attacks''.' Tobacco smoking High blood pressure and cholesterol Uncontrolled diabetes Having relatives who had a heart attack Obesity Lack of physical activity Men older than 45 years and females older than 55 years are at high risk Family history of heart disease Consumption of unhealthy foods"
How do you know if you have a widowmaker heart attack or a regular heart attack?,"'It is difficult to differentiate between a regular heart attack and the widowmaker heart attack because the symptoms are similar. However, the most common symptoms are:' Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness or fullness in the center of the chest Upper body pain or discomfort that involves the arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach Shortness of breath Nausea Lightheadedness Cold sweat Tiredness Flu-like symptoms"
How is a widowmaker heart attack treated?,"'Because the widowmaker damages a major portion of the heart, timely management is necessary to prevent fatalities. Restoring the blood flow within 90 minutes of the start of the heart attack is crucial to prevent any permanent damage. In the emergency room, patients might receive ''aspirin'' and nitroglycerine to prevent blood clotting and improve blood flow.''The physician might consider either a bypass surgery (''coronary artery bypass graft'') or an ''angioplasty'' to treat a widowmaker.''In the bypass surgery, a healthy blood vessel (artery graft) is taken from the leg, arm or chest and placed in the heart as a bypass around the blocked artery. During an angioplasty a catheter is passed through a small cut made on the leg. A tiny balloon attached to the catheter is blown up and pushed through the blockage. Sometimes this is followed by placement of a permanent tube (''stent'') to keep the blocked area open.''Complications of these surgeries include:''Patients may be hospitalized for another five to seven days after the surgery. It requires three months to fully recover from the surgery.' Bleeding Infection Blood clots Memory loss Abnormal heart rhythms Kidney problem Heart attack Stroke Damage to coronary artery"
What are the chances of surviving a widowmaker heart attack?,'Removing the blockage prevents the complications of a widowmaker heart attack. The goal is to restore blood flow to the heart muscle immediately. The chances of survival have improved with advanced technologies.' 
What is therapeutic hypnosis?,"'Therapeutic hypnosis (hypnotherapy) is a technique used by some psychotherapists to induce a trance-like state of mind that becomes more open to suggestions from the therapist. The technique uses focused attention, intense concentration and relaxation to help people overcome certain psychological conditions.''Hypnotherapy is a type of alternative medicine and is not a definitive treatment. It is usually complementary to mainstream treatments of medication and psychological counselling. Hypnotherapy is performed only for people who are willing to undergo such treatment.' "
What is hypnosis?,"'Hypnosis is a heightened state of awareness brought about by intense concentration and complete relaxation. While in a hypnotic state, a person is not asleep, but is in an altered state of consciousness that allows them to talk to the therapist without reservations.' "
What is the purpose of hypnotherapy?,"'The purpose of hypnotherapy is to help a person understand and manage their psychological, physical and emotional behavior. The goal of hypnotherapy is to bring about positive changes in a person’s mental state and behavior by making suggestions while they are in hypnosis.''Hypnotherapy may help a person to''Though cognitive ''behavior therapy'' and medication are the first-line treatments for psychological conditions, hypnotherapy can be used in managing and alleviating several conditions that include:' Overcome addictive behaviors, anxiety and phobias. Safely explore the mind to address deep-rooted trauma and discover ways to cope with it better. Generalized anxiety disorder: Persistent and excessive worry about everyday life. Hypnotherapy can help reduce the anxiety and stress, which may result in reduced dependency on medication. Phobias: Unreasoning and excessive fear about something specific or social. Hypnotherapy can bring about a more tranquil state of mind and may help overcome the fear. Weight loss: Hypnotherapy along with cognitive behavior therapy can have an effect in modifying eating habits and helping with weight loss. Addictive behavior: Suggestion with hypnotherapy may help patients give up smoking and other harmful substance or behavior addictions. Chronic pain relief: While hypnotherapy cannot get rid of pain, it may help some people change their response to pain and reduce their need for opioids. Irritable bowel syndrome: Hypnotherapy has been found to help alleviate symptoms when conventional treatments with diet and medication are not sufficiently effective. Skin conditions: Hypnotherapy is found to be helpful with skin conditions such as alopecia areata and psoriasis, by alleviating stress. Depression: Hypnotherapy can help reduce depression by encouraging more positive thinking. Sleep disorders: Hypnotherapy may help calm the mind and improve sleep patterns. Posttraumatic stress disorder: Hypnotherapy helps a person unwind and talk to the therapist about past trauma, which may help in coping with it better. Palliative care: Hypnotherapy as palliative care has been found useful in reducing symptoms in terminally ill patients, and stress in their caregivers."
Does hypnotherapy really work?,'Hypnotherapy may not prove useful to everyone. Hypnotherapy is found to be effective in people who are more responsive to suggestions from the hypnotherapist.

What is a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) surgery?,"'Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)'' is a procedure to repair the major blood vessel in the body called the ''aorta''. It is a minimally invasive procedure in which a small incision is made for repairing the aorta.\xa0''The aorta is the main artery of the body that exits the ''heart'' and carries blood to the rest of the body. After leaving the heart, it branches to the arms and brain before passing down the back of the chest (thoracic aorta) and into the belly (abdominal aorta). In the abdomen, the aorta forks at the level of the ''belly button'' into branches that go down each leg.''When there is an abnormal bulge in a weakened wall of the aorta in the chest area, the condition is called a thoracic ''aortic aneurysm''. ''A thoracic aortic ''aneurysm'' can cause various symptoms and often life-threatening complications.\xa0''Other conditions that may affect the aorta are tears (dissection), rupture (transection) and narrowing (stenosis) of the aorta. For the surgical repair of these conditions, especially a thoracic aortic ''aneurysm'', TEVAR may be performed.\xa0' In this procedure, surgeons place a device, known as a stent graft, through a small incision in the groin.  The stent is generally made of a fabric-covered metal mesh that is placed under X-ray guidance.  The stent graft expands to fit against the walls of the aorta on either side of the aneurysm. The blood flows through the stent graft, avoiding the aneurysm that typically shrinks over time as the blood pressure is diverted away from the aneurysm.  This repairs the diseased aorta and helps to keep it open (patent) to allow blood to flow properly to the rest of the body."
Who needs thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)?,'The indications for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) are as follows:' Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm: TEVAR is performed in people with a thoracic aneurysm that has not ruptured and is 5 cm or more in size. Complicated descending thoracic aortic dissection Focal penetrating ulcer in the thoracic aorta Aortic injury or trauma
Is a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) surgery better than open repair?,"'Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a better approach than the conventional open surgery in many cases because it is a minimally invasive surgery wherein a small groin incision is made unlike the open repair surgery for the aorta, which requires a large incision through the breastbone or side of the chest.\xa0''This makes TEVAR a less painful and safer alternative with fewer complications than the open repair of the aorta. In some people, however, who have extensive aortic or multiple aneurysms, the best approach may require a combination of TEVAR and open surgery. This is called a hybrid approach.' "
What are the risks of a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) surgery?,"'As with any surgical procedure, certain complications may arise in a thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) surgery such as:' Bleeding Endoleak (leaking of blood around the graft) Displacement of the graft away from its initial placement Stent fracturing Infections Delayed rupture of the aneurysm Stroke Paralysis Blood vessel injury"
What Is Thoracoscopic Wedge Resection?,"'Thoracoscopic wedge resection is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that involves a small surgical cut (incision) for the removal of a small, wedge-shaped piece of the lung tissue. This surgery is used for removing a small ''tumor'' or to diagnose lung conditions.\xa0''In this surgery, a thin flexible tube-like device, called a thoracoscope, is inserted through a small incision in the patient’s chest. The thoracoscope carries a tiny camera that helps the surgeon to visualize the inside of the chest and operate without performing a big incision or spreading the ribs. The wedge can be sent for lab examination to diagnose the disease condition. The procedure is also called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).''Certain medical conditions, such as lung ''cancers'', may require a part of the ''lungs'' to be removed to limit the spread of ''cancer'' in the body. The lungs are divided into segments based upon certain anatomical criteria such as different blood supply.\xa0''In lung segmentectomy surgery, these anatomic criteria are considered to resect or remove a lung segment. In wedge resection, however, nonanatomic lung resection is performed to remove a wedge of the lungs. Removing a small diseased portion of the lungs is a great approach because it preserves most of the functional lungs. This is only possible when the disease is confined to a small part of the lungs.\xa0''Thoracoscopic wedge resection is an ideal procedure for the treatment of lung cancers that require the removal of small lesions of ''cancer'' cells (lung nodules). The procedure is not advised if the tumor cells are not embedded deep within the lung tissue.\xa0''A thoracoscopic wedge resection surgery is also preferred for patients who cannot tolerate a major surgery or for removing a large-sized section of the lungs, such as a lobe (lobectomy), when there may be a significant decrease in lung function. The procedure is used for both the diagnosis and treatment of many cancers and noncancer lung conditions.' "
Is thoracoscopic wedge resection safe?,'Thoracoscopic wedge resection involves a small incision and is safer than conventional open surgery. The procedure is relatively safe even in high-risk patients such as elderly individuals and those with long-term ''heart'' or lung conditions. The procedure removes a minimal lung tissue resulting in earlier recovery and fewer postoperative complications than conventional procedures on the lungs.' 
How long does thoracoscopic wedge resection take?,"'The duration of the thoracoscopic wedge resection surgery depends on many factors such as the extent or severity of the disease and the location of the diseased part of the lung (lesion) to be removed. The surgery can usually take three to four hours, but the patient may ask the doctor about the duration of their surgery because the doctor can guide them more accurately.' "
What are the complications of thoracoscopic wedge resection?,"'Although a thoracoscopic wedge resection surgery is a safe and reliable procedure, particularly useful for lesions at the lung periphery or small lesions at the outer one-third of the lung, it may have some complications:' Pain Bleeding Infections Injury to the muscles, nerves, or blood vessels Delayed or nonhealing wound Wound dehiscence (a condition in which the wound gives way or opens up) Hoarseness of voice due to anesthesia Arrhythmias (irregular or abnormal heart rhythm) Angina (chest pain due to decreased blood supply to the heart) Hemothorax (bleeding inside the chest) Persistent air leak Subcutaneous emphysema (entrapment of air under the skin) Pneumonia Scarring of lungs Bronchopleural fistula (abnormal communication between the large airways in the lungs, called the bronchi, and space between the membranes that line the lungs, called the pleural cavity) Local and thoracoscope port-site recurrence of cancer "
What is tip rhinoplasty?,"'Tip ''rhinoplasty'' is a surgical procedure of the tip of the nose to improve nasal function by repairing an existing defect or to enhance the appearance.''Typically, tip rhinoplasty involves modification of cartilage of the tip of the nose, including excision (removal), dissection (cutting), repositioning, or augmentation to create the desired outcome.' "
Why is tip rhinoplasty done?,"'Tip rhinoplasty may be done in the following instances:''How to prepare for tip rhinoplasty' A bulging nasal tip For lengthening or shortening the nose by restructuring the nose tip “Parrot beak” or hooked nose tip Change in nose tip projection Narrowing the nasal tip Your surgeon will review your general health and underlying disease conditions. Discuss with your surgeon the goals, outcomes, and risks of the procedure. Your surgeon will examine and measure your face, especially the nose. Detail your previous medical and medication history especially, drug allergies and previous surgeries. Your surgeon may take some photographs. You should be prepared emotionally and psychologically with rational expectations. Your surgeon might recommend another nose repair surgery (rhinoplasty), based on the desired outcome."
What are the different stages of tip rhinoplasty?,"'Primary Rhinoplasty:''In this stage, the tip cartilage is modified by partial excision, dissection, repositioning, and augmentation to form a supportive framework.''Rhinoplasty is performed with general or local anesthesia to make you unconscious or numb throughout the procedure.''Tip rhinoplasty may be performed by:''Once the surgeon makes an incision, defects are corrected and the incision is closed.''Secondary Rhinoplasty:''Secondary rhinoplasty is performed when the result of primary rhinoplasty requires further improvement.''A splint or tape is used to fix the position of the nasal bones and cartilages for one week. The patient is monitored for about 6 to 12 months.' Closed technique: In this technique the surgeon makes an incision inside the nose. Open technique: In this technique the surgeon makes an incision across the columella (narrow strip of tissue between the nostrils)."
What to expect from tip rhinoplasty?,"'Because this is a less invasive procedure, serious side effects are rare.\xa0Infection and numbness can occur but are very unusual. Most patients have a satisfying result.' "
What is a knee joint?,"'The knee is the largest joint in the body that consists of the following:''The ends of these three bones are covered with a smooth substance called the articular cartilage that protects the bones and enables joint movement. All surfaces of the knee are covered by a thin lining called the synovial membrane.\xa0''This membrane releases a fluid that lubricates the cartilage, reducing friction to nearly zero in a healthy knee. Normally, all these components work in harmony. However, a disease or an injury can disrupt this harmony, resulting in ''pain'', muscle ''weakness'', and reduced function.' Femur (lower end of the thighbone) Tibia (the upper end of the shinbone)  Patella (the kneecap)"
What is total knee arthroplasty?,"'If an individual’s knee is severely damaged by ''joint swelling'' or an injury, it may be hard for them to perform simple activities such as ''walking'' or climbing stairs. They may even begin to feel ''pain'' when they are sitting or lying down.''If nonsurgical treatments, such as medications and using walking supports, are no longer helpful, the patient may consider a surgical procedure called a ''total knee replacement'' surgery or total knee arthroplasty (TKA).''Joint replacement surgery is a safe and effective procedure to relieve pain, correct leg deformity, and help the individual resume normal activities. In this procedure, the diseased or injured ''knee joint'' is replaced with artificial material.' "
When does an individual require total knee joint replacement?,"'Most patients who undergo total ''knee replacement'' are between 50 and 80 years old. The total knee replacement surgery is considered for patients whose knee joints have been damaged by below conditions:' Osteoarthritis: It is a degenerative joint disease. Patients with this condition are unable to do normal activities due to severe pain. The knee may swell or ""give way"" because the joint is not stable. It is the most common cause of total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Rheumatoid arthritis: This is a disease in which the synovial membrane that surrounds the joint becomes swollen and thickened. This severe swelling can damage the cartilage and eventually cause pain and stiffness. It is the most common form of a group of disorders termed ""inflammatory arthritis."" Severe injury to the knee. Knee joint deformity by birth."
What is replaced in total knee arthroplasty?,"'The artificial components of a total knee replacement are referred to as a prosthesis.' During total knee replacement, the end of the femur bone is removed and replaced with a metal shell. The end of the tibia (lower leg bone) is also removed and replaced with a channeled plastic piece with a metal stem. Depending on the condition of the kneecap portion of the knee joint, a plastic ""button"" may also be added under the kneecap surface. The posterior cruciate ligament is a tissue that normally stabilizes each side of the knee joint so that the lower leg cannot slide backward to the thighbone. In the total knee replacement surgery, this ligament is retained, sacrificed, or substituted by a polyethylene post."
What happens during total knee arthroplasty?,"'Total knee arthroplasty (TKA)'' is major surgery and usually performed under general or spinal anesthesia. Usually, the surgery is completed within three hours, depending upon the patient’s condition.' The surgeon monitors the patient’s vitals throughout the procedure. The surgeon cleanses the skin over the surgical site with an antiseptic solution. The orthopedic surgeon will make an incision in the knee area. The surgeon may remove the damaged surfaces of the knee joint and resurface the knee joint with the prosthesis. The prosthesis generally comprises three components: the tibial component (to resurface the top of the tibia or shin bone), the femoral (thigh bone) component (to resurface the end of the thighbone), and the patellar component (to resurface the bottom of the kneecap that rubs against the thighbone). The surgeon closes the incision with stitches or surgical staples. The surgeon may place a drain in the incision site to remove the fluid. The surgeon will apply a sterile bandage or dressing. The patient may be on painkillers and antibiotics. They will be monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) until they wake up from anesthesia. Depending on the patient’s condition, they may be shifted to the hospital room later."
What are the risks of total knee arthroplasty?,"'Some possible complications of total knee arthroplasty may include the following:' Bleeding Infection Blood clots in the legs or lungs Loosening or wearing out of the prosthesis Fracture Continued pain or stiffness Nerves or blood vessels in the area of surgery may be injured, resulting in weakness or numbness. The joint pain may not be relieved by the surgery."
What is tracheobronchial sleeve resection?,"'Tracheobronchial sleeve resection or a sleeve lobectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a lobe of the ''lungs'' and part of the bronchi (''airway'') usually to eliminate a cancerous or aggressive ''tumor''.\xa0''In this procedure, the ends of the bronchus are rejoined, and any remaining lobes are reattached to the bronchus. This surgery is performed to save a part and function of the lungs. This procedure is usually done for non-small-cell ''lung cancer''.' "
What are the different types of lung cancers?,"'Lung ''cancers'' are broadly divided into two types depending on the affected cells and size of the ''cancer'':''Tracheobronchial sleeve resection is recommended when an individual has a central lung tumor that has moved to the airway but has not invaded the ''lymph nodes'' or other parts of the lungs.' Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC): This type is aggressive cancer and comprises about 20% of lung cancers. SCLC metastasizes rapidly into many sites within the body and are most often discovered after they have spread extensively.  Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC): These are the most common lung cancers, accounting for about 80% of all lung cancers."
What happens during a tracheobronchial sleeve resection procedure?,"'A tracheobronchial sleeve resection procedure is a major surgery and usually performed under general anesthesia. The procedure is usually completed within 120 minutes. On rare occasions, additional time would be required to complete the procedure.\xa0' The surgeon monitors the patient’s vitals during the procedure once the anesthesia kicks in. The surgeon usually cleans the chest area with an antiseptic solution and marks the area for an incision. Once the incision is made, the surgeon reaches to the diseased area of the lungs.  During the procedure, the surgeon will remove a lobe of the lungs in addition to part of the airway that sends air to the lobe.  The surgeon will then reconnect the airway to the remaining lobe after removing the affected part.  The goal of a sleeve lobectomy is to remove the cancerous tissue and preserve the function of the lungs. Once the cancerous lobe is removed and airway lobes are connected, bleeding is stopped, and the surgeon sutures the incisions. The patient may have few tubes on the chest to drain the blood and secretions. The tube is usually removed after a few days. "
What are the risks associated with tracheo-bronchial sleeve resection?,'Tracheo-bronchial sleeve resection is a complicated and risky procedure due to the following complications:' Severe bleeding Respiratory failure Shortness of breath Pulmonary embolism (air in the lungs) Heart attack Sudden death Need for a total lung removal Pneumonia (infection in the lungs) Shock Abnormal heart rhythms Reduced blood flow to the heart
What is the recovery period after tracheobronchial sleeve resection?,"'Tracheobronchial sleeve resection has a quick recovery period compared with other major surgeries. Patients are usually discharged after 10 days of the procedure. Most of the patients recover within 45-60 days after the discharge. The doctor may recommend a ''nutrition'' ''diet'' with ''breathing'' exercises. The patient may also be on painkillers and antibiotics for a few days. Usually, patients can get back to their normal life after 60 days.' "
What is the outcome of tracheobronchial sleeve resection?,"'Tracheobronchial sleeve resection is less risky than other surgeries of lung cancers. Patients typically experience fewer complications and have an improved quality of life because they can breathe better.\xa0''Moreover, the death rate is lower than that in other lung cancer procedures. This procedure is usually considered to save lung function and increase the life expectancy of patients.' "
What is transmetatarsal amputation?,'Transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) involves surgical removal of a part of the foot that includes the ''metatarsals''. Metatarsals are the five bones located between the ankle and toes in each foot.''TMA is a relatively common operation performed to treat a severely infected foot or a foot with lack of oxygen supply (ischemic). Surgeons resort to this type of surgery when all other nonsurgical options to save the foot or limb have failed. Removing the infected part prevents the infection from spreading to the other parts of the limb and thus saves the limb in the long run.' 
When is transmetatarsal amputation needed?,'Transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) is required to stop further loss of tissue from the foot that is damaged because of the following conditions:' Chronic forefoot ulceration Forefoot gangrene (tissue death due to lack of blood flow)  Combination of above two complicated by diabetes Severely crushed forefoot due to a major accident
How is transmetatarsal amputation performed?," The patient will be admitted the night before the surgery and will not be allowed to eat or drink anything 12 hours before the surgery. Necessary medicines, as advised by the doctor, can be taken with few sips of water. The surgeon may give general anesthesia to the patient to keep them asleep and free from pain. Alternatively, they will give a spinal anesthesia to the patient to numb the surgery area.  First, the surgeon will make several incisions (cuts) on the patient’s forefoot.  The surgeon will cut and remove any damaged or infected bones.  Next, the surgeon will cut all the nerves, blood vessels, and tendons.  If the infection is severe, the surgeon will pack the surgical wound with sterile bandages and keep it open to heal. Or, the surgeon will close the wound with sutures or staples.  The surgeon may place a skin graft from a donor or another part of the patient’s body to cover the wound.  The surgeon may clip the wound and attach it to the drains to remove the extra blood and fluid discharge.  The surgeon will clean the wound with a sterile solution and then apply a bandage. The patient will be shifted to the general ward and observed for several hours. Antibiotics and analgesics will be initiated. Intravenous (IV) fluids will be continued. The bandage will be removed usually on the third day, healing of the wound will be checked, and the wound will be cleaned and bandaged again. The patient will be discharged after a hospital stay of 5-14 days."
What are the complications of transmetatarsal amputation?,"'Every surgery carries some complications. Transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) is a high-risk surgery with possible complications such as the following:' Need for further amputation: Infection of structures adjacent to the wound may damage the limb further, and amputation may be required. Wound infection: Diseases, such as diabetes, increase the likelihood of a wound infection. Delayed healing: Co-existing conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, may hamper the healing. Nonhealing wound Heterotopic ossification: This is an abnormal growth of the bone in other tissues such as muscle and tendons. Joint contracture: It is the restricted movement of the joint closest to the part that is amputated. Phantom sensation and phantom pain: This is the feeling that the amputated part is still there, and it is painful. Blood clot in the legs Blood clot in the lungs"
How long does it take to recover from transmetatarsal amputation?,"'If the patient has ''diabetes'', they will have to ask their doctor about diabetic foot care.''The patient needs to wear a splint, boots, or special shoes, such as customized footwear (e.g., steel implants in the soles of shoes), to support the remaining part of their foot.\xa0''The patient needs to lie down and raise their leg to a level above the ''heart'' to alleviate the swelling. After the pain and swelling subside, they will need a physical therapist to learn a few exercises to resume mobility and strength in the operated foot.\xa0''Ideally, the wound should heal completely in approximately four to eight weeks. After the wound healing, the patient can opt for an artificial foot.''The switchover from one’s own foot to an artificial foot may cause mental distress for the patient, and adjusting to this new change in life can be a long process. Hence, during this phase, professional counseling of the patient is essential.' "
What are flaps in plastic surgery?,"'Flaps are skin and subcutaneous tissue with an intact blood supply moved to cover an adjacent tissue defect. They are used\xa0in reconstructive surgery (usually performed by ''plastic'' surgeons). The kind tissue injury or defect the surgeon aims to correct determines which of three different techniques they use\xa0''Many variations and modifications of transposition flaps exist. Similar to other flaps, transposition flaps may be further modified and adjusted to accommodate individual situations.' advancement flaps,  rotational flaps or  transposition flaps."
What is transposition flap surgery?,"'Transpositional flap surgery is a reconstructive surgery which uses transposition flaps. A transposition flap is a flap rotated to cover an intervening area of normal skin to be placed in its recipient site.\xa0''Transpositional flaps exploit skin elasticity at a site distant to the surgical defect and redirect the tension of closure, meaning the ''sutures'' or other closure techniques don’t pull the ''wound'' together at a weak part in the tissue. They are generally smaller and move more freely and are common in facial reconstruction.' "
What is rotational flap surgery?,'Rotation flaps are flaps in which the tissue is rotated on a pivot point to cover a primary defect. Rotation flaps fill one defect by creating another defect that may be closed with less tension.' 
What is advancement flap surgery?,'This reconstructive surgery uses flaps that involve advancement of adjacent tissue to cover a primary tissue defect.' 
What are the advantages of transposition flap surgery?,'Transpositional flap surgery' Accomplishes redistribution and redirection of tension. Tends to use smaller areas of tissue than advancement and rotation flaps. Results in more aesthetically pleasing scars that tend to be easy to hide.
What are the types of transposition flaps and their uses?,"'Many different types of transposition flaps exist, though the most used types include the following:' Classic rhombic flap to cover rhombus-shaped defects Modified rhombic flaps to close defects with acute angles  Banner-type flaps for closure of postsurgical defects of the nasal dorsum Tunneled transposition flap for closure of wide defects and preserving aesthetic appearance "
Who should not get transposition flap surgery?,'Transpositional flap surgery may not be an option for people who' Smoke Take aspirin or other anticoagulant medication Have systemic health conditions
What are the complications of transitional flap surgery?," Dehiscence: A cut made during the procedure separates or ruptures after it has been sutured. Flap necrosis (tissue death) due to excessive tension or postoperative infection Pincushioning, or the trapdoor phenomenon: The puffing up or out-pouching of a flap above the surrounding skin surface. Pincushioning may occur because of excess subcutaneous fat under the flap, fluid accumulation, oversized flaps, or a failure to establish contact between the undersurface of the flap and the recipient bed (lack of contact inhibition), which pushes up the flap center. excess subcutaneous fat under the flap,  fluid accumulation,  oversized flaps, or  a failure to establish contact between the undersurface of the flap and the recipient bed (lack of contact inhibition), which pushes up the flap center."

The patient is given general anesthesia to make them feel relaxed throughout the procedure. Next, the surgeon introduces an instrument known as a speculum into the vagina to visualize the interior of the vagina. The surgeon then makes an incision in the vaginal wall.  The surgeon inserts an endoscope (a long tube-like camera) through the incision and directs it further to visualize the appendix in the abdomen. Once the appendix is identified, the surgeon fills the abdominal cavity with air and cuts the appendix with the help of instruments inserted through the endoscope. The surgeon retrieves the appendix in a bag. Hemostasis (arresting of bleeding) is done. The surgeon then removes the appendix out of the vagina. The surgeon sutures the incision at the vagina. The patient is shifted to the general ward and observed for several hours after the surgery. A liquid diet can be started 12-24 hours after the surgery. Painkillers and antibiotics are initially given intravenously (IV) and later by mouth. After regular monitoring, the patient is discharged usually after one or two days.

What is treadmill stress testing?,"'Exercise'' ''stress'' testing is performed to determine how your ''heart'' responds to physical ''stress'' or exertion, such as ''exercise''. The test is known as stress test, ''treadmill stress test'', ''cardiac stress test'', exercise ''electrocardiogram'', treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress electrocardiogram (''ECG'').''During the treadmill stress test, your heart rate, ''blood pressure'', and electrocardiograph (ECG) are monitored while you walk fast on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bicycle.\xa0' "
When is treadmill stress testing used?,'Treadmill testing is used to' Check the capacity of your heart during periods of exertion Know if your chest pain is due to a heart problem See how well your heart medications are working Check the success of cardiac procedures such as angioplasty or bypass surgery that you have undergone for coronary heart disease To predict your risk of getting a heart attack Decide a customized and safe exercise program for you

You may be asked to hold them and told to carry them with you on the day of your test. If you are on a medicated inhaler, carry it with you on the day of your test. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes.  Remove all your valuables and leave them at home. "
How is treadmill stress testing done?," Your test will take place in the stress lab in front of a physician. Electrodes will be placed at different places on your chest. These are attached to an electrocardiograph (EKG) monitor that charts your heart’s electrical activity during the test. Before you start exercising, the technician will take your EKG, heart rate and blood pressure. Next, you will walk on the treadmill, the speed of which will be gradually increased until you feel exhausted. If you experience extreme shortness of breath, dizziness, light-headedness, arm or jaw pain or chest pain or discomfort, you need to inform your technician. The technician will stop the test if he sees any unusual change on the EKG monitor. After the test, you will walk slowly for a few minutes to cool down.  The entire visit will take approximately 60 minutes, whereas the exercise time is usually between 7 and 12 minutes."
What to expect after treadmill stress testing?,"'The results of your treadmill test can be positive, negative, or inconclusive, as outlined below.''Cardiologists will combine the results of a stress test with your medical history and complaints to confirm if you have ''heart disease''. If you have one, they can decide the further course of treatment for you.' Negative treadmill stress test: This is a normal test that suggests you are less likely to have a significant coronary artery disease (more than 70% block in the coronary arteries). Positive treadmill stress test: This result implies that you may have significant coronary artery disease. This warrants further testing. Inconclusive treadmill stress test: You get this result when you cannot complete the test due to early exhaustion."
What does ALS do to your body?,"'ALS'' (akylosing spondylitis) belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases (MND). The disease causes gradual damage to the nerve cells (motor neurons).\xa0''Motor neurons extend from the brain to the spinal cord and to muscles throughout the body. They are responsible for carrying messages between the brain, spinal cord and the voluntary muscles that help you do various tasks such as grasping objects, talking, eating, dressing up and moving around. In ALS, the death of these neurons stops the transfer of messages from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles.''The disease has a progressive and fatal course. In absence of the control from the nerves, the muscles stay unused and gradually weaken, twitch (fasciculations) and waste away (atrophy). It ultimately causes the brain to lose its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements. There is a \xa0progressive decline in the ability to talk, write, pick up or hold things, swallow and breathe.\xa0''There is no cure for ALS. People with this disease have a shortened life expectancy and may die within a few years of diagnosis. ALS most commonly affects white people, males and people over age 60.\xa0' "
What is usually the first sign of ALS?,"'The earliest signs of ALS usually include muscle ''weakness'' or ''stiffness'' (''spasticity''). ALS typically affects all muscles under voluntary control, and the person ultimately loses their strength and ability to eat, speak, grasp things, move and even breathe. They find it difficult to perform routine tasks such as feeding themselves or getting dressed.''Many people with ALS notice the first signs of the disease in the hand or arm as they find it difficult to perform simple tasks such as turning a key in a lock, buttoning a shirt, combing their hair or writing.\xa0\xa0''Some report initial symptoms in one of the legs causing difficulty or awkwardness when ''walking'' or ''running''. They may also report that they are tripping or stumbling more often than before. If the initial symptoms affect the arms or the legs, it is called a ‘limb onset’ ALS.\xa0''Few people notice their first symptoms as difficulty in speech or swallowing, but these may rarely be the first signs of ALS. This is termed as ‘bulbar onset’ ALS.''Some of the early symptoms of ALS are:''Whatever may be the initial symptom, most people with ALS eventually die from respiratory failure, usually within two to five years from when the symptoms first appear. About 10% of people with ALS, however, survive for 10 years or more after diagnosis.' Muscle twitches or fasciculations in the arm, leg, shoulder or tongue Muscle tightness or stiffness (spasticity) Muscle cramps Weakness of muscles affecting an arm, a leg, neck or diaphragm (the muscular partition separating the chest from the abdomen). Slurred speech Nasal voice  Difficulty in chewing or swallowing."
How is ALS diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of ALS is based on a detailed history of the symptoms and signs observed by a doctor during physical examination, along with various tests to rule out other mimicking diseases.\xa0''Your doctor may request certain tests which include:' Genetic testing (may point to a mutation in cases of familial ALS) Muscle and imaging tests including MRI, electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) Blood tests Urine examination Tests for other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis, HIV, polio and other viral infections"
What is breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is the disease in which the cells multiply at an abnormal rate and displace normal breast tissue. \xa0When ''breast cancer'' spreads to other parts of the body, it is called metastasized ''breast cancer''. Breast ''cancer'' and its complications can affect nearly every part of the body. Although breast ''cancer'' predominantly occurs in women, it can also affect men.' "
What is usually the first sign of breast cancer?,"'The common signs of breast ''cancer'' include:''Apart from above signs below are few other sign and symptoms:\xa0' A lump in the breast or in the armpits is often the first sign of breast cancer. This may be felt while in the shower. There may or may not be changes in the structure of the breast. Axillary (armpit) swelling  may indicate that cancer from the breast has traveled to the lymph nodes, and now there may be a lymph node invasion.  Changes in the nipple area, nipple retraction and inverted nipple are common warning signs of breast cancer Bleeding from the nipple may be limited and difficult to see, but if an individual notices blood stains on the bra, or if the secretions are unusual, bloody or continuous, they may need urgent medical attention.  Change in color and/or thickening of skin on the breast that resembles an orange rind is a warning sign of breast cancer. If the breast skin changes color, typically to a pink or reddish hue that covers more than half the breast that may also be a warning sign. A non-healing sore anywhere on the breast, including the nipple with or without bleeding may be a warning sign of breast cancer  Increased warmth in the breast with change in size and appearance of breast is a sign of breast cancer. "
What are the different types of breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer usually begins either in glands that make milk (called\xa0lobular ''carcinoma''), or the ducts that carry it to the nipple (called\xa0ductal carcinoma). There are several types of breast cancer, and they are broken into two main categories: “invasive” and “noninvasive,” (in situ). These two categories are used to describe the most common types of breast cancer, which include:' Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): DCIS is a noninvasive condition. The cancer cells are confined to the ducts in the breast and haven’t invaded the surrounding breast tissue. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS): LCIS is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of breast; it may not invade the surrounding tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): It is the most common type of breast cancer. This type of breast cancer begins in breast’s milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma: It first develops in milk-producing lobules of the breast and invades nearby tissues. Paget disease of the nipple: This cancer begins in the ducts of the nipple, but as it grows, it begins to affect the skin and area of the nipple. Phyllodes tumor: This very rare type of breast cancer grows in the connective tissue of the breast. It may be benign or cancerous. Angiosarcoma: This cancer grows on the blood and lymph vessels in the breast."
What are the treatment options for breast cancer?,"'Depending on the type and stage of cancer,\xa0treatments\xa0can vary. However, there are some common practices doctors and specialists use to combat breast cancer:' Lumpectomy is when the doctor removes the tumor while leaving the breast intact. Mastectomy is when the doctor surgically removes all of the breast tissue including the tumor and connecting tissue including the lymph nodes. Chemotherapy is the most common cancer treatment, and it involves the use of anticancer drugs. These drugs interfere with cells’ ability to reproduce. Radiation uses X-rays to treat cancer directly. Hormonal and targeted therapy can be used when either genes or hormones play a part in the cancer growth. This therapy targets the specific protein on the tumor cells."
What is the survival rate of breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer has a predicted 90% five-year survival rate. This means that 90 out of 100 people diagnosed with breast cancer are likely to live five years after their diagnosis. This does not mean an individual will die after five years, but a person may live for a minimum five years and more.' "
What is HIV?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') attacks the cells of the immune system. CD4+ cells help the body to resist any infections. With a lack of these cells, the body is less resistant, which makes it vulnerable to other infections and diseases. ''HIV'' spreads mainly via bodily fluids (blood and semen) from the person with ''HIV''; for example, during unprotected sex or sharing injection drug equipment.''If untreated, HIV can lead to ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS''). Hence, treating HIV with antiretroviral therapy (ART, HIV medicine) is necessary to reduce the viral load and prevent transmission of HIV to the patient’s sexual partners.' "
How is HIV transmitted?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted by coming in direct contact with certain body fluids of the person infected with HIV. These fluids are as follows''Transmission only occurs when the fluid gets into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through open sores or ''cuts'', by direct injection or a mucous membrane.''The most common ways of spreading HIV are as follows''Less common ways are as follows''Hence, taking precautions either while having sex or avoiding sharing needles is the best way to prevent HIV.' Blood Semen Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk Having anal or vaginal sex with an HIV-positive person Sharing needles with a person who has HIV During pregnancy or breastfeeding Having oral sex Receiving blood products that are contaminated with HIV Getting stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle"
What is usually the first sign of HIV?,"'The first signs of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are ''flu-like symptoms'', which mainly start around two to four weeks after getting HIV. This stage is known as ''acute HIV infection'' and the symptoms include''In this stage, the virus multiplies at a low level and people may not experience any symptoms at all. Without HIV treatment, the person can remain in this stage for 10 to 15 years. However, the virus remains active during this stage.''If left untreated, HIV leads to ''AIDS''. ''AIDS'' can weaken the immune system causing several opportunistic diseases. Symptoms include' Fever Rash Sore throat Swollen glands Headache Upset stomach Joint aches and pains Muscle pain Unexplainable weight loss Recurring fever Getting tired easily Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin or neck Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week Sores of the mouth, anus or genitals Pneumonia Memory loss, depression Purplish spots on the skin that don’t go away Night sweats Bruises or bleeding due to an unknown reason"
What are the types of HIV tests?,"'There are three types of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests used to diagnose HIV infections, which are as follows' Antibody tests: These check for HIV antibodies in the blood or oral fluid. Antigen/antibody tests: These help to detect both HIV antibodies and antigens in the blood. Nucleic acid tests: These look for HIV in the blood."
What is the treatment for HIV?,"'The treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) involves a combination of medications known as antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART cannot cure HIV; however, it can increase the survival rate of the patients.''ART halts the multiplication of the virus and reduces the amount of virus in the body to help the patient stay healthier.''Once the treatment has been started, the patient must remain compliant with the dosage for the medicines to be effective. Noncompliance can result in developing resistance to the medicines.' "
What is lung cancer?,"'Lung cancer'' is ''cancer'' that originates in the lung cells.''Cancer'' is an abnormal and uncontrolled growth of the cells in the body. These abnormal cells kill the normal cells of the body and disrupt the normal body functions.''Lung cancer'' may spread to the ''lymph nodes'' or other organs in the body that commonly include the ''liver'', bones, brain, and adrenal glands. When ''cancer'' cells spread from one organ to another, it is called ''metastasis''.''According to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer is one of the top 10 leading ''causes of cancer'' deaths globally. People dying from lung cancer alone are more than those dying from colon, breast, and ''prostate cancers'' combined.\xa0''However, early detection and advanced treatment options are a ray of hope for patients with lung cancer.' "
What is usually the first sign of lung cancer?,"'Most often, lung cancer does not show any signs and symptoms until it has advanced to higher stages when it becomes difficult to treat. The initial signs and symptoms vary among patients but may include the following:' Cough that remains unrelieved and gets worse over time  Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or reddish spit Chest pain that worsens on breathing or laughing Hoarseness of voice Weight loss Persistent chest pain Frequent lung infections"
What puts you at risk for lung cancer?,"'Cigarette smoking'' is the leading cause of lung cancer. ''Inhalation'' of tobacco smoke by non-''smokers'' (''passive smoking'') is the next factor that can lead to cancer.\xa0''As many as 90% of lung cancer diagnoses could be prevented if there is no more ''cigarette smoking''. Among people who smoke two or more packs of cigarettes/day, one in seven will die of lung cancer.\xa0''Other risk factors for lung cancer include the following:' Family history of cancer, particularly lung cancer Exposure to asbestos Exposure to radon gas Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Prior history of cancer Air pollution Exposure to diesel exhaust"
What are the four stages of lung cancer?,"'The four stages of lung cancer (based on a grading system) are known as TNM classification. The TNM grades have been derived from diagnostic tests such as''Knowing the stage of the lung cancer helps the oncologist select the right treatment.''In the increasing order of severity, the stages of lung cancer are as follows:' blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, bronchoscopy, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, etc. Stage 0: This stage describes cancer in situ, which means “in place.” Stage 0 cancers are still located in the place they started and do not spread to the nearby tissues. This stage of cancer is often highly curable, usually by removing the entire tumor with surgery. Stage I: This stage is usually a small tumor that has not grown deeply into the nearby tissues. It is often called early-stage cancer. Stages II and III: At these two stages, lung cancer has grown more deeply into its adjacent tissues. Lung cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes. Stage IV: This stage means that lung cancer has spread or metastasized in other organs. This is usually known as the advanced stage of lung cancer."
What is lupus?,"'Systemic lupus erythematosus'' (''SLE'') is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system of the body attacks its healthy tissue. It affects joints, skin, brain, ''lungs'', kidneys and blood vessels, leading to inflammation and tissue damage of the affected organs. More than 90% of cases occur in females.' "
How does a person get lupus?,"'The exact cause of SLE is unknown; however, some environmental, genetic and hormonal factors may contribute to getting ''lupus''.\xa0' Exposure to UV rays Microbial response Certain medications Silica dust Cigarette smoking Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight) Family history of SLE Female gender Chronic infections Use of estrogen in women undergoing menopause Vitamin D deficiency Pregnancy breastfeeding has shown to decrease the risk of SLE. Women of childbearing ages (15-44 years) High-risk ethnic backgrounds such as African Americans, Asians, Hispanics and Caucasians Low birth weight (<2,500 g) Preterm birth (birth that occurs before the 37th week of pregnancy) Exposure to pesticides during childhood"
What is usually the first sign of lupus?,"'Fatigue'', ''fever'', ''joint pain'' and weight changes are usually the first signs of ''lupus''.\xa0''Some adults may have a period of SLE symptoms known as flares, which may occur frequently, sometimes even years apart and resolve at other times—called remission. Other symptoms include:''Apart from the above symptoms, ''nausea'', ''indigestion'', ''abdominal pain'' and ''confusion'' may also be seen in some patients.' Sun sensitivity Oral ulcers Arthritis Seizure Anemia Fever  Loss of appetite Muscle aches Alopecia (hair loss) Facial rash (butterfly rash) Chest pain caused due to inflammation of the lining that surrounds the lung (pleuritis) and the heart (pericarditis) Raynaud’s phenomenon (poor circulation to the fingers and toes with cold exposure) Vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)"
What are the complications of lupus?,'The complications that accompany SLE are as follows:' Lupus nephritis (kidney failure) Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) Lupoid hepatitis (liver disease) Fibromyalgia (muscle pain and tenderness) Pancreatitis (inflammation in pancreas) Infections Coronary heart disease (damage or disease in the heart’s major artery) Blood clots
How is lupus diagnosed?,"'Physicians diagnose SLE with the help of the following laboratory tests:''Radiographic tests such as computed tomography scan, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' and joint radiograph also detect abnormalities.''Ultimately, a ''skin biopsy'' is performed to confirm the diagnosis.' Specific antibody tests for SLE (e.g., antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA) may be done Complete blood cell count (CBC) to screen for anemia and thrombocytopenia Serum creatinine for kidney disease Urinalysis for kidney disease Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for inflammation Liver function tests"
How is lupus treated?,"'There is no cure for SLE. Management of SLE depends on disease severity and disease manifestations.\xa0''Hydroxychloroquine'' is effective in the long-term treatment of SLE. Immunosuppressive medicines help to inhibit the activity of the immune system, which can be useful in treating SLE.\xa0''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') and ''corticosteroids'' help to treat inflammation and ''pain'' in the muscles, joints and other tissues.' "
Can a person die from lupus?,"'SLE along with other medical conditions can be a contributing cause of death. Mainly, secondary conditions like kidney diseases, heart diseases or infection can be the contributing factor.' "
Who needs vaginal vault suspension?,"'Based on its increasing order of severity, doctors grade a vaginal prolapse. The grades range from grade 0 to grade 4. Initially, mild to moderate forms will be first treated with conservative options that include pelvic floor exercises and the use of vaginal pessaries.''A mild vaginal vault prolapse may not cause symptoms. As it progresses, it can cause''Women with a severe form of vaginal vault prolapse and severe symptoms will generally need vaginal vault suspension surgery.' Feeling of heaviness in the vagina Lower back pain Problems with bladder or bowel control Dyspareunia (painful intercourse) Pelvic pain Bleeding ulcers over the bulge"
What causes vaginal vault prolapse?,'The vaginal vault is a part of the vaginal canal. It is supported by ligaments and other structures that are attached to the uterus. Vaginal vault prolapse is caused by the weakening of these ligaments and pelvic floor muscles.''The factors that put women at a greater risk for vaginal vault prolapse include:' Prior hysterectomy Four or more vaginal deliveries Menopause Advancing age Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Chronic constipation Heavy lifting
What is done before vaginal vault suspension?,"'If you are on medications, your doctor will instruct you what medications you can continue and what should be stopped for a few days before the surgery.''You will usually be admitted to the hospital a night before the surgery. You will not be allowed to eat or drink anything after midnight except for a few sips of water (4 hours before the surgery).' "
How is vaginal vault suspension performed?,"'A vaginal vault suspension is done by reattaching the prolapsed vaginal vault to the higher portions of the ligaments (attached to the uterus) with permanent ''stitches'' or through a synthetic mesh (a loosely woven sheet).''After administering the anesthesia to numb your pelvic region, the surgery can be performed via any of the two approaches:''Vaginal approach: ''The instruments for performing the surgery will be inserted by dilating (opening) the vagina.''Abdominal approach:'' This is again of two subtypes.''The surgeon will decide the type of procedure for a patient depending on' Laparotomy: A single, large cut of about 6-12 inches will be made in the lower abdomen along the bikini line. Laparoscopy: Several smaller cuts will be made to carry out the surgery. A long tube-like camera will be inserted to visualize the vagina and the surrounding structures. Other tools are inserted through other cuts and the procedure is carried out. The patient's age Any other existing disease Previous surgery The level of physical and sexual activity"
What happens after vaginal vault suspension?,"'Depending on your overall condition, you will be shifted to the intensive care unit or the general ward.''Usually, the patient is discharged within 1-3 days of the surgery. In the case of laparotomy, it will take longer (3-7 days).' "
How long does it take to recover from vaginal vault suspension?,"'You can resume your regular but light household activities immediately after you get discharged.''You will need to avoid any strenuous activities for at least 6 weeks after the surgery. Such as:''Ask your doctor when you can resume sex after the surgery.''Follow up is generally scheduled 6 weeks after the surgery when the surgeon checks whether the ''wound'' has healed completely.''You will be instructed to follow up again, which is 3 months after you have returned to your normal activities. At this time, the doctor will evaluate how successful the surgery has been by asking you a few questions and examining the vaginal area.' Situps Heavy workouts (that put pressure on your abdomen or pelvic region) Heavy lifting (over 5 pounds) for at least 6 weeks after surgery"
What are the complications of vaginal vault suspension?,"'Every surgery carries a few risks. Vaginal vault suspension is no exception to this. The complications depend on the type of surgery.''Your surgeon will discuss all the benefits and risks with you before the operation. Make sure to clear any queries that you may have.''\xa0The possible risks with vaginal vault suspension surgery include:' Internal bleeding Surgical wound infection Injury to bladder, ureters, or bowel Recurrent urinary tract infections Vaginal discharge Dyspareunia"
What is ventriculoatrial shunt placement?,"'Ventriculoatrial shunting (VAS) ''is a procedure that allows the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to flow from the brain to the ''atrium'' of the ''heart''. This procedure is typically used to treat a condition called ''hydrocephalus''.\xa0''This condition occurs when there is excess CSF in the brain. CSF is a fluid that acts as a cushion for the brain, protecting the brain from an injury due to impact. The fluid also supplies nutrients to the brain and drains away waste products. The CSF normally flows through structures in the brain called the ventricles to the base of the brain and then continues to cover the brain and spinal cord after which the CSF gets absorbed back into the blood.''When the normal CSF flow is disrupted due to impact, there is an excess accumulation of fluid that increases the pressure on the brain (increased intracranial pressure/tension), leading to complications that can damage the brain. The goal of VAS is to divert the CSF away from the brain to the ''atrium'', which is a chamber in the heart, hence reducing the intracranial pressure and restoring the normal CSF flow.\xa0' "
When is ventriculoatrial shunt placement done?,"'Ventriculoatrial shunting (VAS) placement is indicated for patients with ''hydrocephalus'' in whom other treatment modalities and procedures have failed.\xa0''Hydrocephalus occurs due to\xa0''Hydrocephalus in newborns may be due to developmental abnormalities in the brain and nervous system, bleeding in the brain, and infection of the brain during birth.' Obstruction (partial or complete obstruction of the normal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]). Poor absorption (the blood vessels are unable to absorb the CSF due to inflammation of the brain or injury). Overproduction (CSF is created in excess and quickly compared to the absorption rate). Abnormal development of the central nervous system that can obstruct the flow of CSF. Lesions or tumors in the brain or spinal cord. Bleeding in the brain from a stroke or head injury."
When is ventriculoatrial shunt placement not done?,'Contraindications for ventriculoatrial shunting (VAS) placement include the following:' Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection Systemic infection  Infection of the heart  History of shunt-related kidney disease  Pulmonary hypertension (increased blood pressure of the arteries in the lungs and right side of the heart) Heart failure Bleeding disorders 
How is ventriculoatrial shunt placement performed?,"'A ventriculoatrial shunt placement involves a few steps to the procedure, as outlined below.''The physician performs a complete physical examination. They perform a complete blood analysis and radiological assessment of the brain.''The procedure is performed after the patient is given general anesthesia.''The ventriculoatrial shunt is performed under radiological guidance, by placing the tip of a catheter in the ventricle of the brain. The other end of the catheter is placed in the ''atrium'' of the heart. The catheter with a valve functions as a unidirectional medium, draining the excess fluid from the brain to the heart. In the heart, the fluid mixes with the blood and gets absorbed.''The patient is administered with intravenous antibiotics and painkillers. Radiological assessment is done after the procedure to ensure that the catheter is positioned correctly.' "
What are the complications of ventriculoatrial shunt placement?,"'Complications of ventriculoatrial shunting (VAS) placement may include the following:' Shunt-induced inflammation of the kidneys  Microemboli (blood clots in the blood vessels)  Pulmonary hypertension due to microemboli  Thrombosis (blood clots) in larger blood vessels Endocarditis (inflammation of the heart) Wound/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infection  Outgrowing the shunt (as a child with VAS grows, shunt malposition occurs, leading to shunt malfunction) Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) Shunt malfunction  Delayed intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain)"
What are volar splints?,"'Splints are usually applied to reduce movement and provide support and comfort by stabilizing an injury. They are primarily used during nonemergency injuries to the bones or ligaments until they can be evaluated by a consultant such as an orthopedic surgeon. They are also used to temporarily immobilize an extremity before surgery (e.g., for an open ''fracture'') or enable healing.''Unlike casts, splints are preferred in an emergency setting, where injuries are often acute, and swelling may continuously increase. All patients with injuries that are splinted should be referred for evaluation by a consultant within two to seven days.''Volar relates to the palm or sole. Volar splints are applied to minimize movements and provide support and comfort by stabilizing an injury of the palm or foot. Immobilizing the joint reduces ''pain'' and helps the injury heal faster. Studies have reported that using a combination of ''corticosteroid'' injection with splinting may yield better results than using an injection alone in inflammatory conditions.' "
What injuries are volar splinting used for?,"'Volar splinting is used for the following:''There are no absolute contraindications for volar splinting. Relative contraindications involve the following injuries that require an immediate evaluation or intervention by a consultant (e.g., an orthopedic surgeon, a hand surgeon or a ''plastic surgeon''):' Soft-tissue injuries of the wrist and hand   Fractures of the palm and foot Positioning for rheumatoid arthritis  Certain wrist fractures  Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (medical condition due to compression of the nerve called the median nerve as it travels through the wrist) Ligament injuries and inflammation Inflammation of the tendon  Complicated fractures Open fractures Injuries with associated neurovascular compromise (damage to the nerves and blood vessels)"
How is a volar splint wrapped?,"'There are various types of splints made of various materials and have different techniques of application. Volar splints are generally applied by a healthcare professional.''Volar splinting is usually tolerated without the use of anesthesia. In case of significant ''pain'' during joint manipulation or reduction of fracture, anesthesia and painkillers would be required.''Volar splinting of the hand is also called a “cock up splint.”\xa0''In case of a simple sprain, the doctor may advise a simple brace with Velcro clips or a bandage wrap to be worn for two to six weeks to immobilize the joint.''The patient is advised to rest, elevate, and ice the injured limb. If the patient experiences ''weakness'', numbness, color change (pale or bluish), increasing pressure or pain or spreading redness, they are advised to remove the splint and visit the emergency department right away.\xa0''The splint must be kept clean and dry. The patient can be tempted to use sticks, pens, or hangers to scratch an ''itch'' inside the splint. Sticking objects into the splint to scratch yourself can wrinkle the padding and lead to pressure injuries or cause ''cuts'' in the skin, leading to infection. The splint is usually rechecked every 48 hours by the doctor.\xa0' The injured limb is completely exposed.  A stockinette is applied from the palm, covering the entire palm, to the forearm just beyond the mid-forearm.  A hole is made for the thumb to pass through.  Soft padding is applied over the stockinette.  The padding should extend 2-3 cm beyond the overlying plaster on both ends.  Plaster of Paris (POP) is applied over the padding.  A bandage wrap is applied over the wet plaster.  The hand remains immobile until the splint is dry.  The patient may feel some warmth released from the plaster as it dries."
What are the complications of volar splinting?,"'Complications of volar splinting include' Thermal burns may occur due to the warmth as the plaster dries Pressure sores Contact dermatitis Neurovascular compromise (damage to the nerves and blood vessels) Decreased range of motion from immobilization. Hence, aftercare often requires physical therapy."
What are aberrations of the eye?,"'When light hits the interior surface of our eye (retina), the light-sensitive receptors turn this light into electrical signals. These signals travel to the brain through the nerve (''optic nerve''). Then, the brain converts these signals into the images that we see perfectly.''Aberration of the eye is the phenomenon where this light ray distorts when it travels through the eye globe. This distortion hampers the formation of a clear image over the retina.''Aberration of the eye gives rise to various refractive errors such as\xa0''It can also be used to diagnose certain higher order aberrations (more complicated aberrations) as discussed further in this article.' Myopia Hypermetropia Astigmatism Spherical aberrations Trefoil aberrations Coma aberrations"
What is wavefront aberrometry?,'Wavefront\xa0aberrometry is the refractory test to measure vision errors. It is performed by using a wavefront aberrometer machine. It analyzes and compares the differences between distorted wavelengths of an eye and a normal eye using distinct calculations.' 
What happens during wavefront aberrometry?,"'It is a clinic-based test. During this test''The wavefront map is a complete, accurate description of all vision errors that affect your eye through distinct calculations.' Your doctor will ask you to place your chin on the chin rest of the aberrometer. You will be asked to peer into the device and focus your eyes on a point of light. The aberrometer machine sends monochromatic (one-color) light rays into your eye through the pupil (the black part of your eye) and these rays are reflected onto the fundus (the backside of the eye). After a few seconds, the aberrometer sends a map to print out."
What are the vision errors diagnosed by wavefront aberrometry?,"'Wavefront technology/aberrometry diagnoses both lower- and higher-order vision errors.''It occurs even after using corrective methods such as glasses or lenses and cannot be addressed in the clinic. Types of high-order vision errors include' Low-order vision errors: These are the most clinically significant vision errors due to errors in light refraction and can be corrected with glasses/spectacles or contact lenses. These vision errors include Myopia (nearsightedness)Hyperopia (farsightedness)Astigmatism (uneven cornea causing blurry, fuzzy vision that may sometimes require surgery) Myopia (nearsightedness) Hyperopia (farsightedness) Astigmatism (uneven cornea causing blurry, fuzzy vision that may sometimes require surgery) High-order vision errors: These are subtle and complex refractory errors causing disturbances in acuity (visual sharpness) such asDiplopia (double vision)BlurringGhost shadowsHalosStarburstsLoss of contrastPoor night vision Diplopia (double vision) Blurring Ghost shadows Halos Starbursts Loss of contrast Poor night vision Monochromatic (one-color) vision errorsSpherical vision errors: These cause blurry vision.Comatic vision errors: These occur due to imperfection in the lens or other components resulting in comet-shaped images.

What is whole-bowel irrigation?,"'Whole-bowel irrigation is the rarely used technique that cleans the entire intestine to remove unwanted or toxic substances from the gastrointestinal tract. The technique is done by inserting a tube from the nose to the intestine (nasogastric tube).''Usually, a large volume of nonabsorbable solution called ''polyethylene glycol''-''electrolyte'' is administered through the tube to clean the ''intestines''. The technique is usually performed to prepare patients for an intestine surgery or in patients who have an overdose of certain substances or ''drugs''.' "
When is whole-bowel irrigation necessary?,"'Whole-bowel irrigation is uncommonly performed because it carries significant risks in patients. This procedure is performed for the below conditions:' Prior to an intestinal surgery Ingestion or overdose of a significant or life-threatening amount of sustained-release medications or drugs (sustained-release potassium chloride) Ingestion of a significant or life-threatening amount of medications that are not adsorbed by activated charcoal (AC), or a situation in which no other intestine cleaning methods are appropriate (e.g., iron supplements, lead or lithium overdose foreign body) Ingestion of illicit drugs  Ingestion of whole skin patches (e.g., fentanyl patch or clonidine patch)  Ingestion of multiple water beads or gel beads with no signs of bowel obstruction"
When whole-bowel irrigation technique shouldn’t be done?,"'Whole-bowel irrigation technique shouldn’t be done in patients:' Who are uncooperative In whom a nose tube cannot be placed With uncontrolled vomiting Who have a decreased conscious state or risk assessment, suggesting the potential for a decreased conscious state or seizure in the subsequent four hours With intestinal obstruction Who are intubated and ventilated (this is a relative contraindication because large volumes of fluid may fill the tract and flow past the tube cuff, leading to aspiration) With unstable vital signs"
What happens during whole-bowel irrigation?,"'Whole-bowel irrigation may take up to six hours.' A nurse or healthcare provider should be able to monitor the patient and their vitals throughout the procedure. A sufficient supply of polyethylene glycol-electrolyte is usually kept ready before the procedure. A nasogastric tube is inserted from the nose to the stomach. The patient is given intravenous metoclopramide to minimize vomiting and enhance gastric emptying. Activated charcoal (AC) is sent through the nasogastric tube (for the nonmetallic ingestions). Next, a polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution is sent through the nasogastric tube at 2 L per hour (children 25 mL/kg/hour). The patient should sit on a commode because they may have diarrhea. The technique should continue until six hours or until the fecal discharge is clear. The procedure may need to be stopped if the patient has abdominal distension or loss of intestinal sounds.  In some patients, abdominal X-ray may be done to assess the effectiveness of decontamination of radio-opaque substances such as iron and potassium salts. Once the technique is completed, the tube is removed, and the patient might need sufficient rest and monitoring.  "
What are the complications of whole-bowel irrigation?,"'Whole-bowel irrigation is a risky technique that may have the below complications:''In rare cases, if sufficient care is not taken, death is also a possibility during whole-bowel irrigations.'

When should YAG laser capsulotomy not be done?,"'There are no absolute reasons for the procedure not to be done. Some relative contraindications for Nd:YAG laser capsulotomies include the following:' Corneal scarring or swelling that prevents a clear view during the procedure Placement of a glass intraocular lens during cataract surgery Iritis (inflammation of the iris, the pigmented disc in the eye) Swelling (edema) of the retina History of retinal tears or detachments Recent history of eye surgery Patients with increased eye pressure"
How is YAG laser capsulotomy performed?,'The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. Topical anesthesia (anesthetic eye drops) can be used to perform Nd:YAG without any significant ''pain'' or discomfort. The patient is made to sit at a slit lamp equipped with a YAG laser.''Nd:YAG laser beams are applied in rapid busts and the opacified spots in the capsule are burnt away. This creates a small circular opening in the membrane that previously hampered your vision. The procedure can be done in an out-patient setting and only takes a few minutes.''After the procedure:''Topical steroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation. Regular follow-up is advised.\xa0''The procedure usually does not need to be repeated unless the posterior capsule was not completely burnt away.' 
What are the complications of YAG laser capsulotomy?,'The procedure is relatively safe. Some possible complications may include:' Increased pressure inside the eye (elevated intraocular pressure) Iritis (inflammation of the iris) Retinal tears Retinal detachment Corneal swelling (edema) Swelling of the posterior structures of the eye Intraocular lens dislocation
What is phototherapy?,"'Phototherapy is a special light treatment given to newborns who have ''jaundice''. Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes in newborns due to a pigment called bilirubin. 60% of ''babies'' are born with jaundice at birth. However, a few babies have a bilirubin level at birth that is high enough to cause ''brain damage''. The reason may be an infection at birth, low birth weight, or ''breast milk''. Phototherapy helps your baby’s body to get rid of the accumulated excess bilirubin (yellow substance) by making it water-soluble. This process makes it easier for your baby’s ''liver'' to break down and remove the bilirubin from their blood through urine and stools.' "
What happens during phototherapy?,"'During phototherapy,' The baby with jaundice will be kept naked under the special light.  The eyes of the baby will be covered to protect them from damage. Supplemental feeding will be given to your baby because your baby’s body may lose extra water through the skin. In fiberoptic and conventional phototherapy, therapy is usually stopped for 30 minutes every three to four hours, and the baby is given to the mother for breastfeeding, changing their nappy, and cuddling. Continuous multiple phototherapies will be given continuously without a break, and the mother’s breastmilk may be given through a tube into the baby’s stomach or fluids may be given into one of their veins. Signs of dehydration will be checked timely, and intravenous fluids may be given to the baby if it is dehydrated or if the baby is not able to drink a sufficient amount of milk. Your baby’s temperature will be monitored to ensure that it is not too hot. Bilirubin levels will be tested every four to six hours after phototherapy to check if the treatment is working or not. Once your baby’s bilirubin levels have stabilized or started to fall, the doctor will check it after every 6-12 hours."
How long phototherapy is usually needed?,"'The baby needs phototherapy for two days at least, even longer in a few cases. While the baby is under phototherapy, the bilirubin level is tested and retested. Once your baby’s bilirubin is below a certain level, phototherapy will be stopped. Another bilirubin level will be checked 12-18 hours later to make sure it is not high again.''There are no specific guidelines for when to discontinue phototherapy.''Serum bilirubin levels should show a significant reduction before the lights are turned off. Only physical examination for jaundice is not enough, but bilirubin levels in the blood should be checked timely.''The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) guidelines suggested that a ''newborn'' with jaundice with a very high bilirubin level in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia) at ≥18 mg/dL should lower the bilirubin level up to 13-14 mg to discontinue phototherapy.\xa0' "

What MSG does to your body?,"'\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0These symptoms are usually mild and resolve on their own.' Monosodium glutamate (MSG) causes weight gain: Some studies have linked MSG consumption to weight gain and obesity. There isn’t sufficient data and research to claim that MSG consumption is associated with obesity. MSG and children: It has been suggested that children would metabolize glutamate more slowly than adults. They may be more susceptible to the effects of MSG, if any. MSG causes neurotoxicity (nerve cell damage): Scientists have earlier claimed that MSG consumption results in the release of excessive glutamate levels in the brain, causing brain damage. However, these claims have been refuted by other scientists stating that MSG, when consumed in a lower amount, does not cause any neurotoxicity. MSG and pregnant or lactating women: Research studies on pregnant or lactating women suggests MSG or glutamate consumption does not have any adverse effect on mothers,  fetuses nor breastfeeding infants. MSG poisoning: In some people, MSG consumption of more than 3 grams may induce a group of symptoms (Chinese restaurant syndrome), which includesHeadacheDrowsinessSweatingFacial pressure or tightnessNumbness, tingling or burning in the face, neck and other areasRapid, fluttering heartbeatChest painNauseaWeakness Headache Drowsiness Sweating Facial pressure or tightness Numbness, tingling or burning in the face, neck and other areas Rapid, fluttering heartbeat Chest pain Nausea Weakness MSG on the intestine: Dietary glutamate derived from MSG or other sources is a primary source of energy for the intestine. MSG as an appetite enhancer: It enhances the taste in elderly people who have lost their taste and smell."
What is MSG?,"'Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the sodium form of the amino acid, glutamic acid, and a type of glutamate. MSG acts as a flavor enhancer when added to food. It is colorless, tasteless and does not have a texture of its own. It merely enhances the natural flavor of food. Glutamate is associated with the fifth taste, umami. Umami taste receptors have a particular affinity for free glutamate.''Replacing table salt with some MSG reduces the sodium content of food because MSG has two-thirds less sodium than table salt.' "
Is MSG really bad for your health?,"'Glutamate is one of the many amino acids (building blocks of protein) found naturally in the body. Glutamate may be naturally present in some protein-rich foods, such as cheese, milk, meat, fish and several different vegetables. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) levels are high especially in foods such as tomatoes, mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. Thus, it is clear that consuming MSG within the allowed limit is not bad for your health.''Findings of one study concluded that MSG is safe, although some people who consume more than three grams of the substance may experience symptoms such as ''headache'' or drowsiness. The ideal serving of MSG should be less than 0.5 grams in food.''The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies MSG as “generally recognized as safe,” just like ''sugar'' and baking soda. The FDA also claims that the body metabolizes MSG exactly like it metabolizes natural glutamate.' "
What is mucus?,"'Mucus'' is a normal, slippery and stringy fluid substance produced by many lining tissues in the body. It is essential for body function and acts as a protective and moisturizing layer to keep critical organs from drying out. Mucus also acts as a trap for irritants like dust, smoke, or bacteria. It contains antibodies and bacteria-killing enzymes to help fight off infections.'""The body produces a lot of mucus -- about 1 to 1.5 liters per day. We don't tend to notice mucus at all unless its production is increased or the quality of mucus has changed, as may happen with different illnesses and conditions."" "
What causes mucus production to increase?,"'Respiratory infections like colds, the ''flu'', and ''sinusitis'' are common causes of increased mucus production and ''coughing'' up mucus. ''Allergic'' reactions are another reason that mucus production can increase. Even consumption of spicy foods can spark excess mucus production in the nasal passages.''When you are sick from ''respiratory infection'', you may notice thickened mucus that may appear darker than normal. This thickened mucus is harder to clear than typical mucus.  This mucus is associated with many of the characteristic symptoms of a ''cold'' or ''flu''. The mucus may also appear yellow-green in color when you are ill. ' "
What areas of the body produce mucus?,"'Mucus is produced in many sites in the body by mucus glands in the lining tissues of multiple organs, including the:' lungs, sinuses, mouth, throat, nose, and gastrointestinal tract."
What is the difference between mucus and phlegm?,"'Phlegm'' is the term that is used to refer to mucus produced by the respiratory system, particularly when excess mucus is produced and coughed up. During an infection, the mucus contains the ''viruses'' or ''bacteria'"" responsible for the infection as well as infection-fighting cells of the body's immune system (white blood cells).""'Phlegm itself is not dangerous, but when present in large amounts, it can clog the airways. Phlegm is usually expelled by ''coughing'', and this is typically accompanied by symptoms like ''nasal congestion'', ''runny nose'', and ''sore throat''.' "
What do different colors of mucus and phlegm mean?,"'While a small amount of blood in mucus is normal, you should see a health-care professional if there is excessive bleeding. '  The thickened mucus that accompanies many illnesses is often darker and yellow-colored compared to normal, clear, thin mucus. Greenish mucus means that the mucus contains infection-fighting white blood cells. Blood-tinged or brownish mucus is also common with upper respiratory infections, especially if the inside of the nose has become irritated or scratched."
When is excessive mucus a problem?,"'Excessive mucus is rarely a serious medical problem, but it is uncomfortable and a nuisance, particularly when it blocks sinuses or causes coughing fits. Thickened mucus and excess mucus production cause many unpleasant symptoms including:' runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, sinus headache, and cough.    "
How do you get rid of mucus?,"'Saline nasal rinses, including neti pots, are an option for those who would like to get rid of excess mucus without taking medications. Bulb syringes and squeeze bottles are other methods to do ''nasal irrigation''. Saline nasal sprays may also be helpful.''All these techniques thin out the mucus and help clear the airways and sinuses. Always use sterile saline rinses that can be purchased, or use distilled, previously boiled, or sterile water to make up the solution. Using nonsterile tap water has the small chance of introducing an infection into the airways and sinuses.'""Certain medications are also able to help thin mucus and enhance the body's ability to remove it.""  "
How does a neti pot help you get rid of mucus?,'Neti pots and other methods for ''nasal irrigation'' work using the same principle:''Be sure that any solution you use for nasal irrigation is made with sterile (such as previously boiled) water. ' A saline (salt water) solution is injected into one nostril. This loosens up all the mucus in the nasal cavity. The water drains out the other nostril.
Which medications treat or get rid of mucus?,"'A number of ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications can help reduce mucus production or help with removal of mucus. Decongestants and ''antihistamines'' are two kinds of ''drugs'' that may help relieve symptoms of a ''cold'' or flu.''Decongestants reduce blood flow to the lining tissues of the nose and throat, so your body may produce less mucus. They may help you breathe easier when you have a stuffy nose, but because they are drying, they may have the unintended effect of thickening the mucus that is present. Decongestants should be used only under physician supervision in persons with ''high blood pressure'' or ''heart disease''.''Antihistamines'' block or limit the action of histamines, substances produced during ''allergic'' reactions that cause the lining tissues in the nose to produce more mucus. Older or first-generation antihistamines can be sedating, but newer types of antihistamines can be taken during the day with little sedating effect.''An additional kind of medication that can help thin out mucus is ''guaifenesin''. ''Guaifenesin'' is a type of drug called an expectorant. Expectorants make the mucus thinner so it is easier to ''cough'' up. ' "
What is amniotomy?,'Amniotomy refers to an artificial rupture of the membrane and involves deliberate rupturing of the amniotic sac to release the ''amniotic fluid''. Amniotomy has the following purpose:''Amniotomy is avoided in the following conditions:' To induce labor in conjunction with an oxytocin infusion To accelerate labor because amniotomy increases plasma prostaglandins To monitor the fetus or uterus Vasa Previa (a condition in which the fetal blood vessels cross or run near the internal opening of the uterus) Any contraindications to vaginal delivery The head of the child has not dropped deep into the pelvis Placenta previa (a condition where the placenta covers the opening of the cervix) Abnormal fetus positioning Cephalopelvic disproportion (a condition where the baby’s head or body is too large to pass through the mother’s pelvis) Multiple pregnancies Placenta previa (a condition where the placenta covers partially or fully the opening of the cervix) Transverse lie (the baby lies in a horizontal or sideways position of the uterus) Breech presentation (the baby is positioned to deliver feet or bottom first) Underlying medical conditions of the mother such as diabetes or high blood pressure Infection such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or herpes affecting the mother Defects in the baby
How to prepare for amniotomy?,"'Before the amniotomy, the physician will' Explain the procedure including all the risks and alternative options. Obtain consent. Check for any conditions that oppose amniotomy. Put underpads to absorb the amniotic fluid. Conduct a vaginal examination. Elevate the hips on something soft and sterile. Monitor the fetal heart rate before and after the procedure. Monitor amniotic fluid characteristics."
How is amniotomy performed?,"'In this procedure, the physician inserts a hook end of the rod through the vagina. The physician then directs it to the amniotic sac by feeling the amniotic membrane and presenting part. The physician makes a small opening in the amniotic sac with a ''plastic'' hook by applying gentle force. As the sac opens, the patient might feel a warm gush of fluid due to water breaking. The fluid may be odorless or colorless; however, the fluid may either contain a fetus’s first stools or blood-tinge. The physician shouldn’t remove their hand from the vagina immediately after the artificial rupture of the membrane because it would lead to cord prolapse. As the amniotic fluid ceases, and there is no cord dropping down in the vagina, the physician can remove their hand.''Amniotomy is performed if the cervix is partially opened or thinned (effaced) and the baby’s head is present deep in the pelvis. The fetal heart rate will be continuously monitored before and after the procedure.' "
What should I do after a vulvar biopsy?,"'You should follow these instructions after a vulvar biopsy''It takes approximately five days for complete healing while keeping it open. If there is a stitch, it will gradually dissolve over the next one to two weeks as the ''wound'' heals.' Try to keep the biopsy site clean and dry. Do not wash the biopsy area for 12 hours. Apply direct pressure on the biopsy site if bleeding occurs. Take a shower 24 hours after the biopsy. Avoid hot bathtubs until healing is complete. Wash the area once or twice daily and pat it dry. Avoid sexual intercourse until the area has healed completely."
Why is a vulvar biopsy done?,"'A vulvar biopsy is a surgical procedure where a small piece of tissue is extracted from the vulva. A vulvar biopsy is performed in the following conditions' Areas of the skin that appear white or turn white when diluted with a vinegar-like solution Patches of the skin that are red, brown, pink, gray or bumpy A sore that doesn’t recover A lump or growth on the vulva Genital warts that don’t heal"
When should a vulvar biopsy be avoided?,'A vulvar biopsy should be avoided when' The vulvar site is infected. There is coagulopathy (a bleeding disorder). The patient is allergic to local anesthetics.
What should I expect during a vulvar biopsy?,"'Before the procedure''During the procedure''The biopsy is a quick procedure and can be performed in an office setting. The physician cleans the affected area with special swabs. Next, the physician uses a particular instrument known as a colposcope to select the site for a biopsy. A colposcope placed outside the body is a hand-held magnifying ''lens'' that lets the physician view even a small change in the skin of the vulva. The physician treats the vulva with a dilute solution of acetic acid that causes the cancerous areas of the skin to turn white. These changes are easily visible through a colposcope. Once the physician identifies the abnormal area, a local anesthetic is injected to numb the area. The physician using an instrument may either remove the entire abnormal area (excisional biopsy) or take a small piece of tissue (punch biopsy). If the physician takes a larger patch of skin, then it will require ''stitches'' to close it.' The physician will obtain your consent before the procedure. Understand the procedure, including its risk and benefits. You may be given painkillers to counter the pain felt during the procedure. The doctor will apply local anesthesia to numb the area."
What are the complications of a vulvar biopsy?,'The risks of a vulvar biopsy include' Pain  Infection Bleeding Hematoma (pooling of blood) Bruising Scarring Hypopigmentation (loss of skin color) Hyperpigmentation (increased skin color)
What is hydronephrosis?,"'Hydronephrosis involves the collection of urine in the kidney due to incomplete emptying of the urinary tract. This results in swelling and obstruction of the kidney. The swelling or obstruction can occur at:''Hydronephrosis may be of two types:''Hydronephrosis, if left untreated, can lead to ''kidney failure''.' Opening of the kidneys into the ureters The ureters The bladder The urethra Unilateral hydronephrosis (only one kidney is affected) Bilateral hydronephrosis (both the kidneys are affected)"
What causes hydronephrosis?,"'The most common causes of hydronephrosis include:''In women, hydronephrosis may occur as a result of:' Kidney stones Tumors in the bladder or prostate gland Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlargement of the prostate gland causing pressure in the urethra) Blood clots in the kidney or ureter Strictures (narrowing of the urinary tract) Nerve or muscle problems in the kidney or ureters Urinary retention Vesicoureteral reflux (a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder to the ureter) Ureterocele (a condition where the lower part of the ureter may protrude into the bladder) Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (blockage at the point where the kidney joins the ureter) Ureterovesical junction obstruction (blockage at the point where the ureter joins the bladder) Posterior urethral valves (a congenital condition in which there are abnormal flaps of tissue in the urethra) Urethral cancer Pregnancy (enlargement of the uterus can exert pressure on the ureters) Uterine prolapse (uterus sags down from its normal position) Cystocele (a condition where the wall between a woman’s bladder and her vagina weakens and allows the bladder to drop or sag into the vagina)"
What are the symptoms of hydronephrosis?,"'Hydronephrosis generally doesn’t cause any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they include:''In the case of ''electrolyte'' abnormalities, it may lead to:' Nausea Vomiting Blood in the urine Weakness or malaise Fever due to a urinary tract infection Chest pain Shortness of breath Leg swelling Sudden or intense pain in the back or side of the abdomen Cloudy urine Painful urination Heart rhythm disturbance Muscle spasms"
How is hydronephrosis diagnosed?,"'The surgeon takes the history of the patient. They may also ask you to undergo specific tests, which include:' Lab tests may include urinalysis, complete blood cell count, electrolyte analysis, and blood urea nitrogen or creatinine. Imaging studies may include computed tomography scan, ultrasound, intravenous pyelography, or X-ray."
What is the treatment for hydronephrosis?,'Acute or sudden hydronephrosis can be treated using a ''stent'' or soft tube (nephrostomy tube). The stent is inserted through the skin (percutaneously) into the kidney to drain off the urine. Treatment options for kidney or ureteral stones include:' Shock wave lithotripsy Ureteroscopy Laparoscopy
What is autism?,"'Autism is a brain disorder that makes it difficult for an individual to interact with others or communicate well. It usually shows up during a child’s first three years of life, and it can be seen in some ''babies''; however, rarely, it may not be diagnosed until a person is an adult.''Causes: The exact cause of autism is unclear. However, the child has increased chances of autism if:''Symptoms:''Treatment: The goal is to reduce symptoms and improve their learning and development.' The parents are above 35 years of age when they had a child. The mother was on anti-epilepsy drugs such as valproate when she was pregnant. There is a first-degree relative who suffers from autism. Problems with social interactions: A child might want to play alone instead of with other kids. Trouble communicating: A child might seem odd, difficult, or rude to some people because they act differently or have problems maintaining eye contact. Repeating patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities: There might be a movement, such as flapping their hands or rocking, and they might focus on following a routine. They might have an unusual attachment to objects. Sensitivity to sensory input: A child might not want to be touched or cuddled. Other signs and symptoms: A child with autism can and do give affection. But because their brains process things in a different way, they have different ways of giving and accepting love.  Applied behavior analysis: This is usually followed in schools and clinics. It helps a child learn about positive behaviors and reduce the negative ones.  Developmental, Individual Differences, Relationship-Based Approach: It’s meant to support emotional and intellectual growth by helping them learn skills around communication and emotions. This kind of treatment involves a parent or caretaker getting on the floor with the child to play and do the activities they like. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children: This treatment uses visual cues such as picture cards to help a child learn everyday skills such as getting dressed. The Picture Exchange Communication System: It uses symbols instead of picture cards. A child learns to ask questions and communicate through special symbols. Occupational therapy: This treatment helps a child learn life skills such as feeding and dressing themselves, bathing, and understanding how to relate to other people. The skills they learn are meant to help them live as independently as they can. Sensory integration therapy: If a child is easily upset by things such as bright lights, certain sounds, or the feeling of being touched, this therapy can help them learn to deal with that kind of sensory information. Medications: There is currently no medication to treat it. But some medicines can help with related symptoms such as depression, seizures, insomnia, and trouble focusing. But they will not help with autism symptoms. Studies have shown that medication is the most effective when it’s combined with behavioral therapies.Risperdal (Risperidone): It can be prescribed for children between 5 and 16 years old to help with irritability.Some doctors will prescribe other drugs in certain cases, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, anti-anxiety medications, or stimulants, but they’re not Food and Drug Administration–approved for autism spectrum disorder.

What is bronchitis?,"'Bronchitis'' or “''chest cold''” refers to the inflammation of the airways (bronchial tubes) in the ''lungs''. Air passes through the lungs within a network of tubules called bronchial tubes. Bronchitis is often associated with persistent, nagging ''coughs'' with mucus. The condition often starts as an infection of the nose, eyes, ears, or sinuses that later moves to the bronchi.\xa0''Bronchitis can be acute or chronic:' Acute bronchitis: It is a short-term condition. It is usually caused by a viral infection. Smoking may initiate or worsen the symptoms. A bacterial infection may occasionally cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually goes away in a week or two. The symptoms may at times last for three weeks. Chronic bronchitis: It is less common compared with acute bronchitis. It is defined as cough productive of sputum, lasting for three months of the year for at least two consecutive years. It may block the airflow in the lungs and is classified as a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Chronic bronchitis may begin as cough and inflammation caused by a respiratory infection or illness, exposure to tobacco smoke, or other irritants in the air. "
How does a cold turn into bronchitis?,"'Common cold'' and bronchitis can be caused by the same ''viruses''. The ''common cold'' is associated with symptoms in the nose, throat, and sinuses such as ''sneezing'', stuffy or ''running'' nose, ''headache'', and throat ''pain'' or irritation. When this infection travels down and affects the bronchial tubes, bronchitis occurs. Bronchitis may also be caused by a bacterial infection or irritation caused by ''cigarette'' smoke or air pollutants.\xa0''The occurrence of bronchitis is often preceded by symptoms of the ''common cold''. The condition further progresses to cause the following:''Owing to the ''COVID-19'' pandemic, you must consult your healthcare provider right away if you experience any symptoms such as cough, altered taste or smell, shortness of breath, or fever.' Persistent cough with mucus production Shortness of breath Fever which is usually low grade Wheezing (a high-pitched, coarse whistling sound when a person breathes) Feeling sick or having a lack of energy Chest discomfort or pain"
What is a laparoscopic hysterectomy?,"'Laparoscopic hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. The procedure is usually done under general anesthesia.''There are three kinds of laparoscopic hysterectomy:''Benefits of laparoscopic hysterectomy:''Disadvantages of laparoscopic hysterectomy:''Types of hysterectomy:' A laparoscope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera that is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision in or around the navel. It allows the surgeon to see the pelvic organs on a screen. Additional small incisions are made in the abdomen for other instruments used in the surgery. Three to four small cuts may be made in the abdomen. A cut is also made in the vagina. Probes and tools are inserted into the small incisions. The uterus and cervix are removed (possibly, ovaries and fallopian tubes) through the vagina and through the incisions. The vagina is then sewn back. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy: A small cut is made in the navel for the laparoscope, and one or more small cuts are made in the abdomen for other instruments. The uterus is detached from inside the body. It is then removed in small pieces through the incisions, or the pieces are passed out of the body through the vagina. If only the uterus is removed and the cervix is left in place, it is called a supracervical laparoscopic hysterectomy. Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy: A vaginal hysterectomy is done with laparoscopic assistance. For example, the ovaries and fallopian tubes may be detached using laparoscopy, and then, the uterus is detached and all the organs are removed through the vagina. Robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy: Some surgeons use a robot attached to the laparoscopic instruments to help perform the surgery. It allows for more complex cases to be performed in a minimally invasive fashion allowing for faster patient recovery. The cuts are smaller, and there may be less pain. The hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery may be shorter. The patient may be able to return to normal activities sooner. The risk of infection is lower. It often takes longer to perform laparoscopic surgery compared with abdominal or vaginal surgery. The longer you are under general anesthesia, the greater the risks for certain complications. Also, there is an increased risk of bladder injury in this type of surgery. Total hysterectomy: The most common type of hysterectomy, this surgery removes the entire uterus, including the cervix. The ovaries and the fallopian tubes may or may not be removed. Partial hysterectomy: This is also called subtotal or supracervical hysterectomy. In this procedure, only the upper part of the uterus is removed. The cervix is left in place. The ovaries may or may not be removed. Radical hysterectomy: All of the uterus, cervix, the tissue on both sides of the cervix, and the upper part of the vagina are removed. This is often used to treat certain types of cancer like cervical cancer. The fallopian tubes and the ovaries may or may not be removed."
When do you need cervical cerclage?,"'A cervical cerclage procedure is needed when there are chances that your cervix may open quite earlier than the expected time of delivery.''In the non-''pregnant'' stage, your cervix is normally closed and firm. After you become pregnant, the cervix goes on softening, and it opens (dilates) just before delivery. If your cervix is short or is weak enough to hold the baby, it dilates earlier (''second trimester''), resulting in premature delivery or miscarriage.''You may have a weak cervix due to''Cervical cerclage can be done as early as 12 weeks until 23 weeks. Cervical cerclage is typically not done after week 24 of pregnancy due to the risk of early water breaking and subsequent premature birth.' History of late (second trimester) miscarriages. Procedures that involve the removal of tissue from the cervix (such as cone biopsy). Damage during an abortion."
What is done before cervical cerclage?,'The doctor will check a few things before planning cervical cerclage:' Ultrasonography: This is done to check the baby’s heart rate and any major birth defects. Removing swabs of cervical secretions: This is sent to the laboratory to check if your cervix or uterus has any infection.
How is cervical cerclage performed?,"'The doctor will administer you either spinal anesthesia, regional (that covers the whole region of and near the cervix) anesthesia, or general anesthesia before the procedure. This helps you remain pain-free throughout the surgery.''There are two routes through which cervical cerclage can be performed. These are as follows:' Vaginal route: This is the most commonly used approach for performing cervical cerclage. This can be done as an outpatient procedure. This involves inserting an instrument through a speculum in your vagina and stitching the cervix by a band of thread. An ultrasound will be used to guide the doctor during the procedure. Abdominal route: This approach is adopted if the vaginal route is unsuccessful or if your cervix has injuries. You will be usually admitted for a day or two for this type of surgery."
What are the complications of cervical cerclage?,'Complications with pre-planned cervical cerclage are uncommon and occur in less than 10 out of every 100 women. They are more often seen with emergency cervical cerclage. These include:' Infection of the stitched area Premature contractions Premature rupture of the membranes (water breaking) Miscarriage or preterm delivery if the stitch fails Vaginal bleeding Cervical laceration (a tear in the cervix)
How long does it take to recover from cervical cerclage?,"'Each person recovers at a different pace. Depending upon the type of approach (vaginal/abdominal) and anesthesia type, your hospital stay can be anywhere between one and five days.''You need to avoid unnecessary physical activities for two to three days after the procedure or as advised by your doctor.''Sex is generally avoided until at least 32-34 weeks of pregnancy.''You are followed up at regular intervals (weekly or biweekly) to check the status of your cervix.''Repeat cerclage may be performed if the cervix opens again after the procedure.\xa0''The doctor removes cervical ''stitches'' (cerclage) usually at 36-37 weeks of gestation.'

How do you recognize unhealthy vaginal discharge?,"'You can easily recognize if there is a problem with your vaginal discharge. You may notice' Unpleasant odor of discharge. Change in the color of the discharge. Change in the consistency of discharge. Itching in your vagina. Burning, swelling, or redness in your vagina. Heavy bleeding or spotting (slight bleeding) from the vagina in between your actual periods."
When should you be worried about vaginal discharge?,"'Only you can notice your vaginal discharge, and if it doesn’t seem normal to you and if you find any differences in consistency, color (greenish, yellowish, brownish, or greyish), or odor, then you must meet your gynecologist.\xa0''If you have had sex and had these above symptoms, then it is important to find out whether you have contracted any ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs''). Most of the time, unhealthy vaginal discharges can be treated easily.' "
What does it mean when vaginal discharge changes?,"'It is important to pay attention to your vaginal discharge because every woman is different. You must learn to recognize what is normal for you. Do not ignore what your vaginal discharges are trying to tell you. If you have different unhealthy vaginal discharges, it may mean you have some problems such as follows:''You may experience changes in your vaginal fluids due to some diseases or in certain conditions such as follows:' Cloudy or yellowish discharge means you may have gonorrhea (clap). Frothy, yellow, or greenish fluid with a foul odor means you may have trichomoniasis (trich). Thick white cheesy discharge means you may have candidiasis (a yeast infection). White, grey, or yellowish discharge with fishy odor means you may have bacterial vaginosis (a bacterial infection), which is common in pregnancy or in the case of multiple sex partners. Bloody or brownish discharge or spotting may point to serious causes and may need an urgent medical opinion.

What is ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Ankylosing spondylitis'' (AS), also called Bechterew disease, is a chronic inflammatory disease. ''Ankylosing spondylitis'' affects the joints of the body, especially the small joints of the spine and the pelvic (hip) bone. It can also affect multiple organ systems in rare conditions. Prolonged inflammation of the joints eventually leads to the fusion of the joints leading to deformities.' "
What triggers ankylosing spondylitis?,"'The exact cause of ankylosing spondylitis is not known. A combination of age, sex, and genetic and environmental factors may increase the risk of ankylosing spondylitis.\xa0''Genetic factors'': There is a strong association of AS with\xa0HLA-B27 and HLA-B60 genes. Other genetic abnormalities associated with AS are not as common as HLA-B27. HLA (human leukocyte antigen) is a type of protein present on the surface of white blood cells that protect the body from infections.\xa0 AS is more common in people with a family history of the disease. In the case of identical twins, there is a 60 percent increased risk in the other twin.''Ethnicity'': AS is more common in people of Caucasian descent.\xa0''Environmental factors'': AS usually occurs due to genetics and environmental triggers together. The exact environmental triggers are not known but based on research, some possible triggers are:''Age'': AS is commonly seen in a younger age group of 20 years to 40 years. Rarely, younger individuals are affected by AS (10 to 20 percent). It is called juvenile ankylosing spondylitis and symptoms occur before the age of 16 years.\xa0\xa0''Sex'': AS is found to be three times more common in men than women.' Infections Toxins  Pollution  Smoking  Changes in the normal gut organisms "
Is ankylosing spondylitis an autoimmune disease? ,"'Ankylosing spondylitis is considered as an autoimmune disease. Autoimmunity of ankylosing spondylitis is linked to defects in the HLA-B27 gene, seen in people suffering from the disease. However, AS does not develop in everyone who is\xa0HLA-B27\xa0positive.' Individuals with the expression of HLA-B27 in their cells have higher chances of the immune system attacking the body’s own cells.  Defects in another protein, HLA-B60, further increases the risk of developing AS along with HLA-B27. Presence of other autoimmune diseases like psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can trigger AS."
What are the complications of ankylosing spondylitis?,"'Long-term disease with prolonged ''joint inflammation'' leads to ''chronic pain'', joint deformities, and limited range of motion. This is due to the destruction of the joints and joint fusion.\xa0''The most common deformity is seen in the spine. Chronic inflammation of the spine leads to a “hunchback” deformity. The spine can also ''fracture'' and cause compression of the spinal cord, which can lead to ''paralysis''.\xa0''AS can also affect other organ systems, causing inflammation and damage, which may sometimes be irreversible and lead to failure of multiple organs. All of these complications can be reduced through proper treatment and lifestyle modifications.' "
How is ankylosing spondylitis treated?,"'There is no cure for\xa0AS. With appropriate\xa0medical and surgical treatment,\xa0and lifestyle modifications, the disease progression can be delayed. Complications can be prevented and patients can achieve symptomatic relief with these changes and treatments. The physician will prescribe a treatment plan based on the extent of the disease and patient history.' NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), e.g., ibuprofen, can be given orally to reduce pain and inflammation.  Sulfasalazine: These drugs can be given to patients who do not respond to NSAIDs, are allergic to NSAIDs, or have irritable bowel disease. Sulfasalazine also reduced spinal stiffness and inflammation of other joints. Medication that modifies and/or suppresses the immune system: These drugs are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, interleukin inhibitors, corticosteroids, and more. They reduce inflammation, pain, stiffness, delay the disease progression, and reduce or prevent complications.  Severely damaged joints with deformity may need surgery. Joint replacement surgery can be performed on the knees and hips. Surgery to realign the spine, called an osteotomy, may also be done.  Physical therapy and posture training.  Healthy diet, exercise, and maintaining a normal body weight. Alternate methods for symptomatic relief:Using heating pads and/or ice packs, massage therapy, etc. can reduce pain and stiffness.Counseling can provide emotional support, and prevent or treat depression associated with chronic diseases. Using heating pads and/or ice packs, massage therapy, etc. can reduce pain and stiffness. Counseling can provide emotional support, and prevent or treat depression associated with chronic diseases. Avoiding environmental triggers such as smoking, exposure to harmful chemical toxins, fumes, and pollutants."
What is balanitis?,"'Balanitis'' is a condition where a man’s glans penis, or head of the penis, becomes inflamed. Balanitis generally appears only in men or boys who are not circumcised and affects one in 30 uncircumcised males. Balanitis occurs when yeast and bacteria form in the folds of skin around the foreskin and develop into an infection. The infection then causes redness, swelling, and ''pain''.''Uncircumcised men 45 and older may develop balanitis due to ''skin conditions'', weight issues, ''diabetes'', or sexual activity. Boys ages 4 and younger who are uncircumcised might develop balanitis if their genital areas are not adequately cleaned.''Balanitis generally is not a serious condition and can be treated with antibiotic creams and pills. Most occurrences of balanitis clear up within three to five days of starting treatment. Left untreated, however, it can become more painful or cause other health problems.''If you or your child is uncircumcised, it is essential to recognize the symptoms and causes of balanitis so that you can help prevent it.' "
Signs and symptoms of balanitis,"'There are many signs that you might have balanitis. You might experience:''Left untreated, balanitis can cause painful complications.

This is a rare type of balanitis that affects men over 60 and is identified by scaly warts that form on the glans."
Causes of balanitis,"'Poor hygiene'' is one of the most common causes of balanitis. The foreskin on uncircumcised men is a warm and damp area. If the skin is not washed correctly, yeast and bacteria may form between the layers of skin. These microorganisms can cause an infection, which leads to inflammation of the foreskin and glans.''You might also be at risk of developing balanitis if you:' are obese  are diabetic have contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD) like herpes simplex, chlamydia, or syphilis have eczema, psoriasis, or other dry-skin conditions have sensitive skin, especially around your genitals have reactive arthritis, which develops because of an infection have a tight foreskin that is hard to retract"
When to see the doctor for balanitis,"'When it comes to your most sensitive areas, it helps to be cautious. If you experience any symptoms of balanitis, you might want to see your doctor immediately. If you see your doctor in the early stages of balanitis, they can help you eliminate it before it develops into a more painful problem.''A few other conditions cause symptoms similar to balanitis, so it can be difficult to diagnose. A trip to your doctor is the only way to know for sure that you have balanitis. Your doctor will conduct a physical exam and run some tests to determine if you have it, as well as noting the type and cause of it.' "
Diagnosing balanitis,"'To figure out whether you have balanitis, your doctor will collect samples from any discharge, test you for ''STDs'', and take blood samples to screen you for ''diabetes'' or other medical conditions that might be causing it.' "
Treatments for balanitis,"'To treat balanitis, your doctor will most likely prescribe antibiotics (as a pill or cream) or an antifungal lotion. If a skin condition or ''allergic reaction'' is causing balanitis, they might give you a steroid cream.\xa0''Sometimes, balanitis can continue coming back, which is known as recurring balanitis. As a last resort, your doctor might decide you need a ''circumcision'' to alleviate the condition.\xa0''Prevention'"" is always better than treatment. If you're uncircumcised, take extra care to thoroughly clean your genital area with mild soap and warm water. Make sure you dry the area completely. Work to make cleaning and drying your foreskin and penis a daily routine.\xa0""'When having sex, use a ''condom'', and wash thoroughly when you finish and make sure everything is dry. If you have any symptoms of balanitis, try not to engage in sexual activity. Adding the friction and fluid exchanges of sex can make the condition worse.\xa0' "

Over-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, may help to reduce the pain and swelling. You must consult with your healthcare provider before taking these medications if you have long-term conditions such as high blood pressure, heart diseases, liver disease, kidney disease, stomach ulcers, or a history of internal bleeding in the past. Medications should be taken as advised by the healthcare provider and as per the label instructions.  If your healthcare provider permits, you may take Tylenol (acetaminophen). It, however, shouldn’t be taken by people who have liver disease. Other medications are narcotics or even anti-epilepsy medicines. If the pain is severe, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain medicines such as steroid injections. Your healthcare provider may recommend physical therapy including mild stretching exercises. TENS or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation may help relieve the pain. It is a pain-relieving method in which a mild electric current is delivered to the affected area using a small battery-operated device. "
What is diverticulitis?,"'Diverticula are small outgrowths (pouches) that develop in the ''large intestine'' in some individuals. These pockets or diverticula push out through the weak spots in the intestine. When these pouches get inflamed (swollen), the condition is called diverticulitis. It may be due to an infection or other causes. They are commonly seen in the lower part of the colon (sigmoid colon). ''Diverticulosis'' is normally a harmless condition and does not produce any symptoms or require any treatment. In some persons, however, it may get infected and cause health problems. The risk of diverticulitis increases with age. Around 200,000 people are hospitalized for diverticulitis each year in the United States.\xa0''Diverticulitis, if left untreated, can lead to many complications:' Abscess: It is a painful, swollen, infected, and pus-filled area just outside the colon wall. It may cause fever, nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal pain. Bowel obstruction: Diverticulitis may cause partial or complete obstruction of the intestine.  Perforation: It refers to a small hole or tear in the colon. Peritonitis: It is the inflammation or infection of the lining of the abdomen. It presents as fever and severe abdominal pain. Fistula: It refers to an abnormal passage between two organs or between an organ and the outside of the body. "

What causes G6PD deficiency?,"'G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition that is ''inherited'' from one or both parents. The defective gene is linked to the X chromosome, which is one of the two types of sex chromosomes. Men have only one X chromosome whereas women have two X chromosomes. Hence, in males, even one altered gene can cause G6PD deficiency, and females are more likely to be carriers since females must have mutations in both copies of the gene to present with the condition. This is the reason men are more likely to develop the condition than women.''Triggers for G6PD deficiency:''Risk factors for G6PD deficiency:' Infection Antimalarial medications Sulfonamides, a medication to treat various infections Aspirin, a blood thinner and a medication used to relieve fever, pain, and inflammation Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are used to relieve pain and inflammation Being male Being African American or of Middle Eastern descent Having a family history of G6PD deficiency"
What are the symptoms of G6PD deficiency?,"'Most patients with G6PD deficiency may not have any symptoms.

How is G6PD deficiency diagnosed?,"'The doctor may advise simple blood tests to check G6PD enzyme levels in the blood to diagnose G6PD deficiency.''Other diagnostic tests that may be advised are a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), serum ''hemoglobin'' levels, and reticulocyte count. These tests can also diagnose hemolytic anemia.''The doctor would also perform a detailed physical examination and ask for your medical history to get information on ''diet'' and medication to identify triggers.' "
How is G6PD deficiency treated?,"'Treatment for G6PD deficiency involves removing or treating the triggers that may be causing symptoms. If the condition was triggered by an infection, then the underlying infection would need to be treated accordingly with antibiotics or antiviral medications. Any medications that can destroy the red blood cells are usually discontinued. This can lead to a recovery in most cases. Once G6PD deficiency has progressed to hemolytic anemia, the treatment is more aggressive. Treatment involves oxygen therapy, ''blood transfusion'', and close monitoring.' "
What is the prognosis of G6PD deficiency?,"'Many people with G6PD deficiency never have any symptoms and live a normal life. In most cases, the patients completely recover from the symptoms when treated appropriately and the triggers are avoided (if possible). Avoiding triggers such as triggering foods and medication can prevent symptoms from developing.' "
What is genital herpes?,"'Genital herpes'' is a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'') caused by either the\xa0 herpes simplex virus HSV type 1 (HSV-1) or HSV type 2 (HSV-2). The disease is ''contagious'' and can spread through skin contact including unprotected vaginal and oral sex. Transmission usually occurs when in the early stage when there are no visible signs in the infected partner. The infection can affect any part of the body, although it is most commonly seen around the genitals, mouth or anus. Once infected, the virus may stay in the affected person for life. The ''blisters'' may heal within two to three weeks but the virus lies dormant inside the nerves causing occasional flare-ups.''Most people infected with HSV show no symptoms or very mild symptoms that may mistaken for another skin condition. Typical symptoms include a ''blister'' like ''rash'' that erupts in clusters. The ''rashes'' typically occur on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. Symptoms may occur after a period of two to twelve days after the infection.\xa0The ''rashes'' are painful and may be associated with burning or ''itching'' sensation. The symptoms are usually worst in the first episode. Recurrent outbreaks may be shorter and milder than the initial one.' "
How can I prevent getting herpes outbreaks?,"'To reduce the risk of herpes outbreaks you may consider the following:' Take antiviral medicines regularly as prescribed by your doctor Take adequate sleep to keep your immune system strong and minimize emotional stress and fatigue Follow a healthy diet as good nutrition keeps your immunity strong besides keeping you physically and mentally healthy Manage your stress levels by following practices such as regular exercise, meditation, reading and music Protect yourself from potential triggers such as sun, wind, and extreme cold and heat.

How can I manage a herpes outbreak at home?,"'The following tips may help to ease the symptoms of a herpes outbreak:' Take over the counter pain killers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin Apply cool compresses to sores many times a day for relieving itching and pain In the case of women with sores on the vaginal lips (labia), they may try urinating in a tub of water to reduce pain. Do not apply bandage to or cover the sores as air speeds healing Wash the sores gently with soap and water. Do not rub them with a towel. Gently pat dry. Never pick at the sores as this may cause infection and delay healing. Apply only the creams or lotions prescribed by your healthcare provider for the sores. Do not share your creams/ointments or lotions. Take your antiviral medications as prescribed by your provider. Wear loose-fitting cotton clothes A water based lubricant while intercourse may reduce the friction around the genitals and keep the sores away."

Ultimately, there is an increase in the size of the individual muscle fibers.''There are two ways to achieve muscle hypertrophy:''Differences between myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic muscle hypertrophy are enlisted below:''The advantages of muscle hypertrophy include:' To contract to generate body movements To provide strength for body posture Myofibrillar: The growth of muscle contraction parts Sarcoplasmic: Increased muscle glycogen storage Develops maximal strength Increased energy expenditure Increased resting metabolic rate A decrease in percent body fat"
How is muscle hypertrophy achieved?,"'Hypertrophy depends on three primary factors:''The intensity of mechanical tension from weight training is determined by the following factors:''Intense weight training that creates an overload causes muscle damage and inflammatory response, thus releasing various growth factors.\xa0''Anaerobic system exercises cause metabolic stress, leading to muscle ''fiber'' degradation. Finally, the body repairs the damaged tissue above and beyond its ability to prevent the damage caused by the same workout. The body repairs the damaged tissue while sleeping; hence, it is necessary to get seven to nine hours of ''sleep'' every day.'

How do you get rid of tension headaches?,"'To get rid of tension headaches, avoid the trigger factors. This can be difficult if the triggers are not identified or they are difficult to avoid. The following remedies can treat or prevent tension headaches:' Hot or cold packs Posture improvement Stress-reducing activities, like yoga and meditation Balanced and regular meals Regular exercise Pain killers Adequate sleep Stretching workouts Staying hydrated Timely breaks from intense tasks Avoid smoking and alcohol consumption Massage therapy Deep breathing exercises Biofeedback therapy"
Are tension headaches dangerous?,"'Tension headaches are often neglected as benign, everyday occurrences. However, ignoring a long, lingering tension headache, or suppressing it frequently with ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines, carries risks.''Some of the potential complications are:' Toxicities of excessive caffeine-containing painkillers Addiction to narcotic medications Stomach and intestinal bleeding due to overuse of anti-inflammatory painkillers High risk of seizures Headache due to medication overuse"
Do cancer treatments cause tiredness?,"'Unfortunately, yes. Tiredness is usually a side effect of all the cancer treatments. Cancer treatments include:' Cancer medications: Most and even standard cancer medications that are usually prescribed to target cancer may lead to recurrent tiredness in the patients. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy usually leaves the body depleted of energy even after the therapy. Tiredness and exhaustion are one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy: This treatment causes a serious sense of tiredness that typically lasts three to four weeks beyond the treatment. That isn’t always the case though. Sometimes, it will last for up to three months once the treatment ends. Surgery: Surgery may leave the body facing mild, moderate, or even severe exhaustion as patients recover. Many cancers require surgery to attack cancer directly, remove tumors, and prevent the spread of cancer to other areas of the body. Surgeries vary in complexity and impact on the body, and every patient is different.  Targeted cancer drugs and immunotherapy: Generalized tiredness is usually the side effect of targeted cancer drugs and immunotherapy. Targeted cancer drugs work by targeting the differences in cancer cells that help them to grow and survive. Immunotherapy usually uses the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Hormone treatment: Hormone treatment can cause tiredness because it blocks or lowers the number of hormones in the body. This treatment may be usually used in breast or prostate cancer. Cancer-related fatigue after bone marrow transplant: It may last for up to one year after the procedure."
How can a patient manage cancer-related tiredness?,"'Patients with cancers and those who are on cancer treatment may need to make a few lifestyle changes to cope up with side effects such as tiredness.' Physical activity: Staying or becoming physically active can help relieve fatigue. The type and level of physical activity may change during and after cancer treatment. Some people may benefit from working with a physical therapist. Doctors may usually discuss with patients how to be physically fit during and after cancer treatments. Counseling: Behavioral therapy may help patients to cope up with tiredness. It usually helps patients by reframing thoughts and improving sleep during cancer treatment. Stress relievers: Evidence suggests that mindfulness practices, yoga, massages, music therapy, meditation, and acupuncture may reduce tiredness in cancer survivors. Diet: Doctors usually prescribe a healthy diet that includes nutrients and vitamins. Alternatively, few supplements may also be prescribed."
What is LASIK surgery?,"'LASIK and the related surgeries aim to correct refractive errors of the eye. The usual refractive errors corrected using LASIK surgery include:''The cornea is the clear outer eye layer that lies above the ''iris'' (colored part of the eye). The cornea focuses the light falling on the eye to the lens that lies inside the eye. LASIK procedures involve manipulating and reshaping the cornea so that the image formed by the lens falls exactly on the retina (part of the eye that generates vision signals and sends them to the brain). This eliminates the need for specs or ''contact lenses''.' Myopia (near-sightedness): With this condition, you cannot clearly see far away things. Hypermetropia (far-sightedness): With this condition, you cannot read or operate laptops but things far away are clearly visible. Astigmatism: The cornea of the eye is irregularly shaped. Because of this, the image formed in the eye is blurry."
Does LASIK surgery have any disadvantages?,"'LASIK surgery is a minor procedure done on an outpatient basis. The following are the potential disadvantages of LASIK:''The LASIK may not have a favorable outcome in these patients:' Dry eyes: This is one of the common problems after the procedure. It may persist for about 6 months after the surgery. Corneal ectasia: This is more common in individuals having a thin cornea. A part of the cornea thinned during the procedure may bulge out. This thinned-out part may burst and cause a serious infection of the eye. Glares, halos around the eye: Many people may experience the inability to tolerate lights, see rainbow-like rings (halos) around the light sources, and have excessive watering of the eyes. Under correction: Removal of flaps less than what is required may not correct myopia completely. The person may still need to wear spectacles with lesser power lenses. Overcorrection: Excess restructuring of the cornea may push a nearsighted person into being a farsighted person. Flap issues: The infection of a flap or a tear of the corneal flap may result in permanent vision loss. Individuals with diabetes High myopia (more than -8 D, though up to -12 D is approved in the US) Thin cornea High eye pressure Younger than 21 years Constantly changing eye power Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis High astigmatism"
Why are vaccines given to children?,"'A ''vaccine'' is a dead or weakened germ (bacteria or virus), or part of the germ that causes a disease. ''Childhood vaccination or immunization'' is a preventive treatment administered to children for certain medical diseases such as ''measles'', ''mumps'', ''polio'', ''tetanus'', and ''diphtheria''.\xa0''When children are vaccinated for a disease, their immune system builds up antibodies that protect them from getting the disease if they get exposed to the disease-causing germ.\xa0''These diseases are caused by infections that can spread from one person to another. Thus, by vaccinating your child, you not only protect them from the disease and keep them healthy but also minimize the risk of infection from that disease in the community (herd immunity).\xa0''Vaccinating your child also helps to prevent the spread of disease to those who cannot be vaccinated, including those newborns who are too young to be vaccinated and people with weak immunity who may not effectively develop antibodies to fight the disease.' "
What are the different types of vaccines for children?,"'Each vaccine for each disease will contain a tiny amount of the virus or bacteria, or parts of the germ that causes the disease. The following are a few different types of ''vaccines'':' Vaccines containing attenuated or weakened live viruses such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine Vaccines containing killed or inactivated viruses or bacteria, such as the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) Toxoid vaccines that contain an inactivated toxin produced by the bacteria that causes the disease, for example, diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccines Conjugate vaccines containing parts of the disease-causing bacteria combined with certain proteins, for example, the Hib vaccine"
What vaccines do children get?,"'The vaccines needed for your child may vary depending upon your child’s age, health, the type of vaccines available, and where you live.\xa0''In case you plan to travel, additional vaccines (''travel vaccines'') may be needed because the disease pattern varies across different regions. Some of the vaccines are given as part of a combination vaccine.\xa0''This gets easy for the child and parents because fewer shots and healthcare visits are needed this way. You may talk with your doctor about which vaccines your child needs.''The usual vaccines administered to children are as follows:' Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) Varicella virus vaccine (VAR) Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine Polio vaccines Diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) vaccines Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines Rotavirus vaccine Hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine Meningococcal vaccines Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine Cholera vaccine Typhoid vaccines Yellow fever (YF) vaccine Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine Rabies vaccine Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine"
Are vaccines safe for my children?,"'Vaccines are important for your child. They are generally safe, and the protection they provide far outweighs the small risk of serious side effects.\xa0''Usually, the side effects are mild and temporary such as ''fever'', ''pain'', soreness, or a lump at the site where the vaccine shot was given. Your healthcare provider will guide you about the possible side effects of certain vaccines.\xa0''You must report to your doctor if your child had a serious reaction to a vaccine shot so that they may guide you on how future shots are to be given. Your doctor may ask you to avoid vaccines in some special situations; for example, children who have certain types of disease conditions or ''cancer'' may not receive certain vaccines.\xa0''Some vaccines may not be given to children who are taking ''drugs'' that lower the body’s immunity.\xa0' "
What week is the highest risk of a miscarriage?,"'Most miscarriages occur in the ''first trimester'' before the 12th week of ''pregnancy''. A ''miscarriage'' in the ''second trimester'' (between 13 and 19 weeks) happens in 1% to 5% of ''pregnancies''.''Early pregnancy loss ''is defined as a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy with either an empty gestational sac or a gestational sac containing an embryo or a fetus without fetal ''heart'' activity within the first six to seven weeks of pregnancy. This means that a miscarriage may occur if pregnancy fails to progress due to either an empty gestational sac or a lack of fetal heart activity in an embryo. The incidence of a miscarriage in the first six weeks is as high as 31%.''The risk of a miscarriage decreases by 10% after the pregnancy crosses six weeks. Once the fetal heart activity is established after six weeks, there is a decreased chance of failed pregnancy.''Early second-trimester pregnancy loss or late ''miscarriages occur after 13 and before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The incidence of second-trimester pregnancy loss is less than 1%.''Stillbirth'' or fetal death: ''Pregnancy loss that occurs at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy or at a weight of 350 grams (about ¾ of a pound) or greater is generally referred to as a stillbirth or fetal death. The approximate rate of stillbirth in the United States is 6 per 1,000 live births and stillbirths.' "
What is a miscarriage?,"'Miscarriage, also known as spontaneous abortion, is a spontaneous loss of pregnancy before the 20th week. Half of\xa0 pregnancies may end in a miscarriage. Women who experience miscarriages may subsequently have a healthy pregnancy later.' "
What causes a miscarriage?,"'Chromosomal abnormalities are one of the major causes of a miscarriage. Other causes include' Maternal age Uterine abnormalities Hormonal irregularities Infections such as herpes, syphilis or listeriosis Incompetent cervix (cervix dilates too early during pregnancy without pain or contractions) Improper implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine lining Blighted ovum (embryo implants in the uterus but doesn’t develop into a baby) Intrauterine fetal demise (embryo stops developing and dies) Molar pregnancy (tissue in the uterus forms into a tumor) Translocation (when part of a chromosome moves to another chromosome) Septate uterus (band of muscle called septum divides the uterus into two sections) Asherman syndrome (scars in the uterus that can damage the lining of the uterus)"
Who is at a risk for a miscarriage?,'Factors that may increase the risk of a miscarriage include' History of two or more previous miscarriages Over the age of 35 years old Smoking Drinking alcohol Drug abuse Being exposed to harmful chemicals Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus Obesity Hormonal problems such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Preexisting diabetes Thyroid problems Prenatal tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling Caffeine consumption Congenital heart disease Severe kidney disease Severe malnutrition Radiation Certain medications such as Accutane (isotretinoin)

What is the difference between refined wheat flour and whole wheat flour?,"'Whole wheat is made up of three parts from outside to inside, namely, the bran, germ, and endosperm.''Refined wheat is the processed form of wheat that has been stripped of the bran and germ layer sparing only the endosperm. Whole wheat flour is prepared from the raw form of wheat or whole wheat that has not undergone processing.''Refined wheat flour is used primarily to increase the shelf life of the baking products and make them tasty. The products can be used as a substitute for foods that are high in ''sugar'' content.\xa0' "
What are the bad effects of refined wheat?,"'As per the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, half of the grains that people eat should be whole grains, so it is recommended to prefer whole wheat instead of refined wheat.''The food items made from refined grains include bread, cereals, desserts, crackers, and pastries. These products made with refined flour fail to maintain your sugar levels for long, do not satisfy your hunger cravings and tend to make you binge.\xa0''Refined wheat flour is also a bad choice when it comes to keeping weight and ''cholesterol'' under check. They are known to even trigger ''migraines'' and skin problems.' "
How to find whole wheat products?,"'Colors may be misleading—brown flour does not mean it is whole wheat, and white flour does not mean it is completely refined. The brown color may be due to the added flavor. You need to read the labels and product nutrient information to ensure if the product is made from 100% wheat flour. If the food product is made from whole wheat, it will be mentioned first in the ingredient list.' "
Can whole wheat cause health problems?,"'The high ''glycemic index'' of wheat:''Consumption of whole wheat might increase the sugar levels in people with ''diabetes''. This is because of its high glycemic index. The glycemic index is a value that indicates a food item’s effect on your blood sugar levels. Wheat is a food with a high glycemic index and, hence, unsuitable for people with ''diabetes''.''Gluten'':''Gluten is a protein found in wheat that acts as the binding agent and makes the wheat flour sticky when mixed with water. It is known to cause ''allergies'' in people who are sensitive to gluten.''Gluten sensitivity can also result in severe side effects. Gluten triggers an immune reaction in some people giving rise to ''celiac disease''. The signs and symptoms of ''celiac disease'' include:' Constipation Diarrhea Alternating constipation and diarrhea Fatigue Bloating Abdominal pain Unintentional weight loss Malnutrition"
What will make a tick back out?,"'The easiest and simplest way to make a tick back out is to detach it manually with tweezers.''Here is how you should do it''After removing the tick''Avoid using any of the folklore remedies, such as''These remedies do more harm rather than clearing the tick from your skin.' Grasp the tick with the tweezers as close to the skin’s surface as possible. Pull the tick upward with steady, even pressure without twisting the tick. If the mouthparts break off from the body and stay in the skin, let them stay there and allow the skin to heal by itself. Clean the bite area and your hands by washing with soap and water or rubbing with alcohol. Dispose of the live tick byPlacing it in a sealed bagWrapping it in tapeFlushing it down the toiletPutting it in alcohol Placing it in a sealed bag Wrapping it in tape Flushing it down the toilet Putting it in alcohol In case you want to know if the tick is carrying any disease, you can send the tick to a testing lab.

What are ankle splints?,"'Splints are primarily used to stabilize injuries to bones until the patient can be evaluated by a consultant, such as an orthopedic surgeon. These are also used to achieve immobilization for primary healing or in the preoperative period. All patients with injuries that are splinted should be referred for an evaluation by a consultant within two to three days.''Ankle splints are applied to minimize movement and provide support and comfort by stabilizing an injury at the ankle joint. Immobilizing the joint reduces ''pain'' and helps the injury heal faster.' "
When are ankle splints used?,'An ankle splint is primarily used for:' Ligament sprain of the ankle. Ankle joint fractures. Fracture of the lower end of the bones of the lower legs.
When should an ankle splint not be used?,'There are no absolute contraindications for ankle splinting. The following conditions demand immediate evaluation or intervention by a doctor before splinting is done:' Complicated fracture Open fractures Injuries with associated neurovascular compromise
How is ankle splinting done?,"'There are various types of ankle splints, made from various materials. Generally, a healthcare professional applies ankle splints using different techniques.''Anesthesia''Ankle splinting is usually done without the use of anesthesia. In case of significant ''pain'' during joint manipulation or reduction of fracture, anesthesia and pain killers would be required.''During the ankle splinting''The injured limb is completely exposed. A stockinette extends from the toes to the lower calf. Soft padding is applied over the stockinette. The padding should extend two to three cm beyond the overlying plaster on both ends. Plaster of Paris (POP) is applied over the padding. A bandage wrap is applied over the wet plaster. The foot and ankle remain immobile until the splint is dry. The patient may feel some warmth released from the plaster as it dries.''In the case of a simple sprain, the doctor may advise a simple brace with Velcro clips or a bandage wrap to be worn for two to six weeks to immobilize the joint.''After the procedure''It is advised to rest, elevate and ice the injured limb. If the patient experiences ''weakness'', numbness, color change (pale or bluish), increasing pressure or pain, or spreading redness, it is advised to remove the splint and visit the emergency department right away.''The splint must be kept clean and dry. Patients can be tempted to use sticks, pens or hangers to scratch an ''itch'' inside the splint. Sticking objects into the splint to scratch an ''itch'' can wrinkle the padding and lead to pressure injuries\xa0or cause ''cuts'' in the skin, which lead to infections. The splint is usually rechecked in 48 hours by the doctor.' "
What are the complications of ankle splints?, Thermal burns may occur due to the warmth as the plaster dries Pressure sores Contact dermatitis Neurovascular compromise (damage to nerves and blood vessels) Decreased range of motion from immobilization (aftercare often requires physical therapy)
What is a digital amputation?,"'A digital amputation is the surgical removal of a portion of a finger, which can include the tip, end, or joint due to severe injury or elective surgery for a condition that has affected the finger. ' "
When are digital amputations performed?,'Digital amputations are performed for the following conditions:' Severe injury Severe infection (sepsis due to diabetic conditions) Ulcers Severe burns Tumors Restricted blood flow to a finger or digit (peripheral vascular disease) Malformations since birth
What are the goals of a digital amputation?,'The goals involved in the treatment of digital amputations include:' Preservation of function Preservation of the digit’s sensation Preservation of the nerves and other parts Early return to work Early prosthetic fitting
How are digital amputations performed?,"'Digital amputations may sometimes occur after ''severe accidents.'' The doctor may try to reattach the amputated finger under general anesthesia. After thoroughly cleaning and preparing the ''wound'', the surgeon may reattach the finger with ''stitches''.\xa0''The growth and function of the reattached finger'' always depend on the time from the accident and the age of the patient. The younger the patient the faster the recovery.\xa0''When there is severe infection or a ''tumor'','' digital amputation is necessary to restrict further damage of other parts of the hands. This procedure is also done under general anesthesia. The affected fingers are cleansed and then surgically removed. The incisions are sutured and the patient is monitored for a few days in the hospital.\xa0' "
What complications occur after digital amputation?,"'In many cases, surgery can restore much of the sensation and function to the injured finger. However, if there are complications associated with the injury itself, then the patient might have complications. Possible risks and complications include:' Infection Poor wound healing Persisting numbness or allergy Stiffness Abnormal growth Loss of function in the amputated part Painful nerve regeneration following the injury Adverse reaction to anesthesia (headache, drowsiness, and vomiting)"
How can digital amputation affect an individual?,"'Usually, the effect on the use of the hand depends on how many fingers are involved in the digital amputation, as well as to what level the finger is amputated.\xa0''A multiple-finger injury'' may cause a decrease in the ability to lift, carry, or manipulate objects. With ''single-finger involvement,'' the other fingers can assist as needed, but some strength and function may be lost.\xa0''The amputation of a finger or fingers can be a difficult adjustment both physically and psychologically, and an individual may require support from a ''mental health'' professional or counselor afterward.\xa0''Occasionally, job retraining may be necessary, and a hand therapist can assist in that process. Often single-finger amputation is considered to have a better prognosis than a multi-finger amputation.' "
What care should a patient take after digital amputation?,'After digital amputation patients are advised to:' Get adequate rest Maintain adequate hydration and blood circulation volume Take painkillers for at least a week Keep the affected area elevated and warm Frequently monitoring the area for any color changes or signs of infection  Avoid dressing in the first 48 to 72 hours to minimize manipulation of the repair Patients may be placed on blood thinners such as aspirin. Some patients may require further surgery to improve the function.
What is the recovery period after digital amputation?,"'On average, patients return to work within two to three months after a digital amputation.\xa0Studies show better functional recovery within three months, both in terms of movement and strength.' "
What is an amputation?,"'Amputation is the removal of a body part due to a pathological condition. This may include a limb or extremity such as an arm, leg, foot, hand, toe, or finger. It is usually due to an injury, disease, or surgery.' "
What is a prosthesis?,"'A prosthesis is an artificial limb used to help replace the loss of function from amputations. When deciding on a suitable prosthesis, the patient will normally have to choose between a functional and cosmetic prosthesis.' "
When are elbow and above-elbow amputations performed?,'The surgical removal of an elbow or the arm above the elbow joint is called elbow amputation. Elbow and above-elbow amputations may be performed for the following reasons:''The levels of elbow amputations can be separated into three categories:' Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The risk factors include diabetes and blood clots. Osteomyelitis (an infection in the bones) Severe injury or accidents Surgery to remove tumors or infected area from bones and muscles High amputation near the metaphyseal (shoulder joint) Diaphyseal (mid-upper arm) Supracondylar (near the elbow joint)
What are the major goals while performing elbow and above-elbow amputations?,"'Following are the major goals of an upper-extremity amputation surgery:' Maximum preservation of function Durable coverage Preservation of sensation Prevention of damage to the important nerves Minimization of short- and long-term risks Early prosthetic fitting, when applicable Early return of the patient to work and daily routine"
How are elbow and above-elbow amputations performed?,"'General anesthesia is considered for elbow and above-elbow amputations. The level of the elbow amputation will be determined by the surgeon by a thorough assessment.\xa0''Often, the cause of the amputation will decide the level of the required amputation. For example, if the amputation is due to a severe injury or infection, the amount of arm that can be preserved will depend on the location of the injury.\xa0''The surgeon will aim to preserve the arm length but will also require to be able to appropriately pad the remaining area to optimize the prosthetic (artificial) fitting.' After the anesthesia is administered, the surgeon will monitor the patient’s vitals throughout the procedure. The surgeon will also start an intravenous line for pain and antibiotics. During the amputation, the surgeon will smoothen the end of the exposed bone to try and prevent any soft tissue injury from bony edges. The surgeon will separate the nerves and remove them from the site of amputation and place them in healthy soft tissues to reduce irritation from the prosthetic socket or any other unwanted sources of contact from the wound healing. The surgeon will then perform either a myoplasty or myodesis to stabilize the bone and soft tissues.A myoplasty is a procedure in which the opposing muscles in the residual limb are stitched together to stabilize the arm.A myodesis is a procedure in which the muscles are stitched to the bone. A myoplasty is a procedure in which the opposing muscles in the residual limb are stitched together to stabilize the arm. A myodesis is a procedure in which the muscles are stitched to the bone. Both processes will work well to pad the remaining area and facilitate the use of prosthesis. The surgeon may also consider the functional limitations of amputation levels and prosthetic designs. Other factors that need to be considered are the individual’s occupation and their physical and emotional well-being."
What happens after the elbow or above-elbow amputation procedure?,"'After amputation, the patient would be on antibiotics and ''pain management'' for several days. After the surgery, the patient will be offered physiotherapy to assist in learning new skills, which will help the patient adjust to life with a missing part.\xa0''The patient may wish to be fitted with a prosthesis that can help them carry out daily functions with minimal effort. Usually, the patient may take 12 to 18 months to recover from the surgery and learn to live without the amputated part.\xa0''During this time, rehabilitation can be performed by a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. The physiotherapist will help the patient learn how to use the prosthesis and adaptive skills to compensate for the missing arm.\xa0''Treatment will start when the individual is still in the hospital. Moreover, the physiotherapist will focus on maintaining and improving overall body strength and ''fitness'' levels. While the individual is still in the hospital, the physiotherapist will work with them to reduce muscle ''weakness'' and also to assist with recovery from the surgery.' "
What is the outcome of the elbow or above-elbow amputation procedure?,"'Those who have amputations that are performed at the appropriate level and with proper surgical technique do very well. The complications are generally prevented or successfully managed.\xa0''A patient’s attitude, motivation and desire before amputation strongly influence the overall outcome after the procedure. However, if proper follow-up care and rehabilitation are not coordinated with a multispecialty team of surgeons, physical therapists, physiatrists, prosthetists, and psychologists, then the recovery may be delayed.'

This will prevent soft tissue injury from bony edges.  The surgeon will separate the nerves and remove them from the site of amputation and place them in healthy soft tissue to reduce irritation from the prosthetic socket or any other unwanted sources of contact from the wound healing. The surgeon will then perform either a myoplasty or myodesis (techniques to stabilize the bone and soft tissue). In myoplasty, the opposing muscles in the residual limb are stitched together to stabilize the arm. In myodesis, the muscles are stitched to the bone.  Transcarpal amputation: In this procedure, the arteries and their branches are separated and tied up together. The diseased bone is then removed. Rough edges are smoothened, and closure is done with padding from the finger tendons when possible. Usually, after thumb amputation, the patient will lose their pinch and grasp functions. Wrist disarticulation: In this procedure, the wrist and hand are separated from the arm. Lower arm bones are separated from the wrist bones. No bones are cut during this surgery. Forearm amputations can be partial or complete. Forearm amputations depend on the location, which include distal (away from the body) forearm amputation and proximal (near to the body) forearm amputation.  Krukenberg’s Operation: This procedure is done in patients who have a functional and neurologically intact forearm and upper arm but are missing one or both hands. The operation is accomplished by splitting the forearm bones and creating two sensate pincers that can be used to grasp objects. "

"
Why is VBAC done?,"'Some common reasons for choosing VBAC include:' Positive effects on future pregnancies: If the woman is planning to have more children in the future, VBAC can help reduce the risks of multiple Cesarean deliveries in the future. Lower risk of surgical complications: Successful VBAC is associated with a lower risk of complications, such as excessive bleeding, infection, or formation of blood clots in one or more deep veins in the body (deep vein thrombosis). These blood clots in the veins can travel to the lungs, heart, or brain, causing fatal complications. VBAC may also decrease the risk of surgical removal of the uterus (hysterectomy), injury to surrounding abdominal organs, like the bladder or bowel, muscles, nerves, and other tissues. Shorter recovery time: The hospital stay following VBAC is shorter than a repeat Cesarean delivery. The recovery time is shorter compared to a Cesarean delivery and women can resume their normal activities sooner. Individual personal choice: Some women may want to experience a vaginal delivery."
Who is VBAC ideal for?,"'A woman may be a candidate for VBAC if' She is pregnant with one baby, has a history of Cesarean delivery with low transverse (horizontal) incision without complications, and has no other contraindications to VBAC. She is pregnant with one baby, has a history of Cesarean delivery with an unknown uterine incision, and has no other contraindications to VBAC, unless it's suspected that she had a high vertical (classical) uterine incision in the previous Cesarean delivery. She is pregnant with twins or triplets, has a history of low transverse Cesarean delivery, and a candidate for twin or triplet vaginal delivery."
When is VBAC not done?,"'VBAC may be contraindicated in the following cases:' A history of a high vertical (classical) uterine incision during the previous Cesarean delivery A history of Cesarean delivery with an unknown type of prior uterine incision or suspected classical incision A history of uterine rupture due to scarring from previous uttering surgeries A history of certain uterine surgeries, such as fibroid removal A history of more than two previous Cesarean deliveries Having a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher at the time of delivery and never had a single vaginal delivery in previous pregnancies A labor that is not progressing An advanced maternal age A pregnancy that continues longer than 40 weeks Preeclampsia (a dangerous complication of pregnancy due to high blood pressure) Previous Cesarean delivery within 18 months A closed cervix requiring labor induction"
What are the complications of VBAC?,"'A successful\xa0VBAC\xa0is associated with a lesser risk of complications compared to an elective repeat Cesarean delivery. If a trial of ''labor''/VBAC fails or complications like uterine rupture occur, the doctor may perform an emergency Cesarean delivery to deliver the baby. Uterine rupture is a life-threatening complication to the mother and baby. In the case of uterine rupture, hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) may be required. Following a hysterectomy, a woman would not be able to get pregnant again. Other complications following VBAC include blood clots in the blood vessels, extensive bleeding, infection, and fetal distress.' "
What is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"'Hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' or HCM is a medical condition that causes thickening or hypertrophy of the heart muscles (the ''myocardium''). The heart is a muscular organ situated in the chest just behind and slightly towards the left of the breastbone. It roughly measures the size of the closed fist. The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are called atria (left and right atria), while the lower two chambers are called ventricles (left and right ventricles). The ''right atrium'' and ''right ventricle'' are called the right heart while the ''left atrium'' and ''left ventricle'' are called the ''left heart''. The various chambers of the heart are separated by partitions each of which is called a septum. The flow of blood through the heart is guarded by valves.\xa0''Hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' is a serious disease that affects the muscles of the heart. This leads to the thickening of the heart chambers (particularly the ventricles), ''stiffness'' of the left ventricles, and problems with the ''mitral valve'' (the valve between the left ''atrium'' and left ventricle). There are also several changes in heart cells making the cells look disorganized and irregular under the microscope. The thickening of the myocardium primarily affects the septum. This along with the thickening of the ventricles leads to the narrowing of the heart chambers. It may perturb and even obstruct the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the ''aorta'' (the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body). This condition is called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or HOCM. In non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart chambers become thickened and stiff affecting their ability to receive and pump blood, but the flow of blood is not obstructed.' "
What are the symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,"'The symptoms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may vary from person to person depending on the severity of the disease and the age at diagnosis. Some people may not have any symptoms while some may develop symptoms with time. The symptoms may include:' Chest pain: Chest pain due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically felt on doing exercise or other forms of physical activity  Shortness of breath: Patients may complain of easy fatiguability and shortness of breath on doing physical activity. They may report exercise intolerance and feeling tired even when doing a mild activity. Dizziness or fainting: Patients may report feeling dizzy or episodes of fainting (syncope). This may be caused by an irregular heart rhythm or a fall in blood pressure. In some patients, there may be no obvious cause of syncopal attacks or fainting episodes. Palpitations: This refers to a sensation of racing or pounding heartbeat Swelling over the body: Hypertrophic myopathy interferes with the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively. This may lead to fluid accumulation in the body causing swelling, particularly in the feet, legs, belly, and neck veins"
What is a bronchoplasty?,"'Bronchoplasty is a reconstruction or repair of the bronchus to restore its function.''During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes called bronchus (bronchi). The bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. The end of bronchioles opens into little air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels, and its function is to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream.''\xa0' "
When is a bronchoplasty reconstruction procedure used?,"'Bronchoplasty\xa0is used\xa0for various benign and ''malignant'' pulmonary lesions. Stenosis of the bronchus (narrowing of the bronchus) due to inflammation, infection or ''trauma'' may also require bronchoplasty.' "
When can a bronchoplasty not be performed?,"'Contraindications for bronchoplasty include:''Factors that increase postoperative risk for any thoracic surgery, including bronchoplasty are:' A psychologically unstable patient Poor cardiac (heart) status Coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) Consumption of high-dose steroids Severe underlying medical conditions Advanced age Coronary artery disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma Extensive lung resection Immunocompromised status (poor resistance) Morbid obesity Smoking history"
How is a bronchoplasty performed?,"'Before the procedure''The procedure''Various surgical techniques are available. The choice of surgical technique depends on the condition being treated, the extent of the disease and the surgeon’s discretion.''The surgical techniques are:''After the procedure' The surgeon performs a complete physical assessment, along with radiological tests (X-ray, CT scan, angiography) and laboratory tests. The patient is advised to quit smoking before surgery, as smoking delays the healing process. The patient is required to fast for at least 12 hours before surgery. Consent is obtained prior to surgery. A bronchoplasty is typically performed under general anesthesia. Open bronchoplastyIt is performed via an open thoracotomy or thoracoscopic video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). VATS is less invasive. Small incisions are made on the skin above the chest cavity to insert a thoracoscope (camera with a light source) and surgical instruments. VATS also allows for a quicker recovery and is associated with lesser postoperative pain than an open thoracotomy.

Patients are administered painkillers and antibiotics. Patients are required to stay in the hospital for three to seven days in case of open surgery. Patients can go home the same day after balloon bronchoplasty and thermal bronchoplasty. Pain, bruising and swelling may be present in the postoperative period for open surgery, which usually resolves in one to two weeks. Complete recovery would take a few weeks for open surgery."
What are the complications of bronchoplasty?,"'Complications vary depending on the surgical technique performed.''Open bronchoplasty''Thermal\xa0bronchoplasty''Balloon\xa0bronchoplasty' Air leakage Respiratory failure Pneumonia (lung infection) Bleeding Atelectasis (collapse of the lung) Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat/abnormal heart rhythm) Myocardial infarction (heart attack) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Blood clot in deep-lying veins Pulmonary embolism (PE): Blood clot in the lungs Pain and/or infection at the incision site Reaction to anesthesia Transient increase and worsening of respiratory symptoms Atelectasis Hemoptysis (coughing blood) Anxiety Headaches Nausea Chest pain Bronchospasm Airway rupture Pneumothorax (presence of air or gas in the cavity between the lungs and the chest wall, causing collapse of the lung) Hemothorax (collection of blood in the space between the chest wall and the lung) Infection"
What is thoracentesis?,"'Thoracentesis is a bedside medical procedure used to drain fluid from the space between your chest wall and ''lungs'' (the pleural ''cavity'').\xa0''Your lungs are enclosed in a two-layered covering called the pleura. There is a thin space between the two layers of the pleura called the pleural space that contains a small amount of fluid called the pleural fluid. Some disease conditions may lead to fluid collection in the pleural space (''pleural effusion''), which may prevent the normal expansion of the lungs causing several symptoms such as difficulty in ''breathing''.\xa0''Thoracentesis is a minimally invasive procedure, which means it does not involve any major surgical ''cuts'' or incisions, and is typically performed under local anesthesia. During the procedure, the doctor inserts a needle under image guidance between your ribs to withdraw fluid from the pleural ''cavity'' (''pleural effusion'').\xa0''Removing the excess fluid provides relief from the associated symptoms such as ''shortness of breath'' and chest discomfort. The fluid is then sent for lab analysis to understand the cause of the effusion.' "
When is thoracentesis performed?,"'Thoracentesis is performed when the pleural fluid gets collected in the chest (pleural effusion) and your doctor wants to determine the reason for it besides reducing your symptoms due to the effusion. Common conditions for which thoracentesis may be performed are as follows:' Pleural effusion associated with congestive heart failure (a condition in which the heart does not properly pump out blood to the body) Empyema (an area of pus in the pleural space that is the space between the two layers of the pleura) Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs) Cancer Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs) Pneumonia Liver failure Tuberculosis  Infections (viral, fungal, or bacterial) Reactions to medicines"
Is thoracentesis painful?,"'Your doctor will ensure that you feel minimal ''pain'' and discomfort during the procedure by giving local anesthesia. You may feel some ''pain'' in the area where the needle is inserted. This may happen toward the end of the procedure and should go away when the procedure is finished.\xa0''Usually, the discomfort is transient, and medication is not required for it. If you feel a lot of pain, you must tell your doctor, and they may pause the procedure.' "
How much fluid can be drained during thoracentesis?,"'The amount of fluid removed during thoracentesis varies. For instance, if thoracentesis is performed as a diagnostic procedure, then 20-100 mL of fluid may be removed. For therapeutic purposes, removing 400-500 mL of the pleural fluid is often sufficient to reduce shortness of breath. The usual recommended limit is 1000-1500 mL in a single thoracentesis procedure.' "
What are the risks of thoracentesis?,'Thoracentesis is generally a safe procedure. It does not involve any surgical incisions. The complication of thoracentesis may vary depending on the general health and other factors. Your healthcare provider will guide you before the procedure about the risks most applicable to you. The usual risks of thoracentesis include:' Pneumothorax (presence of air in the space between the lungs and chest wall causing the lungs to collapse) Bleeding Infection Pain Pulmonary edema or wet lungs (presence of excessive fluid in the lungs) Breathing difficulty Liver injury Spleen injury 
What is a thumb injection?,"'Thumb ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' can be debilitating and difficult to treat. It can negatively affect the quality of life and cause functional problems that can limit daily activities.\xa0''Thumb ''pain'' can result from ligament or tendon inflammation or an injury, a ''fracture'', or ''joint inflammation''. Moreover, thumb pain can be due to joint malalignment or dysfunction and referred pain from other areas. Diseases of the thumb can be diagnosed based on clinical presentation, radiographic tests, and ''joint aspiration'' (''arthrocentesis'').\xa0''A thumb injection is a procedure in which medications are injected into the thumb joint to treat diseases of the joint. There are different types of injections. The most common type of intra-articular injection is ''corticosteroids''. Other agents that may be used are ''hyaluronic acid'', ''infliximab'' botulinum neurotoxin (''Botox'') and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Joint injections can be done for any joint in the body.''A thumb injection is usually performed when conservative treatment fails. Conservative treatment of joint conditions, including the thumb, includes rest, ice, stretching, strengthening exercises, anti-inflammatory painkillers, and thumb spica wrist splinting. Studies have reported that the combination of ''corticosteroid'' injection with thumb spica casting may yield better results than injection alone.' "
When is a thumb injection needed?,"'Thumb injections may be indicated in the following conditions:' Tenosynovitis: It is the most common indication for a thumb injection with corticosteroids. It is the Inflammation of the tendon sheath (where the muscle connects the bone). It may occur in the hand, wrist, and foot. It is caused by trauma, joint overuse, playing racquet sports (tennis, golf, etc.) regularly, or infection. Patients present with pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the joint. A thumb injection with corticosteroid is usually effective in 80% of patients with tenosynovitis. Acute monoarticular gout or pseudogout Rheumatoid arthritis"
When should a thumb injection not be done?,"'Thumb injections may be contraindicated when there is an active local infection (in which case, infection would have to be treated first) or ''allergic reaction'' to local anesthesia (relative).' "
How is a thumb injection performed?,"'A thumb injection is a relatively quick procedure and performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain. A needle of an appropriate size and length connected to a syringe is introduced into the joint, and the medication is injected. Radiological guidance may sometimes be used to aid in injection.''After the procedure, the patient would need to rest the joint for a few minutes, soon after which they can resume normal activities with caution. The patient may experience pain, swelling, and ''bruising'', which resolve in a few days. Ice packs and painkillers can help reduce pain and ''bruising''.' "
What are the complications of thumb injections?,'Complications of thumb injections include the following:' Bleeding Infection Local skin hypopigmentation (loss of the skin pigment) Fat atrophy (depression of the skin at the location of the injection due to loss of underlying fat)
What is a tracheostomy?,"'A ''tracheostomy'' is an opening that surgeons make through the front of the neck and into the windpipe (trachea). The tracheostomy tube is placed into the opening to keep it open for ''breathing''. A tracheostomy provides an air passage to help breathe when the usual route for breathing is somehow blocked or reduced.\xa0''When health problems require long-term use of a machine (ventilator) to help breathe, a tracheostomy is often needed. In rare cases, an emergency tracheostomy is performed when the ''airway'' is suddenly blocked, such as after a severe injury to the face or neck.' "
How is a tracheostomy performed?,"'A tracheostomy is usually done under general anesthesia, but in emergencies, patients are administered local anesthesia.''The type of procedure depends on why a patient needs a tracheostomy and whether the procedure was planned. There are essentially two options:''For both the procedures, the surgeon inserts a tracheostomy tube into the hole. A neck strap attached to the faceplate of the tube keeps it from slipping out of the hole, and temporary ''sutures'' can be used to secure the faceplate to the skin of your neck.' A surgical tracheotomy can be performed in an operating room or a hospital room. The surgeon usually makes a horizontal incision through the skin at the lower part of the front of your neck. The surrounding muscles are carefully pulled back, and a small portion of the thyroid gland is cut, exposing the windpipe (trachea). At a specific spot on your windpipe near the base of your neck, the surgeon creates a tracheostomy hole. A minimally invasive tracheotomy (percutaneous tracheotomy) is typically performed in a hospital room. The doctor makes a small incision near the base of the front of the neck. A special lens is fed through the mouth so that the surgeon can view the inside of the throat. Using this view of the throat, the surgeon guides a needle into the windpipe to create the tracheostomy hole, then expands it to the appropriate size for the tube."
When should a tracheostomy tube be changed?,"'Usually, the surgeons will monitor the healing for several days after the tracheostomy. The initial tube that was placed at the time of surgery will be changed to a new tube after and between 10 and 14 days following the surgery, depending on the complications and circumstances.' "
What do you need to change a tracheostomy tube?,"'The tracheostomy tube may need to be changed if it comes out or after 10 days of regular change.''If the tracheostomy tube plugs out, healthcare providers use suction to remove secretions and then gently slide the same tracheostomy tube back into the place. The tube is usually secured and tied.''Equipment required for changing a tracheostomy tube include the following:' Clean and backup tracheostomy tube or new tracheostomy tube Emergency size (smaller) tracheostomy tube is sometimes needed Tracheostomy ties Scissors Rolled towel or blanket Soap, warm water, and two soft cloths Saline Ambu bag Tracheostomy dressing  Water-soluble lubricant  Healthcare providers usually examine the new tracheostomy tube for cracks, ridges, or any problems.  The patient may be placed in a well-lit area with a rolled towel under the shoulders to slightly extend the neck. Ties are removed while the tracheostomy tube is secure in place.  The wound is cleaned with one cloth and the neck with another cloth using soap and water. The area is left to dry for a few minutes. Usually, the tracheostomy tube is pulled out in a curving motion.  Two fingers are used to keep the wound open, and a new tracheostomy tube is inserted in curved motions while the patient’s chin is up. If the tracheostomy tube does not go in easily, the patient’s head and neck are repositioned. The tracheostomy tube is secured and tied subsequently. Suction is performed, and the patient will start breathing with a new tube."
What are the risks involved in a tracheostomy tube change procedure?,"'Every surgical procedure carries the risk of infection and excessive bleeding. Below are a few common risks involved in a tracheostomy procedure:' If the tracheostomy tube is blocked, the patient may become breathless, which is an emergency condition requiring further changes or emergency surgery. Damage to the thyroid gland in the neck Damage to the larynx (voice box) or airway, resulting in a permanent change in voice (rare) Lung collapse Airway obstruction and aspiration of secretions Air trapping in the surrounding tissues or chest. In rare situations, a chest tube may be required. Impaired swallowing and vocal function"
What are some of the most common causes of leg pain?,"'Leg pain may occur as a result of conditions that affect bones, joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, or skin of the leg. Leg pain can affect the foot, ankle, knee, thigh, or in any part of the leg.''Some common causes of leg pain include:''Some other causes of leg pain include medications (diuretics and ''statins'') and bone tumors.' Peripheral artery disease: Inadequate blood supply to the leg is the main reason for peripheral artery disease. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot in the vein of the thighs or legs leads to deep vein thrombosis. It may be manifested by redness, pain, swelling, and warmth in the leg. Peripheral neuropathy: It is a condition where the nerves that transmit the message to and fro from the brain are damaged. Electrolyte imbalance: Excessive loss of electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium, may cause cramps, weakness, or numbness in the leg. Spinal stenosis: The spaces within the bone in the spinal cord get narrow, putting pressure on the nerves of that area leading to a tingling sensation, numbness, or weakness in the leg. Sciatica: The nerves in the lower spine get pinched, which causes leg pain and can range from a bad cramp to a strong shooting pain that makes it difficult to stand or sit. Arthritis: The most common condition affecting the joints leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. Pulled muscle: Intense leg pain occurs when the muscle gets stretched extensively. Sprain: Stretching or tearing of the ligament can cause a sprain causing swelling and pain. Muscle cramp: Tightening of the muscle in the calf leads to muscle cramps, which is manifested by sharp pain and the feeling of a hard lump of muscle under the skin. Stress fracture: Overuse of muscles around the shinbone can cause a stress fracture that may not go away with splints. Tendinitis: It is the inflammation of the tendon that attaches the muscle to the bone causing severe pain and swelling. Varicose veins: In this condition, the veins need to work extra hard to get blood back to the heart making them look bulgy and twisted."
How to prevent leg pain?,"'Stretching the muscles before and after the ''exercise'' is important to prevent the pain that may result from physical activity.''Some general tips to prevent leg pain caused due to nerve damage include:' Exercise for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week Quit smoking Keep the blood sugar level and cholesterol level in check Try to maintain a healthy weight Moderate consumption of alcohol Never ignore back pain"
What is eye twitching?,"'An eye/''eyelid'' twitch (myokymia), is an involuntary, repeated spasm of the eyelid muscle. It can occur in the upper or lower lids. It is usually harmless and resolves without any treatment.' "
What causes eyelid twitching?,"'Some common causes are:''Though less common, eye twitching is sometimes the first sign of a chronic movement disorder.' Alcohol, smoking and substance abuse Exposure to bright lights Excessive caffeine consumption Fatigue Stress Lack of sleep Pollution Wind Irritation or infection of the eye or eyelids Straining of the eyes due to reading or using the computer Brain and nervous system disorders such as Bell’s palsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Tourette’s, etc. Side effects of certain medication"
What does eye twitching feel like?," The twitching or spasms are usually very mild and feel like a gentle tug or flickering of the eyelid. Some patients may experience strong spasms, causing the eyelids to shut. This is called blepharospasm. Twitching is usually unpredictable. It may occur every few seconds and last for a few minutes to hours and this may continue for several days. Twitching is usuallypainlessharmless and does not affect vision but maybe a nuisanceresolved spontaneously painless harmless and does not affect vision but maybe a nuisance resolved spontaneously"
How can I get my eye to stop twitching?," Get adequate rest and sleep. Reduce consumption of alcohol, tobacco and caffeine. Artificial tears or eye drops may help keep the eyes lubricated. Apply pressure with the palm of the hand or use a warm compress. Occasionally, the doctor may advise Botox injections into the eyelid or surgery to stop the spasms."
When should I be worried about eye twitching?,"'If the twitching does not disappear on its own, consider seeing a doctor if you face the following:' The twitching does not resolve in a few weeks. Your eyelid shuts when it twitches and there is difficulty opening the eye (blepharospasm). Twitching happens in other parts of your face or body. The eye is inflamed, irritated, red or swollen or has discharge. The eyelids start drooping. "
How can eyelid twitching be prevented?," Get adequate rest. Manage your physical and psychological stress. Reduce the intake of caffeine and alcohol. Avoid smoking. Avoid straining the eyes by taking breaks while reading, using the computer or watching TV."

When should I start cleaning my baby’s mouth?,"'Maintaining infant oral hygiene is very important because it maintains ''oral health'', clears milk and food residues and avoids buildup of bacteria. It helps the baby have healthy gums and ''teeth''. ''Baby teeth'' (also called milk ''teeth'') hold the spaces open for permanent teeth to come in. Although most ''babies'' do not start developing teeth until they are six months old, it is recommended to begin cleaning the baby’s mouth as a ''newborn'', even before the teeth appear. Teeth brushing may begin after the teeth start appearing. It is also recommended to take the baby to the dentist before the first birthday to ensure appropriate ''dental health''.' "
How do I clean my baby’s mouth?,"'The baby’s mouth may be cleaned twice a day. The following steps can be followed while cleaning the baby’s mouth' You should make the baby lie down in your or a caregiver’s lap and you should hold the baby’s head close to your chest so that you can clearly visualize their mouth. You may use a damp washcloth/soft towel to gently rub the baby’s upper and lower gums. Teeth brushing may begin after the teeth start appearing, which is usually after six months of age. You may use a soft-bristle, infant-sized toothbrush that has been approved by a dentist to gently brush the baby’s teeth with a very small amount of toothpaste. Cleaning the baby’s tongue can be a challenge because they seldom cooperate. You may try distracting the baby with interesting activities and toys to be able to clean their tongue. You may gently rub a soft cloth dipped in lukewarm water over the baby’s tongue to clean it."
How do I care for my child’s teeth?,"'Child’s teeth start erupting after six months of age. The following measures can help ensure the baby has healthy teeth''It is advised to follow-up with the pediatrician periodically to ensure oral health and overall health. It is also recommended that the child be examined by a dentist, preferably a pediatric dentist, before the age of one for teeth cleaning to ensure good oral health.' Fluoride may be added to the child’s diet at six months of age: Fluoride is a mineral that hardens the tooth enamel, prevents tooth decay and is essential for healthy teeth. Fluoride is often added to tap water in many countries. Fluoride supplements may be started after consulting the dentist. Managing discomfort due to eruption of teeth: The child may have pain and discomfort of the gums during eruption of  teeth. Massaging sore gums and offering something cold such as frozen apple slices or paracetamol can occasionally help soothe your baby's teething pain. Not all babies experience discomfort. Signs of discomfort include swelling and tenderness around the area of eruption and drooling. Teeth brushing with fluoride toothpaste: Once the child has a tooth, you can start brushing it twice a day with a pinch of toothpaste. A pea-sized portion of the paste is sufficient."
What are hemorrhoids?,"'If you’re dealing with painful or bleeding ''hemorrhoids'', you’re not alone. About one in 20 Americans have ''hemorrhoids'', and that includes half of all adults over age 50.''Hemorrhoids'' develop around the anus or in the walls of the lower rectum. The rectum is the last part of the digestive tract. It’s 6 to 8 inches long and holds solid waste before it leaves the body. The anus is the opening of the rectum.''Hemorrhoids'' can be uncomfortable, but there are treatments available. To determine what kind of treatment you need, a doctor will look at what kind of hemorrhoids you have and what your symptoms are.' "
Types of hemorrhoids,"'There are two types of hemorrhoids: internal and external. External hemorrhoids are completely visible on the outside of the body. They develop near the opening of the anus and can become painful when they swell.''Internal hemorrhoids develop inside the anus or rectum. Most of the time, you can’t see these from outside the body. Internal hemorrhoids may prolapse, which means that part of the ''hemorrhoid'' grows outside of the anal opening. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids may be painful.' "
Symptoms of hemorrhoids,"'Internal and external hemorrhoids cause slightly different symptoms .''External hemorrhoids can cause:''If you strain while moving your bowels or rub too much around your anus, you may make the symptoms of external hemorrhoids worse. Symptoms usually get better within a few days.''Internal hemorrhoids may cause:''Pain'' from internal hemorrhoids usually happens when the ''hemorrhoid'' has prolapsed. Fully-internal hemorrhoids may be painless but still cause bleeding.' Itching near the anus Aching or pain, particularly when sitting Tender, hard lumps near the anus Bleeding that is visible on your stool, in the toilet bowl, or on the toilet paper after you move your bowels Painful tissue around the anus"
Causes of hemorrhoids,"'Hemorrhoids develop when the blood vessels in the rectum and anus swell or bulge. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including:' Straining during bowel movements Sitting on the toilet for extended periods Frequent diarrhea or constipation Weakened anal and rectal tissue due to aging Frequent heavy lifting Pregnancy"
When to see the doctor for hemorrhoids,"'You should see your doctor if you experience either of the following:' Bleeding from the rectum, which may be a sign of a more serious medical condition Severe or recurrent pain"
Diagnosis for hemorrhoids,"'If you have external hemorrhoids only, your doctor may be able to diagnose them by looking at them and touching them with gloved fingers.''To diagnose internal hemorrhoids, the doctor will need to feel and look at the inside of the anus and rectum. They’ll feel for growths using a lubricated, gloved finger. They’ll also use a special instrument to see inside the rectum.\xa0\xa0''If the doctor suspects that hemorrhoids may not be the cause of your discomfort, they may order a procedure called a ''colonoscopy''. This involves a small viewing tube that lets the doctor see your intestine.' "
Treatments for hemorrhoids,"'Treatments for hemorrhoids range from at-home therapies to outpatient surgeries.''If your hemorrhoids don’t respond to at-home treatments, your doctor might suggest treating them during an office visit or at a local medical center.''In-office procedures treat hemorrhoids by creating ''scar tissue'', which ''cuts'' off the hemorrhoid’s blood supply. Possibilities include:''Another option is the rubber band ligation. During this procedure, a doctor cuts off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid using a special rubber band tied around the hemorrhoid’s base.''The outside of the hemorrhoid then shrivels and falls off. ''Scar'' tissue forms in the remaining part of the hemorrhoid and shrinks it.''Rarely, hemorrhoids will need surgery to remove. This usually happens if less invasive procedures haven’t been successful. There are two basic types of hemorrhoid surgeries.''A hemorrhoidectomy involves a doctor cutting away external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids that have fallen out of the anus. Doctors perform this procedure under anesthesia.''Hemorrhoid stapling uses a special surgical tool to block blood flow to internal hemorrhoids. It has a shorter recovery time than hemorrhoidectomy, but hemorrhoids are more likely to come back.' Some people choose to treat hemorrhoids at home by: Eating high-fiber foods Taking stool softeners or fiber supplements Staying hydrated Avoiding sitting on the toilet for long periods Taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen Sitting in warm water to relieve pain  Sclerotherapy, which uses an injected solution Infrared photocoagulation, which uses infrared light that generates heat Electrocoagulation, which uses an electric current"
What is done before the obstetric ultrasound?,'There are no special precautions that you need to take before coming for the ultrasound. You might be asked to drink water up to six glasses or until you feel like peeing. You would not be allowed to go to the washroom before you get your ultrasound done. Your full bladder helps the doctor to visualize your baby more clearly.' 
How is an obstetric ultrasound performed?,"'You will be asked to rest on your back.''A small quantity of a clear, lubricant gel will be applied to your abdomen.''Next, the doctor will move a small device (called a transducer) over your abdomen while applying a little pressure. They can also use a tubular probe into your vagina that functions similar to the transducer.''You may be asked to hold your breaths several times during the procedure.''The transducer emits high-frequency sound waves to the internal structures, including your uterus, its surrounding organs/structures, and your baby. These sound waves are reflected and captured by the transducer. The transducer then displays the captured waves onto the screen in the form of white and black images. Your doctor can help you see your baby in the images.''Getting an obstetric ultrasound is a very simple, safe, and painless test that takes around 30 minutes. You will only feel minimal discomfort due to the pressure of the transducer on your abdomen.' "
What happens after the obstetric ultrasound?,'The gel will be cleaned from your abdomen and allowed to go home as soon as the test ends. You will need to collect the reports during which the doctor will discuss the results of the test with you.' 
When should you not close a wound?,"'Wounds should not be closed in the following conditions' Wounds with high chances of infection should be kept open for greater than 24 hours or should not be stitched for adequate cleaning and antibiotic treatment to prevent the risk of infection.

When should you screen for prostate cancer?,"'Screening for prostate cancer'' helps detecta ''tumor'' early, enabling timely treatment and ''prevention'' of any complications. According to the American ''Cancer'' Society (ACS), the decision to get screened should be made by men in consultation with their doctor. The doctor needs to counsel the men about the uncertainties involved in the screening process, the risks and potential benefits of getting screened for ''prostate cancer''. The risks for ''prostate cancer'' include:''You must ask your doctor about getting screened for prostate cancer if''If a man is not able to decide whether they should go for screening after a discussion with their doctor, the doctor can recommend screening keeping in mind the man’s general health preferences and values. Most health experts recommend that screening should not be done if a man is around the age of 70 years old or if he has other serious medical conditions that limit his life expectancy.' Age: The chances of getting prostate cancer increase with age. Most experts recommend considering screening when a man is in his 50s. Race: African American men are at a greater risk of developing prostate cancer. Family history: There is a higher risk of prostate cancer in men who have a close family member (father, uncle or brother) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). Heredity: Certain genetic conditions may increase the risk of prostate cancer. Diet: Men who have a diet rich in animal fats and low in fruits and vegetables may have greater chances of getting prostate cancer. You are in your 50s and have an average risk of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is usually slow growing. Thus, men who do not have any symptoms of prostate cancer and do not have a life expectancy of at least 10 years may not be screened since they are not likely to benefit. You are 45 years old and are at high risk of developing prostate cancer. High-risk groups include African Americans and men who have a first-degree relative (father or brother) diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than age 65). You are 40 years old and have an even higher risk of prostate cancer. This includes people who have more than one first-degree relative who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age."
Which test is done for screening of prostate cancer?,"'There is no single, standard test for screening for prostate cancer. The screening commonly is done with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. This test measures the blood levels of PSA, which is a substance made by the prostate. An ''ultrasonography'' may be done if PSA values are dubious. Another commonly used test that may be done for screening is the digital rectal examination or DRE. During a DRE, the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into a man’s rectum and feels the prostate for anything abnormal, such as cancer.' "
Should I get screened again for prostate cancer if my first screening came back negative?,"'If screening revealed that you do not have prostate cancer, you need to get repeat screening based on the results of the PSA blood test.' If your PSA was less than 2.5 ng/mL, you may need to be retested every two years. If your PSA level was 2.5 ng/mL or higher, you need to be screened annuallyfor prostate cancer."
When should you start HIV medication?,"'In general, medical professionals now believe the best chance for an ''HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'') patient to protect and maintain their immune system health is to start aggressive treatment upon diagnosis in almost all cases. In the past, doctors thought that waiting until disease markers on blood tests reached a certain level could be better for the patient’s chances of survival and quality of life. Despite the potential danger of viral resistance and long-term drug side effects, studies have subsequently shown that starting antiviral medication early is the best option for nearly all people with ''HIV''.''After 40 years of researching ''HIV/AIDS'', clinicians, drug researchers, epidemiologists, and public health professionals have succeeded in making the virus much less deadly. Part of this effort included developing treatment guidelines about when, how, and under what conditions to initiate antiviral therapy to control the ''HIV'' infections.''AIDS'' (''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'') is the end result of unchecked ''HIV'' infection. In other words, not all people with ''HIV'' have ''AIDS'', but everyone with ''AIDS'' has ''HIV''. “''AIDS''” describes the immune system collapse that opens the door for opportunistic infections and ''cancers''. Without successful intervention, these secondary conditions typically kill the patient.''Most people with HIV infection can now live long and relatively healthy lives, as long as they stick to the antiviral drug cocktail prescribed by their treatment team. In most cases, the current treatments started at the right time can prevent the virus from causing full-blown ''AIDS''.' "
How do doctors treat HIV infections?,"'First, there is no evidence that people infected with HIV can be cured by the currently available therapies, although research related to curing people of infection is underway. In general, those who are treated for years and are repeatedly found to have no virus in their blood by standard viral load assays will experience a prompt rebound in the number of viral particles when therapy is discontinued. Consequently, the decision to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) must balance the risk versus the benefits of treatment. The risks of therapy include the short- and long-term side effects of the ''drugs'', as well as the possibility that the virus will become resistant to the therapy, which can limit options for future treatment. The risks of both of these problems are quite small with the treatment options currently available.'""A major reason that a person’s infection develops resistance to a particular drug regimen is the patient's failure to correctly follow the prescribed treatment, for example, by not taking the medications at the correct time. If virus remains detectable by blood test on any given regimen, resistance eventually will develop. Indeed, with certain ""'drugs'', resistance may develop in a matter of weeks, such as with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) ''lamivudine'' (''Epivir'', 3TC) and ''emtricitabine'' (''Emtriva'', FTC), the drugs in the class of nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) such as ''nevirapine'' (''Viramune'', NVP), ''delavirdine'' (''Rescriptor'', DLV), ''efavirenz'' (''Sustiva'', EFV), and rilpivirine (Edurant, RPV), as well as the integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) such as ''raltegravir'' (''Isentress'', RAL) and elvitegravir (Vitekta, EVG).''Thus, if these drugs are used as part of a combination of agents that do not suppress the viral load to undetectable levels, resistance will develop rapidly and the treatment will lose its effectiveness.''In contrast, HIV becomes resistant to other drugs, such as the boosted ''protease inhibitors'' (''PIs''), over months. Resistance also seems to be relatively uncommon with some of the newer InSTIs, such as dolutegravir (Tivicay, DTG) and bictegravir (BIC), which is only available as a combination pill (Biktarvy) with ''tenofovir'' alafenamide (TAF) and ''emtricitabine'' (FTC). It is important to note that when resistance develops to one drug, it often results in resistance to other related drugs, so-called cross-resistance. Nevertheless, HIV-infected individuals must realize that antiviral therapy can be, and typically is, very effective. This is the case even in those who have a low CD4 cell count and advanced disease, as long as ''drug resistance'' has not developed. CD4 cells are a type of immune cell used as a bellweather to judge the degree of HIV infection. The lower the count of CD4 cells in tests, the more advanced the infection. When should antiviral therapy be started? Until very recently, one of the biggest questions related to the management of HIV disease was the optimal time to start antiviral treatment. For some time, there had been very strong data demonstrating that therapy is appropriate for those with CD4 cells numbering less than 350 cells/mm3 in the blood. There have also long been strong recommendations to treat patients with select conditions regardless of their CD4 cell count, such as having HIV during ''pregnancy'', in order to prevent transmission of HIV to the baby. Other cases that need immediate treatment are those who have HIV-associated ''renal disease'' or chronic ''hepatitis B'' infection where the antiviral treatment for HIV also treats the ''hepatitis'' virus.''Several large studies have shifted all guidelines around the world to recommending treatment of all HIV-infected individuals at the time of diagnosis no matter what the CD4 cell count.''Regardless, prior to initiating antiviral therapy, everything possible should be done to ensure that the patient is committed to the treatment, able to adhere to the regimen, and will follow up with his or her health care professional to assess whether medications are tolerated and working.''Guidelines for starting antiviral therapy have been proposed by panels of experts from several groups, including the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/) and International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA). There are similar guidelines for treatment throughout Europe and by the World Health Organization for treatment in resource-limited countries. Until recently a recommendation supporting the start of therapy in those with CD4 cells greater than 500 cells was based upon evidence that ongoing viral replication, even in the setting of high CD4 cell counts, may be associated with damage to the brain, kidneys, ''heart'', and possibly even ''liver''. Along with this rationale, it was clear that newer regimens were easy to take, including a growing number of one-pill-per-day options, with minimal side effects. Another compelling argument that can be made for early therapy is the ability to reduce the risk of transmission to uninfected partners.''A study called HPTN 052 demonstrated that among couples in which one person is HIV-infected and the other is not, those who were on antiretroviral therapy were 96% less likely to transmit HIV to their uninfected partner than those not on treatment.''Finally, a large study was recently reported that demonstrated unequivocally that starting therapy even with a CD4 cell count of greater than 500 cells/mm3 was associated with less risk of disease progression than waiting until CD4 cells were less than 350 cells/mm3. This study was called the START study and demonstrated a major reduction in disease progression with early therapy with virtually no increased risk for side effects. Based upon START, HPTN 052 and other accumulated data, currently all major guidelines around the world, including those of the World Health Organization recommend that antiretroviral therapy be initiated in all HIV-infected patients at the time of diagnosis. It is worth noting that these recommendations for universal treatment of HIV-infected patients will be limited by resources available for antiviral treatment in resource-limited countries.''Before starting treatment, patients must be aware of the short- and long-term side effects of the drugs, including the fact that some long-term complications may not be known. Patients also need to realize that therapy is a long-term commitment and requires consistent adherence to the drugs. In addition, clinicians and patients should recognize that ''depression'', feelings of isolation, ''substance abuse'', and side effects of the antiviral drugs can all be associated with the failure to follow the treatment program.' "
Should patients with the flu- or mono-like illness of primary HIV infection be treated?,"""There are theoretical reasons why patients identified with HIV around the time they are first infected (primary, acute infection) may benefit from the immediate initiation of potent antiviral therapy. Preliminary evidence suggests that unique aspects of the body's immune response to the virus may be preserved by this strategy. It is thought that treatment during the primary infection may be an opportunity to help the body's natural defense system to work against HIV. Thus, patients may gain improved control of their infection while on therapy and perhaps even after therapy is stopped.""'At one time, the hope was that if therapy was started very early in the course of the infection, HIV could be eradicated. Most evidence today, however, suggests that this is not the case, although research will certainly continue in the coming years in this area. Recent data demonstrated that a subset of those starting ART within the first weeks of infection were able to stop therapy after many years and maintain good viral control off treatment. While this response does not occur in the majority of similarly treated patients, the observations are intriguing and an area of ongoing research. Regardless, at least for now it is premature to think that early treatment may result in a cure, although other benefits may still exist, including avoiding the substantial damage to the immune system that occurs during the first weeks of infection.''In addition, these individuals have very high levels of virus in their blood and genital secretions, and early treatment might reduce their risk of transmitting HIV to others. There also is evidence that those who develop such symptoms during the early days of infection may be at greater risk of disease progression than those who become infected with minimal or no symptoms. Due to the absence of definitive data, guidelines vary. Because doctors now recommend all patients initiate therapy at the time of diagnosis, it is generally recommended that patients with primary infection be offered early therapy.' "
What about treatment for HIV during pregnancy?,"'One of the greatest advances in the management of HIV infection has been in ''pregnant'' women. Prior to antiviral therapy, the risk of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her ''newborn'' was approximately 25%-35%. The first major advance in this area came with studies giving ZDV (''zidovudine'') after the ''first trimester'' of ''pregnancy'', then intravenously during the delivery process, and then after delivery to the ''newborn'' for six weeks. This treatment showed a reduction in the risk of transmission to less than 10%. There is strong data that women who have viral suppression during pregnancy have a very low risk of transmitting HIV to their baby, perhaps even less than 1%. Current recommendations are to advise HIV-infected ''pregnant'' women regarding both the unknown side effects of antiviral therapy on the fetus and the promising clinical experience with potent therapy in preventing transmission. In the final analysis, however, pregnant women with HIV should be treated essentially the same as nonpregnant women with HIV. The choice of medications in this situation should be determined after consultation with an expert in treating HIV-infected pregnant women.''All HIV-infected pregnant women should be managed by an obstetrician with experience in dealing with HIV-infected women. Maximal obstetric precautions to minimize transmission of the HIV virus, such as avoiding ''scalp'' monitors and minimizing ''labor'' after rupture of the uterine membranes, should be observed. In addition, the potential use of an elective Caesarean section (''C-section'') should be discussed, particularly in those women without good viral control of their HIV infection where the risk of transmission may be increased. ''Breastfeeding'' should be avoided if alternative ''nutrition'' for the infant is available since HIV transmission can occur by this route. When ''breastfeeding'' is done, it should be in conjunction with antiretroviral therapy for the mother if at all possible. Updated guidelines for managing HIV-infected women are updated on a regular basis and can be found at https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/.' "
What can be done for people who have severe immunosuppression?,"'Although one goal of antiviral therapy is to prevent the development of immune suppression, some individuals are already immunosuppressed when they first seek medical care. In addition, others may progress to that stage as a result of resistance to antiviral drugs. Every effort must be made to optimize antiviral therapy in these patients. In addition, certain specific antibiotics should be initiated, depending on the number of CD4 cells, to prevent the complications (that is, the opportunistic infections) that are associated with HIV immunosuppression. Guidelines for the ''prevention'' of opportunistic infections can be found at https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/.''In summary, patients with a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mm3 should receive preventative treatment against Pneumocystis jiroveci with ''trimethoprim''/''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim'', ''Septra''), given once daily or three times weekly. If they are intolerant to that drug, patients can be treated with an alternative drug such as ''dapsone'' or atovaquone (''Mepron''). Those patients with a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells/mm3 who also have evidence of past infection with Toxoplasma gondii, which is usually determined by the presence of Toxoplasma antibodies in the blood, should receive ''trimethoprim''/''sulfamethoxazole''. ''Toxoplasmosis'' is an opportunistic parasitic disease that affects the brain and ''liver''. If a person is using ''dapsone'' to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci, ''pyrimethamine'' and ''leucovorin'' can be added once a week to dapsone to prevent ''toxoplasmosis''. Finally, patients with a CD4 cell count of less than 50 cells/mm3 should receive preventive treatment for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection with weekly ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax''), or as an alternative, twice daily ''clarithromycin'' (''Biaxin'') or ''rifabutin'' (''Mycobutin''). MAC is an opportunistic bacterium that causes infection throughout the body. Many of these drugs can be stopped if initial antiviral therapy results in good viral suppression and sustained increases in CD4 cells.' "

What are night sweats?,"'Night sweats or ''sleep'' ''hyperhidrosis'' are episodes of ''excessive sweating'' or ''perspiration'' that happen during ''sleep''. They are often described as soaking or drenching and may require a change of sheets or even clothes. Night sweats can occur during sleep and without physical exertion. They aren’t caused by a heavy blanket or warm bedroom. Instead, other underlying health issues may be responsible for these episodes of considerable ''sweating'' in the sleep. Night sweats can reduce sleep quality, concern a bed partner, and provoke serious discomfort.' "
What are the causes of night sweats?,"'There are many different causes of night sweats. Most common include:' Idiopathic hyperhidrosis: Idiopathic hyperhidrosis is a condition in which the body severely produces too much sweat without any identifiable medical cause. Hormone disorders: Sweating or flushing can be seen with several hormone disorders such as hyperthyroidism. Neurologic conditions: Neurologic conditions including stroke and autonomic neuropathy may cause increased sweating and may lead to night sweats. Infections: Tuberculosis is the infection most commonly associated with night sweats. However, bacterial infections, such as endocarditis (inflammation of the heart valves), osteomyelitis (inflammation in the bones), and abscesses can also cause night sweats. Night sweats are also a symptom of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Lifestyle: Excessive intake of drugs, alcohol, and caffeine intake can also increase the risk of night sweats. Late-night eating, excess stress, or workload may also increase night sweats.  Medications: Certain medications are known to be associated with night sweats. These include some antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), steroids, and medicines taken to lower fevers such as aspirin or acetaminophen that may paradoxically cause sweating. Low blood sugars Menopause Cancers Other medical conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), heart failure, anxiety, and panic attacks have been correlated with night sweats."
How can night sweats be treated?,"'The most effective treatment for night sweats will vary for any individual patient and should always be overseen by a health professional. Some potential treatment methods include modifications in environment and behavior, ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT''), and medications.' Lifestyle modifications: Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods; drinking sufficient cold water; maintaining a healthy weight; utilizing relaxation techniques, and wearing breathable clothing before sleeping are few modifications that may relieve night sweats. CBT: It is a type of talk therapy that is commonly used for health problems such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. It is normally conducted in-person by a psychiatrist or counselor, but several self-directed programs have been developed. Studies have found that CBT for hot flashes and night sweats can reduce their frequency and improve mood and quality of life in menopausal women. CBT is compatible with other approaches, such as behavior modifications, and likely has the greatest effect on night sweats when combined with other approaches. Medications: Sometimes, existing medications may cause night sweats; changing the prescription, dosage, or when the drug is taken may resolve night sweats. If the night sweats are caused by an underlying infection or hormone problem, medication to treat the underlying condition may help in relieving the symptoms. Several types of drugs, notably hormone therapies, can reduce night sweats, but these drugs can have significant side effects. A doctor may be in the best position to discuss the benefits and downsides of any specific medication."
What is the outcome of patients with night sweats?,"'Night sweats affect many people. They are sometimes not a cause for concern, but they can interrupt sleep and reduce the quality of life. In some cases, night sweats are a sign of a health issue that requires attention. Sleeping in a cool room with bedding and pajamas made from light natural fabrics may help. If not, a doctor can recommend other approaches, which may include medications and therapies. Therapy along with lifestyle changes helps most people have a good quality of life.' "
What type of headaches are dangerous?,"'Almost everyone must have experienced a headache at some point in their life.''The most common reasons for your headache are ''migraines'', tension headaches, ''cluster headaches'', and sinus headaches.

Brain aneurysm: It is weakening of the wall of a blood vessel that causes it to bulge. Intracerebral hematoma: It is bleeding in the brain that results in the pooling of the blood. Intracranial hematoma: It is a collection of the blood in the skull, most often as a result of head injury. Bleeding around the brain: This can be in the form of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, a subdural hematoma, or an epidural hematoma. Acute hydrocephalus: It is a buildup of fluid in the skull that causes it to swell. Pseudotumor cerebri: It is a buildup of pressure inside the skull that results in signs and symptoms similar to a tumor but is not a tumor. Meningitis: It is an infection or inflammation in the tissue that surrounds the brain. Encephalitis: It is an infection or inflammation in the brain. Temporal arteritis: It is swelling of the arteries in the temple and behind the eye.

Skin cuts Surgical wounds: Intended cuts in the skin to carry out a surgical procedure. Gunshot wounds: Wounds resulting from firearms. Thermal wounds: Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, can result in injuries (burns, sunburns, and frostbite). Chemical wounds: Contact with or inhalation of chemical materials can result in skin or lung injury. Bites and stings: Bites resulting from humans, dogs, bats, rodents, snakes, spiders, and ticks can result in skin injury. Electrical wounds: Passage of high-voltage electrical currents through the body can result in superficial burn-like or sting-like wounds and severe internal damage. Clean Clean and contaminated: A normal wound, but a colonized tissue. Contaminated: A wound containing foreign material. Infected: A wound with pus."
What are the factors that affect wound healing?,'Factors that affect wound healing and the potential of infection include' Age Underlying diseases Blood supply to the affected part Presence of a foreign body in the wound Injured organ or tissue The intensity of the injury Characteristics of injury Contamination or infection The duration between trauma and treatment
What is the importance of birthing classes during pregnancy?,"'Birthing classes play a crucial role in preparation for having a baby. They help create confidence in the parents-to-be by making them understand the various aspects of ''childbirth''. These classes help people to share their concerns, doubts, and experience related to ''childbirth''. Most of the birthing classes are designed to involve the expecting mother and her partner (a spouse, friend, or relative) to get involved in the journey toward having a baby. The partner in turn becomes a great source of support and encouragement to the expecting mother. Birthing classes are important, not just for first-time parents but for people who already have children. This is because they act as refresher classes for the ones who have been through this experience.''Birthing classes help people learn about' The various methods of delivery. Painless labor and options for such. Staying healthy during pregnancy, including a proper diet and exercise during pregnancy. Pain management options during labor. The signs that tell you that you are going in labor. What has to be done when the water breaks. How to make the delivery experience more comfortable, including the techniques for breathing and relaxation. Basics of breastfeeding. Caring for the newborn at home including first aid for the baby."
What are the various types of birthing classes in the United States?,"'Two of the most popular birthing classes in the United States are as follows:' Lamaze: This birthing technique is quite popular in the United States. The essence of this method is making a woman comfortable during labor so that she can make her own decisions. It focuses on breathing techniques that help move focus away from the pain of contractions. It uses other relaxation techniques including walking, massage, and using a birthing ball (similar to an exercise ball). Although Lamaze encourages natural childbirth without using medications or epidural anesthesia, a woman practicing Lamaze can also take medications during her labor. Bradley method: The Bradley method is a 12-week course that focuses on having a baby with no or minimal need for medications. It includes a detailed curriculum and study guide to prepare you for the entire process of having a baby starting from pregnancy. It prepares both the mother and her birthing partner who acts as a coach to participate in her journey of having a baby. The coach learns how to support and guide the mother through the pain. The Bradley method also teaches about effective birthing positions to minimize the pain."
Where do bed bugs hide?,"'Bed bugs live usually in the cracks and crevices of beds. When they sense that a person is asleep, they move toward them and feed on their blood. Bed bugs can also be found in sofas, mattresses, chairs, sheets, blankets, suitcases, cardboard boxes, cluttered areas, and other similar furniture items.' "
How do bedbugs survive?,"'Bed bugs are blood-sucking insects. They usually live on the blood of other creatures for their survival and breeding. Bed bugs usually feed on humans and other warm-blooded hosts to survive and reproduce. They find a host by detecting carbon dioxide emitted from warm-blooded people or animals and respond to warmth/moisture. To feed, they penetrate the skin of the host and inject a salivary fluid that contains an ''anticoagulant'' to help them obtain blood.' "
Do bed bugs cause any health issues?,"'Even without disease transmission, bed bugs are known to affect health in ways that may become serious. Few common health issues due to ''bedbugs'' include:\xa0' Blood loss: Many bites over time can cause significant blood loss and potential anemia. Depending on the stage of the bedbug, they may feed for as little as 3 minutes or as long as 10-15 minutes. They prefer to feed at night on exposed areas such as the hands, neck, arms, and face. Heavy rates of feeding have been known to cause significant blood loss and eventually lead to anemia and other complications, especially in children. Allergic reactions: As per research, 70% of people may have allergic reaction bed bugs, which may sometimes lead to life-threatening situations. Allergies to their droppings and remains may cause asthmatic attacks in susceptible people. Allergies to the bite, caused by bed bug saliva, can trigger hives, rashes, itching, and burning. Infection: Bedbug bites can be very itchy, leading to a strong urge to scratch it until the itch goes away. A few patients develop severe systemic reactions including trouble breathing, severe infections, and difficulty breathing. Because bedbugs often bite in the middle of the night during sleep, people scratch them, leading to flesh wounds in the morning. Small open wounds from continuous scratching may lead to germs and bacterial infection if left untreated. Scarring can occur and persist for months or longer. Emotional and psychological effects: Some people have been known to respond to bedbug infestations with insomnia, fear, stress, anxiety, and even paranoia. Sometimes, they become too distressed to sleep due to the fear of being bitten, and the lack of sleep can sometimes trigger depression and emotional anxiety."
How to treat a bedbug bite?,"'Bed bugs may be treated at home; however, in severe cases, it may need immediate medical attention:' Bite sites should be washed with soap and water. A steroidal anti-itch cream should be applied that contains hydrocortisone or cortisone. Calamine lotion may dry out the rash. Oral antihistamine or allergy tablets may control swelling and rash caused by the bites. Topical anesthetic that contains pramoxine for pain relief and diphenhydramine for itch control may be used. Pain relievers that contain ibuprofen or naproxen may also be used. If wounds have pus, topical application of antipruritic agents such as paroxime, doxepin, or corticosteroids such as triamcinolone may be helpful. Sites that appear to be secondarily infected may benefit from topical mupirocin or systemic antibiotics as appropriate. Systemic allergic reactions to bedbug bites may be treated with intramuscular epinephrine, followed by antihistamines and corticosteroids when appropriate. "
What medications can be given using a subcutaneous injection?,"'Medications injected by a subcutaneous injection are usually medications that can be given in small volumes (up to 2 mL). Some common medications include:' Insulin may be administered using the traditional insulin syringe or in the form of an automated injector, insulin pen. Hormones for hormone therapy Fertility medication Epinephrine to treat allergic reactions. It comes in an automated injector form called the EpiPen. It can also be given intramuscularly (injected into the muscles). Steroid medication such as dexamethasone to suppress inflammation Allergy shots Blood thinners Pain medications such as morphine Anti-nausea and anti-vomiting medications such as metoclopramide Certain vaccines"
How is a subcutaneous injection given?,"'Equipment used for subcutaneous injections includes:''Before injection:''The individual or caregiver should first wash their hands thoroughly or use an ''alcohol''-based hand sanitizer.\xa0Following this, all the supplies required should be gathered, such as the syringe or auto-injection pen, alcohol swabs, some cotton or gauze, and a band-aid.''The injection site should be disinfected using an alcohol swab. The injection site should not have any swelling, redness, ''bruising'', hardness, change in the skin texture or color, irritation, ''pain'', or dilated veins. If these abnormalities are present, an alternate injection site may be chosen. To prevent damage to an area as a result of repeated injections at the same site, it is advised to change the injection site often. The syringe should then be loaded with medication. In the case of an auto-injection pen, this is not required every time, and the vial needs to be changed once it’s completely over. It’s advised to follow the dosage advised by the doctor accurately. A new needle is required for the syringe with every injection. The auto-injection pen can be reused by the same person with the same needle. The needle may be disinfected using an alcohol-based disinfectant.''During injection:''Once the appropriate site of injection is identified, the skin should be pinched between the thumb and index finger (around an inch and a half apart) and held in that position till the procedure is completed. This pulls the fatty tissue away from the underlying muscle, making the injection safer and easier. The needle should be held at an angle of 90° or at an angle of 45° if the person is thin with very little fat. This should be done quickly, without applying too much force. The entire medication loaded in the syringe with the prescribed dose should be slowly pushed into the pinched injected site. The pinched skin can be released as the needle is withdrawn. Mild pressure may be applied after the injection to prevent bleeding. There is usually no more than one to two drops of blood loss during a subcutaneous injection. There may be minimal swelling and ''bruising'', which resolves on its own. Subcutaneous injections should not be administered in the same spot twice in a row to avoid complications. A subcutaneous injection is not very painful and feels like a quick pin prick or ant bite lasting a few seconds. It is advised to have a healthcare professional demonstrate how to administer the injection before one attempts to administer it themselves.\xa0' Syringes: The needles are typically short, around 5/8-inch long, and thin with usually a capacity of 1 mL and sometimes more for children and people with visual difficulties. Auto-injector pen: Some medications such as epinephrine and insulin are available in the form of a “pen” with a multi-use vial, which is quick and easy to administer, making it beneficial during emergencies.

What is bone cancer?,"'Bone cancer'' occurs when there is an abnormal multiplication of the bone cells. It can arise from any bone in the body. The most commonly affected bones are the pelvis (hip bone) and long bones in the arms and legs such as the humerus and femur bone. ''Bone cancer'' is rare. Noncancerous bone tumors are more common than cancerous tumors. Some types of bone ''cancer'' affect adults, whereas others are common in children. Bone ''cancer'' destroys the normal bone and can spread to other parts of the body (''metastasis''). There are various treatment options for bone ''cancer'' such as surgery, ''chemotherapy'', and ''radiation therapy''.\xa0' "
What are the types of bone cancer?,"'There are two main types of bone cancer:''Primary bone cancer''Primary bone cancer is also called sarcoma. It starts in the bone. Some of the most common types of primary bone cancer are as follows:''Secondary bone cancer''This occurs when cancer starts in other parts of the body and spreads to the bone. This is also called metastatic cancer.''Cancer that commonly spread to the bone are as follows:' Primary bone cancer Secondary bone cancer Osteosarcoma: It usually arises from around the knees and upper arm. Young adults and teenagers are usually affected. Ewing’s sarcoma: It occurs between the ages of 5 and 20 years. The ribs, pelvis, leg, and upper arm are usually affected, including the soft tissue around the bones. Chondrosarcoma: It occurs between the ages of 40 and 70 years. The hip, shoulders, leg, and arm are usually affected. It arises from the cartilage cells. Breast cancer  Lung cancer  Prostate cancer"
What are the causes of bone cancer?,"'The exact cause of bone cancer is unknown. Some factors increase the risk of bone cancer, which are as follows:' Cancer treatment: Patients who have had a history of radiation, stem cell transplants or certain chemotherapy drugs for other cancer  Genetics: Genetic disorders such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome or eye cancer called retinoblastoma  Paget’s disease of bone: A benign bone condition"
What are the symptoms of bone cancer?,"'The common symptoms of bone cancer are as follows:' Dull, aching pain in and around the area of the tumor Pain that worsens with activity and causes sleep disturbance Swelling around the affected bone An altered gait (Limping) Fracture of the affected bone Fatigue Fever and night sweats Weight loss"
How is bone cancer diagnosed?,"'The doctor performs a complete physical assessment and complete blood and radiological assessment (X-ray, computed tomography [CT] scan, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' [''MRI''], positron emission tomography [PET]/whole body scan and ''bone scan''). A minimally invasive, diagnostic procedure called a biopsy can confirm the diagnosis and also assess if the cancer is primary or secondary. During a biopsy, a tumor sample is obtained with a needle or through a small cut in the skin and examined under the microscope.' "
How is bone cancer treated?,"'There are various treatment options for bone cancer, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Treatment may involve one or a combination of treatment modalities. The treatment plan is based on the type and extent of bone cancer. Common treatments options include the following:' Limb salvage surgery: It is the surgical removal of part of the affected bone without the surrounding muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues. A metallic implant is used in place of the bone removed. Amputation: If the tumor is large and affects the surrounding tissues, nerves, and blood vessels, the whole limb may be removed and replaced with a prosthetic limb. Radiation therapy: This targets and selectively kills cancer cells and shrinks tumors using radiation.  Chemotherapy: The tumor cells are killed with cancer medication.  Targeted therapy: This treatment uses medication to target certain genetic, protein, or other changes in and around cancer cells."
What is the function of the prostate?,"'The main function of the prostate gland is to secrete an alkaline fluid that forms around 70% of the semen. Apart from lubrication, these secretions act as a source of nutrients for the sperm. The alkaline fluid in the ejaculated semen also helps to neutralize the acidic vaginal environment during sexual intercourse.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of prostate problems?,"'The presence of any one or more of the following signs and symptoms may indicate a problem with the prostate.' Frequent urge to urinate throughout the day Nocturia (frequent urge to urinate at night) Painful or burning urination Dribbling of urine Hematuria (blood in urine) Hematospermia (blood in semen) Painful ejaculation Frequent pain/stiffness in lower back, hips, pelvic or rectal area, or upper thighs"
How to check the prostate?,"'A person can get his prostate checked from a doctor if he is experiencing any of the signs and symptoms. The doctor will usually perform the following examinations and tests to confirm if the complaints are due to an abnormality with the prostate.' Digital rectal exam (DRE): A DRE is usually the first step towards detecting any abnormal growth in the prostate. This procedure involves inserting a lubricated finger through the anus until it reaches the rectum. Once the finger reaches the rectum, the prostate can be felt. This test helps the doctor to feel the hard lump, if any, on the prostate. Ultrasonography (USG): Next, the patient is advised to undergo a USG of the pelvis or a transrectal ultrasound to look for any changes in the shape or structure of the prostate. During a transrectal ultrasound, a small probe, about the size and shape of a cigar, is inserted into the rectum. The probe uses sound waves to create an image of the prostate gland. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test: A PSA test is a blood test that helps the doctor to check the health quotient of the prostate. A higher PSA level in the blood can be seen in an individual when he is experiencing inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), enlargement of the prostate (benign prostate hypertrophy or BPH), and prostate cancer. Many other things can cause a false-positive test result. These include an orgasm within the past 24 hours, a prostate biopsy, or prostate surgery that may cause a temporary increase in PSA levels. PSA test combined with DRE is being widely used as a screening test to identify prostate cancers in their early stages. Biopsy: A biopsy of the prostate is only advised to confirm or rule out prostate cancer after the above investigations. This procedure involves the surgical removal of a small sample (tissue) of the prostate through a tube-like long camera inserted in the abdomen. The sample is then sent to the laboratory to check for the presence of cancer cells under a microscope. A biopsy is the most reliable test for confirming prostate cancer."
What are the advantages of Nexplanon?,"'Currently, Nexplanon is the most effective form of ''birth control'' among all the available options. It has become a popular option among women due to its following advantages:' It provides effective long-term contraception. It does not depend on your daily compliance (because it does not require any daily, weekly, or monthly dosing—that happens with oral pills). Its insertion takes less than a minute at the hands of trained doctors. It has very low chances of pregnancy—1 out of 100 women will get pregnant if Nexplanon is implanted in their body. It can be placed immediately after the delivery (it may be inserted as soon as 10 minutes after placental delivery)."
How does Nexplanon work?,'The contraceptive implant Nexplanon works by' Inhibiting ovulation. Thinning the endometrium (lining of the uterus). Thickening cervical mucus (thick cervical mucus helps to keep the sperm from moving toward the uterus).
What makes you unfit for Nexplanon?,"'Nexplanon is not for every woman. Your doctor will not implant Nexplanon if you are''The contraceptive implant is generally safe, but the following conditions can make it unsafe for you:' Pregnant. Suffering from liver disease (including severe liver damage or liver tumors). Having a history of breast cancer. Having undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding. Allergic to Nexplanon. Cigarette smoking Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) Obesity  Hypertension (high blood pressure) Hyperlipidemia (high lipid or cholesterol levels) Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the deep veins of your legs) Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the big vein supplying blood to the lungs) Rheumatoid arthritis Anemia Epilepsy Thyroid disease Diabetes mellitus History of bariatric surgery Abortion in the first or second trimester"
When can you get Nexplanon inserted?,"'After confirming that you are not pregnant, the doctor can place Nexplanon at optimal timings, some of which include:' Between days 1 and 5 of the menstrual cycle During the hormone-free week if using oral contraceptive pills Within five days after a first- or second-trimester abortion At any time after childbirth in a breastfeeding mother (either within 24-48 hours or at the 6th week of delivery)"
How many times can you get Nexplanon?,"'With Nexplanon, you can expect to have three years of pregnancy ''prevention''. It needs to be removed after three years. If you wish to continue contraception, it should be replaced by a new Nexplanon implant at the end of three years.' "
What are the possible complications of Nexplanon?,"'The most common complication is ''pain'' at the insertion site, which occurs in less than 3 out of 100 women with the implant, as per one study. ''Pain'' is usually mild and resolves with time. ''Over-the-counter'' painkillers usually help in relieving the pain.''Other uncommon complications at the insertion site are''An analysis of 11 major international ''clinical trials'' that included 942 subjects found that some women experienced the following side effects:\xa0''Please contact your doctor if you experience any of the above complaints.' Redness (due to bleeding). Hematoma (pooling of blood) at the insertion site. Bruising (should resolve within a few days). Headache Weight gain Acne Breast pain Abdominal pain Irregular periods Amenorrhea (no periods for a few to several months) Prolonged periods"
Conclusion,"'A condom with any type of birth control is the only way to get protection from pregnancy and STDs during vaginal sex. No birth control method is perfect. Using condoms with another type of birth control gives backup protection in case either method fails. Condoms also lower the chances of getting all kinds of\xa0STDs, like\xa0''HIV'',\xa0''gonorrhea'',\xa0''chlamydia'' and\xa0''herpes''. A condom with any birth control is safe and most effective contraceptive method.' "
What are the different types of cancer pain?,"'Cancer pain can be felt in one of three ways:' Acute pain: It is severe in the beginning and then eases off immediately. It may be due to an ulcer-like sore on the skin and inside the body that is cancerous. Chronic pain: It is a low throbbing or sharp pain that hangs around for a long time. It can be managed with pain medications but cannot completely disappear. It may be due to the destruction of the normal tissue by cancer cells. Breakthrough pain: If you treat chronic pain with medications, you may feel a flash of pain every once in a while. This is called “breakthrough pain” because it breaks through the effects of medications."
Can cancer pain be relieved?,"'Cancer pain can’t be completely relieved; however, it can be controlled and managed to a great extent.' "
How does the physician treat cancer pain?,"'The physician chooses to remove cancer with surgery, chemotherapy, or ''radiation''. Medications for pain fall into three categories:''Antidepressants'', anti-''seizure'' ''drugs'', and steroids are also useful in treating cancer pain. A specialized treatment, such as nerve block (local anesthetic), prevents pain messages around or into the nerve pathway from the brain.''Alternative treatment may also be used to treat cancer pain, which includes:' Over-the-counter and prescription: For mild pain, fever, and swelling, the physician may prescribe acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Weak opioid: Codeine is a weak opioid prescribed for cancer pain. Strong opioid: Fentanyl, methadone, and morphine are the most powerful opioids used to relieve cancer pain.

What are the types of polyphenols?,"'There are more than eight thousand different types of polyphenols and they are categorized into 4 main groups:''Terpene lactones and ''ginkgo'' flavone glycosides are a special type of polyphenol present in the leaf of a tree called Ginkgo biloba. These are among the popular phenols present in the market. They have shown numerous health benefits. The effects of these polyphenols are being studied in memory problems, psychiatric issues, skin problems, and ''eye problems''. It has been known to reduce the symptoms of ''vertigo'' and ''ringing in the ear'' in some individuals if taken for a long time, i.e. 1 year.''Foods that are rich in polyphenols:''Fruits''Vegetables''Legumes''Nuts and seeds''Grains''Herbs and spices''Others' Flavonoids: They make up around 60% of all polyphenols.

What exactly is arthritis?,"'Arthritis, or joint inflammation, describes\xa0swelling and tenderness of one or more of the joints. Its main symptoms include ''joint pain'', swelling and ''stiffness''. Arthritis is a general term for a group of over 100 diseases causing inflammation and swelling in and around the joints.\xa0''Joint inflammation is a natural response of the body to a disease or injury, but becomes arthritis when the inflammation persists in the absence of joint injury or infection. Arthritis usually worsens with age and may even lead to a loss of joint movement.''There are different types of arthritis such as:''Arthritis may progress to limit everyday activities such as cooking, bathing, ''walking'' and dressing. It affects almost one in five Americans.\xa0Arthritis can affect people of any age and gender. It is the leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15.\xa0' Osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis  Gout or gouty arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis Septic arthritis Reactive arthritis Juvenile idiopathic arthritis"
What causes arthritis?,"'The cause of arthritis may vary according to the type of the disease. Most types of arthritis do not have a known cause. Research has revealed the role of three major factors in certain types of arthritis:''Several factors may increase a person’s risk for arthritis:' Genetic (inherited) factors cause some types of arthritis to run in families Physical activity and diet affects arthritis symptoms The presence of other medical conditions such as infections and chronic diseases such as lupus puts you at risk for Arthritis. Age: The risk of getting arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis, increases with age. Age may also worsen the symptoms of arthritis. Gender: Arthritis generally affects women more often than in men. Weight: Being obese or overweight puts extra stress on the joints that support an individual’s weight. Increased weight beyond the normal range for a person’s age and height increases joint wear and tear, and the risk of arthritis. Occupation: Certain jobs may involve the worker to keep doing the same movements repeatedly. These include jobs where one needs to do heavy lifting or repeated fine work as done by musicians. It can cause joint stress and/or an injury, which may lead to arthritis. Injury: joint injury or trauma may cause osteoarthritis Autoimmune diseases: these may misdirect the immune system towards the joints as seen in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus Infections: certain infections may lead to joint inflammation as seen in tubercular arthritis and septic arthritis."
Are mushrooms good for arthritis?,"'Mushrooms are good for arthritis patients as they are rich in nutrients and they retard inflammation. They are the richest ''vegetarian'' source of ''vitamin D'', which is important in maintaining healthy bones, muscles and immunity. Other foods which are good for arthritis are:' Fatty fish like sardines, salmon and fresh tuna Unsweetened cocoa Extra virgin olive oil Green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach and chard Bananas and plantains Berries such as blueberries and blackberries Spices such as turmeric, paprika, ginger and garlic Beans Lean meat such as skinless chicken Lentils Soy, including soybeans and tofu Nuts Green tea Citrus fruits such as lemons, oranges and grapefruit Broccoli Cherries"
What are the symptoms of arthritis?,"'Different types of arthritis may cause different presentations. For example, ''fever'' may be seen in arthritis due to ''tuberculosis'', but not in osteoarthritis.''Some of the common symptoms of arthritis are:' Joint pain Swelling around the joints Stiffness Warm skin over the joints Redness of the skin over the joints Reduced range of movement."
What is LASIK?,"'Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is performed to correct vision error by using a laser. It has been performed since the late 1980s to improve ''farsightedness'' (hyperopia), near-sightedness (myopia), or imperfect eye curvature (''astigmatism'').''During LASIK, your eye surgeon induces the first laser that creates a very thin layer protective flap on the clear membrane (cornea) of your eye. Then, the second laser is used to correct your vision by lifting this protective flap. If you have vision errors in both the eyes, they can be treated on the same day. The recovery process is fairly quick in this procedure. You can drive or start working after 24 hours. Most people regain an error free vision in about four to six weeks after the procedure.''Your eye doctor may not suggest this surgery if you' Have unstable vision errors. Have hyperopia (extreme farsightedness), myopia (nearsightedness), or astigmatism (imperfect eye curvature). Have a cone-shaped clear cornea. Have a very thin clear layer of the eye. Have glaucoma (advanced eye nerve damage). Have a severe dry eye. Have poorly controlled diabetes. Are pregnant or breastfeeding."
What is LASEK?,"'Laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK) is performed to correct vision error. It is a newer and less-invasive procedure. This procedure has been performed since 1996. If you have a thin cornea or preexisting disease or condition that makes your eye surgery more challenging, this is the best option for you.''During this surgery, only one laser ray is used to correct your vision. In this procedure, an ''alcohol'' solution loosens the thin layer of cells of your eye’s surface (corneal epithelium). These cells then stick to a sheet that gently moves to the side of your eye, which provides easy access to the surgeon to the clear layer of your eye (cornea) to treat it through laser.''After reshaping the clear layer of your eye (cornea), special protective lenses will be put on your eyes to increase your comfort and healing process. The lens will be taken off after four days.''Both the eyes can be treated on the same day similar to laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Many patients can experience improvement in their vision in a few hours; however, it may take a few days or sometimes weeks to resolve your vision. Slightly longer recovery time for LASEK is a small compromise for long-term correction of your vision, which you will never get from any other surgery.' "
What are the complications of both LASIK and LASEK?,"'Some temporary or permanent complications of both procedures are as follows:' Eye pain and discomfort Hazy, blurry vision Scratchy eye Sensitivity toward light Starburst or halos around the light Eye infection Persistence visual error(rare)"
Which option is better?,"'The easiest way to figure out which humidifier works best for an individual is by simply knowing which type of air is easier for them to breathe. If you inhale well in a sauna, then a warm mist humidifier might be the best. If you have ''allergies'' or ''asthma'', you might benefit more from a cool-mist humidifier. Doctors will recommend a certain type of humidifier if necessary. However, the choice basically depends on individual preferences. There are slight differences between each, but they both are designed to make ''breathing'' easier within the home. Humidifiers release water vapor to increase humidity in the air, helping keep things comfortable and hydrated.\xa0''Cool mist humidifiers:'' Cool mist humidifiers emit cool vapors to add moisture to the air. They utilize a filter that captures water impurities and is easy to clean. These humidifiers are ideal for use during warmer weather and in areas that experience a warmer climate. These however are slightly noisier than the other type of humidifier.''Advantages:''Disadvantages:''Warm mist humidifiers: ''Warm mist humidifiers are often used to treat colds and flu during colder months. They heat water to create vapor, which is cooled prior to being released.\xa0''Advantages:''Disadvantages:''Overall benefits:'' Humidifiers are a part of many households. There are many different versions of humidifiers, but they all add moisture to\xa0the air. The moisture in turn increases the level of humidity in the living space, which\xa0helps alleviate ''common cold''-weather\xa0conditions.\xa0Below are a few common benefits of humidifiers:' Emit cool vapor; safer for children and pets Easy cleaning and little maintenance required Filter out waterborne impurities Can add inhalants, making them good for cold and flu sufferers Cost-effective Helpful for asthma and allergy sufferers Reduces static in the air Bacterial contamination may occur Mineral dust may accumulate from water filtration Operating noise Reduced mineral dust accumulation Can add inhalants to treat colds and flu Quiet operation Risk of burns; not suitable for use around children Low energy efficiency More difficult to clean More prone to gather bacteria due to warm temperature. During the winter, the air tends to be cold and crisp; we may develop chapped lips and flaky skin. However, with a humidifier in hand, one can get through winter without feeling moisture-deprived. If a person breathes through the mouth while sleeping, they are likely going to be waking up feeling dry. Run a humidifier during the night to help soothe the throat and nose from dryness. It will help an individual to sleep more comfortably while also minimizing snoring. Additionally, running the humidifier during the day as well helps your throat to stay moist. If a home has wooden floors or furniture, keeping humidity balanced can help the wood to last longer. Furthermore, houseplants will benefit from a little extra moisture in the air. Prevent the spreading of airborne viruses. In recent studies, it was shown that airborne viruses were least likely to spread when the humidity was at least 43%. The study showed that nearly 85% of viruses were virtually ineffective in more humid conditions. Moisture can prevent the movement of germs because they drop to the nearest surface when combined with moisture. As a result, it’s more difficult for germs to spread through the air. Humidifiers are also useful when an individual is suffering from breathing issues. They help reduce inflammation in the sinuses and help loosen up any mucus that may have formed. Breathing in warm, humid air can help loosen up pockets of mucus left in the lungs and sinus passages, making illness pass quicker. Patients who suffer from arthritis often report flare-ups during colder, drier months due to low temperatures and lack of humidity in the air. A humidifier can help these symptoms by putting moisture back into the air, which has been tied with reducing the overall swelling felt like a symptom of the condition. The warming properties of humidifiers can also help cut down on the discomfort caused by cold air leaking into a room or home, making the symptoms of arthritis less painful. Humidifiers for allergies can help to limit the discomfort caused by allergic reactions. The vapor released by a humidifier hydrates the nose and throat, thinning out mucus and allowing the little hairs in the nose to move freely and easily. This helps the nasal passages to trap bacteria, dust, and other allergy-causing particles before they enter your respiratory system, thereby helping to prevent swelling and reduce instances of allergies flaring up. Furthermore, in a dry environment, pollen, dust, and other allergens more easily become airborne. Moderate relative humidity levels of around 40% enable moisture to condense upon the particles, weighing them down so that they fall out of the air and are less likely to be inhaled."

Can an individual survive from cancer?,"'If identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment and can result in a greater probability of surviving. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care. Early screening aims to identify individuals with abnormalities suggestive of specific cancer or precancer who have not developed any symptoms and can be referred promptly for diagnosis and treatment. For example, a 50-year patient who is a heavy smoker should have regular checkups and if necessary, should undergo computed tomography (CT) scan of the lung every six months to detect any early symptom of lung cancer.\xa0' "
How is cancer treated? ,"'The important goal of cancer treatment is to achieve maximum cure and allow the person to live a normal life. If a cure is not possible, treatments may be used to shrink the cells or slow the growth of cancer to allow patient to live symptom free for as long as possible.''Common cancer treatments include:''Primary treatment'': Primary treatment is used to remove cancer from your body or kill all the cancer cells.''Adjuvant treatment: ''The goal of adjuvant therapy is to kill any cancer cell that may remain after primary treatment. It is aimed to reduce the chance of recurrence.''Palliative treatment:'' Palliative treatments relieve side effects of treatment and make the ''pain'' and ''cancer symptoms'' bearable. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy can all be used as palliative treatment. Palliative treatment can be used at the same time as other treatments. They are more important in inoperable cancers.' Surgery is primary cancer treatment for the most types of cancers. Patient may also receive radiation therapy or chemotherapy if cancer cells are sensitive to these treatments.  Common adjuvant therapies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is similar, but it is used before the primary treatment to make the primary treatment easier or more effective."
What are the advancements in cancer treatment?,"'Apart from the above common treatments, patients may also be treated with advanced treatments which include:' Immunotherapy to treat cancer: Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps the immune system to recognize the cancer cells and destroy them.  Targeted therapy: Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that targets the specific proteins found only on cancer cells. It slows down the cancer multiplication. These cells do not affect normal cells and hence have fewer side effects. Stem cell transplant: Stem cell transplants are procedures that use stem cells to regenerate diseased or compromised organs."
Facts you should know about whiplash injuries, Whiplash is a relatively common injury that is often ignored or mistreated due to lack of understanding of the condition. Whiplash is usually the result of a rear impact while in a stationary position. Early range of motion and exercises lead to a more rapid recovery than prolonged immobilization or use of a cervical collar. Failure to properly educate and treat patients with whiplash can lead to chronic psychosocial symptoms including depression and anxiety.
What is whiplash?,"'Whiplash is a relatively common injury that occurs to a person\'s neck following a sudden acceleration-deceleration force that causes unrestrained, rapid forward and backward movement of the head and neck, most commonly from motor vehicle accidents. The term ""whiplash"" was first used in 1928. The term ""railway spine"" was used to describe a similar condition that was common in persons involved in train accidents prior to 1928. The term ""whiplash injury"" describes damage to both the bone structures and soft tissues, while ""whiplash associated disorders"" describes a more severe and chronic condition.''Fortunately, whiplash is typically not a life threatening injury, but it can lead to a prolonged period of partial disability. There are significant economic expenses related to whiplash that can reach 30 billion dollars a year in the United States, including:''While most people involved in minor motor vehicle accidents recover quickly without any chronic symptoms, some continue to experience symptoms for years after the injury. This wide variation in symptoms after relatively minor injuries has led some to suggest that, in many cases, whiplash is not so much a real physiologic injury, but that symptoms are more created as a result of potential economic gain. Many clinical studies have investigated this issue. Unfortunately, while there will always be people willing to attempt to mislead the system for personal gain, whiplash is a real condition with real symptoms.'   medical care,  disability,  sick leave,  lost productivity, and litigation."
What causes whiplash?,"""Whiplash is most commonly caused by a motor vehicle accident in which the person is in a car that is not moving, and is struck by another vehicle from behind. It is commonly thought the rear impact causes the head and neck to be forced into hyperextended (backward) position as the seat pushes the person's torso forward - and the unrestrained head and neck fall backwards. After a short delay the head and neck then recover and are thrown into a hyperflexed (forward) position.""'More recent studies investigating high-speed cameras and sophisticated crash dummies have determined that after the rear impact the lower cervical vertebrae (lower bones in the neck) are forced into a position of ''hyperextension'' while the upper cervical vertebrae (upper bones in the neck) are in a ''hyperflexed'' position. This leads to an abnormal S-shape in the cervical spine after the rear impact that is different from the normal motion. It is thought that this abnormal motion causes damage to the soft tissues that hold the cervical vertebrae together (ligaments, facet capsules, muscles). ' "
What are the symptoms of whiplash?,"'Common symptoms related to whiplash may include:''In a more severe and chronic case of ""whiplash associated disorder"" symptoms may include:''Patients with whiplash injuries may enter into litigation and ''social isolation'' may occur as a result of their symptoms.'   neck pain and stiffness, headache,  shoulder pain and stiffness,  dizziness,  fatigue,  jaw pain (temporomandibular joint symptoms),  arm pain,  arm weakness,  visual disturbances,  ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and  back pain.  depression,  anger,  frustration,  anxiety,  stress,  drug dependency,  post-traumatic stress syndrome,  sleep disturbance (insomnia), "
How do medical professionals diagnose whiplash?,"""After an accident the patient may be taken to the hospital or a doctor's office to be examined. The doctor will examine the patient to determine if they have any injuries that require treatment. Based on the symptoms and examination findings the doctor may place a collar on the neck for additional support. The doctor may also obtain ""'X-rays'' of the neck to check for more serious injury. The most important first step is to make sure there is no major injury to the neck, head or the rest of the body requiring immediate treatment.''If the X-rays are normal but the patient continues to have ''neck pain'', the doctor may keep the cervical collar in place and see the patient back in the office in about a week for an additional examination. At that time, the doctor may obtain new X-rays to see if there have been any changes. If the doctor is still concerned about soft tissue injuries, he or she may obtain either X-rays with the head leaning forward and backward\xa0(dynamic X-rays) or obtain an ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'' study). These dynamic X-rays or MRI scans are better able to detect injuries to the soft tissues of the neck, especially instability, that may not been seen with normal X-rays of the neck.' "
What is the treatment for whiplash?,"'Treatment of whiplash depends on the wide variety of symptoms present. Unfortunately, most treatments of whiplash have not been well tested to determine their effectiveness.''The most important issue in the management of whiplash is optimal education of the patient about their injury. This includes information on the cause, potential treatments, and likely outcomes. Patients should understand that this is a real injury, but that nearly all patients have the ability to fully recover. Patients that do not receive this information are much more likely to develop the more chronic ""whiplash associated disorder.""''In the past, the initial treatment for whiplash was often a soft cervical collar for several weeks. The goal of the collar was intended to reduce the range of motion of the neck and to prevent any additional injuries. More recent studies have shown that this prolonged immobilization actually slows the healing process. If there is no evidence of abnormal spinal alignment, early range of motion is advised.''Patients involved in early range of motion exercises have been shown to have a more reliable and rapid improvement in their symptoms. This treatment typically involves rotational exercises performed 10 times per hour as soon as symptoms allow within the first four days of the accident.''It seems that excessive rest and immobilization have been shown to have greater chances of chronic symptoms. This is explained by loss of range of motion leading to increased ''pain'' and stiffness. Immobilization also causes muscle atrophy (muscle wasting), decreased blood flow to the injured soft tissues, and healing of damaged muscles in shortened position that renders them less flexible.''Physical therapy can be useful in helping to wean a patient from a cervical collar as well as to help strengthen muscles and reduce painful motions. Occupational therapy can be used to help return the patient to the work environment.''If the patient begins to develop psychological symptoms including anger, ''anxiety'' or ''depression'' following an injury, prompt treatment of the emotional condition is recommended. This can help the patient better understand the good chances for successful recovery and reduce the chances of chronic symptoms.'  "
What can people do to prevent whiplash?,"'While it is not always possible to prevent accidents, advances in automobile safety have attempted to reduce the associated risks. Many advances in seat belts and head restraints have been able to reduce the risk of whiplash injury. The proper use of these devices is crucial to their success in preventing injury. Head restraints are designed to prevent the head from moving into hyperextension when struck from behind. In order for this to work properly, the head restraint should be optimally positioned directly behind the head. If the head restraint is lowered below the level of the head it could actually force the head into further hyperextension after an impact. Many automobiles have additional safety equipment including air ''bags'' and air curtains to further protect drivers and passengers from injury.' "
What is a pancreas?,"'The pancreas is a gland situated in the abdomen (behind the stomach). The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body. The pancreas is a vital organ that works closely with the ''liver'' and ducts that carry bile. The pancreas releases (secretes) enzymes that help digest food, especially ''fats'' and protein. The pancreas also secretes hormones that help manage your blood ''sugar''. ''Pancreatic cancer'' is the fourth leading cause of ''cancer'' death for both men and women.' "
What is the Whipple procedure?,"'The Whipple procedure is a standard procedure to remove ''pancreatic cancer'' or a ''tumor''. The procedure is named after Allen Oldfather Whipple (former chairman of the Department of Surgery at Columbia University) who pioneered the procedure.\xa0''In the Whipple procedure, a surgeon removes the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder and the first section of the small intestine (the duodenum). Occasionally, a small part of the stomach is also removed. The Whipple procedure is also called pancreaticoduodenectomy.' "
What is a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy?,"'There are two common types of Whipple procedures: the conventional Whipple and the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy.' The conventional Whipple: This involves the removal of the head of the pancreas, the duodenum and a portion of the stomach, as well as the gallbladder and a portion of the bile duct. The remaining stomach, bile duct and pancreas are then reconnected to the digestive tract to restore the flow of ingested contents, digestive enzymes and bile.  The pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy: In this, the terminal section of the stomach is not removed during the operation. The diseased part is removed, and the remaining is reconnected to the digestive tract."
What are the different procedures that constitute the Whipple procedure?,"'The Whipple procedure may be done in various ways:''Minimally invasive surgery offers some benefits, such as lower blood loss and a quicker recovery in those without complications. However, it also takes longer. Sometimes, a procedure may begin with minimally invasive surgery, but complications or technical difficulty requires the surgeon to make an open incision to finish the operation.' Open surgery: During an open procedure, the surgeon makes an incision in the stomach to access the pancreas. This is the most common approach and the most studied. Laparoscopic surgery: During this surgery, the surgeon makes several small cuts in the abdomen and inserts special instruments, including a camera that transmits video to a monitor in the operating room. The monitor guides the surgeon to navigate while performing the Whipple procedure. Laparoscopic surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. Robotic surgery: This is a type of minimally invasive surgery in which the surgical tools are attached to a mechanical device (robot). The surgeon sits at a console nearby and uses hand controls to direct the robot. A surgical robot can use tools in tight spaces and around corners, where human hands may be too large to be effective."
What are the risks involved in the Whipple procedure?,"'The Whipple procedure is a difficult operation, often involving an open surgery. It carries risks both during and after the surgery. These may include' bleeding at the surgical areas, infection of the incision area or inside your abdomen, delayed emptying of the stomach, which may make it difficult to eat or to keep food down temporarily, leakage from the pancreas or bile duct connection and diabetes, temporary or permanent."
What are the results of the Whipple procedure?,"'The chances of long-term survival after the Whipple procedure depend on the patient’s particular situation. For most tumors and ''cancers'' of the pancreas, the Whipple procedure is the only known cure. Hence, the Whipple procedure increases the survival chances in patients with ''pancreatic cancer''.' "
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."

You should see your doctor every six to 12 months in order to follow and treat skin changes.' "
"Who gets 
it?",'Lichen sclerosus appears:' Most often in women (usually after menopause). Less often in men. Rarely in children.
What are the symptoms?,"'You may have no symptoms if you have a mild form of the disease. If you do have signs, they can include:'   Small white spots on the skin (early in the disease). Spots that grow into bigger patches. The skin over these patches become thin and crinkled. Skin that tears and bruises. Skin that becomes scarred. Itching, which is very common. Pain. Bleeding. Blisters."
What causes it?,"""You can't give lichen sclerosus to someone else. No one knows what exactly causes the disease. Some possible causes include:"" An overactive immune system. Hormone problems. Inheriting the risk for getting the disease from your parents. An injury that damaged or scarred the skin."
Is there a test for it?,"'Usually a doctor will take a small piece of skin and look at it under a microscope to diagnose lichen sclerosus. In more severe cases, doctors can just look at you to diagnose the disease based upon how it has affected your skin.'  "
How is it treated?,"'Patches on the arms or upper body usually go away after time without treatment. The disease may also go away after ''puberty''.'""Patches of the genital skin should be treated, even if they aren't painful or ""'itchy''. These patches can ''scar'', causing problems with urination or sex. There is also a very small chance that ''skin cancer'' may develop in the patches.

Who is at high risk for multiple sclerosis?,"'The cause of ''multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is not known. But scientists believe that a combination of various factors may put an individual at a higher risk for ''MS''. These factors include:''Environmental ''allergies'', exposure to household pets, exposure to the heavy metals, and consumption of the ''artificial sweetener'' ''aspartame'' do not play any role in causing MS.' Immunologic factors: Abnormal responses by the body’s immune system that may cause inflammation and damage in the central nervous system. Environmental factors: Exposure to some environmental toxins before puberty may predispose a person to develop MS later in life. Vitamin D: Low vitamin D levels in the blood due to less exposure to sunlight have been proposed to trigger the development of MS. Smoking: Smoking can cause MS to become more severe and progress rapidly.  Obesity: Obesity in childhood and adolescence increases the risk of later developing MS.  Infectious factors: Evidence suggests that previous infection with Epstein-Barr virus contributes to the risk of developing MS. Genetic factors: About 200 genes have been identified that play a role in developing MS. Female gender: Women are twice as likely as men to develop MS particularly during childbearing years and during the early postpartum period."
How do you diagnose multiple sclerosis?,"'Diagnosis of ''multiple sclerosis'' (MS) takes a very long time to diagnose because many times the symptoms stay for a short time, go away, and take several months or years to come back. It takes time for the signs of MS to show up in any diagnostic test and there is no single test that can prove that a person has MS.\xa0''Many conditions have symptoms similar to MS and MS may be mistaken for another disease initially.\xa0''The doctor who specializes in treating MS (''neurologist'') will order a few tests to see if the brain and spinal cord are working as they should. These include:' Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This imaging test lets the doctor check for any inflammatory changes of MS in the deep parts of the brain or spinal cord. Lumbar puncture: Doctors draw out a small amount of fluid known as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal cord and send it to the laboratory for its analysis.  Evoked potentials: The doctor will place wires on the patient’s scalp to check if the brain's response to certain things is altered as happens in MS.  Blood tests: Blood tests may help the doctor support the MS diagnosis and rule out other conditions."
What is the best medicine for MS?,"'More than a dozen disease-modifying therapies are available that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat MS. The best medicine for MS varies among patients. Research is ongoing all around the world to find more effective therapies for MS.''Although doctors are not unsure of the underlying or triggering mechanism for MS and MS attacks, several ''drugs'' have been shown to have beneficial effects in people with MS. These drugs fall under two categories: immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) for the underlying autoimmune disorder and therapies to relieve symptoms.\xa0''Some of the immunomodulatory medications include:''General treatment to relieve the ''symptoms of MS'' includes:''The FDA recently approved the drug ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) to treat adult patients with RRMS and PPMS. Stem cell therapy, though not approved by the FDA, is available for MS, which offers a promising option for some of the patients with MS.''Other drugs are used as required to relieve the specific symptoms in MS such as ''pain'', sexual inability, ''eye problems'', bladder/bowel problems, ''depression'', and so on. Examples include:' Interferons Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) Natalizumab (Tysabri)  Methylprednisolone  Immunoglobulin Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol)  Plasma exchange or plasmapheresis (a method to remove autoantibodies from the blood) Dexamethasone  Tricyclic antidepressants Anticonvulsants Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Sildenafil (Viagra) Amantadine Fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) Modafinil (Provigil) Baclofen (Lioresal), Gabapentin Tizanidine (Zanaflex) Prednisone Injecting Botox into the bladder Stool softeners Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Cladribine (Mavenclad) is an oral medication used in people with MS who have failed to respond to all other therapies."
What happens with untreated MS?," More than 30% of untreated patients with MS develop physical disability within 20-25 years. In 50 to 60% of deaths from MS is usually due to complications, such as kidney or lung problems.  RRMS is generally associated with a better treatment outcome and chances of survival than PPMS. Another variant of MS—the Marburg variant—can lead to coma or death within days."
What is mechanical ventilation?,'Mechanical ventilation is a treatment to help a person breathe when they find it difficult or are unable to breathe on their own. A mechanical ventilator pushes airflow into the patient’s ''lungs'' to help them breathe.' 
Do you need mechanical ventilation if you have COVID-19 coronavirus?,"'Mechanical ventilation is part of the arsenal of supportive care clinicians use for ''COVID-19'' coronavirus disease patients with the most severe lung symptoms.\xa0''A ''COVID-19'' infection can cause fluids and ''mucus'' in the lungs that block oxygenation of lung tissue.\xa0 Mechanical ventilation can help support ''COVID-19'"" patients' ""'breathing'' until their immune system and treatment can clear the infection and proper lung function is restored.\xa0''Public health experts fear there is a shortage of mechanical ventilation machines in the U.S., considering the coronavirus pandemic.' "
Why is mechanical ventilation required?,'Breathing is essential to get oxygen into the body and expel carbon dioxide. The lung normally performs this function by expanding and drawing in air and contracting and expelling it.''The lung has millions of tiny air sacs (alveoli) that transfer the oxygen into the blood supply that flows to the ''heart'' and remove the carbon dioxide from the blood flowing into the lungs from the heart. Certain illnesses prevent the lung from functioning normally.''Mechanical ventilation is required when:''Mechanical ventilation assists lung function until ventilation is no longer needed. Mechanical ventilation helps in:' a patient needs assistance with breathing  the patient’s respiration needs to be mechanically maintained relieving respiratory distress decreasing the work of breathing improving exchange of gases (oxygen/carbon dioxide)  healing the lung reversing respiratory muscle fatigue allowing time for the patient to rest and recover
How is mechanical ventilation performed?,"'Mechanical ventilation may be performed invasively or noninvasively. Invasive ventilation is performed in the intensive care unit of hospitals. The two invasive methods of mechanical ventilation are:''Beside ventilation, the other benefits of ''intubation'' are:''Noninvasive ventilation that can be administered at home or in the hospital are of three kinds:' Endotracheal intubation: a tube inserted through the patient’s nose or throat. Tracheostomy: a tube inserted into a hole made in the patient’s throat. Bronchoscopy: examining the lung with a bronchoscope inserted through the breathing tube. Aspiration: suction of fluids to keep the airway clear. Medication: aerosolized medications more effectively delivered directly to the airway or lungs. CPAP: Continuous positive airway pressure that delivers constant and steady air pressure. APAP: Autotritating (adjustable) positive airway pressure that changes air pressure according to the breathing pattern. BiPAP: Bilevel positive airway pressure that delivers air with different pressures for inhalation and exhalation."
What are the indications for mechanical ventilation?,'The indications for starting mechanical ventilation in a patient are' Abnormally slow breathing (bradypnea) Cessation of breathing (apnea) Abnormally rapid breathing (tachypnea) Inefficient exchange of gases Respiratory muscle fatigue
Who needs mechanical ventilation?,'Mechanical ventilation is a life-support treatment in the hospitals for critically ill people in acute respiratory distress or failure. Ventilation may be required by patients in conditions that include:' Short-term ventilation while being under general anesthesia for a surgical procedure. Severe heart disease Acute lung injury Hypotension Coma Sepsis and multiorgan failure Neuromuscular diseases Pneumonia Acute asthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Bacterial inflammation in the lungs Viral infections in the respiratory system such asWest NileSARSInfluenzaCOVID-19 (novel coronavirus 2019) West Nile SARS Influenza COVID-19 (novel coronavirus 2019)
What are the risks and complications of mechanical ventilation?,"'Mechanical ventilation has a few risks and complications that can sometimes be life-threatening. The complications can arise during intubation or with ventilation.''Prolonged intubation might cause:' Upper airway and nasal trauma Tooth displacement (avulsion) Injury to the mouth, throat, vocal cords or trachea sinusitis tracheal narrowing (stenosis) or tissue death (necrosis) edema in the vocal cords infection in the respiratory system pneumonia sepsis in the bloodstream Ventilator-induced lung injury leading to alveoli rupture and lung collapse (pneumothorax) from:Barotrauma – trauma caused by excess air pressureVolutrauma -- caused by excess volume of air Barotrauma – trauma caused by excess air pressure Volutrauma -- caused by excess volume of air Oxygen toxicity from too much oxygen Ventilator-assisted pneumonia caused by bacterial and viral infections in the lung Medication side effects and reactions Effects on other organs such asblood circulationheartkidneysabdomen blood circulation heart kidneys abdomen Ventilator malfunction Inability to wean off from the ventilator Sepsis Death"
What is genetic counselling?,"'Genetic counseling is the process that helps you in determining hereditary or genetic (''running'' in your family) problems that might affect you or your family. It is done by a trained professional.''It involves the following steps:''Genetic counseling sessions may last for an hour and may vary based on your specific health problem and family history.' Checking or reviewing your medical history, family history, and pregnancy history Identifying and interpreting the increased risk of inherited disorders or passing on a hereditary disease to your unborn baby Suggesting and organizing genetic tests Evaluating and providing information about test results Providing information about management and prevention and helping in the decision-making process"
What causes a genetic disorder?, Defects in the chromosomes (small bodies carrying reproductive instructions of a cell) Mutation (spontaneous permanent changes) in the DNA (a molecule carrying instructions of living being make-up) Environmental exposure to chemicals or radiation Developmental defect of the sperm or egg Recreational drug use for long term Industrial chemical exposure
How are genetic disorders treated?,"'Genetic disorders are mostly incurable. These are results of a change in genes that are the functional unit of body cells. They affect many organs. However, management of symptoms can be possible with the following approaches:' Many genetic conditions occur due to inborn errors in metabolism. Avoiding certain substances in the diet may prevent the build-up of potentially toxic substances.  Enzyme replacement therapy may help to manage the conditions or prevent future complications. Surgery for certain genetic conditions such as heart transplant for the birth heart defect, bone marrow transplant for defective blood cell formation diseases (sickle cell disease), cleft palate, and clubfoot may improve the particular symptoms associated with disorders. Familial breast cancer gene (BRCA1 and BRCA2) mutation (changes) can be screened in all family members and can be prevented by removing the cancer cells by breast surgeries before growing it as cancer. Most of the treatment strategies include gene therapy that is still in the experimental stage; this involves changing a person’s defective genes that may be helpful in the future for many genetic disorders."
What is whooping cough (pertussis)?,'Whooping cough'' (also termed ''pertussis'') is a respiratory disease that is caused by the bacterium Bordetella ''pertussis''. It results in characteristic fits of ''coughing'' (the characteristic ''noise''\xa0on ''inhalation'' produces a whooping sound) and mild to moderate difficulty with ''breathing'' (most noticeable during coughing fits). These symptoms are caused by the release of toxins produced by ''Bordetella pertussis'' bacteria that damage the lining of throat cells and cause inflammation and swelling of the throat.'  
Is whooping cough contagious?,"'Whooping cough'' is considered highly ''contagious'' and is only found in humans. Coughing or ''sneezing'' spreads whooping ''cough'' from person to person. The bacteria can live in droplets that become airborne during coughing or sneezing; anyone in close contact with an individual who has whooping cough is likely to be exposed to the disease. Even individuals who have had pertussis vaccine in the past can become infected because the vaccine, and even having the disease, does not confer lifelong protection against whooping cough. Likewise, even individuals who previously had whooping cough are not immune to future episodes of infection. Consequently, pertussis vaccine booster shots are highly recommended and are usually incorporated with other vaccines like ''diphtheria'' and ''tetanus'', which have a similar limited time (about five to 10 years) of protection.' "
How will I know if someone has whooping cough? What are the various stages of pertussis?,"'Early in the disease patients may have ''cold''-like symptoms (mild cough and/or ''fever''), but after about a week or so, severe coughing can begin. The cold-like symptoms comprise stage one of whooping cough and last about one to two weeks; stage one is termed the catarrhal stage. Stage two, termed the paroxysmal stage, can last from about one to six weeks and consists of fits of rapid coughing (coughing fits) and the characteristic whooping sounds. Stage three, termed the convalescent stage, lasts about two to three weeks with gradual reduction of the coughing fits. The length of time coughing fits last is variable; for example, some individuals will still experience some coughing for as long as about three and a half months. The coughing fits can cause intermittent ''shortness of breath'', ''vomiting'', and ''fatigue''. Unfortunately, usually a person is not diagnosed with whooping cough until stage two, but the person can be contagious during stage one. Individuals with whooping cough are highly contagious during the first two weeks of stage two, but they still can be contagious for about three weeks. Some experts suggest antibiotic therapy reduces contagiousness in individuals with the disease.''Not every person who gets pertussis develops the characteristic coughing fits; if a person, especially an infant or young child, develops a persistent relatively severe cough for a week or more, a physician should be consulted to perform blood tests and cultures for ''Bordetella pertussis'' bacteria.' "
How is whooping cough transmitted? What is the incubation period for pertussis? What is the contagious period for pertussis?,"'Coughing, sneezing, or direct personal contact with an infected individual easily spreads whooping cough from person to person. It is not spread to pets (''dogs'' and cats, for example), but it can be spread to other adults and even to vaccinated individuals whose vaccine immunity has waned. It can be spread before the characteristic coughing fits begin. The incubation period is variable, and symptoms develop usually five to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria; occasionally, the incubation period can be up to three weeks. It is possible to be contagious during the incubation period, but the highly contagious time for spread to others is in the beginning weeks of stage two (coughing fits, whooping sounds produced).' "
When will I know someone is cured of whooping cough?,"'After about three weeks of symptoms, the body usually develops an immune response that effectively limits and/or kills the bacteria. However, symptoms can still be present for some period of time (weeks to months) because of the damage done by the infection. Early treatment with antibiotics is thought to reduce the time of contagiousness and importantly, may reduce the severity of symptoms. However, antibiotics may not help reduce any symptoms if started later (a few weeks) in the disease process. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) states that giving ''cough medicine'"" for pertussis usually will not help and is not recommended for children under 4 years of age; parents and/or caregivers should check with their child's pediatrician if they aren't sure what to do."" "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about whooping cough?,"""Call your child's physician or your physician or consider going to an emergency department if coughing spells cause the following:""  Pauses in breathing Struggling to breathe Face turning blue or red during coughing fits Vomiting during and/or after coughing fits Inhalation that produces a whooping sound"
Can whooping cough be prevented?,"""Perhaps the best way to avoid pertussis is to contact your child's pediatrician to make sure that your child is up to date with their childhood vaccinations since these include vaccinations for pertussis. For adults, the same thing is true; they should get routine booster shots for pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus every 10 years or when their physician recommends it."" "
Is a little blood in phlegm normal?,"'You may get little streaks of blood in ''phlegm'' due to reasons such as excessive coughing. Blood in phlegm, however, may be due to serious conditions such as lung ''cancer'', ''pulmonary embolism'', and ''heart failure''.''You must seek medical care for blood in ''cough''/phlegm if:' The coughing up of small amounts of blood lasts more than a week. You are coughing up more than a few teaspoons of blood. There is a presence of blood in the urine or stools. You have shortness of breath. You experience chest pain. You feel light-headed or dizzy. There is a presence of fever. You have rapid or excessive unintended weight loss."
How would I know why I am coughing up blood?,"'Coughing up blood may be caused by various conditions that may range from mild to serious. To know the exact cause of coughing up blood, you need to consult a doctor. Your doctor may ask details about coughing up blood such as since when you are having it, how much blood you ''cough'' up, and whether you have other complaints such as breathlessness, ''fever'', and ''chest pain''. They may also ask about your history of taking any medications or ''smoking''.''To diagnose the cause of coughing up blood, your doctor may ask the following tests to be done:\xa0' Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest Chest X-ray Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Sputum examinations such as microscopy or culture to look for infections Lung scan Lung biopsy Bronchoscopy (a procedure in which a flexible tube is inserted through the nose or mouth to examine the lungs and airways) Blood counts Blood clotting test Pulmonary arteriography/angiography (a procedure to see the blood flow through the lungs) Urinalysis"

Acupressure and massage therapies can help in relaxation and reducing chronic pain. Stimulus-control therapy: It works by associating the bed with only sleepiness and when it is time to sleep. Sleep-restriction therapy: This is based on the fact that excessive time in bed can lead to insomnia. Hence, it is advised for adults to limit sleep time to around five to seven hours. Patients are advised the following: To avoid caffeinated beverages in the late afternoon or evening To avoid alcohol in the evening To avoid large meals right before bedtime To exercise in the late afternoon or early evening (six hours before bedtime) that can promote sleep"
"What is bloating? What does ""feeling bloated"" mean?","'Why am I so bloated? Abdominal bloating or ""feeling bloated"" is a very frequent and familiar symptom most people have experienced at some time in their lives. There are many reasons you may feel bloated. Most causes are simple, harmless, and easily treatable with ''over-the-counter'' or home remedies. Very rarely, abdominal bloating is caused by something more serious, leading to a rapid worsening of uncomfortable symptoms.''The definition of ""bloated"" is swelling or distension, and it usually refers to abdominal bloating, which is a distended belly. Bloating may be accompanied by burping (''belching''), ''gas'' (''flatulence'', ''farting''), abdominal discomfort, and a feeling of fullness. People sometimes refer abdominal bloating as a ""''bloated stomach''"" or ""bloated belly.""' "
What are 21 common causes of abdominal bloating?,"'Increased ''intestinal gas'' is one of the most common reasons you might be bloated.

Why are calcium levels low in renal failure?,"'There is a complex coordination between the calcium controlling glands (the parathyroid gland), ''vitamin D'' (made by the skin or a ''diet'') and the kidneys that is affected once ''kidney disease'' progresses.''Renal failure'' usually causes calcium imbalance.''It should also be noted that renal failure may also lead to ''high calcium levels''.' During renal failure, the kidneys may no longer filter out extra phosphorus and remove it from the body or from urine. Over time, phosphorus may increase in the blood. Calcium and phosphorous usually keep each other in check. With the progression of kidney disease, high phosphorus levels may lead to low serum calcium by depositing it onto the bones and other tissues. Vitamin D usually aids in the absorption of calcium from food. Healthy kidneys usually change vitamin D from sunlight and foods into active vitamin D that may help in balancing calcium levels through absorption. When the kidneys fail, there is a short supply of active vitamin D. This causes calcium and phosphorus to get out of balance.  Parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be produced in large quantities, stimulated by low levels of calcium in the blood. PTH tries to keep the calcium level in the blood normal by increasing calcium absorption from food, but it also takes calcium out of the bones. Eventually the parathyroid glands work so hard they go out of control and may cause persistently high calcium levels."
What is renal failure?,"'Renal or ''kidney failure'' is a condition in which the kidney does not perform its functions properly. This condition may be temporary or permanent. There are two different types of ''kidney failure''Stages' Acute kidney injury: It may start suddenly and may be reversible. It may occur due to injury, infections, medication side effects or sometimes preexisting diseases. Chronic/severe kidney disease: It progresses slowly over at least three months and can lead to permanent kidney failure. It may be caused by various medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, hereditary kidney disease, etc. It usually does not produce any symptoms until it progresses to advanced stages. Stage 1: 90% kidney function is usually preserved.  Stage 2: 60% to 89% kidney function is preserved. Stage 3: Symptoms may include tiredness, puffiness, changes in appetite, dull back pain and urine changes. Kidney functioning may be reduced to 40% to 59%. Stage 4: Patients experience fatigue, swelling, changes in appetite, back pain, changes in urination, hypertension and slowed digestion. Kidney function may be reduced to 15% to 29%. Stage 5: This is end-stage kidney failure. The kidneys are only functioning at less than 15%."
How is renal failure treated?,"'Early stages of renal failure are usually treated with lifestyle modifications and by controlling underlying causes such as ''hypertension'' and ''diabetes''.''When kidney function falls below 10% of normal, the options below may be used' Dialysis: This is a way to pump blood through a machine that filters out waste and returns the blood to the body. There are two types of dialysisHemodialysis: A tube is stuck into one of the veins (the neck, arm or leg) to remove toxins from the blood. This is usually done three times a week for three to four hours at a time.Peritoneal dialysis: This is done through a tube that is placed inside the belly. Hemodialysis: A tube is stuck into one of the veins (the neck, arm or leg) to remove toxins from the blood. This is usually done three times a week for three to four hours at a time. Peritoneal dialysis: This is done through a tube that is placed inside the belly. Kidney transplant: This is a procedure in which a surgeon puts a healthier kidney from another person into the person who has kidney disease. A kidney transplant is the best way to treat many patients with end-stage kidney failure. Kidneys for transplant come from people who have agreed to donate their kidneys when they die (deceased donors) or healthy people (living donors). Living donors are most often family members of the patient. There is a shorter wait time to surgery for a transplant from a living donor. This is because there is a waiting list for the kidneys from deceased donors and not enough donors. Additionally, patients with kidneys donated by living donors live longer (and the kidneys last longer) than those with kidneys from deceased donors or who just stay on dialysis."
What is the life expectancy with kidney failure?,"'Kidney disease or failure may affect the lifespan. Estimating a timeframe may be complex. In acute cases, death may occur within a few days to a week without treatment. In severe cases, life expectancy may be a few years at most without treatment. However, even people who have complete renal failure may live for years with proper care and regular dialysis treatments. A kidney transplant may also result in a longer survival period.' "
Why are my eyes twitching?,"'Eye twitching, or ''blepharospasm'', is a condition in which you cannot keep your eyes open for a long time due to spasms.''The main causes of ''eye twitch'' include' Fatigue Stress Smoking Caffeine Medication side effects (e.g., anti-depression medicines, medications for parkinsonism) Light sensitivity Lack of sleep Foreign particles in the eye Corneal irritation"
What is an eye twitch?,"'An eye twitch is a harmless involuntary spasm of the muscle of the eyelids, which may resolve on its own. Eye twitch (blepharospasm) causes the ''eyelid'' to blink every few seconds for a minute or two.''Twitches are generally painless; however, if there is a strong spasm, it causes the eyelid to shut completely and then reopen.'

What is the twitching eye an indication of?,"'Eye twitching is generally harmless and does not indicate any serious medical conditions. Sometimes, persistent eye twitching can be a sign of more serious conditions like:''Very rarely, eye twitching can be a sign of a nerve or brain disorder like:' Blepharitis (inflamed eyelids) Dry eyes Light sensitivity Conjunctivitis or pink eye Bell’s palsy: A form of facial paralysis due to dysfunction of facial nerves Dystonia: Involuntary muscle contractions Parkinson’s disease: A brain disorder caused due to nerve cell damage Tourette’s syndrome: A nervous system disorder causing the person to make sudden movements"
What are the different types of eye twitches?,"'There are three types of eye twitches, which are:' Minor eyelid twitches: These are normal twitches commonly associated with fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, caffeine, alcohol, or corneal or conjunctival irritation. Benign essential blepharospasm: This results in nonstop blinking or eye irritation. As the condition advances, it can cause blurry vision, light sensitivity, and facial spasms. Benign essential blepharospasm is caused because of fatigue, stress, and bright light or wind. Hemifacial spasm: This rare condition affects the muscles around the mouth and the eyelid. It generally affects only one side of the face."
When should an eye twitch be treated?,"'Seek medical attention in the following conditions:' Twitch that lasts for more than a week Eyelid closes completely Spasms of other facial muscles Redness, swelling, or discharge from the eye Drooping of the upper eyelid"
How to stop eye twitching?,"'Twitches generally stop without any major effort. If it doesn’t go away, you might try these techniques to ease eye twitching:''On the other hand, the physician might inject ''Botox'' (botulinum toxin) to treat serious conditions like benign essential blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. Botox is prescribed for temporary relief, and you should undergo repeated treatment for complete relief.''The physicians may also prescribe medications like ''Klonopin'' (''clonazepam''), ''Ativan'' (''lorazepam'') or Artane,\xa0Trihexane, Tritane (trihexyphenidyl\xa0hydrochloride) to treat mild cases.''There are some alternative therapies, which include:''As a last resort, the physician might perform a surgical myectomy, i.e., removal of muscle and nerve ending around your eyelid to relieve spasm.' Get adequate rest Cut down alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine Apply a warm compress to your eyes Use artificial tears to keep the eye surfaces lubricated Biofeedback: This technique helps to control the involuntary muscle using relaxation exercises and methods Acupuncture: Thin needles are inserted to the pressure points to relieve twitching Hypnosis Chiropractic: This technique involves hands-on spinal manipulation to heal twitching Diet management Tinted glass"
Why do hippies smell like patchouli?,"'Patchouli oil has been in use for thousands of years, but it gained tremendous popularity because of its use by the hippies in the 1960s. Experts suggest that regular use of patchouli oil by hippies is because of the raw, earthy and natural nature of this oil. Hippies preferred using products that were not artificially manufactured and were cruelty free. Those are characteristics of patchouli oil. Patchouli oil is derived from the plant, Pogostemon cablin, that belongs to the mint family. The plant is native to tropical Asian countries such as India, China, Malaysia and the Philippines. Some experts suggest that strong-smelling patchouli oil was used by hippies to mask the smell of ''marijuana'' that they have used. It was also effective in masking the smell of ''alcohol''. The hippie culture emphasized unbounded love and inclusiveness. Patchouli oil is known for its calming and libido-enhancing effect, which made it popular among the hippies.' "
Is patchouli oil good for stress and anxiety?,"'There is lack of scientific evidence to support the use of patchouli oil for medical conditions including ''stress'', ''depression'' and ''anxiety''. Caution is advised. The oil, however, is used by practitioners of alternative medicine including Ayurveda and aromatherapy for managing mental conditions such as ''stress'', ''depression'' and ''anxiety''. Besides the use for mental conditions, patchouli oil is also used for other purposes including' Treating skin conditions such as skin allergies and inflammation Controlling nausea and vomiting Treating headaches Treating bad breath, especially from alcohol use Treating diarrhea and stomach pain Controlling appetite Treating skin conditions as a constituent of skin creams, lotions and other personal care products Treating hair conditions such as hair loss and dandruff Treating insect and fungal infestations as an insecticide and antifungal agent to protect items such as silk fabrics, carpets and woolen clothes Enhancing the taste of foods and beverages as a flavoring agent Disinfecting because it has disinfectant and antibacterial properties  Enhancing scent In perfumes and deodorants"
How do you use patchouli oil?,"'Patchouli oil has to be diluted in a carrier oil such as coconut oil before use. Direct application of the concentrated essential oil is not recommended because it may cause skin irritation. The oil can also be used in aromatherapy. You may add a few drops of the oil to your moisturizer or skin cream before application. Add a few drops to shampoo or conditioner to make hair smoother and boost ''scalp'' health. Patchouli oil may also be added in small quantities to foods and beverages as a flavoring agent. Dried leaves from the patchouli plant may be used for making patchouli tea. Ingestion of patchouli oil may be toxic and should be avoided. The safety of patchouli oil has not been demonstrated in ''pregnant'' women or lactating mothers. Because there is a paucity of scientific evidence for using patchouli oil for treating medical conditions, it advisable to not use the oil or other patchouli products without consulting your healthcare provider. People with underlying medical conditions or who are on long-term medications must particularly refrain from using the oil without consulting their doctor.' "
Signs and symptoms of canker sores,"'One of the most obvious signs of a ''canker sore'' is a small, painful yellow or white ulcer inside of your lip or cheek. For some, the sore appears on the gums. These sometimes get confused with ''cold sores''. There are a few things that can help you to tell the difference.''One of the biggest differences between ''cold sores'' and canker sores is that ''cold sores'' appear on the outside of the mouth, usually around the lips. In some instances, they may show up on the roof of your mouth or tongue. Canker sores always appear inside the lips or cheeks. Another major difference between the two is that canker sores aren’t ''contagious'', while ''cold'' sores are.\xa0''Other signs and symptoms of canker sores include:''You may notice a tingling or burning feeling inside of your mouth before the canker sore appears.\xa0''While it’s not always the case, some people develop a ''fever'' when they get a canker sore. A high ''fever'' can point toward a more serious issue.''Some people with canker sores may feel tired.\xa0''While not as common as some of the other symptoms, ''swollen lymph nodes'' may come along with a canker sore.

Some of the most common include:''The connection between ''stress'' and canker sores isn’t well-understood, but studies do suggest that increased levels of ''stress'' can cause the ulcers to develop .\xa0''Fluctuations in hormones may cause canker sores. Women who are prone to them may notice that the ulcers appear a few days before their period and go away after it’s done.\xa0''You might develop canker sores if your body is lacking certain nutrients. Some studies show that low levels of B ''vitamins'' can increase the risk of these painful ulcers. Other studies show that low iron levels may contribute to canker sores.\xa0''Acidic foods, such as lemons, limes, oranges, tomatoes, strawberries, and more, can sometimes cause a canker sore to develop. You may also develop canker sores if you are sensitive to certain types of foods, such as ''chocolate'', coffee, eggs, or anything spicy.\xa0''Sodium lauryl sulfate, a common ingredient in ''toothpaste'' and mouthwash, can cause canker sores. Studies show people who use oral care products with this ingredient are more likely to have them.''Injuries to the soft tissues inside of your mouth — such as brushing too hard, biting your cheek, rubbing from ''braces'', or ill-fitting ''dentures'' — can sometimes cause a canker sore to form.\xa0''Canker sores may develop as a side effect of an autoimmune disease. The ulcers are linked to many conditions, such as:' Celiac disease Lupus Inflammatory bowel disease Behcet’s syndrome HIV/AIDS"
Diagnosing canker sores,"'You don’t need to undergo any tests to diagnose a canker sore. Your doctor or dentist can identify them by looking at them. If your doctor believes that the ulcers are occurring as a result of an underlying condition, however, you may undergo other tests to determine what that issue is.' "
Treatments for canker sores,"'In many cases, canker sores go away on their own without treatment. Large or painful canker sores that last longer than two weeks, however, may need medical care. Some common treatment options for these ulcers include:''If your canker sores are the result of an underlying health condition, your doctor will provide recommendations to treat that issue.\xa0' Over-the-counter or prescription topical medications, such as benzocaine or fluocinonide Prescription mouthwashes  Oral medications Nutritional supplements Cauterization of the sore"
Why you should see a neuro-ophthalmologist,"'Neuro-ophthalmologists are doctors who treat visual problems that are usually related to the nervous system. These doctors or physicians are specialists with expertise in problems of the eye, brain, nerves, and muscles.''A patient may have been advised to see a neuro-ophthalmologist if they have ''vision loss'' or vision problems due to ''optic nerve'' injury. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that are part of the central nervous system. They transfer visual information from the retina to the brain. When the optic nerve is squeezed due to injury or mass/''cancers'', the blood supply and ability of the nerve to send the signals to the brain may be impaired.''Below are a few common conditions for which neuro-ophthalmologist consultation may be required:''These conditions are usually diagnosed through physical examination, blood tests, or by various imaging tests, such as ''CT scans'' or ''MRIs''.' Papilledema: It is a serious medical condition where the optic nerve at the back of the eye becomes swollen. There is a buildup of pressure in or around the brain, which causes the optic nerve to swell causing visual disturbances, headaches, and vomiting. Medications are used to reduce the pressure inside the skull. Sometimes brain surgery may be required if the increased pressure is due to tumor growth. Optic neuropathy: This is a condition in which the optic nerve is damaged leading to a loss of vision. It may be due to diabetes, cancer, toxins, or other causes. The treatment is done to find and eliminate the underlying cause. Optic neuritis: This a condition in which swelling near the optic nerve interferes with the function of the optic nerve. Symptoms may include pain with eye movement and temporary vision loss. Antibiotics and corticosteroids are usually prescribed to flush out the infection or suppress the immune disorders from causing further damage. Tumors: Brain tumors and orbital tumors that may be causing vision disturbances require consultation with a neuro-ophthalmologist. Stroke: A stroke is a medical emergency. It occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing brain tissue from getting oxygen and nutrients. Brain cells may begin to die in minutes, and this can be fatal if left untreated. Seizures: Seizures are characterized by the sudden contraction and stiffening of the muscles. Often a person's eyes may roll back into their head, and as the chest muscles tighten and contract, it may become more difficult to breathe. These seizures are short in duration and usually last less than 20 seconds. Repetitive seizures may be fatal if left untreated. Ptosis: Drooping or falling of the upper eyelid is called blepharoptosis or ptosis. The drooping may be worse after being awake for a long time when the individual's muscles are tired. Blepharospasm: It is a rare condition in which the eyelid may blink or twitch involuntary. This is usually caused by muscle spasm around the eye. Nystagmus: Also called dancing eyes. In this condition, a patient may have involuntary (or voluntary, in some cases) eye movement, acquired in infancy or later in life, that may result in reduced or limited vision. Multiple sclerosis (MS): Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease (the immune system mistakenly attacks its own body) in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) by damaging, sometimes even destroying, the protective sheet (myelin) around the nerve fibers. Due to this condition an individual might develop problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other bodily functions. Doctors might prescribe pain killers, antidepressants, steroids, and other drugs like muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, or botulinum toxin (Botox), to ease muscle spasms and make MS attacks shorter and less severe. Diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy: In this condition, the optic nerve and retina may be damaged due to excessive blood sugar levels or diabetes. As the disease progresses, the blood supply to the retina gets cut off, leading to vision loss. Since the underlying cause is diabetes, it is essential to treat diabetes before it further damages the nerve and other blood vessels. Unexplained headaches: Few patients may present with recurrent severe headaches that do not give enough relief with primary treatment."
What are the symptoms of boils?,"'You may get single or multiple boils at a time. A ''boil'' usually starts as a painful, pinkish-red, and swollen bump on a firm area of the skin. The boil may progress to form a fluid-filled ''cyst''.''The ''pain'' typically worsens when the boil gets filled with pus and dead tissue. A boil may empty its contents (drain) on its own. This may reduce ''pain''. Usually, however, a large boil needs to be opened and drained by a healthcare provider.''The other symptoms of a boil include:' A bump about the size of a pea that may grow as large as a golf ball Pustules (white or yellow center) Spread to other skin areas or joining with other boils Quick growth Weeping, oozing, or crusting Fever and chills Fatigue Feeling unwell Itching before the boil develops The skin around the boil becomes red, painful, and warm"
How to treat boils at home?,"'Boils may go away on their own. For home management of boils, you may:' Apply warm, moist compresses on the boil. Soak a flannel or any clean and soft cloth in warm water and place it over the boils for a few minutes, many times a day. Clean the area around the boil with soap and water. If the boil opens, continue applying warm and moist compresses to speed up healing. Keep yourself clean by taking a bath every day and regularly washing your hands. You may take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications to ease the pain. Do not squeeze or pick a boil. Do not try to cut open the boil at home. Wash your hand before and after touching the boil. You should not share or reuse your washcloths or towels. Clean your clothing, washcloths, towels, sheets, or other items that have touched infected areas by washing in hot water. Dispose of the used dressings in a sealed bag carefully so that any discharge from the boil does not touch anything else."
When should I consult a doctor for my boil?,"'Boils usually get better with home management. You may consult your doctor if''Your doctor may drain the boil and prescribe antibiotics for faster healing. Never attempt to drain the boil yourself because it can spread infection.' The boil does not heal in two weeks. You get a fever. More boils appear. The boil comes back. The boil is on the spine or middle of your face (the dangerous area). The boil causes significant pain or discomfort. You have long-term health conditions such as diabetes, heart diseases, or cancer."
What is the gallbladder? ,"'The\xa0''gallbladder ''is a small pear-shaped organ located below the ''liver'' on the right side of the belly. The main function of the gallbladder is to store bile, a substance secreted by the liver that is required for ''digestion''. The bile contents in the bile may sometimes crystallize and form ''gallstones''. They may be as small as a grain of salt or as large as a tennis ball causing serious symptoms and complications.' "
Why do you get gallstones?,"'The exact cause of ''gallstones'' cannot usually be determined. Some possible causes are as follows:''Risk factors for gallstones: ''Certain factors increase the risk of gallstones, such as:' High cholesterol in the bile: Normally, the cholesterol excreted by the liver is digested and dissolved by the chemicals in the bile. If the liver excretes excess cholesterol, beyond what the bile can dissolve, the excess cholesterol may crystallize, forming stones. High bilirubin in the bile: Bilirubin is a chemical that's produced when the body breaks down red blood cells. Certain conditions of the liver like liver cirrhosis or liver infections or blood disorders cause increased production of bilirubin. The excess bilirubin can lead to gallstone formation. Decreased gallbladder emptying: If the gallbladder doesn't empty completely, bile concentration may increase, contributing to the formation of gallstones. Age over 40 years  Being woman (women who are overweight and above 40 years have an even higher risk) Being of Native American or Mexican American descent  Obesity Sudden loss of weight Sedentary lifestyle Pregnancy Eating diet containing high fat, high cholesterol, and low fiber Family history of gallstones Having diabetes or liver disease Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia or leukemia Certain medications such as oral contraceptives or hormone therapy drugs"
What are the types of gallstones?,'There are two types of gallstones that can form in the gallbladder:' Cholesterol gallstones: This is the most common type of gallstone. They appear yellow in color. These gallstones mainly consist of undissolved cholesterol and small amounts of other components. Pigment gallstones: These stones contain high amount of bilirubin. The appear dark brown or black.
What are the signs and symptoms of gallstones?,"'There may be no symptoms in the initial stages. Some signs and symptoms that may develop later are as follows' Pain in the right upper abdomen, which may be mild or severe  Back pain Digestive discomfort, especially after a heavy meal  Tenderness over the right upper abdomen  Fever with chills, in case of infection  Nausea and vomiting "
Can gallstones be prevented?,"'The following may help prevent gallstones' Maintaining a healthy body weight Eating a balanced diet, with low fat and high fiber Not skipping meals Slow and steady weight loss"
How are gallstones treated?,"'If gallstones are not very large, the doctor may advise nonsurgical treatment methods to dissolve the gallstones.' "
Nonsurgical treatment options," Medication: Medications such as ursodiol cause thinning of the bile, helping gallstones dissolve. Medication to reduce cholesterol levels in the bile may help. These medications usually take years to work and do not prevent recurrence. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ECSWL): ECSWL is a nonsurgical treatment that uses external shock waves to fragment the gallstones, less than 2 cm in diameter. Methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) injection: A solvent called MTBE is injected into the gallbladder to dissolve gallstones. Endoscopic drainage: An endoscope (a thin tube attached to a camera and light) along with a wire is passed down the throat and into the gallbladder, helping the gallbladder resume normal drainage. Percutaneous cholecystostomy: This is ideal for seriously ill patients who are not fit for surgery. A needle is used to withdraw fluid from the gallbladder followed by inserting a catheter through the skin to drain the fluid that is left in place for a few weeks until surgery is possible. Transmural drainage: This involves creating a new tract through the stomach into the gallbladder. A metal stent is placed, allowing gallbladder to drain into the small intestine.  Acute cholecystostomy: In patients with acute cholecystitis, cholecystostomy may be performed for those who are unable to undergo surgery to drain infection. Surgery: Cholecystectomy (surgery to remove the gallbladder) is indicated if nonsurgical techniques are not possible or in the case of recurrence. Once the gallbladder is removed, the bile flows directly from the liver into the small intestine. Gallbladder is not required to live, and its removal doesn't affect digestion or quality of life. Sometimes, there may be bloating or diarrhea on eating food with a high fat content but having a balanced diet can make such complaints go away."
What is sclerotherapy?,"'Sclerotherapy'' is a procedure in which a solution called “sclerosing agent” is injected into the veins for treatment of small vessel varicose disease. Sclerotherapy is typically performed on the legs for conditions such as\xa0''Varicose veins''\xa0are enlarged, swollen, and twisting\xa0veins. They appear blue or dark purple. They occur when faulty valves in the\xa0veins\xa0allow blood to flow in the wrong direction or to pool.''Telangiectasias'' are widened capillaries that appear as flat, red vessels smaller than 1 mm in diameter.''Venulectasias'' are tiny veins that are widened and appear blue, sometimes distended above the skin surface, smaller than 2 mm in diameter.''Reticular veins'' have a bluish discoloration (cyanotic hue), and are 2 mm to 4 mm in diameter.''Large varicosities and tiny varicosities do not respond to sclerotherapy.' telangiectasis,  venulectasias, and  reticular ectasias.  "
What are the types of sclerotherapy?,"'The agents used in sclerotherapy (sclerosants) include:\xa0' Detergents – they disrupt vein cellular membrane (protein theft denaturation) Osmotic agents – they damage the cell by shifting the water balance and cell membrane denaturation Chemical irritants –damage the cell membrane by direct, caustic destruction "
When is sclerotherapy used?,'The main indications for sclerotherapy include:''Sclerotherapy is not recommended if you have certain pre-existing conditions:' improving cosmetic appearance; and  reducing symptoms such as pain and burning associated with varicosities. Blood clotting in the veins(thrombophlebitis )  Blood clotting in the lungs (pulmonary emboli)  A blood clotting disorder (hypercoagulable states)  Pregnancy Allergy to the sclerosing agents
What are the risks and complications of sclerotherapy?," Temporary bruising   Pain  Temporary, small blood vessels in the treated area Dark skin patches (hyperpigmentation), usually temporary  Swelling (edema) Allergic reactions to the sclerosing agents (itchy, red hives) Severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction to the sclerosing agents (anaphylaxis)The reaction can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Symptoms include rashes, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and shock. If not treated immediately, it can lead to unconsciousness or death.

What is distal pancreatectomy?,"'A pancreatosplenectomy (pancreaticosplenectomy) or spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is performed to surgically treat the pancreatic disease of the tail and body. A distal pancreatectomy involves surgical resection of the body and tail of the pancreas with or without splenectomy.''There are various surgical techniques, and the choice of procedure depends upon the disease process, characteristics of the lesion, and surgeon’s experience.\xa0''A spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is reserved for ''chronic pancreatitis'', proven benign pancreatic lesions and ''cysts'', and pancreatic ''trauma''. Lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas become symptomatic because they enlarge and invade surrounding structures.' The pancreas: It is about 6 inches long and located behind the stomach. The head of the pancreas is on the right side of the abdomen and is connected to the duodenum (the first section of the small intestine) through a small tube called the pancreatic duct. The narrow end of the pancreas, called the tail, extends to the left side of the body. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes and insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. The spleen: It is an organ located in the upper left of the abdomen and left of the stomach. The spleen varies in size and shape, but it is typically fist-shaped, purple, and about 4 inches long. The spleen is protected by the rib cage; hence, it cannot be felt unless it is abnormally enlarged. The spleen acts as a filter. It helps to fight infection and removes damaged red blood cells."
Why is distal pancreatectomy done?,'Some common indications for surgery are as follows:' Chronic pancreatitis (chronic and recurrent inflammation of the pancreas) Pancreatic tumors Stenosis (narrowing) the pancreatic duct Pancreatolithiasis (calculi/stones in the pancreas) Stenosis of the blood vessels supplying the pancreas Pancreatic cysts Pancreatic trauma
How is distal pancreatectomy performed? ,"'The surgery is performed under general anesthesia.''Staging laparotomy ''is usually performed before proceeding to resection. During a staging laparotomy, the surgeon inserts a scope (a camera with a light source) through a small incision (a surgical cut) on the abdomen.\xa0''A staging laparotomy helps to examine the structures in the abdominal ''cavity'' and staging the ''cancer of the pancreas''. The surgery may be performed via an open approach or laparoscopically or via a robotic-assisted surgery.\xa0''There are also various surgical techniques. The approach and technique depend upon the disease, extent of surgery, and surgeon’s experience. A surgical drain may be inserted during the surgery.''Patients are administered with painkillers and antibiotics during the postoperative period. Patients are usually discharged five to seven days after the surgery. Although the surgery is complex, most patients recover well from the surgery.' Open distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy: In this technique, the spleen is separated and mobilized first, and the resection of the pancreas is the final step. The tumor is resected completely along with a margin of healthy tissues. Surrounding lymph nodes may be removed. Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS): In this technique, the neck of the pancreas is divided first, and mobilization of the spleen is the final step. The tumor is resected completely along with a margin of healthy tissues. Surrounding lymph nodes may be removed. Robot-assisted RAMPS may be done. In laparoscopic surgery, multiple small incisions are made through which the scope and surgical instruments are inserted. A spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy may be done if there is no indication for spleen removal."
Why is a spleen removed in distal pancreatectomy?,"'A spleen may be removed during the surgery\xa0because the artery supplying the spleen lies along the body and tail of the pancreas. Because of this, the blood vessel can get blocked, and infection or tumor can spread to the spleen.\xa0''Because the spleen helps the body fight infection, a splenectomy (spleen removal) would reduce the patient’s immunity. Hence, the doctor would recommend certain ''vaccines'' before the surgery and precautions to be taken after the surgery.' "
What are the complications of distal pancreatectomy?,"'Some common complications that may be encountered during the surgery are' pancreatic leak, pancreatic fistula, abdominal abscess, infection, bleeding, small bowel obstruction, new-onset insulin-dependent diabetes, problems with digestion, change in bowel habits and loss of appetite and weight."
What is a transbronchial biopsy?,"'A transbronchial biopsy is a procedure that examines the ''lungs''. In a transbronchial biopsy, the doctor passes a flexible telescope called a bronchoscope through the nose or mouth to cut a small piece of the lung tissue for further lung analysis. The procedure is typically used to find a problem in the lungs.' "
Why is a transbronchial biopsy performed?,'There are several reasons patients might require a transbronchial biopsy. The most common reasons are as follows:' Tumor confirmation Lung changes observed on computed tomography (CT) scan or other imaging tests Causes for difficulty breathing such as suspected interstitial lung disease Suspected cause for lung transplant rejection Unexplained cough lasting more than three months Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) Severe lung or bronchial infections
How long does a transbronchial biopsy take?,"'Usually, a transbronchial biopsy is completed within one hour. However, in rare cases, the procedure may extend for a couple of hours depending on the patient’s complications. The procedure is usually done under local anesthesia and mostly as an outpatient procedure. A transbronchial biopsy is performed by a ''pulmonologist'' or lung specialist.' The patient may be advised not to eat or drink for at least four hours prior to surgery. A local anesthesia gel and spray is used to numb the nose and throat. Local sedatives are used for the patient to relax during the procedure.  Patient’s oxygen levels and heart rate are monitored during the procedure. The doctor will pass a bronchoscope (flexible telescope) through the nose and down into the lungs. Sometimes, the bronchoscope will be passed through the patient’s mouth instead of their nose.  The doctor uses a bronchoscope to examine the patient’s bronchi (airways) and then gently pushes small forceps down one of their airways (a bronchus) into the lungs. The doctor will use the forceps to take samples of the lung tissue and use an X-ray machine to determine the location within the lung from which the biopsies are taken.  The doctor may also use small amounts of salty water to obtain other further samples for analysis.  The patient may have to undergo a chest X-ray after the procedure. Following the procedure, the samples will be examined to determine the cause of the problem."
What are the risks involved in a transbronchial biopsy?,"'Although the procedure carries some risks, they’re low. This test provides important diagnostic information. It may help the patient avoid a major surgery, which is much riskier.' Complications of a transbronchial biopsy include the following: Allergic reaction to sedatives Infection Bleeding Damage to the vocal cords Injury to the lungs Irregular heart rhythms Pneumothorax or leaking of air from the lungs Heart attack Hypoxemia or low blood oxygen"
What is the recovery period after a transbronchial biopsy?, 
Is vacuum-assisted delivery safe?,"'Vacuum-assisted delivery is usually safe, but the following criteria have to be met to undergo a vacuum-assisted delivery safely:' The cervix should be completely dilated: If the cervix is not fully dilated and a vacuum is used, there is a high risk of injuring or tearing the cervix, which requires surgical repair and may affect future pregnancies. The exact position of your baby’s head should be known: The vacuum should be placed over the midline of the top of the head and never on the baby’s face or brow. Hence, vacuum-assisted delivery is less likely to succeed if the baby is facing straight up. The baby’s head must be engaged: The baby’s head should be engaged (fixed), meaning the baby’s head should have entered the pelvic brim or inlet. This is measured in relation to the narrowest point of the birth canal called the ischial spines. The top of the baby’s head should be aligned with the ischial spines and ideally 1-2 cm below the spines to be able to use a vacuum. The success of using a vacuum increases the baby’s head, which is visible at the vaginal opening when the mother is pushing. The membranes must be ruptured: The amniotic membranes must be ruptured (also referred to as water breaking) to perform a vacuum-assisted delivery. The baby should be able to fit through the birth canal: Sometimes, the baby may be too big for the birth canal; for example, in gestational diabetes, the baby’s head is bigger than average. If a vacuum-assisted delivery is attempted, it would most likely fail and result in serious complications. The pregnancy must be term or near term: The risk of fetal complications following a vacuum-assisted delivery is higher in premature infants; hence, it is not to be performed before 34 weeks of pregnancy. Forceps and other techniques may be used to augment the delivery of premature infants."
Why is amniocentesis done in Polyhydramnios?,"'The fetus (unborn baby) is present inside the uterus in the amniotic sac (the covering) that contains the ''amniotic fluid''. The fluid provides ''nutrition'' to the developing baby and protects the baby from any external shocks or injuries. ''Amniocentesis'' is a medical procedure in which a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed and sent for lab examination to diagnose medical conditions. The procedure is usually done after the 15th week of ''pregnancy''. Amniocentesis is also done for treatment purposes. The procedure in which amniocentesis is done to intentionally reduce the amniotic fluid volume is called amnioreduction. Amnioreduction helps in the treatment of polyhydramnios. This is a condition in which the amount of the amniotic fluid is more than what it should be for the gestational age. It is preferred particularly when the doctor has diagnosed the condition as severe polyhydramnios as in the case of ''twin-to-twin transfusion'' syndrome (TTTS). In TTTS, one twin gets an excess of blood, whereas the other has decreased blood flow. Besides removing the excess amniotic fluid, amniocentesis also helps diagnose the cause of polyhydramnios by laboratory examination of the amniotic fluid to look for any genetic conditions in the fetus.''Amnioreduction can be performed manually or with the help of vacuum-assisted devices (vacuum tubing and vacuum bottles). During the procedure, needles of different sizes (gauges) may be used (typically 18 or 20 gauge). The amount of the fluid removed depends on the severity of polyhydramnios. The procedure is generally done under sedation and numbing agents such as ''lidocaine'' may be used to reduce ''pain'' and discomfort. The patient lies on her back with a slight tilt toward her left side with the help of supporting pillows. The procedure is done under ''ultrasound'' guidance to ensure the safety of the mother and her baby. Medications may be given after the procedure to reduce any ''pain'' and complications.' "
What are the various indications for amniocentesis?,"'Amniocentesis may be done for various diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. It is helpful in the diagnosis of many genetic abnormalities in the fetus. Because the procedure carries some risks for the mother and the baby, amniocentesis is done when the doctor thinks that the benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks. The patient can refuse to go for the procedure, if she wants.''Amniocentesis may be done for' The diagnosis of genetic diseases such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. Testing fetal lung maturity, especially in cases where preterm labor (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) is planned or expected. The treatment of polyhydramnios, especially in cases of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The diagnosis of fetal infections. Determining paternity through DNA testing of the fetal cells present in the amniotic fluid."
What are the risks of amniocentesis?,"'The risks of amniocentesis are as follows' Infections Preterm labor Miscarriage Injury to the baby  Injury to the mother Transmission of infections from the mother to baby Rh sensitization (the baby is Rh positive, whereas the mother is Rh negative)"
What is an endobronchial ultrasound?,"'Endobronchial ''ultrasound'' is a procedure used to diagnose various lung problems, including infections and ''cancer''. The procedure allows the doctors to investigate the ''lungs'' and to take samples with the aid of an ultrasound scan.' "
Why is an endobronchial ultrasound performed?,"'Endobronchial ultrasound allows physicians to perform a technique known as ''transbronchial needle aspiration.'' It helps the doctors to obtain tissue or fluid samples from the lungs and surrounding areas without invasive surgery.''The samples can be used for' diagnosing and staging lung cancer, detecting infections, and identifying inflammatory diseases that affect the lungs, such as sarcoidosis or cancers like lymphoma."
What happens during an endobronchial ultrasound?,"'There are several steps involved with an endobronchial ultrasound, which includes the following.' Endobronchial ultrasound is usually done under local and general anesthesia.  A flexible small tube (bronchoscope) is passed into the lungs via the mouth.  A small camera at the end of the bronchoscope enables the doctor to look directly into the windpipe (trachea) and breathing tubes (bronchi).  A small ultrasound probe on the end of the camera allows the doctor to see the glands in the center of the chest (mediastinum) and take samples under direct vision.  Most of the time endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration is done to take samples from the center of your chest (mediastinum).  The whole procedure takes about 20 to 30 minutes.  Endobronchial ultrasound is beneficial because it is noninvasive, and also provides doctor access to more areas of the lungs, including hard-to-reach spots.  This procedure is usually done as an outpatient surgery. This allows the patient to return home on the same day after the procedure. "
What happens after endobronchial ultrasound?,"'After the procedure, the patient is monitored. It takes a few hours before the patient may be able to\xa0''cough''\xa0after the procedure.''The throat may feel sore and scratchy for a few days. At this time, the doctor may also send a biopsy to a lab for testing.\xa0''If a patient has\xa0''lung cancer'', the information from the needle aspiration can help the doctor figure out the ''cancer'' stage. Usually, the doctor provides results within five days after the procedure.' "
What are the risks of endobronchial ultrasound?,"'Endobronchial ultrasound ''bronchoscopy'' is extremely safe but, as with any medical procedure, there is a small risk of complications that include:''All these complications are treatable but may require the patient to be admitted to the hospital instead of going home the same day after the procedure.\xa0' Bleeding from the biopsy Infection after the procedure Fever Sore throat Chest pain Breathing difficulties Low oxygen levels during or after the procedure  Lung collapse of the lung (very rare)"
Is an endobronchial ultrasound painful?,"'Although some patients may experience a ''sore throat'' and ''fatigue'' after the procedure, endobronchial ultrasound is safe and isn’t associated with ''pain''.''Once the procedure is completed, the patient may remain under observation for a couple hours until the effects of the medications wear off. The patient might then be discharged home on the same day.' "
Why is an escharotomy performed?,'An escharotomy is generally performed:''It is most effective when performed before the onset of lactic acidosis.' To restore perfusion (blood supply) To relieve pressure (pressure greater than 30 mmHg) To correct lung function
What is escharotomy?,"'An escharotomy is an emergency medical procedure that involves the removal of the full-thickness ''burn'' (eschar) down to the subcutaneous fat to release it and prevent further complications. It restores blood flow and allows adequate ventilation. When the skin suffers an eschar, it loses its elasticity resulting in the compression of the underlying skin tissues due to the formation of ''edema'' beneath the eschar. The fluid from the cells shifts to the adjacent interstitial space, causing augmented tissue pressure. The inelasticity of the overlying burned skin can lead to increased tissue pressure, thus reducing blood flow to the legs. If the front part of the body is affected by eschar, it can compromise lung function, which is seen as an inability to ventilate and oxygenate. Escharotomy allows the underlying tissues to have an increased available volume to allow expansion and prevent further tissue damage.' "
When is escharotomy avoided?,'There are generally no contraindications associated with escharotomy except for this one condition' Gangrene in the leg that is close to the full-thickness eschar
How is escharotomy performed?,"'You are made to lie flat on the table. The physician then cleans the surgical site with the povidone-''iodine'' solution. For escharotomy, the physician may either use a scalpel or electrocautery to make incisions through the entire thickness of the eschar until the subcutaneous fat is seen. There would be an immediate release of tissue pressure heard as a popping sensation. The doctor extends the incisions to the entire length of the eschar. Electrocautery prevents bleeding from the site. The effectiveness of escharotomy can be tested after its completion by checking the pressure in the blood vessels using a handheld Doppler and compartment pressure. Compartment pressure is a dangerous condition in which the pressure builds up in the tissue resulting in bleeding or swelling. Improvement in fluid flow and decrease in the compartmental pressure indicate that the procedure is effective. Persistent low Doppler signals or increased compartmental pressure indicates an insufficient release of tissue pressure, which may require further extension of escharotomy incision.' "
What are the complications of escharotomy?,'Complications of escharotomy include''The complications of escharotomy not performed on time include' Excessive blood loss Injury to the underlying healthy tissues Bacteremia (infection of the tissues) Infection of the open escharotomy wounds Muscle necrosis (cell death of the muscles around the eschar) Injury to the nerve Gangrene that may lead to amputation of the legs or toes Inadequate ventilation leading to compromised lung function Abdominal compartment syndrome (abdominal pressure is 5 to 7 mm Hg) Kidney failure Hyperkalemia (high blood potassium concentration) Metabolic acidosis (increase in plasma acidity)
What is an exploratory laparotomy?,"'An exploratory laparotomy is an open surgical procedure for visual examination of the abdominal organs, tissue and blood vessels. An exploratory laparotomy is often an emergency procedure for patients with acute ''abdominal pain'' from disease or injury to the abdomen.''With the availability of sophisticated imaging technologies and ''laparoscopy'', the need for an exploratory laparotomy has diminished. Nonetheless, it is a valuable procedure for acute abdominal conditions.' "
Why is an exploratory laparotomy done?,"'The primary purpose of an exploratory laparotomy is to identify the cause of acute ''abdominal pain'' and treat it. An exploratory laparotomy is generally performed only in an emergency or after other less invasive methods have not been successful in diagnosis.\xa0''An exploratory laparotomy may often be converted into a therapeutic procedure.

How is an exploratory laparotomy done?,"'A general or specialized surgeon usually performs an exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia in the hospital operation theatre.''Before the surgery, the patient:' Undergoes a physical examination, and blood, urine and imaging tests. Ideally, must not eat or drink anything for 8 hours prior to the surgery. Must inform the doctor of any allergies. Must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Must empty their bladder and bowel. The anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the vital functions during the surgery. The surgeon usually inserts a tube through the nose into the stomach to decompress the stomach. The surgeon also inserts a urinary catheter to decompress the bladder. The surgeon makes a vertical midline incision in the upper, middle or lower stomach wall depending on the expected source of the pain. The surgeon carefully opens up the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum). If there is blood, bodily fluids, or gastric contents present in the abdominal cavity, the surgeon will suction them out. The surgeon systematically inspects every organ in the abdominal area for damage or disease. Depending on the findings, the surgeon performs all possible remedial treatments required. The surgeon may remove tissue samples for biopsy. The surgeon closes the incision with sutures. The anesthetist will slowly wean the patient off anesthesia. The patient will be under observation for several hours in the recovery room. Pain medication will be administered for postoperative pain."
How long does it take to recover from exploratory laparotomy?,"'An exploratory laparotomy may involve five to 10 days of hospitalization, but this varies widely with individuals. The recovery period depends on the severity of the underlying condition and the complexity of the surgery. Some may need additional treatments or surgeries, which could extend their hospital stay.' "
What are the risks and complications of an exploratory laparotomy?,"'An exploratory laparotomy is a major surgical procedure potentially involving several vital organs. The risks are higher for ''malignant'' diseases and serious ''trauma''. Risks and complications include:''Anesthetic side effects such as''Surgical risks such as''Wound infections are the most common complication after an exploratory laparotomy, especially if there is gastric content leakage. Death rate is high in laparotomy performed in cases of trauma because of hemorrhage.'

Why is aspartame bad?,"'According to research, adverse effects of ''aspartame'' only occur at very high concentrations not generally achieved by daily consumption. Consuming large amounts of aspartame is bad because it may cause the following' Headaches and migraines: Glutamate is a byproduct of aspartame that may trigger headaches or worsen migraine symptoms. Increased body mass index (BMI) or weight gain: Many recent studies have reported that consuming artificial sweeteners disrupts the metabolic response within the body. One of the reasons for this is because artificial sweeteners provide a sweet taste. In some cases, it is hundreds of times sweeter than regular sugar and this sweetness does not match the energy or calories that foods provide. When sweetness is matched by calories, the body is satisfied. When the sweet flavor is not followed by the right amount of calories, the brain does not get the same message. This can cause the brain to signal that it needs more, which interferes with metabolism. Diabetes: One of the side effects of aspartame is that it can actually cause a person to develop diabetes. Because it can affect a person’s metabolism, it can also affect the way that the body gets rid of sugars. This can damage the pancreas, which then causes issues with the production of insulin. Because aspartame interferes with metabolism, it can trigger metabolic syndrome. Phenylketonuria: Individuals with a metabolic disease called phenylketonuria cannot process aspartame, so levels build up in them and may cause complications. Cancer: There are claims stating that aspartame has carcinogenic potential. There are direct links that consuming aspartame can increase the likelihood of a person developing certain types of cancer. However, the evidence to prove it conclusively is missing. Heart disease: Consuming foods and beverages that contain aspartame can increase your risk of heart disease. If an individual is overweight, pre-diabetic, diabetic or at risk of heart-related diseases genetically, it is a good idea to stay away from foods and drinks that contain aspartame because these can dramatically increase the risk of heart-related diseases and other health issues. Memory loss (Alzheimer’s disease and dementia): Drinking diet soda and consuming diet foods that contain aspartame can increase the risk of dementia by up to three times. Drinking aspartame-laden drinks seems to be the worst culprit because the body breaks them down into methanol, which is converted into formaldehyde. This is quite dangerous for the entire body, but especially for the brain. When the brain cannot distinguish between the sweetness of these drinks and sugar and expects calories to follow, it can cause many different types of issues. Some people may be sensitive to aspartame and experience symptoms like  hives, rashes and trouble in breathing. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Swelling caused by lupus can affect many different body systems including the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Mood irritability Depression Dizziness Seizures Erectile dysfunction (ED), impotency Anxiety Multiple sclerosis, generalized body pain Diarrhea Abdominal bloating"
What is aspartame used for?,"'The purpose of aspartame in food is to reduce the amount of sugar and calories. We may find it in many common foods including\xa0''However, it cannot be used in cooking or baking because aspartame is not stable and will hydrolyze (break down) into amino acids when heated to temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The function of aspartame is to act as a sugar substitute. It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar. Moreover, the calories in aspartame are negligible because it is so sweet that just 1 gram of the sweetener contains approximately just 17 calories.\xa0' Carbonated soft drinks Powdered drinks Instant coffee and tea beverages Fruit juice Tabletop sweeteners Dairy products Frozen desserts, puddings Yogurts Chewing gum Breath mints Candy Cereals "
What is the acceptable aspartame limit?,'The\xa0acceptable\xa0daily intake of\xa0aspartame\xa0is 50\xa0mg per 2.2 pounds of body weight per day. This new study suggests that this number may be too high and should be more in the area of 20\xa0mg per 2.2 pounds of body weight.\xa0Acceptable\xa0daily intake is 50 mg for every 2.2 pounds of body weight. The European ''Food Safety'' Authority (EFSA) ruled\xa0that aspartame is safe\xa0for human consumption and set an acceptable\xa0daily\xa0intake (ADI) of\xa040 mg\xa0of aspartame per\xa02.2 pounds of body weight. The EFSA’s ADI for\xa0aspartame\xa0is 10 mg lower than the amount the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers\xa0safe.' 
What is decortication?,"'Decortication'' is a surgical procedure that removes the restrictive layer of fibrous tissue overlying an organ. It is mostly performed to remove the fibrous layer over the lung, chest wall, and ''diaphragm''.\xa0''Pleura'' is\xa0a thin membrane that lines the outer surface of the ''lungs'' (visceral pleura) and the inner surface of the chest wall (parietal pleura). The space between these is called the pleural space. The pleural space is less than 1 mm thick and is filled with fluid.\xa0''When this space is affected by pathologic disorders, it can lead to medical consequences. One of the complications is fibrothorax, which is an abnormal accumulation of fibrous tissues (''scar tissue'') over visceral pleura.\xa0''Deposits of fibrous tissues over the lung can be so intense that the layers of the pleural space fuse, preventing the lung from expanding adequately. Over time, the lung becomes entrapped and ''breathing'' becomes difficult.''Decortication surgery'' aims to remove this fibrous layer and allow the lung to expand, decrease breathing problems and other lung symptoms. When the peel is removed, the elasticity of the chest wall returns, and the lung can expand and deflate.' "
Why is decortication performed?,"'The primary indication for decortication is fibrothorax leading to symptoms of lung restriction. Patients with fibrothorax present with difficulty in breathing which aggravates with the following:''The conditions that cause fibrothorax are:\xa0' activity, decreased chest wall movement, reduced breath sounds, chest discomfort, chest pain, especially during deep breaths, and coughing.  Pneumonia (lung infection) Empyema (pleural space infection) Iatrogenic infection and scarring after pleural tap (infection following the diagnostic/therapeutic removal of fluid or air from the pleural space) Sepsis (infection in the blood) Hemothorax (blood accumulation in pleural space) Long-term exposure to chemicals (e.g. asbestos) "
How is decortication performed?,"'Decortication is performed under general anesthesia. There are two types of decortication based on the technique. Depending upon the extent of disease, the surgeon decides which technique to choose at a given time.' This is an open surgical procedure. The surgeon makes an incision (surgical cut) of around four inches over the chest. This technique allows the surgeon to directly view and analyze the surgical area and extent of the disease.  The thick peel covering the lungs is exposed and removed. Remnant blood and debris present in the pleural cavity are removed to prevent infection and future scarring.  The expansion of the lungs is checked on the table and the skin and underlying tissues are sutured (stitched).  Small incisions are made on the skin above the chest cavity to insert a thoracoscope (camera with a light source) and surgical instruments.  The peel is carefully removed piece by piece to avoid air leaks. Any remnant blood and debris are cleared.  The underlying tissues and skin are sutured. After the surgical procedure, patients may experience pain, swelling, and bruising.  The doctor may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics.  The average stay in the hospital after VATS is two to three days and three to five days after surgery. Patients are mobile within 24 hours after surgery.  Chest physiotherapy may be advised after surgery."
What are the complications of decortication?,"'The success rate of decortication surgery is high, with low morbidity and mortality rates. Like any major surgery, decortication may be associated with certain risks and complications, which are usually manageable.\xa0''Some common complications are:' Infection Air leak from the lung Bleeding Broncho-pleural fistula (an abnormal connection between the pleural space and the lung) Respiratory failure  Cardiac complications Damage to surrounding structures"
What is a forceps delivery?,"'Forceps delivery is a type of assisted delivery in which tong-shaped instruments are used to ease the baby out of the birth canal. These instruments are used to cradle the baby’s head in the vagina and turn the baby into a better position if needed so that they can be guided out. However, the use of forceps has decreased in recent years. Below are a few common benefits and risks of forceps delivery:''Benefits:''Risks:\xa0''Forceps delivery has its risks for both the mother and the baby.\xa0The mother’s risks include:''Post the delivery the mother may experience:''The baby’s risks include:' Delivery may be achieved faster The rate of successful vaginal delivery is higher compared to vacuum extraction The incidence of fetal scalp injuries is lower They can be used to rotate the fetal head into the right position and facilitate normal delivery They do not detach from the fetal head during traction if correctly applied Vaginal tears during the delivery Bladder injuries Urethra injuries Fecal and/or urinary incontinence Perineum (the area between anus and vagina) pain Difficulty while urinating A weakening of the muscles supporting the pelvic organs Bruising on the baby’s face due to the usage of forceps Nerve damage to the face caused by the pressure of the forceps Facial injuries Skull fracture Internal bleeding within the skull Temporary eye trauma for the baby due to the pressure of the forceps Seizures or shaking of the body"
How is forceps delivery performed?,"'Forceps delivery is done during the\xa0second stage\xa0of\xa0normal vaginal delivery. During this procedure, the patient may be on anesthesia to numb the ''pain''.'""The doctor gently inserts two or more fingers inside the vagina and beside the baby's head.""'If after using the forceps, the doctor is not able to move the baby\xa0after three pulls or the baby is not delivered within 20 minutes, the doctor will most likely suggest an emergency\xa0cesarean delivery. Alternatively, the doctor may also opt for vacuum extraction.' The doctor then gently slides one part of the tong between the fingers and the baby's head, followed by the positioning of the other half of the tong on the other side of the baby's head. Both parts of the tong are then locked together to safely secure the baby’s head in between them. If the baby is facing upwards, in between the mother’s contractions, the doctor uses the forceps to gently shift the position of the baby’s head. As the labor progresses, the doctor may remove the forceps before the widest part of the baby’s head goes through the birth canal or they may retain the hold of the forceps. When the mother experiences the next contraction, the doctor gently guides the baby through the birth canal using the forceps."
What should a patient do after a forceps delivery procedure?,"'While using the forceps to assist in the delivery of the baby, if the doctor had made a cut on the side of the vagina during the delivery (''episiotomy''), or you had a vaginal tear, there are a few things you can do to accelerate your healing:' Apply ice packs in the area of the wound right after birth; even when at home, continue using ice packs in the area. Use sitz baths a few times a day, which may provide relief from the pain. During urination, keep pouring warm water over the area; this may take away the sting of the urine. Do not put pressure in that area while passing a stool. After urinating or after a bowel movement spray some warm water in the area and pat dry using very soft towels or baby wipes. Do not use toilet paper or rub the area hard. While sitting down, use a doughnut cushion or a pillow."

What is Hartmann’s procedure?,"'Hartmann’s procedure is a surgical procedure in which an unhealthy part of your colon is cut from the rest of the colon, and the open end of the colon is connected to a bag outside the body through an opening in the skin (''colostomy''). It is done when some part of your colon becomes unhealthy due to some infectious or inflammatory process or due to ''cancer''.\xa0''Hartmann’s procedure helps prevent the infection or ''tumor'' from spreading to the healthy parts of the colon. It can be performed in either of the two ways:' Open Hartmann’s procedure:  Open surgery or laparotomy in which a large incision is made in the abdomen. Laparoscopic Hartmann‘s procedure: The operation is done through small incisions using specialized equipment."
Why is Hartmann's procedure necessary?,"'Hartmann’s procedure is necessary to preserve the healthy part of the colon in conditions that most commonly include:''Less commonly, the procedure may be done for:\xa0' Diverticulitis:  Infection of the pouch formed in the intestine Colon cancer Volvulus. Twisting of the intestine that results in loops Injury to the colonDuring colonoscopy (insertion of a tube-like camera in your colon)By a foreign bodyTrauma (blow to the abdomen near the intestine) During colonoscopy (insertion of a tube-like camera in your colon) By a foreign body Trauma (blow to the abdomen near the intestine) Crohn’s disease Trauma Rectal prolapse Ulcerative colitis Radiation injuries"
What is done before Hartmann’s procedure?, Enema is given the night before the surgery to clear your bowels. You need to fast 6 to 12 hours before the surgery as advised by your surgeon. A tube known as Foley’s catheter will be inserted in your bladder through your urethra to measure the urine output after the surgery. Fluids will be given through a needle inserted in your vein (intravenous).
How is open Hartmann’s procedure performed?," You are given medicine (general anesthesia) that makes you sleep throughout the procedure. You will be put on a ventilator with or without inserting a tube in your throat to allow you to breathe. Your surgeon will open your abdomen by making a large incision through your bellybutton. Your colon is retrieved and inspected to locate its unhealthy part.  The unhealthy part of the colon is then removed, and the rectal end of the colon is sealed off.  The end of the colon that is connected to the stomach is brought out of another incision made into the abdomen. This end of the colon is then tied to a colostomy bag where it can expel gas and stools. The colostomy bag can be changed as needed. The colon is sutured or stapled followed by suturing/stapling of the surgical wounds. The operation usually takes between two and four hours."
What happens after open Hartmann’s procedure?," You will be shifted to the surgical ward and monitored for several hours after the surgery. If you are an elderly person, you may experience diarrhea right after the procedure. Intravenous fluids will be continued as per your condition. You will be put on intravenous painkillers and antibiotics for three to seven days. You will be taught how to remove, clean, and put back the colostomy bag. You can resume drinking and eat right from the next day of the surgery or as advised by your surgeon."
What are the complications of open Hartmann’s procedure?, Wound infection (most common) Leaking of the colon Hernia (bulging of an organ through an abnormal opening in the abdomen) Paralytic ileus (paralysis of intestinal muscles) Wound dehiscence (reopening of the surgical wounds) Internal bleeding Damage to surrounding structures/organs Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg) Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)
How long does it take to recover from open Hartmann's procedure?, You will be encouraged to ambulate within one to two days after the surgery. You will be discharged five to ten days after the surgery with the necessary dietary instructions. You might feel constipated for which you will be prescribed mild laxatives. Avoid lifting heavy objects for at least six weeks after the surgery. It might take three months to one year after the surgery to return to your normal level of function. Resuming exercises-like walking-early after the surgery and doing them regularly might help you recover faster
Can a Hartmann's procedure be reversed?,"'Depending upon your condition, you may need to use the colostomy bag for a short term or permanently.''Your surgeon can reverse the Hartmann’s procedure by removing the seal of the rectum and freeing the end of colon connected to the colostomy. He will then join the two ends of the colon so that you can continue to pass stools normally as before. The opening of the colostomy will be sutured.''The Hartmann’s procedure reversal is recommended to be performed at least six months after the previous Hartmann’s procedure.' "
Why is MSG bad for your health?,"'Although many findings state the benefits of monosodium glutamate (MSG), many studies have linked MSG with various forms of toxicity. The detrimental effects of MSG, as alleged by the scientists, include:' Weight gain: Some studies have linked MSG consumption to weight gain obesity. There are no sufficient data and research to claim that MSG consumption is associated with obesity. Asthma: Some studies have proved episodes of asthma in people who take a high amount of MSG, whereas some findings couldn’t establish the connection between MSG and asthma. Neurotoxicity: Scientists have earlier claimed that MSG consumption results in the release of excessive glutamate in the brain, causing neurotoxicity (excessive stimulation of the brain), and it is linked to strokes. These claims have been refuted by other scientists stating that MSG when consumed in a lower amount does not cause any neurotoxicity. Chinese restaurant syndrome: In some people, MSG above 3 g may induce a group of symptoms, which include:HeadacheDrowsinessSweatingFacial pressure or tightnessNumbness, tingling, or burning in the face, neck, and other areasRapid, fluttering heartbeatChest painNauseaWeaknessThese symptoms are usually mild and resolve on their own.

What is MSG?,"'Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is the sodium form of amino acid, glutamic acid, and a type of glutamate. MSG acts as a flavor enhancer when added to the food. It doesn’t have color or texture of its own and enhances the natural flavor of the food rather than exerting any taste of its own. Glutamate exerts the fifth essential taste, that is, Umami. Umami taste receptors have a particular affinity for free glutamate.''Replacing table salt with some MSG will reduce the sodium content because MSG has two-thirds less sodium than table salt.' "
What are the benefits of MSG?,"'MSG controversy has caused people to stop using MSG in their food. However, when used in minimal amounts, MSG can have the following benefits:' Lower salt consumption of the individual by replacing MSG with salt Combat salt-related maladies like blood pressure and water retention"
Which infectious diseases cause head itch?,"'Some of the most common causes leading to head itching are:' Dandruff: Dandruff mainly occurs as a result of the body’s response to yeast overgrowth, resulting in itching and a dry, flaky scalp.

Should I go to the doctor if my poop appears black?,"'The dark or tarry appearance of poop may also imply a benign or severe underlying medical condition. These underlying medical conditions could be peptic ulcers, ''cancer'', and bowel ischemia. Peptic ulcers are one of the most common causes of black, ''tarry stools''. A small amount of ''blood in the stool'' may be seen in children. It is usually not a serious sign and may occur due to ''constipation'' or worm infestation.''Even if you believe that you have zeroed down to the cause of ''black stools'', you may consult your doctor to be sure of the diagnosis.''Urgent medical attention is needed if you:' See blood or change in the colors of your poop See blood in your vomit Feel lightheaded or dizzy Get fever or severe pain in the abdomen Have unintended weight loss Notice that your skin or eyes appear yellowish"

How is salpingo-oophorectomy performed?,"'The doctor may perform salpingo-oophorectomy under general or regional anesthesia. Below are common surgical approaches:''The doctor may advise which procedure is the best based on a patient’s diagnosis, age, medical history, general health, and possibly personal preference.' Open abdominal oophorectomy: It involves removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes through a five- to seven-inch cut in the lower part of the belly. The cut may be vertical or horizontal. Open surgery allows the doctor to directly see and access the surgical area; however, it involves a longer recovery period and more pain. Open surgery requires a larger cut and more displacement of the muscles and other tissues. Despite this, open surgery may be a safer or more effective method for certain patients. Laparoscopic oophorectomy: It involves the removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes through several small incisions in the abdomen. Usually, the doctor inserts a small tube fitted with a special camera and other surgical instruments through the small incisions to remove the ovaries. The camera transmits pictures of the inside of your body to a video screen. The doctor sees the inside of your abdomen on the screen while performing the surgery. Minimally invasive surgery generally involves a faster recovery and less pain than open surgery. A vaginal approach can also be performed, especially when combined with removing the uterus. Robotic approach: Robotic salpingo-oophorectomy is a similar procedure to laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy. During robotic salpingo-oophorectomy, a robotic arm, operated by an experienced gynecological surgeon, will be used to locate and remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes."
What are the risks involved in a salpingo-oophorectomy procedure?,"'Common risks involved in salpingo-oophorectomy include:''Oophorectomy results in early\xa0''menopause''. ''Menopause symptoms'' and complications include:' Anesthesia reaction, such as an allergic reaction, dizziness, headache, or vomiting Excessive bleeding A blood clot, in particular, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that develops in the leg or pelvis (a DVT can travel to your lungs and cause pulmonary embolism) Infection, which can spread to other areas Damage to the nearby abdominal organs, such as the uterus or intestines Development of intestinal blockage Anxiety and mood swings, which can interfere with your daily life and become debilitating Higher risk of heart disease Hot flashes and night sweats, which are often described as a sudden sensation of warmth, flushing, and sweating Osteoporosis or thinning bones Sleep problems including insomnia or sleeplessness Vaginal dryness, which causes burning, irritation, and painful sexual intercourse"
What is the recovery period after a salpingo-oophorectomy procedure?,"'The recovery period after salpingo-oophorectomy depends on the type of procedure.''Laparoscopic or robotic salpingo-oophorectomy may be performed on an outpatient basis, and patients may go home on the same night. Some patients with laparoscopic or robotic salpingo-oophorectomy will need an overnight hospital stay. It can take approximately three weeks to return to the normal activity level after laparoscopic or robotic salpingo-oophorectomy.''In open salpingo-oophorectomy, patients may need to recover in the hospital for a few days after the surgery. It can take up to eight weeks to return to the normal activity level after open salpingo-oophorectomy.' "
What is wrist arthrocentesis?,'Wrist ''arthrocentesis'' is a procedure to remove or aspirate fluid from the wrist joint through a needle for diagnostic and treatment purposes.' 
Why is wrist arthrocentesis performed?,"'Wrist arthrocentesis is performed in patients in the below conditions:' To reduce pain and swelling from the joint To inject medications at that joint To diagnose conditions related to pain, swelling and infection (septic arthritis, gout, arthritis, etc.)  To remove the synovial fluid for diagnostic and treatment purposes"
When is wrist arthrocentesis not performed?,'Wrist arthrocentesis is not performed when a patient has''It is also avoided in patients who are on ''anticoagulant'' medications (''Warfarin'').' Cellulitis (infection on the skin). Dermatitis or psoriasis (lesions on the skin). A history of bacteremia (severe bacterial infection). Bleeding disorders. Unstable joint or fracture.
How is wrist arthrocentesis performed?,"'Wrist arthrocentesis is usually done under local anesthesia, and the procedure is completed in less than 45 minutes.' The area of the wrist is cleaned with betadine. Lidocaine is injected first on the skin and then into the deeper tissues. Once anesthesia is given, patient vitals are monitored. The patient is usually kept in a normal sleeping position with their palms open and flexed. Usually, the needle is inserted through the upper side of the wrist just away from the radial bone. The needle is usually inserted perpendicular to the skin.  If the needle is touching the bone, the needle is pulled back, and it may be redirected slightly toward the thumb. Sometimes, the surgeon may also use the ulnar bone side approach. Keeping the wrist in the same relaxed position, the joint space can be identified by palpating just away from the ulnar joint.  A 22-gauge needle is usually used for the procedure. The surgeon may also use bedside ultrasonography for joint aspiration to localize the optimal site for needle placement. A pop or give way is felt as the needle enters the joint. Sufficient fluid and any infection are aspirated through the needle. If the fluid cannot be withdrawn, rotating the needle, withdrawing it slightly or even reinjecting a little of the fluid often unclog the needle and allow additional fluid to be withdrawn.  After the procedure is done and the sample is taken, the needle is withdrawn.  In therapeutic cases where injections are to be given, the only syringe is removed, keeping the needle secure in the place, and the desired medication is injected. At the end of the injection procedure, the needle should be swiftly withdrawn, and light pressure should be applied on the needle site on the skin."
What are the risks involved in wrist arthrocentesis?,"'The risks involved in wrist arthrocentesis include the following:' Wrist pain Swelling near the injected site Septic arthritis (infection) Nerve, bone or tendon injuries due to misplaced needles"
Why would you not remove a foreign object from an open cut?,"'In open ''cuts'', the foreign body may not be removed immediately if it could harm the blood vessels or nerves. Sometimes, a foreign body is stuck in the ''wound'', which also stops the blood from spurting out. Such a deeply embedded foreign body must only be treated by a physician. The decision to remove or leave a foreign object inside the body depends on many factors such as''If an object, such as a knife, a piece of glass or metal, is embedded in a wound, do not remove it.''Most tiny foreign bodies in the skin surface can be removed at home. These include splinters, cactus spines, fiberglass and pieces of glass.' Type of object (metal/glass/other) Size of the object (big or small) Location (deep or just under the skin or is it in the foot or hand where the use of the foot or hand will cause discomfort) Place several dressings around it to keep it from moving. Bandage the dressings in place around the object. If something needs to be removed by a doctor, see one right away. Waiting may cause the object to become hidden or pushed in deeper. The doctor can numb the skin before the object is removed. Organic slivers (wood or thorns) most often become infected if they are not removed. Nonorganic slivers (metal or glass) often do not become infected."
How to remove foreign objects from the skin?,"'Most of the time, you can remove small objects and debris from your skin using a pair of tweezers. When foreign objects enter the body because of a puncture wound, it’s important to use care. Removing large or deeply embedded objects can result in uncontrolled blood loss. Generally, it’s best to seek medical attention to remove any foreign body that’s large enough to create a substantial wound. Before you attempt any foreign body removal from the skin, make sure to''A patient may require a visit with the doctor if' Wash your hands using soap and water. Use tweezers and sterilize them with rubbing alcohol before use. Remove the object and sterilize the wound using rubbing alcohol. Allow the wound to dry and then apply antibiotic ointment. Cover the wound with a bandage or gauze pad. The object does not come out easily. The puncture wound is on the face, deep or touching bone. The wound is very dirty. The object entered through the bottom of a shoe (stepping on a nail, for instance). You have not had tetanus shots recently."
What are the common measures to treat the wound?,"'The common measures include' Rest the affected part as much as possible. Elevate the area above the level of your heart for the first two days. Elevation minimizes swelling and pain. Over-the-counter pain medications can help relieve discomfort associated with your wound. Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen, or naproxen can be taken, depending on individual preference. Clean the wound daily with soap and water. After cleaning, re-dress the wound. Apply over-the-counter antibacterial ointment and cover the wound with gauze. When changing the dressing, inspect the wound for signs of infection, such as pus on the wound, increasing redness/swelling/warmth around the wound or red streaks spreading from the wound. If you suspect infection is present, return to the doctor promptly. If you have continuing problems with the wounded area, schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Seek care if you have continuing discomfort when moving or using the wounded site or if you would like another opinion on the risks/benefits of removal."
What is a ventricular repair (cardiorrhaphy) procedure?,"'Ventricular repair ''is also called ''cardiorrhaphy.'' It is a lifesaving procedure performed for cardiac (''heart'') ''trauma'' in the emergency room (ER). ''Emergency thoracotomy or'' ''surgical resuscitation'' may be done first prior to ventricular repair.\xa0''Emergency thoracotomy is a procedure that allows immediate direct access to the chest to control bleeding and cardiac tamponade and treat injuries of the heart, ''lungs'', or blood vessels in the chest. Emergency thoracotomy helps to assess the extent of injury and determine if cardiorrhaphy is required.\xa0''Cardiac trauma is divided into the following two mechanisms:''The ventricles in the heart are involved in ''80% of penetrating cardiac injuries.' Blunt injury: The heart may rupture following a blunt force trauma to the chest. This type of a trauma leads to instant death before the patient can present to the ER. Penetrating injury: The heart can get injured due to a trauma from penetrating sharp objects. Although lethal, the patient can be saved with timely treatment. One of the most common causes of death from penetrating trauma wounds is cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a condition in which fluid fills up within the pericardium (the sac around the heart), leading to compression of the heart. Exsanguination is a severe loss of blood that can lead to death."
Why are ventricular repair (cardiorrhaphy) procedures performed?,'A penetrating trauma to the chest in an unstable patient is an indication for emergency thoracotomy and possible cardiorrhaphy.''The indications for emergency thoracotomy with or without cardiorrhaphy include the following:' Cardiac arrest (heart attack) in patients with penetrating chest injuries Persistent hypotension (decreased blood pressure) or signs of cardiac tamponade Cardiac arrest in the emergency room (ER) following a blunt trauma
When are ventricular repair (cardiorrhaphy) procedures not done?,'Contraindications for ventricular repair include the following:' Clinically stable patients Blunt trauma with no vital signs Unsalvageable patients (decapacitated patients) Patient is deceased by the time they reach the hospital
How is a ventricular repair (cardiorrhaphy) procedure performed? ,"'The surgery involves the patient being put under anesthesia. There are two different types of procedures in which a ventricular repair is performed.' Thoracotomy procedure: A deep incision is made usually between the fourth or fifth intercostal space (the space between two ribs), which is below the nipple just to the left of the breastbone. Cardiorrhaphy procedure: The chest cavity is exposed. The major blood vessels and nerves supplying blood to the heart are identified and isolated. The wound in the heart is identified. Depending on the size, a finger or a catheter may be used to plug the wound until the surgeon prepares the suture material. The wound may be sutured or stapled in layers."
What are the complications of ventricular repair (cardiorrhaphy) procedures?,"'Potential complications of ventricular repair include the following:' Injury to underlying structures in the chest such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels, nerves and esophagus (food pipe) Uncontrolled bleeding  Postpericardiotomy syndrome (characterized by fever, chest pain, pericardial effusion, and electrocardiogram [ECG] changes) Arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythm) Postoperative infection Increased risk to physicians, nurses, and other staff of exposure to infectious blood and tissue such as HIV, Hepatitis B, etc., because it is an emergency procedure."
What is pediatric tracheostomy?,"'Pediatric ''tracheostomy'' is a surgical procedure performed in children to create a small opening (''stoma'') in the ''airway'' (trachea) below the vocal cords. The stoma is used to insert a tube into the trachea which allows air to flow into the ''lungs'' if the upper airway is blocked, or to provide assisted ventilation to children who are unable to breathe, or have difficulty ''breathing'' on their own.' "
Why would a child need a tracheostomy?,"'A child may require a tracheostomy if they are unable to breathe spontaneously. Currently, the most common reason for pediatric tracheostomy is a prolonged requirement for assisted ventilation because of respiratory or neuromuscular disorders.''Tracheostomy was originally developed as a treatment for children whose upper airway was blocked due to infectious diseases such as ''diphtheria'' and poliomyelitis. Vaccination has now successfully eradicated these diseases in most of the world.\xa0''Pediatric tracheostomy is now mainly performed in the following situations:''Some of the conditions affecting the upper airway (mouth, nose, throat and larynx) which require a pediatric tracheostomy include the following:' Anticipated long-term insufficiency in lung and/or heart function Presence of upper airway obstruction that is unlikely to resolve for a significant period of time Subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the glottis, an opening in the folds of the vocal cords) Bilateral vocal cord paralysis Congenital airway malformations Respiratory papillomatosis (benign or malignant airway tumors) Ingestion of any corrosive substance Craniofacial syndromes (congenital malformation of the skull or face)"
What are the difficulties in pediatric tracheostomy?,"'A pediatric tracheostomy is more difficult than an adult tracheostomy because a child’s tissues are delicate and underdeveloped. Certain anatomical characteristics of a child’s neck may complicate a pediatric tracheostomy, include the following:' The dome of the lung’s membrane (pleura) extends into the neck increasing the risk of lung injury. The trachea is very pliable and difficult to identify by palpating the throat. The trachea may be deep in the throat and great care is required to distinguish it from the carotid blood vessels. The neck is very short, which allows much smaller working space. The cricoid cartilage around the larynx can be injured if it is not properly identified."
How is a pediatric tracheostomy performed?,"'A pediatric surgeon performs the pediatric tracheostomy with the patient under general anesthesia. The procedure may take up to 45 minutes.''The surgeon will likely complete the following steps:''The child undergoes imaging tests to evaluate the tube’s position and the lung condition, in case of possible collapse (''pneumothorax''). The child will be in intensive care for approximately a week, till the stoma heals and the first tube can be changed.''The tracheostomy tube is removed (decannulation), as soon as the child is able to breathe spontaneously through the upper airway and is no longer dependent on assisted ventilation. If decannulation is difficult, a ''bronchoscopy'' or microlaryngoscopy may be performed to check for obstruction in the airway and mobility of the larynx.''The tube is first plugged to check if the child is able to breathe without support. Once the tube is removed, the opening is taped shut and the ''wound'' normally heals and closes within a week, but may sometimes require a surgical closure.' The surgeon selects a tracheostomy tube with appropriate diameter and length, based on the age and weight of the child. The child has to stop eating and drinking a few hours prior (in elective procedures). The pediatric anesthesiologist administers general anesthesia and places an endotracheal tube through the mouth, unless the child is already intubated for assisted ventilation. If the child has a nasogastric feeding tube, it is removed. The child lies on their back with a roll under the shoulders to extend the neck. Injects a local anesthesia in the throat area. Makes a horizontal incision in the skin halfway between the cricoid cartilage and the top of the sternum (sternal notch). Retracts the skin and cuts through the fat and muscle layers and cauterizes them to prevent bleeding and infection. Cuts or retracts the thyroid isthmus, the central part of the thyroid, which connects the right and left lobes of the thyroid gland, and exposes the trachea. Places nonabsorbable stay sutures on both sides of the trachea’s midline, which will be left in place after the surgery. Elevates the trachea to the skin surface. Makes a vertical incision in the midline of the trachea. Sutures the skin flaps to the trachea. Inserts the tracheostomy tube while simultaneously withdrawing the endotracheal tube. Connects the ventilator to the tracheostomy tube and makes sure the tube is clear and functioning properly. Tapes the stay sutures on the chest and applies gauze dressing on the tracheostomy."
How long does a child need tracheostomy?,"'Most tracheostomies are temporary, until the underlying condition is treated. Premature ''babies'' may require a tracheostomy tube in place for a few weeks depending on their gestational age.''Tracheostomy may be permanent for some children if there is permanent damage or loss of function in the upper airway or larynx. The tube size will be appropriately changed as the child grows.' "
How do you take care of a child with a tracheostomy?,'Children who require tracheostomy for prolonged periods can be cared for at home. The family or ''caregiver'' is required to first undergo a structured training program in the hospital before starting home care for the child. Following are some of the essential components of home care for a child with a tracheostomy:' Cleaning and changing the tube Keeping the tube clear by suctioning secretions Humidification of the inhaled air Application of medications Keeping the stoma and tube clean and sterile to prevent infections Dressing and protecting the stoma
What are the complications of a tracheostomy?,"'Complications of a tracheostomy include the following:' Pneumomediastinum (air leak into the chest space [mediastinum] between the lungs) Pneumothorax Subcutaneous emphysema (passage and trapping of air under the skin tissue) Acute hemorrhage Accidental tube dislodgement Tube obstruction Infection at the stoma leading to excessive growth of new tissue (granulation), which makes it difficult to remove or change the tube Difficulty in decannulation because of granulation in the stoma Obstruction of trachea from tracheal granulation Accidental decannulation as the child develops more mobility Subglottic stenosis Tracheal stenosis Suprastomal collapse (collapse of the part of trachea above the stoma) Tracheocutaneous fistula (formation of an abnormal channel between the trachea and subcutaneous tissue) Problems with speech and language development"
What is assisted ventilation of the newborn?,'Assisted ventilation of the ''newborn'' is a procedure to assist and stabilize a newborn’s ''breathing'' until the baby’s respiratory system starts working normally. A mechanical ventilator provides oxygen to the ''lungs'' at the required pressure and frequency.' 
Why would a newborn need a ventilator?,"'The fetus gets its oxygen supply from the mother’s blood. The fetal lungs are nonfunctional, and the blood circulation mostly bypasses the lungs through shunts in the cardiac system, which usually close within a short period after birth. The lungs start functioning spontaneously at birth in normal ''babies'' and ''respiration'' usually stabilizes within a day or two.''Some babies, typically premature or ill babies, may not start breathing spontaneously, or have trouble breathing. Respiratory distress or failure may be the result of underdeveloped lungs or a congenital condition which compromises lung function.\xa0''The mechanical ventilator provides oxygen to the baby and stimulates the respiratory system until the baby can breathe adequately on their own. Assisted ventilation has greatly improved the survival rate of preterm babies.''Respiratory distress or failure may occur in newborns for several reasons which include the following:' Birth depression: The period immediately after birth when the baby transitions from non-breathing intrauterine life to breathing with their own lungs. Neonatal encephalopathy: Depressed brain function because of lack of oxygen during birth. Neonatal apnea: Pause in breathing for 20 seconds at a time or more. Shock of birth: Shock due to acute blood loss or defective heart functioning. Pulmonary disease: Pulmonary diseases such as respiratory distress syndrome occur due to underdevelopment of the lungs in preterm babies."
How does assisted ventilation help respiration?,"'Respiration is a combination of precise functioning of respiratory muscles and molecular exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide in the lungs, with the brain regulating the entire activity. Impairment in any part of this respiratory system can cause respiratory distress or failure in infants.''Assisted ventilation delivers oxygen at the required rate and frequency to the lungs, which gradually stimulates the lung, brain and the respiratory muscles to start functioning normally.' "
What are the factors that influence assisted ventilation?,"'Following are the important aspects of respiration which influence the choice of the right kind of assisted ventilation, depending on the respiratory distress cause.''Lungs are made of millions of tiny air sacs known as alveoli. With each ''inhalation'', the alveoli fill with air, the oxygen from which travels into the blood. An equivalent volume of carbon dioxide is released by the blood for ''exhalation''. The chemical process of ''gas'' exchange is driven by the positive and negative air pressure inside the lungs, which changes with each breath during the course of healthy breathing.''Newborn babies are vulnerable to impairment in alveolar gas exchange because of their relatively high metabolism and propensity for''Newborns also have the potential risk for persistence of certain fetal cardiac circulatory systems such as:''Impaired gas exchange leads to:''Along with assisted ventilation, ''anemic'' babies may also require administration of packed ''red cells'' to enable adequate oxygen transfer to the tissues from the blood.''A newborn baby’s lungs are fragile and can be easily injured. The mechanical properties of the baby’s respiratory system are an important consideration for selecting the safest and most effective ventilation strategy. The factors that influence ventilation include the following:''The respiratory center in the brain regulates breathing. Motor neurons in the brain send signals to alter the breathing rhythm and volume based on continuous feedback from two types of sensors:' Low functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the residual volume of air in the lungs after normal exhalation Reduced lung compliance (elasticity of the lung) Increased resistance to airflow in the airway Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, which occurs when air flow and blood flow do not synchronize in the alveoli, which is essential for proper gas exchange to take place Patent foramen ovale: A small hole in the wall (septum) between the two upper chambers (atria) of the heart which normally closes within a year after birth. Patent ductus arteriosus: A connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery that closes within two or three days after birth. It may take longer in premature babies. Hypercapnia: Elevated carbon dioxide level in the blood, lowering the pH and making the blood acidic (respiratory acidosis). Hypoxemia: Low level of oxygen in the blood leading to inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues. Pressure gradient: Presence of a pressure gradient between the airway opening and the alveoli is necessary to drive the flow of gases during inspiration and expiration. Compliance: Compliance is the elasticity of the respiratory structures such as the alveoli and chest wall, in inflating and deflating. Resistance: Resistance is the inherent opposition to airflow in the airway or the endotracheal tube, due to friction. Time constant: Time constant is the amount of time taken by an alveolus to fill during inhalation (inspiratory time constant) and empty during exhalation (expiratory time constant) at a stable pressure. Gas trapping: Gas trapping is abnormal retention of air in the lungs when inspiratory time is too long, expiratory time is too short, or the tidal volume is excessive.Tidal volume is the volume of air that flows in or out of the lungs in a respiratory cycle. Tidal volume is the volume of air that flows in or out of the lungs in a respiratory cycle. Chest wall motion: Chest wall motion is the movement of the chest wall that allows expansion and contraction of the lungs. Assessing chest wall motion with ECG leads helps in delivering appropriate ventilation. Chemoreceptors: Two types of chemoreceptors send feedback to the brain for regulation of respiration: Central chemoreceptors: Sensors located in the brainstem region which sense increase in carbon dioxide pressure and decrease in the pH level in blood. Peripheral chemoreceptors: Sensors found in certain structures on the carotid artery and aorta, known as carotid bodies and aortic bodies, sense decrease in oxygen pressure in the blood. Mechanoreceptors: Mechanoreceptors sensors present in the respiratory tract, lungs and the pulmonary vessels sense airway stretch and air pressure in the lungs and produce a multitude of reflex responses. Mechanical ventilation results in stimulation of chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, which facilitates respiration."
What is a salpingectomy?,"'Salpingectomy refers to the surgical removal of one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) fallopian tubes (uterine tubes).''After this surgery, the eggs will no longer be able to travel from the ovaries to the womb. Therefore, you may not be able to conceive naturally after a bilateral salpingectomy.' "

The surgeon will remove the tubes and ensure the bleeding is stopped. If you have undergone a laparotomy (open surgery), then you may need to stay in the hospital for a few days to recover from surgery, whereas recovery is usually quicker with keyhole surgery. You will feel pain in the belly and tiredness. You will be prescribed pain medications to be taken by mouth."
What are the possible complications of a salpingectomy?,"'Problems from the surgery are rare, but all surgeries have some risks such as:''Keyhole surgery usually involves a lower risk of complications than open surgery.'

Will a chest X-ray show lung cancer?,"'When diagnosing ''lung cancer'', chest ''X-rays'' do not provide a definitive diagnosis of lung ''cancers'' at an early stage (when they are more treatable).''Until the ''lung cancer'' shows up on a ''chest X-ray'', the ''tumor'' is often too far advanced to be cured. Often, many things seen on a chest X-ray turn out to be treatable problems or artifacts.''Pulmonary nodules are small round or oval-shaped growth in the lung. They can be either cancerous (''malignant'') or benign (non-cancerous).\xa0''Only one of every 500 chest X-rays and one out of every 100 chest ''computerized tomography'' (CT) scans will show pulmonary nodules. At least 60% of pulmonary nodules observed on chest X-rays are benign, and 99% of those on chest CT are benign.\xa0''About half the people who smoke and are over age 50 years will have nodules, many of them being noncancerous, on a ''CT scan'' of their chest.' "
What does lung cancer look like on a CT scan?,"'A CT scan shows detailed cross-sectional images of your ''lungs'' and hence, it can detect lung ''cancer'' more accurately than chest X-ray. It can show the size, shape, position, and depth of any lung tumor.\xa0''Lung ''cancer'' looks like a nodule on a CT scan, which can detect many more lung nodules than a chest X-ray.''A CT scan test can also be used to look for the spread of lung ''cancer'' in the adrenal glands, ''liver'', brain, and other organs.\xa0' "
Does lung cancer show up in routine blood work?,"'Routine blood tests are not used to diagnose lung cancer, but they can indicate if cancer has spread to other organs, such as the liver or kidneys. For example, if cancer has spread to the bones, it might be an abnormal increase in the levels of calcium and ''alkaline phosphatase''.''Routine blood tests can help to get a sense of a person’s overall health. For example, they can be used to help determine if a person can have surgery for lung cancer.''A ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') tells you if your blood has normal levels of different types of blood cells.

What is tonsillitis?,"'Tonsils'' are the two oval-shaped pads of tissue in the back of your throat. They help protect your body from infection. However, sometimes they get infected and inflamed (red and swollen) and this is called ''tonsillitis''.

How do I know if my child has tonsillitis?,"'Generally, acute tonsillitis is diagnosed with clinical examination of the mouth. However, it is difficult to distinguish between viral or bacterial infection.''You can check your child’s tonsils with a flashlight by gently placing a spoon on thier tongue. If your child is reluctant for this examination, do not insist. If you find your child’s tonsils are bright red and swollen, see a pediatrician or an ENT specialist/doctor.\xa0' The doctor will examine the tonsils and soft palate to check for a tonsillar abscess. Because viral and bacterial infections of tonsils look no different, your doctor may sometimes take a throat culture using a cotton swab in the back of your child’s throat to check for strep throat after examining your child’s tonsils. Your doctor may order a blood test to rule out glandular fever if the symptoms are severe and will not go away. Your doctor may ask for a rapid antigen test to check for bacterial tonsillitis. It has very low sensitivity. However, more accurate tests take longer - maybe a couple of days - to deliver results. If these test results are negative, the doctor may ask for a bacterial culture to check the type of bacteria which takes 24 to 48 hours."
What is Williams syndrome?,"'Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and ''heart'' and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome?,"'People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. ''Attention deficit disorder'' (''ADD''), problems with ''anxiety'', and ''phobias'' are common among people with this disorder.''Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including ''Many affected people have dental problems such as ''teeth'' that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.''A form of ''cardiovascular disease''  called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the ''aorta''). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to ''Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including ''high blood pressure''  (''hypertension''), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.'""Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin.

"
How common is Williams syndrome?,"'Williams syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 7,500 to 10,000 people.' "
What Causes Williams syndrome?,"'Williams syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from a specific region of chromosome 7. The deleted region includes 26 to 28 genes, and researchers believe that a loss of several of these genes probably contributes to the characteristic features of this disorder.''CLIP2, ELN, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1'', and ''LIMK1'' are among the genes that are typically deleted in people with Williams syndrome. Researchers have found that loss of the ''ELN'' gene is associated with the connective tissue abnormalities and ''cardiovascular disease'' (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis) found in many people with this disease. Studies suggest that deletion of CLIP2, ''GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, LIMK1'', and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, unique behavioral characteristics, and other cognitive difficulties seen in people with Williams syndrome. Loss of the ''GTF2IRD1'' gene may also contribute to the distinctive facial features often associated with this condition.''Researchers believe that the presence or absence of the ''NCF1'' gene on chromosome 7 is related to the risk of developing ''hypertension'' in people with Williams syndrome. When the ''NCF1'' gene is included in the part of the chromosome that is deleted, affected individuals are less likely to develop ''hypertension''. Therefore, the loss of this gene appears to be a protective factor. People with Williams syndrome whose ''NCF1'' gene is not deleted have a higher risk of developing ''hypertension''.''The relationship between other genes in the deleted region of chromosome 7 and the signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome is under investigation or unknown.' "
Is Williams syndrome inherited?,"'Most cases of Williams syndrome are not ''inherited'', but occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) in a parent of an affected individual. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.''Williams syndrome is considered an autosomal dominant condition because one copy of the altered chromosome 7 in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In a small percentage of cases, people with Williams syndrome inherit the chromosomal deletion from a parent with the condition.' "

Facts you should know about a capsule endoscopy,"'Modern endoscopic techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract (''esophagus'', stomach, and duodenum) and the colon. The last remaining frontier has been the small intestine.''The small intestine has been a difficult organ in which to make diagnoses and treat without performing surgery. Radiological\xa0procedures, specifically the ''upper GI series'' with small bowel follow-through, which involves following swallowed barium as it passes through the intestine with X-ray films, have been available for diagnosis, but these radiological procedures are time-consuming and are not accurate in identifying small tumors and other subtle abnormalities of the small intestine. The demand for improved capabilities in the small intestine has been less because a minority of intestinal diseases involve the small intestine beyond the reach of the upper gastrointestinal endoscope and the ''colonoscope''. Nevertheless, improved diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in the small intestine would be very useful, particularly in uncovering the causes of ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''anemia'"" due to intestinal loss of blood and diagnosing diseases that may involve only the small intestine, for example, Crohn's disease. One of the newer technologies that expands the diagnostic capabilities in the small intestine is capsule ""'endoscopy'' also known as wireless capsule endoscopy.' "
What is capsule endoscopy?,"'Capsule endoscopy is a technology that uses a swallowed video capsule to take photographs of the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. For capsule endoscopy, the ''intestines'' are first cleared of residual food and bacterial debris with the use of laxatives and/or purges very similar to the laxatives and purges used before ''colonoscopy''. A large capsule -- larger than the largest pill -- is swallowed by the patient. The capsule contains one or two video chips (cameras), a light bulb, a battery, and a radio transmitter. As the capsule travels through the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, it takes photographs rapidly. The photographs are transmitted by the radio transmitter to a small receiver that is worn\xa0on the waist of\xa0the patient who is undergoing the capsule endoscopy. At the end of the procedure, approximately 8 hours later, the photographs are downloaded from the receiver into a computer, and the images are reviewed by a physician. The capsule is passed by the patient into the toilet and flushed away. There is no need to retrieve the capsule!' "
What are the limitations of capsule endoscopy?,"'While the capsule provides the best means of viewing the inside of the small intestine, there are many inherent limitations and problems with its use, the most important of which is that\xa0the capsule\xa0does not allow for therapy. Other problems include:' Abnormalities in some areas of the intestine are missed because of rapid transit of the capsule and blurred, uninterpretable photographs. The images can also be blurred by retained stool of food debris. Hence the importance of a good bowel preparation prior to the capsule endoscopy. At times, transit is so slow that the capsule examines only part of the small intestine before the battery fails. The battery life is about eight hours. If abnormalities are discovered that require surgical resection or further investigation, it may be difficult to determine where in the small intestine the abnormality is and thereby help direct therapy. If there are narrow areas due to scarring (strictures) or tumors in the small intestine, the capsule can get stuck in the narrow area and cause an obstruction of the intestine that requires surgical removal of the capsule. (For this reason, in patients who are suspected of having a stricture, a self-dissolving, dummy capsule is swallowed first. If the dummy capsule sticks, it can be seen on an X-ray of the abdomen and the location of the stricture determined. Because it dissolves with time, however, the obstruction from the capsule will resolve without surgery, and the real capsule will not be used.) Finally, reviewing the tens of thousands of photographs is very time consuming for the conscientious physician."
What type of diseases can be diagnosed with capsule endoscopy?,"'Capsule endoscopy continues to improve technically. It has revolutionized diagnosis by providing a sensitive (able to identify subtle abnormalities) and simple (non-invasive) means of examining the inside of the small intestine. Some common examples of small intestine diseases diagnosed by capsule endoscopy include: ' Angiodysplasias (collections of small blood vessels located just beneath the inner intestinal lining that can bleed intermittently and cause anemia) Small intestinal tumors such as lymphoma, carcinoid tumor, and small intestinal cancer Crohn's disease of the small intestine "
What are wisdom teeth?,"'Wisdom tooth is another name for any one of four third molars found in the permanent dentition (adult ''teeth''). These ''teeth'' are the last or most posterior teeth in the dental arch. Although most people have ''wisdom teeth'"", it is possible for some or all of the third molars to never develop. It is also possible for a person to have more than four wisdom teeth. In many individuals, the wisdom teeth aren't visible because they have become impacted (not normally erupted through the gums) under the gingival tissue."" "
How do I know if I have wisdom teeth?,"'You know if you have wisdom teeth by examining your mouth and finding three permanent molars in each dental quadrant. However, if the tooth is impacted under the tissue, presence of the tooth needs to be verified by a radiograph. A panoramic radiograph is usually the preferred X-ray to help assess the angle of eruption and state of development of the tooth. Most wisdom teeth can be visualized erupting through the ''gingiva'' in early adulthood, between the ages of 16 to 23. Sometimes, a person will feel the effects of the wisdom teeth before they are able to visualize them in their mouth. Erupting wisdom teeth will usually produce a feeling of pressure or dull throbbing in the back of the jaws. Your general dentist will often be able to inform you of the condition of these erupting teeth.' "
Do all wisdom teeth need to be extracted?,"'Not all wisdom teeth need to be extracted. When a wisdom tooth erupts cleanly through the tissue without compromising the adjacent tooth, the wisdom tooth can be retained in the mouth with little concern as long as the person is able to brush, floss, and clean it thoroughly. The condition of the wisdom teeth changes a lot between the ages of 16 and 23; it is imperative that wisdom teeth are examined regularly by a dental professional to determine the proper diagnosis and course of action in this age group.''Sometimes the wisdom teeth cause ''pain'', but a person can avoid extracting them with a few modifications of the surrounding tissues or oral hygiene habits. If there is a small flap of swollen gum tissue barely covering the back of the tooth, a person may have ''pain'' from biting down on that gum tissue. If there is otherwise enough room for the wisdom tooth, the gum tissue can be removed from the back of the tooth to remedy this problem. Changing the angle of tooth brushing and increasing the frequency of flossing both in front and behind the wisdom teeth can help keep the gum tissues healthy and avoid the potential of painful ''gingivitis'' or infection around the wisdom teeth.''There are certain situations, however, where extraction of wisdom teeth is absolutely necessary. The wisdom tooth may erupt at an angle such that the adjacent molar can become difficult to keep clean and free of dental ''caries''. Sometimes the position of the wisdom tooth will cause deep periodontal pockets, ''gum disease'' or recession around the adjacent tooth, and should be removed before too much damage is caused to the much more critical second molars. If there isn’t sufficient room in the mouth for the wisdom teeth and they are trying to erupt, they may cause significant pressure on the surrounding teeth and tissues. This pressure can result in a bad ''headache'', ''jaw pain''/''stiffness'' or ''tooth pain'' that is only resolved by removing the wisdom teeth. The pressure can give the impression that the wisdom teeth are causing crowded teeth. If the third molar has erupted through the tissue but is without opposing occlusion (contact with other teeth), extraction should still be considered. Considering the posterior position of an erupted wisdom tooth, these teeth are often difficult to keep clean. If wisdom teeth get ''tooth decay'', it is usually best to extract them instead of removing the decay and fixing wisdom teeth with ''fillings'', root canals, or crowns. These treatments that are indicated for the rest of the teeth, are often less successful in treating wisdom teeth due to their position in the back of the mouth.''Removal of a wisdom tooth is indicated if the tooth has partially erupted through the gingival tissue, causing inflammation and/or infection. This condition is called a partially erupted, or partially impacted wisdom tooth. A soft-tissue growth over a partially erupted wisdom tooth is referred to as an operculum. If bacteria become trapped under the operculum, an infection called ''pericoronitis'' can develop.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of an infected wisdom tooth?,"""Pericoronitis is one of the most common indications for emergency extraction of a wisdom tooth and typically happens when there isn't enough room for all of the teeth in the lower jaw. Infection symptoms are red, swollen gum tissue behind the last visible molar, bad taste/smell, pain with biting in the back teeth, and sometimes pus oozing and draining from the area. Occasionally, the infection will lead to swelling of the gum tissue, cheek, or other area around the affected side of the jaw. Swelling can cause pressure on adjacent structures and can radiate to the ear causing an intense ""'earache''. Sometimes an ''ear infection'' or a ''sinus infection'' can cause pain that radiates to the teeth as well, so it is very important to get examined whenever there is suspicion of infection.' "
What if the wisdom teeth hurt and they cannot be extracted right away?,"'If there is swelling, infection, ''difficulty swallowing'' or ''breathing'', ''fever'', or intense pain, priority needs to be given to getting the wisdom teeth out as soon as possible. Antibiotics may be prescribed to help keep an infection from getting worse or spreading for a very short while. Warm saltwater rinse or antibacterial mouth rinse and OTC painkillers can be used as short-term remedies for ''tooth pain'' until more definitive treatment can be obtained. Some large dental schools may offer emergency evaluation and/or tooth extraction.' "
Are home remedies effective for treating wisdom tooth pain?,"'A variety of home remedies have been suggested for help with symptomatic wisdom teeth. While home remedies can be helpful if used to provide temporary relief, they are not alternatives to seeking a diagnosis and proper treatment from a licensed dentist or ''oral surgeon''. With prolonged use, they can actually worsen the condition by making the symptom less noticeable while allowing the source of infection, tooth decay, or pain increase until it spreads or causes more severe consequences.''In certain situations, however, the following home remedies can be helpful:''Again, people should contact a dentist as soon as possible as the above home remedies will not cure the underlying problem and may mask a more serious condition.' Clove oil: Clove oil contains eugenol, which is a natural numbing agent. Place a few drops on a cotton ball and place it adjacent to the area causing pain. If used for very long, it can cause irritation or burns to the tongue or other tissues, and the pain will return soon after removing the clove. Saltwater: Saltwater has a cleansing effect that battles bacterial infections. If a wisdom tooth has pericoronitis or another type of abscess, a saltwater rinse can help clean the infected area until the source is treated. Dissolve a small amount of salt in warm water and swish for 30 seconds one to two times per day. This can also help after wisdom teeth are removed to help keep the sockets free from debris and infection. Saltwater won't permanently cure an infection if the source is a poorly positioned or decayed wisdom tooth. Garlic: Garlic also works to stop the growth of bacteria that cause infections. Make a paste with minced garlic and salt and apply it to the problem area to help control an infection until a dentist can diagnose the condition. The strong odor of garlic is difficult to withstand for too long though. Tea bag: Various types of tea have natural properties that can help problems associated with wisdom tooth pain and extraction. Peppermint tea has numbing properties and can provide temporary relief of pain by applying a cooled tea bag to the painful site. Black tea contains tannic acid, which helps stop bleeding by inducing clot formation. If a wisdom tooth has been extracted and the bleeding won't stop with pressure after an hour, place a moistened tea bag on the bleeding area and bite down gently to provide pressure."
How is wisdom tooth extraction performed?,"'Once it has been determined that a wisdom tooth is problematic, extraction by an oral surgeon or qualified general dentist is usually indicated. Local anesthesia is administered to ensure the tooth can be pulled out without any major discomfort. Many people will choose conscious sedation (being put into a sleepy state where pain signals are blocked) so they have little or no memory of having the wisdom teeth extracted. A minor surgery is then performed where the tissue and bone around the wisdom tooth are removed so that the tooth can be cleanly extracted from the socket. Several ''stitches'' may be needed to close the surgical site and promote healing of the overlying tissue. These stitches may either be dissolvable stitches that come out on their own after three to five days or stitches that need to be removed by the surgeon after a certain period of time.' "
"What is the recovery 
time after wisdom teeth extraction?","'The initial recovery and healing from wisdom tooth extraction usually occurs over about three to five days. It is normal to have slight bleeding (oozing) from the site considering the surgical procedure performed. The minor bleeding (oozing) after extraction should start to ease after the first 24 hours. When the anesthesia wears off, there may be jaw stiffness, difficulty opening the mouth all the way, and some pain. Pain medication is often prescribed to help with any postoperative symptoms and discomfort. Usually, ''Tylenol'', an ice pack, and a mild narcotic is enough to provide pain relief. Some patients may be prescribed antibiotics. The patient will be asked to eat soft foods for a few days and avoid spicy foods, tobacco and ''alcohol'' use, and excessive ''exercise'' for three to four days following surgery. One of the most important things to remember is to avoid ''smoking'' after wisdom teeth removal. ''Smoking'' will delay the healing process and increase the chance of postoperative pain and complications. The best remedies for pain following extraction are rest and giving the area time to heal. Adhering to the postoperative instructions of the surgeon is important to minimize any complications. Complete healing of the gums may take three to four weeks.'  "
What can I eat after getting my wisdom teeth out?,"'While it is hard to eat for the first few days following tooth extraction, it is important not to skip meals and to stay well nourished to help maintain strength and heal faster. For the first day or two, it is best to eat mostly soft foods or liquids like smoothies, yogurt, shakes, pureed foods, soups, pudding, etc. It is best to avoid drinking through a straw and eating extremely hot or spicy foods. Also, foods that can get caught in the extraction socket like nuts, rice, seeds, and popcorn should be avoided. As the extraction areas start to heal, regular foods that require chewing can be slowly introduced back into the ''diet'' depending on the comfort of the person.' "
What are the potential risks and complications of wisdom teeth extraction?,"'Although the postoperative recovery is usually uneventful, problems can occur. The most common adverse occurrence of a wisdom tooth extraction is a ''dry socket'' or ''alveolar osteitis''. This condition is created when the ''blood clot'' in the surgical site accidentally dislodges, leaving exposed bone Once this occurs, the bone along the extraction socket can become inflamed and painful. If it happens, a dry socket will typically develop between two and five days after the extraction and will produce a bad smell/taste in the mouth along with constant throbbing pain. If a dry socket occurs, the surgeon should be contacted. This complication is easily treated and often resolves quickly with a packing medication or stimulation of a new ''blood clot''. More serious complications are rare but can include injury to the adjacent inferior alveolar nerve for wisdom teeth on the bottom of the mouth (mandible), sinus perforation for wisdom teeth on the top of the mouth (maxilla), damage to adjacent teeth, prolonged numbness or altered sensation of the tongue, lip, or gum tissue (paresthesia), or problems with the temporomandibular joint as a result of ''trauma'' to the area. The potential risks of wisdom tooth extraction should be reviewed with a dentist. If a wisdom tooth is deemed compromised, removal of the tooth in adolescence is advantageous to extracting the tooth in late adulthood. The extraction procedure and healing both become more difficult as the person gets older. Discussion with a dentist about the condition of the wisdom teeth and timeline for the extractions is important and will help minimize complications.'  "
How much does wisdom tooth removal cost?,'The cost of the procedure is often dependent on whether the tooth is impacted or not and can range from about $100 to $600 dollars per tooth. The cost can increase if sedation is needed or requested.'  
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy."" "
What is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'' is a specific type of abnormality of the electrical system of the ''heart''. This syndrome causes a specific pattern on an ''electrocardiogram'' (Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern) and is linked to an episode of rapid heart rates, such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ''atrial fibrillation''. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is a treatable medical condition. ''Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is also referred to as WPW syndrome and pre-excitation syndrome.' "
Who gets Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome can affect all ages but is usually diagnosed in children, adolescents, and young adults. Except in rare circumstances, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is not a hereditary condition.'  "
What causes Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'The heart has internal electrical “wiring” that is essential for proper pumping of blood to the rest of the body. In some people, an abnormal extra “wire” is present. This additional connection can cause a short-circuiting that causes the heart to beat very rapidly. This causes abnormal electrocardiogram (''ECG'') testing with rapid rate rhythms called supraventricular tachycardia or SVT.  Of note, the presence of a cardiac ''arrhythmia'' such as SVT can be from other heart conditions that are not Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'Individuals affected by Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can experience ''palpitations'', rapid heart rates, difficulty ''breathing'', and ''lightheadedness'' as well as near ''loss of consciousness'' and complete loss of consciousness. For the most part, these symptoms occur all of a sudden and are not associated with warning signs. Usually, there are no dramatic triggers, however, ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and ''exercise'' can cause the heart to start racing.'  "
What are the potential complications of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'Wolff-Parkinson-White can lead to significant symptoms from the rapid heart rates and can be alarming when first experienced. In addition, episodes can be disruptive and can last from minutes to hours and in some rare circumstances even days to weeks. The most serious complication of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is sudden death, which is rare and has been estimated to be around 0.25% per year. This very rare occurrence can happen if the short-circuit of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome triggers another arrhythmia called ''atrial fibrillation'' that even more rarely can induce ventricular ''fibrillation''. Ventricular fibrillation can cause sudden death if not treated promptly.' "
How is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed?,"'Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is diagnosed when the specific WPW pattern found on an ECG is linked to an episode of rapid heart rates, such as SVT or ''atrial fibrillation''. The WPW pattern is a combination of what is termed a short PR interval and a delta wave.    The rapid heart episode is usually from supraventricular tachycardia or SVT. Of note, the presence of an SVT can be from other more common forms of “short-circuiting” not necessarily related to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, such as ''atrial flutter'' or AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).'  "
What is the treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'A range of treatment options is available for the management of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In the majority of people without any symptoms, there is no need for immediate treatment. However, when or if symptoms suspicious for an episode of rapid heart rate occur, a cardiac electrophysiology study is recommended. A cardiac electrophysiology study is a minimally invasive surgical operation in which special wires inserted through the veins in the legs are used to measure electrical activity inside the heart. During this procedure, the connection can be identified, and importantly, can be eradicated, or ablated (a procedure known as ablation). A successful ablation of an extra connection can permanently treat all the symptoms of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, including the risk of sudden death. Finally, in some circumstances, eradication of the extra connection is not possible to perform safely or not desired by the patient. Medications can then be prescribed to help reduce the frequency of rapid heart rate episodes. Of note, the extra connection in the heart can be located on the left side of the heart (type B) or on the right side of the heart (''type A'').'  "
What is the prognosis for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"'The prognosis for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is excellent. Discussion with your physician can help navigate the treatment options that are available. In general, many people with the electrocardiogram findings of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may never need any type of treatment.' "
Can Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome be prevented?,"'Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome cannot be prevented, but can be treated in the vast majority of people. It is important to seek out a cardiologist or electrophysiologist if you have remaining questions or are in need of treatment.' "

How is endometrial biopsy done?,"""Endometrial biopsy is most often done in the physician's office, but it can be performed on women in the hospital. The patient lies on the examining table in a position similar to that used for obtaining Pap smears. The doctor uses a speculum to open the vaginal canal and visualize the cervix, the opening to the uterus. During endometrial biopsy the doctor inserts a thin ""'plastic'' or metal tubular device through the cervix into the uterus to remove a tiny piece of the inner lining tissue.''Usually no anesthesia is required, but taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (''NSAID'') 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure can help reduce cramping and pain. In some cases, a small amount of ''lidocaine'' anesthetic is inserted into the uterine ''cavity'' to minimize discomfort.' "
What are the risks of endometrial biopsy?,"'There are very few risks with endometrial biopsy. The leading risk is pain or cramping, but this typically subsides rapidly following the procedure. Other less common risks are:' Feeling faint or light-headed Infection Bleeding Rarely, perforation of the uterus"
What are uterine fibroids? What do they look like?,"'Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that originate in the uterus (womb). Although they are composed of the same smooth muscle fibers as the uterine wall (myometrium), they are much denser than normal myometrium. Uterine fibroids are usually round. In most cases, fibroids do not cause ''pain'' or other symptoms. However, exceptionally large fibroids may cause pressure on the bladder or other organs, leading to specific symptoms (see: What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids?)''Uterine fibroids are often described based upon their location within the uterus.'   Subserosal fibroids are located beneath the serosa (the lining membrane on the outside of the uterus). These often appear localized on the outside surface of the uterus or may be attached to the outside surface by a pedicle. Submucosal (submucous) fibroids are located inside the uterine cavity beneath the inner lining of the uterus. Intramural fibroids are located within the muscular wall of the uterus. Pedunculated fibroids grow on a stalk of tissue known as a pedicle (like a mushroom), extending either inside the cavity of the uterus or outside the uterus from its outer surface."
What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids? Do they cause pain?,"'Most of the time, uterine fibroids do not cause symptoms or problems, and a woman with a ''fibroid'' is usually unaware of its presence.''However, abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common symptom of a ''fibroid''. If the tumors are near the uterine lining, or interfere with the blood flow to the lining, they can cause heavy periods, painful periods, prolonged periods, or ''spotting'' between menses. Women with excessive bleeding due to fibroids may develop ''iron deficiency anemia''. Uterine fibroids that are degenerating can sometimes cause severe, localized pain.''Fibroids can also cause a number of symptoms depending on their size, location within the uterus, and how close they are to adjacent pelvic organs. Large fibroids can cause:''While fibroids do not interfere with ''ovulation'', some studies suggest that they may impair ''fertility'' and lead to poorer ''pregnancy'' outcomes. In particular, submucosal fibroids that deform the inner uterine cavity are most strongly associated with decreases in fertility. Occasionally, fibroids are the cause of recurrent miscarriages. If they are not removed in these cases, the woman may not be able to sustain a pregnancy.'   pressure, pelvic pain, including pain during sex, pressure on the bladder with frequent or even obstructed urination, and pressure on the rectum with painful or difficult defecation."
What causes uterine fibroids to grow? How big can they get?,"'We do not know exactly why women develop these tumors. Genetic abnormalities, alterations in growth factor (proteins formed in the body that direct the rate and extent of cell proliferation) expression, abnormalities in the vascular (blood vessel) system, and tissue response to injury have all been suggested to play a role in the development of fibroids.''Family history is a key factor, since there is often a history of fibroids developing in women of the same family. Race also appears to play a role. Women of African descent are two to three times more likely to develop fibroids than women of other races. Women of African ancestry also develop fibroids at a younger age and may have symptoms from fibroids in their 20s, in contrast to Caucasian women with fibroids, in whom symptoms typically occur during the 30s and 40s. Early pregnancy decreases the likelihood that fibroids will develop. Fibroids have not been observed in girls who have not reached ''puberty'', but adolescent girls may rarely develop fibroids. Other factors that researchers have associated with an increased risk of developing fibroids include having the first ''menstrual period'' (menarche) prior to age 10, consumption of ''alcohol'' (particularly beer), uterine infections, and elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''Estrogen tends to stimulate the growth of fibroids in many cases. During the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy, about a third of fibroids will enlarge and then shrink after the birth. In general, fibroids tend to shrink after ''menopause'', but ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'' may cause symptoms to persist.''Overall, these tumors are fairly common and occur in about 70% to 80% of all women by the time they reach age 50.''Uterine fibroids can be as small as a few millimeters (less than an inch) in diameter. They can also be very large (grapefruit-sized or larger).' "
Can uterine fibroids cause cancer?,"'For the most part, uterine fibroids that do not cause a problem for the woman can be left untreated. In some cases, even fibroids that are not causing symptoms require removal or at least close observation. Rapid growth is a reason to watch more carefully, since a rare cancerous form of fibroid (referred to as a leiomyosarcoma) can be a fast-growing ''tumor'', and it cannot be differentiated from a benign fibroid by ultrasound, MRI , or other imaging studies. However, this type of tumor occurs in less than 1% of uterine fibroids. It is also important to note that these rare cancerous tumors are not thought to begin in a benign fibroid.''Another risk of leaving these tumors alone is that they sometimes grow to a size that eventually causes significant symptoms, thus requiring removal. If fibroids grow large enough, the surgery to remove them can become more difficult and risky.' "
What tests diagnose uterine fibroids?,"'Uterine fibroids are diagnosed by pelvic exam and even more commonly by ultrasound. Often, a pelvic mass cannot be determined to be a fibroid on pelvic exam alone, and ultrasound is very helpful in differentiating it from other conditions such as ovarian tumors. MRI and ''CT scans'' can also play a role in diagnosing fibroids, but ultrasound is the simplest, cheapest, and best technique for imaging the pelvis. Occasionally, when trying to determine if a fibroid is present in the uterine cavity (endometrial cavity), a hysterosonogram (HSG) is done. In this procedure, an ultrasound exam is done while contrast fluid is injected into the uterus through the cervix. The fluid within the endometrial cavity can help outline any masses that are inside, such as submucosal fibroids.'  "
Are there home remedies for uterine fibroids?,"'There are no known home remedies that can shrink fibroids. If uterine fibroids are not causing symptoms or problems, they can be left alone without specific treatment. If they are large enough to cause symptoms like bleeding, pain, or pressure, medical or surgical treatment is required.' "
What is the treatment for uterine fibroids?,"'There are several uterine fibroids treatment options, including:''Medical treatments include medications such as:'   surgery (hysterectomy, myomectomy, cryosurgery), MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), and uterine artery embolization (UAE). mifepristone (RU-486), danazol (Danocrine), raloxifene (Evista), GnRH analogs (Lupron and others), and low-dose formulations of oral contraceptives."
Surgery for fibroids,"'There are many ways of managing uterine fibroids. Surgical methods are the mainstay of treatment when treatment is necessary. Possible surgical interventions include hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus (and the fibroids with it). ''Myomectomy'' is the selective removal of just the fibroids within the uterus. Myomectomy can be done through a hysteroscope, laparoscope, or with the standard open incision on the abdominal wall. Some treatments have involved boring holes into the fibroid with laser fibers, freezing probes (cryosurgery), and other destructive techniques that do not actually remove the tissue but try to destroy it in place. Surgery is necessary if there is suspicion of ''malignancy'' in any case of a leiomyoma or uterine mass.''Another technique for treating fibroids is known as uterine artery embolization (UAE). This technique uses small beads of a compound called polyvinyl alcohol, which are injected through a catheter into the arteries that feed the fibroid. These beads obstruct the blood supply to the fibroid and starve it of blood and oxygen. While this technique has not been in use long enough to evaluate long-term effects of UAE versus surgery, women undergoing UAE for fibroids have a shorter hospital stay than those having surgery but a greater risk of complications and readmissions to the hospital. Studies are underway to evaluate the long-term outcomes of UAE as opposed to surgical treatment. Uterine artery occlusion (UAO), which involves clamping the involved uterine arteries as opposed to injecting the polyvinyl alcohol beads, is currently under investigation as a potential alternative to UAE.''High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a relatively new treatment for fibroids and other abnormalities. It is also known as MRgFUS (MRI-guided focused ultrasound) and FUS (focused ultrasound surgery). HIFU uses an ultrasound transducer with higher energy than those used for diagnostic examinations. The device focuses the sound waves, generating heat to destroy the fibroid. MRI imaging may be used for planning and monitoring of treatment.'  "
Medical treatment for fibroids,"'Nonsurgical techniques are usually hormonal in nature and include the use of ''drugs'' that turn off the production of estrogen from the ovaries (GnRH analogs). These medications are given for three to six months and induce a hypoestrogenic (low estrogen) state. When successful, they can shrink the fibroids by as much as 50%. Side effects of these drugs are similar to the ''symptoms of menopause'' and can include ''hot flashes'', ''sleep'' disturbance, ''vaginal dryness'', and ''mood changes''. Bone loss leading to ''osteoporosis'' after long-term (6 to 12+ months) use is one complication. This is generally reversed after the treatment ends. These drugs may also be used as preoperative treatment for large leiomyomas to shrink them in order to make the operation less difficult and reduce surgical risk.''Mifepristone (RU-486) is an antiprogestin drug that can shrink fibroids to an extent comparable to treatment with the GnRH analogs. This drug is also used to terminate early pregnancy. Treatment with mifepristone also reduces the bleeding associated with fibroids, but this treatment can be associated with adverse side effects such as overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the ''endometrium'' (uterine lining). Mifepristone is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas, and the required dosages (different from those used for termination of early pregnancy) have not been determined.''Danazol (Danocrine) is an androgenic steroid hormone that has been used to reduce bleeding in women with fibroids, since this drug causes ''menstruation'' to cease. However, danazol does not appear to shrink the size of fibroids. Danazol is also associated with significant side effects, including ''weight gain'', ''muscle cramps'', decreased breast size, ''acne'', hirsutism (inappropriate hair growth), oily skin, mood changes, ''depression'', decreased high density lipoprotein (''HDL'' or ""good"" ''cholesterol'') levels, and increased ''liver'' enzyme levels.''The administration of raloxifene (Evista), a drug used to prevent and treat ''osteoporosis'' in postmenopausal women, has been shown to decrease the size of fibroids in postmenopausal women, but results with this therapy in premenopausal women have been conflicting.''Low dose formulations of oral contraceptives are also sometimes given to treat the abnormal bleeding associated with fibroids, but these do not shrink the fibroids themselves.' "
What are the risks of uterine fibroids during pregnancy?,"'Some studies have shown an increased risk of pregnancy complications in the presence of fibroids, such as first trimester bleeding, breech presentation, ''placental abruption'', and problems during ''labor''. Fibroids have also been associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. The size of the fibroid and its precise location within the uterus are important factors in determining whether a fibroid causes obstetric complications.' "
Facts you should know about breast lumps in women," Breast lumps can be caused by infections, injuries, non-cancerous growths, and cancer. Breast cancer usually causes no pain in the breast. The symptoms of breast cancer include painless breast lumps, nipple discharge, and inflammation of the skin of the breast. The chances that a particular breast lump could be cancerous depends on many factors, including past medical history, physical examination, as well as genetic and other risk factors. The only way to be certain that a lump is not cancerous is to have a tissue sampling (biopsy). There are several ways to do the biopsy. The treatment of a breast lump depends on its cause."
What are the types and causes of breast lumps? What do they look like?,"'There are many causes of breast lumps. Some of these causes are harmless, while others can be painful and/or dangerous. Causes of breast lumps include infections, injuries, non-cancerous growths, and ''cancer''.''Breast cancer'' is the second leading cause of ''cancer''-related deaths in women in the United States. Currently, death rates from ''breast cancer'' are declining. The decline in death rates may be due to a combination of earlier detection and better screening as well as improved treatments. While most breast lumps are harmless (benign), every breast lump should be evaluated by a doctor to exclude or establish a diagnosis of cancer.'  "
Infections,"'Inflammation of the breast tissue is known as ''mastitis''. Mastitis may occur in women who are ''breastfeeding'' a baby (lactating). When the skin of the ''nipple'' (''areola'') is injured or cracked, which may occur with ''nursing'', bacteria can enter the damaged area and cause infections. In a breastfeeding woman, a hard area commonly thought of as a ""clogged milk duct"" can form. Sometimes, certain treatments (see below) can prevent the painful, hard area from developing into an actual ''breast infection''. Infections can either be a deep pocket of pus, in which the infection looks like it is growing down into the breast (an ''abscess''), or a wider area of skin redness that spreads out (''cellulitis''). Body piercing in the nipple area increases the risk of breast infections, and these may be particularly difficult to treat.' "
Injuries to the breast,"'If a breast is injured by ''trauma'', tiny blood vessels can rupture to cause an area of localized bleeding (''hematoma'') that can be felt as a lump. Trauma to the breast can damage the fat cells in the breast tissue, a condition called fat necrosis. The injury can also form a lump in the breast. These types of lumps that follow a significant trauma are not cancerous. Fat necrosis can also occur at the site of a previous ''breast biopsy''.'  "
Non-cancerous growths,"   Fibroadenomas are benign (not cancerous) growths and are very common. These growths most commonly occur in women 30 to 35 years old, but can also occur in women under 30 years of age. Fibroadenomas are solid, firm tumors that are usually painless or only slightly tender. They sometimes grow quickly in teenagers or during pregnancy. Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs within the breast tissue and are benign. They are very common, especially over the age of 35. These cysts often vary in size during the menstrual cycle and may be tender. Fibrocystic changes are characterized by breasts that are lumpy with many irregularities in the breast tissue itself. Fibrocystic breasts seem to occur when a woman's breasts are overly sensitive to fluctuating hormone levels. Women with fibrocystic changes may have pain and/or lumps."
What do cancerous lumps in the breast feel like? Are they painful?,"'Sometimes breast ''cancer causes'' no symptoms or signs; but when they do occur, they include:''Breast cancer frequently causes no pain in the breast. Although women often worry about ''breast pain'', most women with ''breast pain'' do not have breast cancer.'   Nipple discharge that occurs without the nipple being touched can be caused by benign (non-cancerous) growths. Examples of these growths are intraductal papillomas (non-cancerous growths that protrude into the milk ducts) and dilated areas of milk ducts (ductal ectasia). Nipple discharge also can be caused by cancer of the breast tissue. Because nipple discharge can be a sign of cancer, it needs to be evaluated by a doctor. Skin changes on the breast, including redness and warmth, can sometimes be a sign of breast cancer. Inflammation: A form of breast cancer that commonly causes symptons and signs of inflammation is Paget's disease of the breast. However, most inflammation or rashes on the breast are not due to cancer. They may be caused by benign problems such as nipple eczema or a fungal infection. Still, a doctor should be evaluate any rashes. Areas that are especially scaly and red, particularly if they are persistent, or if there is also nipple discharge, are often sampled (biopsied) to rule out cancer."
How do doctors diagnose the types and causes of breast lumps?,"'A manual examination of the breast is an important screening method for detecting cancer, and it is the first step in the evaluation of a breast lump. Unfortunately, the manual examination of the breast is not precise. However, if a mass can be felt manually, it is important to estimate the location of the mass so that the ''mammogram'' and/or other diagnostic examinations can focus on that particular area. A doctor also inspects any suspicious skin changes that may be a sign of breast cancer. Since the manual examination can miss breast cancer, ''mammography'' is also an important screening tool.''Women with a breast lump need to have a mammogram of both breasts. A mammogram is estimated to be able to detect about 90% of breast ''cancers''. This means that about 10% of breast cancers are missed by mammography. Therefore, if a woman or her physician feels a lump and the mammogram is normal, further studies or biopsies are carried out to rule out cancer. Sometimes, a certain pattern of calcium deposits appears on the mammogram that makes the doctor suspicious of cancer. In these cases, it is often recommended that a biopsy be taken that is guided by mammogram images to be sure the correct area is sampled.''Ultrasound'' is useful in the evaluation of breast lumps. It can distinguish between a ''cyst'', which is filled with fluid and a solid lump (which may or may not be cancerous). The first step in the evaluation of a breast lump is to determine whether it is a ''cyst'' or solid mass. This is best accomplished by performing an ultrasound examination. In a young woman, where a benign cyst is anticipated and, the ultrasound is confirmatory, she may not require any procedures or biopsies. If it is unclear on the ultrasound whether the lump is entirely cystic in nature, a further evaluation is usually recommended.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is becoming more widely used in the evaluation of breast lumps because it is particularly sensitive to small abnormalities in breast tissue. MRI is a special radiology technique designed to image internal structures of the body using magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce the images of body structures. Cancers generally have a greater blood supply than non-cancerous growths. The images obtained from an MRI may help determine whether a particular area is cancerous as the MRI exhibits greater contrast in those areas with an increased blood supply. In most cases, MRI is performed if results of mammography and ultrasound evaluations are not conclusive.''MRI also has limitations. For example, MRI cannot detect the presence of calcium deposits, which can be identified by mammography and may be a sign of cancer.'  "
6 treatments for breast lumps,"'If the area actually looks red or fails to get better with heat, massage, and nursing, a doctor should be consulted for consideration of antibiotics. If untreated, mastitis can quickly progress and develop into a severe infection. Whether a woman is ''pregnant'' or not, she needs to see a doctor if the area does not return completely to normal with treatment in order to rule out more unusual types of infections. Cellulitis needs to be treated with antibiotics and frequent follow-ups with the doctor.' Breast pain (mastodynia) is a common problem. As long as the doctor or patient can feel no mass, and no breast lump is seen on a mammogram or ultrasound, breast pain is often concluded to be a normal condition. It is often thought that this pain is caused by natural hormonal fluctuations. If the discomfort is particularly acute and interferes excessively with a woman's life, oral contraceptives or other medications can be helpful, especially if the pain is worse around the time of the menstrual cycles. Fibrocystic changes do not require medication or surgery. Often, a baseline mammogram is done. Then, no further treatment is needed unless a new lump arises, in which case an evaluation with a mammogram and possibly ultrasound is necessary. Fibroadenomas are usually removed because they may otherwise be difficult to distinguish from cancer. Breast cancer requires urgent treatment. Treatment depends on the type of cancer detected, its size, and its location. An abscess of the breast often needs to be drained by a doctor because antibiotics alone cannot adequately treat an abscess. A breast infection (mastitis) in a woman who is breast-feeding is treated with warm compresses and antibiotics. Heat treatment is a convenient and effective way of applying heat treatment is to wet some washcloths and put them in the microwave briefly to warm them. Hot showers Massage during heat treatment of the infected area. Beast swelling pain: Heat treatment helps open up the milk ducts. Nursing your baby or using a breast pump can help relieve the swelling and pain. Contrary to common myth, nursing the baby or using a breast pump is a critical part of the treatment because it helps decrease the chance of the infection progressing."
What determines one's breast cancer risk?,"""The chances that a particular breast lump could be cancerous depends on many factors, including a woman's past medical history, her physical examination, and results of radiological tests (e.g. mammograms and ultrasounds). Some of the most important risk factors are outlined below.""'Age is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer. In other words, most cases of breast cancer occur due to the fact that the risk of breast cancer increases with age. Most women with breast cancer do not have a history of breast cancer. A woman who has had a prior breast cancer or who has a family history of breast cancer is certainly at risk herself, especially if multiple family members are involved, the cases occurred at a young age, or if the cancer involved both breasts of a single family member.''Women who have received ''radiation therapy'' to the chest area as treatment for another cancer have a significantly increased risk for breast cancer.''About 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases have been shown to be related to ''inherited'' gene changes (mutations). The most common mutations are those of the ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' genes, although other genetic mutations may also lead to breast cancers.''The finding of certain conditions on previous breast biopsies can also increase the risk for developing breast cancer. Pre-cancerous growths and growths noted on a breast biopsy that represent an increased risk for the development of breast cancer include the following:''Women with DCIS, LCIS, atypical hyperplasia, or proliferative disease are at even higher risk of developing breast cancer if they have a history of breast cancer in the family.' Ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) is an uncontrolled growth of cells that has not spread beyond the milk duct where it is located. DCIS consists of cancer cells that have not invaded other tissues. Therefore, DCIS often is considered to be an early stage of breast cancer and is the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS is not life threatening, but must be treated. Women with DCIS have an increased risk for developing a recurrence of the cancer or for development of a new cancer in either breast. Lobular carcinoma-in-situ (LCIS) is considered a condition in which abnormal cells are confined to the lobules in the breast (the glands that produce milk). Unlike DCIS, LCIS is not considered to have a high probability of becoming a cancer, but it is a sign of risk for that breast or the opposite breast for developing a cancer. Therefore, women with LCIS have a greater chance of developing breast cancer in either breast. Proliferative disease of the breast is a benign condition, but it can be a signal that breast cancer may develop in the future. Ductal hyperplasia (the overgrowth of normal cells within the breast ducts) and atypical hyperplasia (overgrowth of abnormal cells in the ducts or lobules that is not serious or extensive enough to qualify as DCIS or LCIS) are examples of conditions that increase the overall risk for developing breast cancer. Not surprisingly, women with atypical hyperplasia have a higher risk than do those with simple ductal hyperplasia (without atypia)."
How can a woman be certain that a lump is not cancer?,"'The only one way to be certain that a lump is not cancerous is to have a tissue sampling (biopsy). There are several ways to perform the biopsy.''Types of biopsy studies include:''To determine the correct location to sample by either method, the lump may be felt by hand (palpitated) if cannot be located. The FNA or core biopsy may be done during an ultrasound examination or mammogram. FNA of a benign cyst may remove the fluid contents of the cyst and cause the mass to disappear or markedly decrease in size.' Fine needle aspiration: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is similar to a blood test in that a needle is inserted into the mass and fluid is withdrawn. The fluid and cells are examined by a pathologist for signs suggesting malignancy. Core needle biopsy: For some women, may be indicated. In this procedure, a hollow needle is inserted into the suspicious area, and a core of tissue is removed through the needle. Excisional biopsy: If no fluid can be aspirated, and the mass is solid, then a direct tissue sampling must be performed. Tissue sampling using either a core needle biopsy or an excisional biopsy (removal of all or a portion of the abnormal area in a surgical procedure). The excisional biopsy is the best method of making an accurate diagnosis. Typically it is done in the operating room using either local or general anesthesia."

Osteoporosis,"'Osteoporosis'' is a condition characterized by progressive loss of ''bone density'' leading to bone ''fractures''. Estrogen is important in maintaining bone density. When estrogen levels drop after ''menopause'', bone loss accelerates. Thus,\xa0''osteoporosis'' is more common among ''postmenopausal'' women.''Measurement of bone density using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (''DEXA'') scan''DEXA bone density scanning can:''The National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines state that all postmenopausal women below age 65 who have risk factors for osteoporosis or medical conditions associated with osteoporosis and all women aged 65 and older should consider bone density testing.''High risk factors for osteoporosis include:''Osteoporosis produces no symptoms until a bone ''fracture'' occurs. Bone fracture secondary to osteoporosis can occur with only a minor fall, blow, or even just a twist of the body that normally would not cause an injury.''Prevention'' and treatment of osteoporosis can decrease the risk of bone fractures.''While ''hormone therapy'' containing estrogen has been shown to prevent bone loss, increase bone density, and decrease the risk of fractures, HT has also been associated with health risks.

Breast cancer,"'Breast cancer'' is the most common ''cancer'' among women in the United States. Approximately one in nine women who live to age 65 will develop ''breast cancer'', although many will not do so until after age 65.''The most important screening methods to detect ''breast cancer'' include:''Early detection of breast cancer is important to every woman, regardless of risk factors, because the earlier a cancer is found, the smaller it is likely to be. Studies have clearly shown that the smaller the size of the breast cancer when detected, the better the chance of a surgical cure and long-term survival. Smaller breast cancers are also less likely to have already spread to ''lymph nodes'' and to other organs such as the ''lungs'', ''liver'', bones, and brain.''Mammograms can detect many small breast cancers long before they may be felt during breast examinations. There is extensive evidence that early detection by mammography has improved survival in women with this disease.''Some 10% to 15% of breast cancers are not detected through mammograms but are detected by breast examinations. Therefore a normal mammogram does not completely exclude the possibility of breast cancer, and breast self-examinations and breast examinations by a doctor remain important.'  breast examination by a trained professional, and mammography In November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against teaching breast self-examination, citing a lack of benefit for a monthly self-examination. Groups such as the American Cancer Society agree with this conclusion and do not offer guidance on exactly how often a woman should check her breasts, but do state that a woman should be aware of any changes in her breasts. Breast examination by a professional trained in breast examination. Mammography: In their revised recommendations issued in November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that women age 40 to 49 do not require routine mammograms. They recommend biannual screening mammograms for women aged 49-74, and further state that: ""The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms."" However, The American Cancer Society (ACS) disagrees and recommends a baseline mammogram for all women by age 40 and annual mammograms for women 40 and older for as long as they are in good health. In women with ""lumpy breasts"" or breast symptoms, and also in women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, a baseline mammogram at 35 years of age is sometimes recommended. This recommendation is somewhat controversial, and there are other viewpoints. a history of breast cancer; first-degree relatives (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer. The risk is especially higher if both the mother and sister have had breast cancers, if a relative developed her cancer before age 50, if the relative had breast cancer in both breasts, if there is both ovarian and breast cancers in the family, or if a male family member has been diagnosed with breast cancer"
High blood pressure (hypertension),"'About one-sixth of all Americans have ''high blood pressure'', and the incidence of this disease increases with age. Consequently, the proportion among adults is higher, and it is even higher among seniors. African-Americans are more likely than others to have ''high blood pressure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause arterial disease (''atherosclerosis'') that can lead to ''heart attack'', ''congestive heart failure'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause diseases without any early warning symptoms.''There is good evidence that treatment of high blood pressure can reduce the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.''Actually, there is good evidence that adults with all degrees of high blood pressure can benefit from the lowering of blood pressure. It is important to discuss\xa0''weight management'', ''exercise'', and ''stress management''\xa0with your doctor.'  High-normal blood pressure is 130-139/85-89. Stage 1 hypertension is 140-159/90-99. Stages 2 and 3 blood pressure are >160 / >100. How often blood pressure should be checked depends on how severely elevated the blood pressure is. It also depends on the presence of other risk factors for heart attack and stroke. Adults with most recent normal blood pressure of systolic < 130 and diastolic < 85 should be checked at least every other year."
Cervical cancer,"'Cancer of the cervix'' (the portion of the uterus that extends downward into the vagina) is the third leading cause of gynecologic cancer. \xa0''It is almost always caused by a sexually transmitted organism ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV''). ''Cervical cancer'' typically develops over the long term from abnormal ''precancerous'' (before-cancer) cells on the surface of the cervix. Once cancer develops, the cells may spread (i.e. ''metastasize'') to other organs.''Pap test'' also known as ''Pap smear''.'""A Pap test is a simple, quick office test in which a sample of cells from a woman's cervix is collected by swabbing the surface of the cervix and spreading the cells on a microscope slide or placed in a special solution. The cells are examined under a microscope in order to look for precancerous (before-cancer) or cancer cells.""'Women should have Pap tests as part of an annual pelvic examination beginning at age 21 or three years following the onset of sexual activity. The risk of ''cervical cancer'' increases sharply during the first few years following the initiation of sexual activity. Some physicians begin screening women as soon as they become sexually active, but not before. High-risk factors for cervical cancer of the cervix include:''In 2009, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) revised its recommendations regarding Pap testing. Instead of beginning at age 18 as previously recommended, the new recommendations advise beginning Pap smears at age 21. Further changes to the ACOG guidelines are:''As it is rare to find a pre-cancerous or cancerous lesion of the cervix in women over the age of 65 who have repeatedly had normal Pap smears, many doctors decrease the frequency of Pap screening under these circumstances.''Women who have had a ''hysterectomy'' (surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix) do not need Paps unless they have had a cancerous or pre-cancerous lesion of the genital tract. However, they should continue to have manual pelvic and rectal examinations by their doctors as a part of their periodic medical evaluations for reasons other than cancer of the cervix.''There has been a 70% decrease in the death rate from cervical cancer, in large part because of judicious use of the Pap test. Benefits of the Pap test include:''A ''vaccine'' (''Gardasil'') has received U.S. FDA approval for use in young women between 9 and 26 years of age. Early vaccination will consistently protect against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 unless the patient has already been infected by one of these viral types. HPV types 16 and 18 are known to be the two viral types most frequently associated with pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. Initial trials with the vaccine have shown that the HPV-16/18 vaccine is safe and induces a high degree of protection against HPV-16/18 infection. Gardasil is given in three injections over a six-month interval. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that girls 11-12 years of age receive the vaccine. It is also recommended for girls and women age 13 through 26 who have not yet been vaccinated or completed the vaccine series.''A newer vaccine (Cervarix) was approved by the FDA in October, 2009, for use in girls and young women ages 10-25 to help prevent cervical cancer. Cervarix targets two HPV ''strains'', HPV 16 and HPV 18. A well-controlled study comparing Gardisil\xa0and Cervarix has yet to be conducted.'  cigarette smoking; a history of genital warts or other genital infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV); multiple sexual partners or a partner who has multiple sexual partners; the onset of sexual activity at a young age. women younger than 30 years of age should have a Pap test every 2 years. women aged 30 years of age and older should have a Pap test every 2 years. After three normal Pap test results in a row, a woman in this age group may have Pap tests every 3 years if:she does not have a history of moderate or severe dysplasia;she is not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV);her immune system is not weakened (for example, if she has had an organ transplant);she was not exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth. she does not have a history of moderate or severe dysplasia; she is not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); her immune system is not weakened (for example, if she has had an organ transplant); she was not exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) before birth. early identification and treatment of abnormal cells before they become cancerous. identification of cervical cancer at an early stage, thereby allowing optimum treatment before the cancer has metastasized."
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),"'HIV'' is the virus that causes ''AIDS'' (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome). While modern anti-''HIV'' medications have significantly improved long-term survival and quality of life of HIV infected individuals, there is still no cure or vaccine. HIV infection is still eventually lethal in everyone who is infected. Therefore, preventing the spread of HIV is the most important step in preventing illness and death due to HIV infection.''The following individuals should be routinely offered HIV testing:''Most infected individuals will develop a positive HIV blood test within three months of being exposed to HIV. If the ''HIV test'' at three months is negative and there are risk factors for infection, the test should be repeated in another three months.'""Theoretically, early treatment with anti-HIV medications may help the body's immune system fight the virus. So far, early treatment cannot cure or eradicate the virus. Therefore, early detection is most important to prevent viral spread.""'The HIV virus may be present in the blood, genital fluid, and other body secretions of virtually all infected individuals, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. The HIV virus is spread from one person to another when these secretions come in contact with the vagina, anal area, mouth, eyes, or a break in the skin, such as from a cut, bruise, sore, or puncture by a needle. Sexual transmission of HIV has been described from men to men, men to women, women to men, and women to women through vaginal, anal, and oral sex.' Screening blood test for antibodies to HIV is called an ELISA test. Confirmatory test for antibodies to HIV is called a Western blot. HIV infected individuals can remain free of symptoms for many years.  Patients will know if they are infected ONLY if a blood test for HIV is done. HIV testing can be performed by a physician or at a testing center. pregnant women; individuals with occupational exposure to HIV (health care workers and researchers working with HIV); individuals with high-risk sexual behavior (multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse), drug users who practice needle-sharing; anyone requesting HIV testing; and individuals with active tuberculosis, unexplained fevers, low white blood cell counts, or who have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Abstinence from sex until both partners are certain that they are not infected (for example both partners test negative for HIV antibody after the last potential exposure) is paramount in preventing the spread of HIV. While most newly infected individuals test positive by two months after infection, up to 5% are still negative after six months with routine testing. If abstinence is not possible, use latex barriers such as a condom.  A dental dam (i.e. a piece of latex that prevents vaginal secretions from coming in direct contact with the mouth) can also be employed. For pregnant women infected with HIV, proper prenatal counseling, treatment with anti-HIV drugs after the first trimester, proper handling of the delivery process, and short-term treatment of the newborn child can substantially reduce HIV infection in the newborn. Avoid sharing of needles, razor blades, and toothbrushes. Health care workers who experience a needle stick or exposure of the eyes, mouth, or injured skin to fluids from an infected person should take anti-HIV medication in order to reduce the risk of developing a clinical infection."
"Hypercholesterolemia (hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia)","'Elevated ''LDL cholesterol'' or low ''HDL cholesterol'' increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (""''hardening of the arteries''""). Atherosclerosis can begin to develop in adolescence and progress without any symptoms for many years. It can lead to heart attack and ''stroke'' later in life.''Hyperlipidemia'' is a common and treatable cause of atherosclerosis.

An estimated 18% of all Americans over 65 have ''diabetes''. Over ten million Americans have been diagnosed with ''diabetes''; and at least half as many more are thought to have undiagnosed diabetes. Many more people have a condition that precedes diabetes, referred to as ''prediabetes'', characterized by sluggish metabolism of ''sugar'' (glucose) to a lesser degree than is present in those with diabetes.''Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of ''blindness'' in adults aged 20-74 years, the leading cause of chronic ''kidney disease'', and the leading cause of lower extremity amputations not related to injury. Individuals with diabetes are 2-4 times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than are those without diabetes.''Tests for diabetes mellitus include:''Healthy subjects over 45 years of age should have ''fasting blood glucose'' level checked every three years. Adults at a higher than normal risk of developing diabetes mellitus should be checked on a more frequent basis.''Risk factors for diabetes include:' fasting blood sugar (blood sugar test after at least eight hours without calories), normal level less than 100 mg/dl; pre-diabetes is characterized by a fasting blood sugar level of 100-125 mg/dl; diabetes is diagnosed by a fasting glucose level greater than 126 mg/dl; and two-hour postprandial blood sugar (blood sugar test drawn two hours after a meal), A normal postprandial level less than 140mg/dl. excessive weight; a first-degree blood relative with adult-onset diabetes; certain ethnic groups such as African-Americans, Hispanics, certain Native American, and Asians Groups; delivery of a baby weighing more than 9 lbs or a history of diabetes during pregnancy (""gestational diabetes""); impaired glucose tolerance, currently or previously; and low HDL cholesterol (35 mg/dl or less) or elevated triglyceride level (over 250 mg/dl)."
Benefits of early detection,"'There is good evidence in diabetic patients that curtailing total caloric intake (especially intake of processed starches, sugar and sweets), regular exercise, and the loss of excess weight can help prevent the development of diabetes mellitus. ''Weight control'' will usually lead to improved metabolism of glucose, often to levels in those without impaired glucose tolerance.''There is good evidence that in diabetic patients with diabetes, pharmacological blood sugar controls, ''diet'', ''weight loss'', and regular exercise can slow the development of diabetic complications.''There is also strong evidence that even those with impaired glucose tolerance can significantly improve their otherwise increased risk for ''atherosclerotic'' disease (including ''heart attacks'' and stroke) with appropriate changes in ''diet'', physical activity, and weight.'

Cancer of colon and rectum and polyps of colon and rectum,"'Colorectal cancer'' is the second most common cause of death from cancer overall and ranks third in both women (after lung and breast cancer) and men (after lung and ''prostate cancer'').''Scientists believe that majority of the colon cancers develop from colonic polyps (precancerous growths on the inner surface of the colon). These tumors may become ''malignant'', with the cells invading locally or spreading (metastasizing) to other parts of the body.''Colon cancer'' is preventable by removing ''colon polyps'' before they evolve into a cancer. Colon cancer is curable if removed before spread occurs.''All healthy subjects should have stool occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 50, followed by stool occult blood annually and flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years.''Alternatively, instead of flexible sigmoidoscopy, all healthy subjects can undergo screening colonoscopy at age 50 and then every 10 years if tests remain normal and there is no prior history of polyps or cancer.''Higher risk patients (individuals with a family history of colonic polyps or cancer, long-standing ''ulcerative colitis'', or a prior personal history of colon polyps or cancer) require colonoscopy earlier and more frequently.''Stool occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy have been documented to reduce colon cancer mortality by:'  Stool occult blood test: Stool occult blood test is a chemical test to detect trace amounts of blood in the stool. It is inexpensive and easily performed, though not always accurate. Some cancers are not detected by this test, and many positive tests are caused by other problems besides cancer. Flexible sigmoidoscopy: Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a relatively quick and easy office procedure which allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious lesions from the distal portion of the colon. The procedure is uncomfortable, and it is less accurate than a full colonoscopy. Colonoscopy: Colonoscopy allows visualization of the entire colon and is the most complete and thorough test. It requires intravenous sedation, is much more expensive, and is not covered by some insurance plans as a screening procedure. Although screening colonoscopies may have a slightly higher risk of complications than flexible sigmoidoscopies, both screening tests are very safe when performed by trained professionals. preventing colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they become cancerous. increasing cancer cure rate by identifying early cancer at a treatable stage before the cancer has spread (metastasized)."
Bladder cancer,"'(Note that bladder cancer is only one of many causes of blood in the urine.)''All people who are current or former ''cigarette'' ''smokers'' or who have a history of occupational exposure to certain chemicals such as those used in the dye, leather, tire, and rubber industries should have a urine examination for blood periodically after the age of 60 years.''Early bladder cancer may produce no symptoms and no gross blood in the urine. However, the blood is almost always visible microscopically.''Treatment can be effective if the cancer is detected early, and survival is strongly associated with the stage of disease at the time of initiation of treatment.''Cessation of ''cigarette smoking'' is always advisable.' Initial  screening for bladder cancer  is carried out by determining if there is blood in the urine (hematuria). This may be done using a dipstick that is placed in the urine. If positive, the urine should be examined under the microscope. Alternatively, the urine may be visualized microscopically without the dipstick being used. Bladder cancer can cause gross hematuria (a large amount of blood in the urine), or microscopic hematuria (the blood can only be seen with the aid of a microscope). Bladder cancer is only one of many causes of hematuria."
Glaucoma,"'Glaucoma'' is a condition with abnormally elevated intra-''ocular'' pressures (pressure within the eyeball).'""The American Academy of Ophthalmology's recommended intervals for eye exams, including ""'glaucoma'' screening, are:''Although there is no formal screening recommendation for healthy subjects with normal risk, everyone over 60 years of age should have periodic intra-ocular pressure measurements periodically, perhaps yearly.''Glaucoma can cause extensive damage of the retina, as well as\xa0irreversible ''loss of vision'' without warning symptoms and before the individual becomes aware of a loss of vision.''There is good evidence that treatment of ''elevated eye pressure''\xa0from glaucoma can prevent blindness.' Measurement of intra-ocular pressure should be a standard component of a comprehensive eye examination. Note that a checkup for vision does not always measure intra-ocular pressure. Intra-ocular pressure should be measured by eye care specialists. Have an eye examination every three to five years. Others should have an eye exam at least once during this period. Age 20-29: Individuals of African descent or a family history of glaucoma should have two screenings during this period. Age 30-39: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma.  Age 40-64: Every two to four years. Age 65 or older: Every one to two years."

What is heart disease?,"'Heart disease in women'' includes a number of problems affecting the ''heart'' and the blood vessels in the heart. Types of ''heart disease'' include:''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'')'' is the most common type and is the leading cause of ''heart attacks''. When you have ''CAD'', your arteries become hard and narrow. Blood has a hard time getting to the heart, so the heart does not get all the blood it needs. CAD can lead to:'' '' ''Heart failure'' occurs when the heart is not able to pump blood through the body as well as it should. This means that other organs, which normally get blood from the heart, do not get enough blood. It does not mean that the heart stops. Signs of ''heart failure'' include:'""Heart arrhythmias (uh-RITH-mee-uhz) are changes in the beat of the heart. Most people have felt dizzy, faint, out of breath or had chest pains at one time. These changes in heartbeat are harmless for most people. As you get older, you are more likely to have arrhythmias. Don't panic if you have a few flutters or if your heart races once in a while. If you have flutters and other symptoms such as ""'dizziness'' or ''shortness of breath'', call 911 right away.' Angina (an-JEYE-nuh). Angina is chest pain or discomfort that happens when the heart does not get enough blood. It may feel like a pressing or squeezing pain, often in the chest, but sometimes the pain is in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It can also feel like indigestion (upset stomach). Angina is not a heart attack, but having angina means you are more likely to have a heart attack. Heart attack. A heart attack occurs when an artery is severely or completely blocked, and the heart does not get the blood it needs for more than 20 minutes. Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Swelling in feet, ankles, and legs Extreme tiredness"
Do women need to worry about heart disease?,"'Yes. Among all U.S. women who die each year, one in four dies of ''heart disease''. In 2004, nearly 60 percent more women died of ''cardiovascular disease'' (both ''heart disease'' and ''stroke'') than from all ''cancers'' combined. The older a woman gets, the more likely she is to get ''heart disease''. But women of all ages should be concerned about ''heart disease''. All women should take steps to prevent ''heart disease''.''Both men and women have ''heart attacks'', but ''more women who have heart attacks die from them.'' Treatments can limit heart damage but they must be given as soon as possible after a heart attack starts. Ideally, treatment should start within one hour of the first symptoms.'""If you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Tell the operator your symptoms and that you think you're having a heart attack."" "
Do women of color need to worry about heart disease?,"'Yes.

What does high blood pressure have to do with heart disease?,"'Blood pressure is the force your blood makes against the walls of your arteries. The pressure is highest when your heart pumps blood into your arteries – when it beats. It is lowest between heart beats, when your heart relaxes. A doctor or nurse will write down your blood pressure as the higher number over the lower number. For instance, you could have a blood pressure of 110/70 (read as ""110 over 70""). A blood pressure reading below 120/80 is usually considered normal. Very ''low blood pressure'' (lower than 90/60) can sometimes be a cause of concern and should be checked out by a doctor.''High blood pressure'', or ''hypertension'', is a blood pressure reading of 140/90 or higher. Years of ''high blood pressure'' can damage artery walls, causing them to become stiff and narrow. This includes the arteries carrying blood to the heart. As a result, your heart cannot get the blood it needs to work well. This can cause a heart attack.''A blood pressure reading of 120/80 to 139/89 is considered ''prehypertension'"". This means that you don't have ""'high blood pressure'' now but are likely to develop it in the future.' "

What does high cholesterol have to do with heart disease?,"'Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in cells in all parts of the body. When there is too much cholesterol in your blood, cholesterol can build up on the walls of your arteries and cause ''blood clots''. Cholesterol can clog your arteries and keep your heart from getting the blood it needs. This can cause a heart attack.''There are two types of cholesterol:''All women age 20 and older should have their blood cholesterol and ''triglyceride levels'' checked at least once every 5 years.' Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is often called the ""bad"" type of cholesterol because it can clog the arteries that carry blood to your heart. For LDL, lower numbers are better. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as ""good"" cholesterol because it takes the bad cholesterol out of your blood and keeps it from building up in your arteries. For HDL, higher numbers are better."

Facts on women's health," Women and men share many similar health problems, but women have their own health issues, which deserve special consideration. Women's lives have changed over the centuries. Historically, life was particularly difficult for most women. Aside from the numerous dangers and diseases, women became wives and mothers often when they were just emerging from their own childhood. Many women had a large number of pregnancies which may or may not have been wanted. In the past, childbirth itself was risky and frequently, led to the death of the mother. Most women in the past did not live long enough to be concerned about menopause or old age. In 1900, a woman's life span was about 50 years. Now, in the new millennium, average life expectancy for American women is 82 years of age, and it is continuing to rise. Not only are women living longer, but they also can anticipate the possibility of enjoying a better quality of life throughout their span of years. In order to accomplish this, it is essential that women take charge of their own bodies and that they comprehend how they can maximize their personal health and fitness. It is also helpful that men understand and are supportive of the health concerns of the women. Gynecology is the primary branch of medical science concerned with women's health issues. The word ""gynecology"" is a word consisting of ""gyneco,"" meaning ""woman,"" and ""logic,"" meaning ""knowledge."" Taken together, it is ""woman knowledge."" It is important that every woman has access to knowledge related to the spectrum of women's health issues, not only about her reproductive system, but about all aspects of her body."
Women's general health and wellness,"'There is credible information available to women not only on such problems as ''eating disorders'', ''stress'', ''alcoholism'', addictions, and ''depression'', but also on basic topics such as good ''nutrition'', ''heart'' health, and ''exercise'"". For example, it is beneficial that a woman maintain her optimum weight. If a woman's waist size measures more than 35 inches (89 cm), she is more likely to develop ""'heart disease'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes''. Eating sensible meals, eliminating after-dinner snacks, and making physical activity a part of daily life are significant ways to help control weight and lower the risk of a long list of health problems.''Smoking'"" is detrimental to anyone's health, as well as the health of those around them. Unfortunately, women continue to smoke despite the known health risks. Even though the number of female\xa0""'smokers''\xa0is declining, still about 16% of women in the U.S. continue to smoke. Women are ''smoking'' in spite of the well-publicized risks including ''cancer'', ''heart disease'', and innumerable other health issues.''Drinking an excessive amount of ''alcohol'' is also harmful to health. Although women typically begin drinking at a later age than men and tend to drink somewhat less, lower doses of alcohol are required for women to develop alcohol-related medical problems including alcohol toxicity, ''cirrhosis'', and ''hepatitis''.''Women should be aware that they metabolize a number of ''drugs'' differently than men. In some cases and for some medications, the rate of metabolism may be slower, and in other cases, faster. It is, therefore, essential that women are well informed about the kinds and correct dosages of any drugs they are taking.' "
Female anatomy,"""There are major differences in anatomy between males and females that require consideration. As more women are now participating in sports, many anatomic differences are being identified, often because men and women athletes sustain different types of injuries. In females, the hamstrings (muscles behind the leg) are not as strong as in males. Women also have a wider hip-to-knee ratio than men. A woman's legs are relatively longer and her torso shorter than a man of comparable size. She has a lower center of gravity, less muscle mass, less dense bones, and higher percentage of body fat.""'Anatomic differences between men and women go well beyond the reproductive and skeletal systems. For example, they involve the brain and the heart. In fact, ''heart disease'' is the leading cause of death among women in the United States. It is now described as an ""equal opportunity killer."" Over one in three adult women in the US has some form of ''cardiovascular disease''.''Women tend to suffer their first ''heart attack'' 10 years later than men. For reasons that remain unclear (and require more research), the likelihood for a younger woman dying from a heart attack is significantly greater than that of a man. Moreover, the symptoms of an impending heart attack may be somewhat different in a woman than in a man. A woman is more likely to ignore the symptoms and fail to seek medical attention. Every woman needs to develop her own healthy heart program.' "
The female reproductive system,"'Since the ''female reproductive system'"" plays such an important role throughout the life of a woman, it receives special consideration. A woman's reproductive system includes her uterus, Fallopian tubes, ovaries, cervix, and external genitalia. The breasts can also be included, even though, technically speaking, they are not part of the reproductive system. The breasts do play a major role in ""'pregnancy'' and motherhood.'""Although the primary function of the reproductive system is to conceive and bear children, a female's reproductive system makes a major contribution to her overall womanhood. Due to the complexity of her reproductive system, she can experience a number of problems ranging from yeast infections of the vagina to fibroids of the uterus or ""'cysts'' of the ovary.''If a woman is to make informed choices about her health care, she must understand her reproductive system. In the U.S., a common major surgery performed on women who are not ''pregnant'' is a ''hysterectomy''. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, ends ''menstruation'"" and a woman's innate ability to become pregnant. A woman needs to comprehend her options before she can decide if a hysterectomy is the best solution for her particular medical condition."" "
Female hormones,"'A hormone is a chemical substance secreted by an organ that travels by way of body fluids to affect another tissue in the body. In essence, hormones are ""chemical messengers."" Many hormones, especially those affecting growth and behavior, are present in both men and women. Nevertheless, women are more often portrayed as being under the influence of their hormones, as being subject to hormonal ""tides"" or ""storms.""''Some hormones are of special concern to women. The sex hormones produced by the ovaries are not only involved in the growth, maintenance, and the repair of the reproductive tissues, but they also influence other body tissues, including bone mass. This can be a problem for women who strive for lower body fat (for example, athletes, models, and ballerinas) and for women with eating disorders. Women with low body fat often do not produce sufficient amounts of sex hormones. They can, therefore, experience a cessation of ''menstruation'', ''osteoporosis'' (thinning of the bones), ''fractures'', and other conditions similar to those faced by many post- menopausal women.''After ''menopause'"", a woman's body produces less of the female hormones\xa0estrogen and ""'progesterone''. Symptoms of the menopausal transition can be troubling for some women. Many doctors prescribe ''hormone therapy'' (HT, ''HRT'') to ease menopausal symptoms, although this therapy should be administered for a short duration due to increases in the frequency of ''heart attacks'' and a slightly increased risk of ''breast cancer''.''Hormonal problems for women are not confined to those involving the sex hormones. For example, ''thyroid disease'',\xa0including\xa0''hyperthyroidism'' (over-activity of the thyroid gland) and ''hypothyroidism'' (under- activity of the thyroid), is far more common in women than in men.' "
Diseases more common in women,"'Many diseases affect both women and men, but some diseases occur at a higher frequency in women. For example, ''gallstones'' are three to four times more common in women than in men. About 18% of women in the U.S. suffer ''migraine'' ''headaches''\xa0compared with only 6% of men, a ratio of three to one females to males. Other conditions seen more often in\xa0women than in men include ''irritable bowel syndrome'' and ''urinary tract infections''.''Urinary tract infections'', including ''cystitis'' (''bladder infection'') and ''kidney infection'' (''pyelonephritis'') are significant health problems that more frequently affect women. ''Kidney disease'' is a leading cause of ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). And, after age 50, ''hypertension'' is more common in women than in men.''Also more common in women than men are the autoimmune disorders (for example, ''multiple sclerosis'"", Sjögren's syndrome, and ""'lupus'""). In these diseases, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. Autoimmune disorders afflict at least 12 million Americans and 3/4 of them are women. One autoimmune disorder, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', affects approximately 1.3 million Americans, with 2/3 of the sufferers being women.''Osteoporosis'', a condition in which ''bone density'' decreases, occurs in both men and women. Overall, however, it is more of a major health concern for women. Some studies have reported that as many as one of every two women over 50 will suffer a ''fracture'' related to ''osteoporosis'"" during her lifetime. By age 65, some women have lost half of their skeletal mass. A woman's doctor can assess her bone density and make recommendations as to how to prevent further bone loss."" "
Cancer in women,"'Certain ''cancers'' are of specific concern to women. These include not only ''cancer'' of the female organs, such as the breast, cervix, womb (uterus), and ovary; but also\xa0of the pancreas, large bowel (''colorectal cancer''), and lung.''Breast cancer'' is the second leading cause of ''cancer'' deaths among women. In the U.S., a woman has a 12.4% chance of developing ''breast cancer'' in her lifetime. Research studies show that the smaller the breast cancer is when it is detected, the greater the chance of survival. Currently, ''mammography'' and breast examinations serve as the recommended screening tests for breast cancer. The discovery of ''inherited'' gene mutations permits the identification of at least some women at increased risk for developing breast cancer.''Cancer involving the ovaries is also referred to as ''ovarian cancer''. Because ''ovarian cancer'' is very difficult to detect in its early stages, it is often referred to as the ""silent killer."" Although ''ovarian cancer'"" can occur at any age, a woman's risk gradually increases over time, and it is significantly higher if there is a history of ovarian cancer in the family. One in every 70 females in the U.S. develops ovarian cancer.""'Colorectal cancer'' is cancer of the ''large intestine''. Most cases of ''colorectal'' cancer occur in people over 50 years of age. A woman with a history of ''cancer of the breast'', uterus, or ovary has an increased risk for colorectal cancer. Regular screening is recommended for all women over 50 years of age. Research studies show that eating a ''diet'' rich in fruits and vegetables, as well as supplementing the ''diet'"" with antioxidants may help reduce a woman's risk of developing not only colorectal cancer, but a number of other cancers as well.""'Lung cancer'' is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. As ''smoking'' is the primary cause of ''lung cancer'', it should be obvious that abstinence from smoking is a significant way to avoid this dreaded disease. ''Smoking cessation'' is essential in minimizing the damage already caused by smoking and optimizing long-term health.' "
Women's cosmetic concerns,"'To many women, ""cosmetic"" means a make-up preparation for external use, such as lipstick or eye-shadow. ""Cosmetic"" can also mean a medical procedure done to correct defects or for the sake of appearance. It is probably an underestimate that more than 600,000 cosmetic procedures are performed in the U.S. each year. The variety of procedures and the number of women undergoing ''cosmetic surgery'' is continuing to increase.''There are very few areas of the body for which a cosmetic procedure has not been developed. There are processes to improve the texture and tone of skin such as ''dermabrasion'' and chemical peels. Collagen and ''Botox injections'' can modify unwanted ''wrinkles'' and creases. ''Birthmarks'', ''moles'', and ''varicose veins'' can be treated with a variety of techniques. Lasers can eliminate unwanted hair, whereas lack of hair (''baldness'' or ''alopecia'') can often be remedied with drugs or surgical implants.''Liposuction'' is the removal of fat under the skin. Body contouring to reshape or ""sculpt"" the body can be done using ultrasonic and tumescent liposuction techniques. Various ""lifts"" and ''plastic surgery'' remove skin and fat and reposition skin and tissue.''Millions of women have undergone ''breast augmentation'' or reduction over the years. These procedures remain both popular and controversial. ''Breast reconstruction'', especially following breast cancer, is usually viewed in a different light. Because all of these cosmetic procedures are also medical in nature, it is important that a woman understand their risks and benefits.' "
Menstruation,"'For about 40 years of her life, a woman experiences a normal phenomenon called the ''menstrual cycle''. Regular loss of blood and tissue from normal sloughing of the inner lining of the uterus (menstruation) occurs every 26 to 35 days (more or less monthly) in every normal non-pregnant woman prior to ''menopause''. Each monthly cycle can be divided into a follicular phase (an egg develops), ''ovulation'' (egg release) at mid-month, and a luteal phase (during which the uterine lining readies itself to receive a fertilized egg). If the egg is not fertilized, the uterine lining is shed, and a woman has her ''menstrual period''. Then, the entire sequence of events is repeated.''Most women do not have difficulties during the first half of their menstrual cycle, but once the egg has been released, there may be problems such as ''pelvic pain''. During the second half of the cycle, a woman may experience ''premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS'') and she may have ''menstrual cramps'' at the onset of her menstrual flow.''Approximately 70%-90% of women suffer from ''premenstrual syndrome''. ''PMS symptoms'' include irritability, nervousness, ''cramps'', ''bloating'', and ''headaches''. A particularly severe condition, ''premenstrual dysphoric disorder'' (''PMDD''), is even more troublesome than ''PMS''.'""Every step of a woman's menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. The production of these hormones is dependent on the general good health of the woman. The loss of too much body weight can result in the cessation of menstruation. There are a number of disorders marked either by absent periods or by periods that are too long, heavy, irregular, or painful. Underlying conditions, which may include ""'polycystic ovary syndrome'' and ''endometriosis'', need to be medically evaluated.''Ironically, there is a medical condition in which affected women benefit from menstruation. The disease is ''hemochromatosis'', which is characterized by too much iron in the blood. Menstruating women with ''hemochromatosis'' can lose enough blood during their menstrual periods that they may not need further treatment to remove the excess iron.'  "
Sexuality,"""Sexuality deals with a woman's sexual attitudes and practices. During her lifetime, a woman goes through many changes, not only in her body, but perhaps also in attitude and lifestyle.""""The sex hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, have a profound influence on a woman's sex life. Women also produce testosterone, as it is required for sexual arousal. In humans, the sexual impulse is not tied to reproduction, and women will engage in sexual activity even when they are not ""'fertile''.''Little is known about what facilitates or inhibits feminine sexual arousal. It is estimated that 50 million American women have difficulty with sexual arousal. Problems include low sexual desire, sexual aversion, difficulty with sexual arousal (like ''impotence'' in men) and ''pain'' during intercourse (dyspareunia).''Physical ''exercise'' may increase sexual arousal whereas chronic illness, ''arthritis'', cancer, ''diabetes'', cardiovascular disease, ''mental illness'', and\xa0''depression'' can inhibit sexual arousal. Alcohol and certain drugs such as tranquilizers can also inhibit the sexual response.''Following the success of ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra'') and other male ''impotence'' drugs, considerable research is now being conducted on drugs that improve blood flow to the vagina and the vaginal region which may improve female sexual arousal.' "
"Fertility, birth control, and infertility","'Fertility'' is the ability to bear children. Most women wish to restrict when and by whom they conceive. In the U.S., 94% of women age 15-44 use some method of ''birth control'' in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies.''Ideally, the use of ''birth control'' is the responsibility of both sexual partners. The choice of a birth control method should be a joint decision. In reality, the ultimate responsibility for birth control more often than not rests with the woman. Her choices include ''oral contraceptives'', ''spermicides'', diaphragms, cervical caps, rhythm methods, ''contraceptive'' implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). In general, longer-term protection (for example, oral contraceptives, implants, or IUDs) not requiring last minute decision-making provides better protection (a 0.1-3% ""failure rate"") than methods (for example, ''condoms'' or spermicides) used just before intercourse (5%-15% ""failure rate"").''Every woman who wishes to use birth control needs to decide which method is best suited for her. She must also determine which methods offer her the most protection against ''sexually transmitted diseases'', including ''HIV'' infection and ''AIDS''.''The opposite of fertility is, of course, ''infertility'' or the inability to bear children. ''Infertility'' affects one in five couples in the U.S. Female infertility tends to become more of a problem as a woman ages, especially after age 35. Regardless of age, a woman and her partner need to be medically evaluated by an infertility specialist to determine the cause for the infertility and, if possible, to correct the problem. The options currently available to ''infertile'' couples have been expanded. These include the advanced reproductive technologies, such as ''in vitro fertilization'' (''IVF''), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), utilization of donor eggs and/or sperm, and maternal surrogacy. Adoption, as always, is another option for childless couples.' "
Pregnancy,"'Optimally, all pregnancies would be planned well before ''conception''. In the United States, it is currently estimated that 40% of all pregnancies are unplanned. This means that many women become pregnant before they are prepared.''The ideal time to start learning about pregnancy is not when a woman is already pregnant. In order for a future mother to maximize her chances of having a healthy baby, she should attempt to learn about what she can do before she conceives and what to do after she becomes pregnant.''For a woman, ''pregnancy planning'' means learning everything she can about how her own health and that of her baby can be optimized. For example:'  The expectant mother needs to know about those diseases that can complicate a pregnancy by their existence or their treatment, such as depression, epilepsy, thyroid disease, asthma, lupus, or diabetes. If the mother smokes, she must stop, because women who smoke have a higher incidence of miscarriages and stillbirths. She needs to be aware of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. She must also know which drugs and medications she can continue to use safely and which ones she must avoid. There are also a number of prenatal tests that can monitor the health and development of her baby. Finally, she needs to plan ahead for the labor and delivery. Although pregnancy itself lasts only nine months, it is a period of time in which the maintenance of a woman's health is especially critical."
Motherhood,"""A woman who has children devotes a large proportion of her life to motherhood. Although a woman's fertility is limited roughly to a 40 year period, her maternal responsibilities may last considerably longer -- 60 years or so. Most mothers never cease being concerned about the health and welfare of their children (and grandchildren), no matter what their ages. In other words, a mother is a mother forever.""'During the time of motherhood, a woman is responsible not only for the maintenance of her own health, but also that of her family. Roughly one-third of all children in this country live apart from their fathers, which means that society still relies on mothers to protect and nurture their children.' "
Menopause,"""The term menopause is used to describe an event or a period of time in a woman's life. In some contexts, it is used to designate a period of a number of years, typically the time when a woman is in her 40's through the decade of her 50's and beyond. Strictly speaking, a woman is said to have experienced menopause when she has had 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. On average, menopause occurs around 51 years of age. The premenopausal process, however, usually begins in the early 40's. Diminishing sex hormone levels can be measured in a woman as early as her mid-30's.""'""Menopausal"" women represent a major component of the population. An estimated 50 million women in the US have reached menopause. Most women can expect to spend around 1/3 of their lives after menopause has occurred.''Menopause has often been referred to as ""the ''change of life''"" because it is a time in a woman\'s life when regular menstruation stops and she can no longer conceive. ''Symptoms of menopause'' may include:'""Until the 1950's, society's attitude was that menopause is a woman's fate and she should simply accept her destiny. Now there are many medical strategies to cope with the symptoms of menopause. Women are encouraged to think of menopause not as a cataclysmic event in life, but merely as a time of transition.""   hot flashes, mood swings, vaginal dryness, diminished sexual desire, forgetfulness, trouble sleeping, and urinary incontinence."
The mature woman - post menopause,"""Before the 20th century, the average woman didn't live long enough to worry about the quality of her life after cessation of menses. Now, most women live for several decades beyond menopause.""'This is not necessarily good news. Almost half of U.S. women over age 75 are living alone in relative social isolation. Most residents in ''nursing'' homes are women. Not only does the mature woman often have to deal with ''osteoporosis'', cancer, and heart disease, but she is also confronted with other health problems including ''hearing loss'', diminished vison, ''incontinence'', arthritis, ''insomnia'', ''memory loss'', and sexual dysfunction.''The problems of a sedentary, isolated life style can be compounded by poor diet, smoking, and alcohol or\xa0''drug abuse''. Studies show that it is never too late to benefit from an improved diet, moderate exercise, cessation of ''cigarette smoking'' and drug usage, and decreasing alcohol consumption.''Disease, rather than normal ''aging'"", usually accounts for loss of function in the mature woman. Nothing can be done to prevent the passage of years, but a great deal can be accomplished during a woman's life to prevent and treat the diseases that keep her from maintaining her best possible state of health."" "
What is a pelvic exam?,"""A pelvic exam is an examination of a woman's genital system. A pelvic exam examines organs including the vulva, vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes; the bladder and rectum are also usually included in the exam. A pelvic exam involves visual examination of the external genitalia and an internal visual exam of the vaginal walls and cervix using a speculum to open the vaginal canal. It also involves palpation, or examination by feeling the size and shape of the pelvic organs."" "
Why is a pelvic exam performed?,"'A pelvic exam may be performed as part of a regular checkup (or wellness visit) or can be done to investigate symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, unusual ''vaginal discharge'', or ''pain''. Pelvic exams are also done during ''pregnancy'' check-ups. Pelvic exams are necessary for ''cervical cancer'' screenings, in which a sample of cells from the uterine opening (cervix) are taken for microscopic examination (known as the ''Pap smear'' or ''Pap test'').' "
What conditions can be evaluated with a pelvic exam?,"'A pelvic exam can be useful in the evaluation and diagnosis of multiple conditions. ''Some examples include:'  sexually-transmitted infections, such 
as gonorrhea,
	syphilis, 
	Trichomonas, 
	human papillomavirus, and 
	Chlamydia 
bacterial vaginosis yeast infections urinary tract infections abnormal uterine bleeding fibroid tumors ovarian cysts  infertility polycystic ovary syndrome rectal bleeding endometriosis tumors of the genital organs 
genital warts pregnancy ectopic pregnancy"
How is a pelvic exam performed?,"""There is no special preparation needed for a pelvic exam. A pelvic exam is performed in the doctor's office and takes only a few minutes. The woman undergoing the exam lies on an examination table, covered with a sheet. The doctor and/or nurse will help the woman get in position for the speculum examination, which involves bending the knees and placing the ""'feet'' in metal supports on the side of the exam table. The speculum is a metal or ''plastic'' device that is inserted into the vagina to allow the vaginal walls and cervix to be seen. A small sample of the cells of the cervix is taken by a brush or a small spatula for the Pap test. While there may be some discomfort, a pelvic exam should not be painful. ''A bimanual exam is another component of the pelvic exam. This involves placement of two fingers inside the vaginal canal and pressing on the lower abdomen with the other hand to palpate (feel) the pelvic organs. A rectal exam is also often performed at this time. The bimanual exam may reveal enlarged organs or tissue masses.' "

Diseases more common in women,"'Many diseases affect both women and men, but some diseases occur at a higher frequency in women. For example, ''gallstones'' are three to four times more common in women than in men. About 18% of women in the U.S. suffer ''migraine'' ''headaches''\xa0compared with only 6% of men, a ratio of three to one females to males. Other conditions seen more often in\xa0women than in men include ''irritable bowel syndrome'' and ''urinary tract infections''.''Urinary tract infections'', including ''cystitis'' (''bladder infection'') and ''kidney infection'' (''pyelonephritis'') are significant health problems that more frequently affect women. ''Kidney disease'' is a leading cause of ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). And, after age 50, ''hypertension'' is more common in women than in men.''Also more common in women than men are the autoimmune disorders (for example, ''multiple sclerosis'"", Sjögren's syndrome, and ""'lupus'""). In these diseases, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. Autoimmune disorders afflict at least 12 million Americans and 3/4 of them are women. One autoimmune disorder, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', affects approximately 1.3 million Americans, with 2/3 of the sufferers being women.''Osteoporosis'', a condition in which ''bone density'' decreases, occurs in both men and women. Overall, however, it is more of a major health concern for women. Some studies have reported that as many as one of every two women over 50 will suffer a ''fracture'' related to ''osteoporosis'"" during her lifetime. By age 65, some women have lost half of their skeletal mass. A woman's doctor can assess her bone density and make recommendations as to how to prevent further bone loss."" "
Cancer in women,"'Certain ''cancers'' are of specific concern to women. These include not only ''cancer'' of the female organs, such as the breast, cervix, womb (uterus), and ovary; but also\xa0of the pancreas, large bowel (''colorectal cancer''), and lung.''Breast cancer'' is the second leading cause of ''cancer'' deaths among women. In the U.S., a woman has a 12.4% chance of developing ''breast cancer'' in her lifetime. Research studies show that the smaller the breast cancer is when it is detected, the greater the chance of survival. Currently, ''mammography'' and breast examinations serve as the recommended screening tests for breast cancer. The discovery of ''inherited'' gene mutations permits the identification of at least some women at increased risk for developing breast cancer.''Cancer involving the ovaries is also referred to as ''ovarian cancer''. Because ''ovarian cancer'' is very difficult to detect in its early stages, it is often referred to as the ""silent killer."" Although ''ovarian cancer'"" can occur at any age, a woman's risk gradually increases over time, and it is significantly higher if there is a history of ovarian cancer in the family. One in every 70 females in the U.S. develops ovarian cancer.""'Colorectal cancer'' is cancer of the ''large intestine''. Most cases of ''colorectal'' cancer occur in people over 50 years of age. A woman with a history of ''cancer of the breast'', uterus, or ovary has an increased risk for colorectal cancer. Regular screening is recommended for all women over 50 years of age. Research studies show that eating a ''diet'' rich in fruits and vegetables, as well as supplementing the ''diet'"" with antioxidants may help reduce a woman's risk of developing not only colorectal cancer, but a number of other cancers as well.""'Lung cancer'' is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. As ''smoking'' is the primary cause of ''lung cancer'', it should be obvious that abstinence from smoking is a significant way to avoid this dreaded disease. ''Smoking cessation'' is essential in minimizing the damage already caused by smoking and optimizing long-term health.' "
Women's cosmetic concerns,"'To many women, ""cosmetic"" means a make-up preparation for external use, such as lipstick or eye-shadow. ""Cosmetic"" can also mean a medical procedure done to correct defects or for the sake of appearance. It is probably an underestimate that more than 600,000 cosmetic procedures are performed in the U.S. each year. The variety of procedures and the number of women undergoing ''cosmetic surgery'' is continuing to increase.''There are very few areas of the body for which a cosmetic procedure has not been developed. There are processes to improve the texture and tone of skin such as ''dermabrasion'' and chemical peels. Collagen and ''Botox injections'' can modify unwanted ''wrinkles'' and creases. ''Birthmarks'', ''moles'', and ''varicose veins'' can be treated with a variety of techniques. Lasers can eliminate unwanted hair, whereas lack of hair (''baldness'' or ''alopecia'') can often be remedied with drugs or surgical implants.''Liposuction'' is the removal of fat under the skin. Body contouring to reshape or ""sculpt"" the body can be done using ultrasonic and tumescent liposuction techniques. Various ""lifts"" and ''plastic surgery'' remove skin and fat and reposition skin and tissue.''Millions of women have undergone ''breast augmentation'' or reduction over the years. These procedures remain both popular and controversial. ''Breast reconstruction'', especially following breast cancer, is usually viewed in a different light. Because all of these cosmetic procedures are also medical in nature, it is important that a woman understand their risks and benefits.' "
Menstruation,"'For about 40 years of her life, a woman experiences a normal phenomenon called the ''menstrual cycle''. Regular loss of blood and tissue from normal sloughing of the inner lining of the uterus (menstruation) occurs every 26 to 35 days (more or less monthly) in every normal non-pregnant woman prior to ''menopause''. Each monthly cycle can be divided into a follicular phase (an egg develops), ''ovulation'' (egg release) at mid-month, and a luteal phase (during which the uterine lining readies itself to receive a fertilized egg). If the egg is not fertilized, the uterine lining is shed, and a woman has her ''menstrual period''. Then, the entire sequence of events is repeated.''Most women do not have difficulties during the first half of their menstrual cycle, but once the egg has been released, there may be problems such as ''pelvic pain''. During the second half of the cycle, a woman may experience ''premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS'') and she may have ''menstrual cramps'' at the onset of her menstrual flow.''Approximately 70%-90% of women suffer from ''premenstrual syndrome''. ''PMS symptoms'' include irritability, nervousness, ''cramps'', ''bloating'', and ''headaches''. A particularly severe condition, ''premenstrual dysphoric disorder'' (''PMDD''), is even more troublesome than ''PMS''.'""Every step of a woman's menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. The production of these hormones is dependent on the general good health of the woman. The loss of too much body weight can result in the cessation of menstruation. There are a number of disorders marked either by absent periods or by periods that are too long, heavy, irregular, or painful. Underlying conditions, which may include ""'polycystic ovary syndrome'' and ''endometriosis'', need to be medically evaluated.''Ironically, there is a medical condition in which affected women benefit from menstruation. The disease is ''hemochromatosis'', which is characterized by too much iron in the blood. Menstruating women with ''hemochromatosis'' can lose enough blood during their menstrual periods that they may not need further treatment to remove the excess iron.'  "
Sexuality,"""Sexuality deals with a woman's sexual attitudes and practices. During her lifetime, a woman goes through many changes, not only in her body, but perhaps also in attitude and lifestyle.""""The sex hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, have a profound influence on a woman's sex life. Women also produce testosterone, as it is required for sexual arousal. In humans, the sexual impulse is not tied to reproduction, and women will engage in sexual activity even when they are not ""'fertile''.''Little is known about what facilitates or inhibits feminine sexual arousal. It is estimated that 50 million American women have difficulty with sexual arousal. Problems include low sexual desire, sexual aversion, difficulty with sexual arousal (like ''impotence'' in men) and ''pain'' during intercourse (dyspareunia).''Physical ''exercise'' may increase sexual arousal whereas chronic illness, ''arthritis'', cancer, ''diabetes'', cardiovascular disease, ''mental illness'', and\xa0''depression'' can inhibit sexual arousal. Alcohol and certain drugs such as tranquilizers can also inhibit the sexual response.''Following the success of ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra'') and other male ''impotence'' drugs, considerable research is now being conducted on drugs that improve blood flow to the vagina and the vaginal region which may improve female sexual arousal.' "
"Fertility, birth control, and infertility","'Fertility'' is the ability to bear children. Most women wish to restrict when and by whom they conceive. In the U.S., 94% of women age 15-44 use some method of ''birth control'' in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies.''Ideally, the use of ''birth control'' is the responsibility of both sexual partners. The choice of a birth control method should be a joint decision. In reality, the ultimate responsibility for birth control more often than not rests with the woman. Her choices include ''oral contraceptives'', ''spermicides'', diaphragms, cervical caps, rhythm methods, ''contraceptive'' implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs). In general, longer-term protection (for example, oral contraceptives, implants, or IUDs) not requiring last minute decision-making provides better protection (a 0.1-3% ""failure rate"") than methods (for example, ''condoms'' or spermicides) used just before intercourse (5%-15% ""failure rate"").''Every woman who wishes to use birth control needs to decide which method is best suited for her. She must also determine which methods offer her the most protection against ''sexually transmitted diseases'', including ''HIV'' infection and ''AIDS''.''The opposite of fertility is, of course, ''infertility'' or the inability to bear children. ''Infertility'' affects one in five couples in the U.S. Female infertility tends to become more of a problem as a woman ages, especially after age 35. Regardless of age, a woman and her partner need to be medically evaluated by an infertility specialist to determine the cause for the infertility and, if possible, to correct the problem. The options currently available to ''infertile'' couples have been expanded. These include the advanced reproductive technologies, such as ''in vitro fertilization'' (''IVF''), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), utilization of donor eggs and/or sperm, and maternal surrogacy. Adoption, as always, is another option for childless couples.' "
Pregnancy,"'Optimally, all pregnancies would be planned well before ''conception''. In the United States, it is currently estimated that 40% of all pregnancies are unplanned. This means that many women become pregnant before they are prepared.''The ideal time to start learning about pregnancy is not when a woman is already pregnant. In order for a future mother to maximize her chances of having a healthy baby, she should attempt to learn about what she can do before she conceives and what to do after she becomes pregnant.''For a woman, ''pregnancy planning'' means learning everything she can about how her own health and that of her baby can be optimized. For example:'  The expectant mother needs to know about those diseases that can complicate a pregnancy by their existence or their treatment, such as depression, epilepsy, thyroid disease, asthma, lupus, or diabetes. If the mother smokes, she must stop, because women who smoke have a higher incidence of miscarriages and stillbirths. She needs to be aware of the dangers of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. She must also know which drugs and medications she can continue to use safely and which ones she must avoid. There are also a number of prenatal tests that can monitor the health and development of her baby. Finally, she needs to plan ahead for the labor and delivery. Although pregnancy itself lasts only nine months, it is a period of time in which the maintenance of a woman's health is especially critical."
Motherhood,"""A woman who has children devotes a large proportion of her life to motherhood. Although a woman's fertility is limited roughly to a 40 year period, her maternal responsibilities may last considerably longer -- 60 years or so. Most mothers never cease being concerned about the health and welfare of their children (and grandchildren), no matter what their ages. In other words, a mother is a mother forever.""'During the time of motherhood, a woman is responsible not only for the maintenance of her own health, but also that of her family. Roughly one-third of all children in this country live apart from their fathers, which means that society still relies on mothers to protect and nurture their children.' "
Menopause,"""The term menopause is used to describe an event or a period of time in a woman's life. In some contexts, it is used to designate a period of a number of years, typically the time when a woman is in her 40's through the decade of her 50's and beyond. Strictly speaking, a woman is said to have experienced menopause when she has had 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. On average, menopause occurs around 51 years of age. The premenopausal process, however, usually begins in the early 40's. Diminishing sex hormone levels can be measured in a woman as early as her mid-30's.""'""Menopausal"" women represent a major component of the population. An estimated 50 million women in the US have reached menopause. Most women can expect to spend around 1/3 of their lives after menopause has occurred.''Menopause has often been referred to as ""the ''change of life''"" because it is a time in a woman\'s life when regular menstruation stops and she can no longer conceive. ''Symptoms of menopause'' may include:'""Until the 1950's, society's attitude was that menopause is a woman's fate and she should simply accept her destiny. Now there are many medical strategies to cope with the symptoms of menopause. Women are encouraged to think of menopause not as a cataclysmic event in life, but merely as a time of transition.""   hot flashes, mood swings, vaginal dryness, diminished sexual desire, forgetfulness, trouble sleeping, and urinary incontinence."
The mature woman - post menopause,"""Before the 20th century, the average woman didn't live long enough to worry about the quality of her life after cessation of menses. Now, most women live for several decades beyond menopause.""'This is not necessarily good news. Almost half of U.S. women over age 75 are living alone in relative social isolation. Most residents in ''nursing'' homes are women. Not only does the mature woman often have to deal with ''osteoporosis'', cancer, and heart disease, but she is also confronted with other health problems including ''hearing loss'', diminished vison, ''incontinence'', arthritis, ''insomnia'', ''memory loss'', and sexual dysfunction.''The problems of a sedentary, isolated life style can be compounded by poor diet, smoking, and alcohol or\xa0''drug abuse''. Studies show that it is never too late to benefit from an improved diet, moderate exercise, cessation of ''cigarette smoking'' and drug usage, and decreasing alcohol consumption.''Disease, rather than normal ''aging'"", usually accounts for loss of function in the mature woman. Nothing can be done to prevent the passage of years, but a great deal can be accomplished during a woman's life to prevent and treat the diseases that keep her from maintaining her best possible state of health."" "
What are pinworms?,"'Pinworm infection is an infection of the large intestine and anal area by a small, white parasite that resembles a ""worm."" The medical name for the parasite is ''Enterobius vermicularis'', but it is commonly termed a pinworm in both the lay and medical literature. These parasites are also termed seatworms or threadworms, and the infections is medically termed enterobiasis, oxyuriasis, or helminthiasis. Pinworms and other helminthic parasitic worms (which, as a group, are termed helminths) feed off of the host animal by adsorbing nutrients from the host animal. Pinworm infections are the most common helminth infection that occurs in the US. Pinworms only infect humans. ''Dogs'', cats, or other animals cannot become infected.'  "
Who gets pinworms?,"'Pinworm is the most common parasitic worm infection in the United States, and the majority of pinworm infections worldwide occur in children, in temperate climates.''The highest rates of pinworm infection occur in school-age children. They are followed by preschoolers. Institutional settings including day care facilities often harbor multiple individuals (adults and children) with pinworm infections. Sometimes, nearly half of the children may be infected in a day care facility.''Pinworm infection often occurs in more than one family member. Adults are less likely to have pinworm infection, except for mothers of infected children. However, adult sexual partners can transfer the eggs to each other. Pinworms also may infect the vagina and urethra.' "
What are the symptoms of pinworms in children and adults?,"'If symptoms are present, they are similar in both children and adults. The signs and symptoms may include one or more of the following:''Less common symptoms include:''Many infected children and adults have few or no symptoms but, if the infection is heavy, the symptoms can be correspondingly more severe.'   Intense (pruritus) around the anus and/or vagina Discomfort in the anal and/or vaginal area Rash or skin irritation around the anus or vagina Insomnia or difficulty sleeping and/or restlessness due to irritation of skin Pinworms often can be seen on the anal skin or in the stools, sometimes detected in the vagina and may produce some vaginal discharge Abdominal pain Secondary bacterial infections from intense skin scratching Infrequent infection of the ureters and/or bladder may cause dysuria or bladder discomfort"
What do pinworms and their eggs look like (pinworm pictures)?,"'The pinworms are white, can be seen with the naked eye (no magnification) and are about the length of a staple (about 8-13 mm for female and 2-5mm for male worms). The eggs that are laid by the female worms are not visible as they are about 55 micrometers in diameter and are translucent (see Figure 1).''The male and female worms live for the most part within the rectum of humans but have a life cycle in humans that involves rectal/oral transmission (see Figure 2).''While an infected person is asleep, female pinworms leave the intestines through the anus and deposit eggs on the skin around the anus. This causes ''itching'' and irritation of the surrounding area; children especially will scratch the rectal/anal area, get eggs on their fingers or underneath their fingernails and transport the infective eggs to bedding, toys, other humans, or back to themselves. The eggs hatch into larval forms in the small intestines and then progress to the large intestine where they mature, mate, and progress to the rectal/anal area where females deposit about 10,000-15,000 eggs.' "
How do you get pinworms?,"'Pinworm infection is spread person to person. The symptoms of pinworm infection are caused by the female pinworm moving and laying her eggs, and this usually occurs at night. Within a few hours of being deposited on the skin around the anus, pinworm eggs become infective (capable of infecting another person). They can survive up to two weeks on nightclothes, bed linen, or other objects. Infection is acquired when these eggs are accidentally swallowed, usually due to inadequate hand washing by the parents and children. However, eggs on bedding or other objects that are touched while the eggs are still viable can cause infection or reinfection of people.' "
Can you get pinworms in the vagina?,"'Yes, pinworms can infect the vagina (about 20% of infected girls). Infrequently, the pinworms can go on to infect the Fallopian tubes and other structures.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat pinworms?,"""The majority of pinworm infected patients can be treated by the patient's primary care or pediatric physician. Rarely, an infectious disease specialist, parasitologist, OB/GYN, ""'gastroenterologist'' or dermatologist is consulted.' "
How is the tape test used in diagnosing pinworms?,"'If pinworms are suspected, transparent adhesive tape or a pinworm paddle (supplied by your health care professional) are applied to the anal region. The eggs (and sometimes the parasites themselves) adhere to the sticky tape or paddle and are identified by examination under a microscope. The test is sometimes referred to as ""the Tape Test.""''The test should be done as soon the affected individual wakes up in the morning (because bathing or having a bowel movement may remove most eggs and parasites). The exam may require several samples for diagnosis. Samples taken from under the fingernails may also contain eggs (since scratching of the anal area is common by affected individuals).''At night, the adult worms can sometimes be seen directly in bedclothes or around the anal area: this is another good time to detect the parasites with the transparent adhesive tape method.' "
Are there natural or home remedies that treat pinworms?,'There are many natural and/or home remedies for pinworms although there is a lack of data to support claims. Some of the many suggested remedies include the following:''The above are just a few of the remedies. Check with your doctors before using these remedies.'   Garlic Coconut (grated) Grapefruit seed extract and paste Grated carrots daily Onion juice three times per day for two days Pumpkin seeds Wormwood extract
What are treatment options and medications for pinworms?,"'Most pinworm infections are treated at home with the above medications. However, reinfection is fairly common. To both reduce the chances for reinfection and to help prevent others from getting pinworms, see the ''prevention'' section.''Pinworm infections can be cured; usually by three doses of medication, each three weeks apart. Individuals are encouraged to follow-up with their doctor to be sure treatment has been effective.'   Usually, a single tablet of mebendazole (Vermox) is used as pinworm medicine. This can sometimes be repeated a week later or, if infection persists, the medication is given again three weeks later. Some clinicians recommend a treatment protocol of a drug dose every three weeks, three times, so that the person has effective drug treatment for about nine weeks total. Vermox has been discontinued in the U.S., but stocks are still available in some pharmacies. Another effective medication is albendazole (Albenza) but it may require other medications to reduce the inflammation of the central nervous system, a side effect of the drug. Albendazole is well tolerated with minimal side effects due to minimal systemic absorption. Pyrantel pamoate (Pin-Rid, Pin-X) is available over the counter for pinworm after confirmation of the diagnosis by a licensed health care practitioner. Drugs available over the counter vary from country to country. Pyrantel is the treatment of choice for pregnant women. To treat pinworms affecting urinary and genital organs, combination therapy with oral mebendazole (Vermox) and ivermectin (Stromectol) for the worms as well as topical therapy for the eggs may be required."
What happens if pinworms aren't treated?,"'Untreated pinworms may cause or have a role in causing:''Complications may include ''endometriosis'', salpingitis, ''urethritis'', ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), vulvovaginitis, and possibly ''appendicitis''.' Diarrhea Significant malabsorption of food Weight loss Genital itching Bedwetting (enuresis) Main during urination (dysuria) Vaginal discharge which can be associated with genital skin irritation and rash"
Is it possible to prevent pinworms?,"'Good hygiene will help reduce the spread of the parasites.' Hand washing after handling bedding, diapers, underwear, and other items like child toilet seats, toys, changing tables, and other surfaces that may contain the infective pinworm eggs will also help prevent spread of the parasite. Cleaning under the fingernails and not biting the fingernails will also help reduce the chance of contacting the parasites. Change and wash clothes in hot water daily, especially underwear, to help prevent spreading the disease. Treating everyone infected in a household at the same time may help prevent recurrence and spread to others. Because the eggs remain infective for up to three weeks in a moist environment, prevention of spread and reinfection is difficult but possible."
Why is wound closure important?,"'The ability to close a skin wound is an important surgical skill learned by medical care providers. Whether a fall in the street or a scalpel made the skin injury in an operating room, the decision as to how and when to repair the damage needs to be individualized for each patient and situation.''The skin has many layers from the ''epidermis'' on the outside, to the deeper subcutaneous tissues and the dermis in between. Each of these layers has other sub-layers that help the skin perform its functions. The skin provides a barrier to the outside world and the dangers of infection, environmental hazards and chemicals, and temperature. It contains melanocytes that can darken or tan the skin while protecting the body from ultraviolet ''radiation''. It also plays an important role in temperature and fluid regulation.''Different options exist for repairing lacerated skin and providing a nice cosmetic outcome. There are two important steps that need to occur before the skin is closed.''The purpose of ''wound care'' is not simply to yield a good-looking ''scar''. All wounds will eventually heal over time, although closing the skin edges will make that healing time shorter. The primary purpose of seeking medical care from a health care professional is to get the wound properly cleaned and make certain everything is in good working order beneath the damaged skin.''When a laceration occurs, there are some reasonable ''first aid'' and home care steps to consider. Washing with tap water to clean the wound is always helpful. Studies show that plain tap water is as good as any special fluids used in hospitals for cleaning wounds. Lightly bandage the wound and elevate it if possible.''The amount of blood supplied to different parts of the body varies. A wound on the face, ''scalp'', or hand may bleed profusely while one on the shin or back may not. Bleeding will often stop with direct pressure at the bleeding site and elevation of the injured part of the body.' Exploration: A doctor will need to examine and explore most wounds need to their full depth, looking for dirt and debris that may have entered, and making certain that the anatomic structures beneath the damaged skin are intact and not injured. For example, in a hand or finger laceration, the care provider will want to make certain that the blood vessels, nerves, and tendons beneath the skin have not been cut. This is done both by physical examination of the hand and finger, evaluating their power and motion, blood supply and nerve sensation, and also by looking inside the wound, identifying the tendon and perhaps the artery and nerve bundles to make certain that they are intact. Cleaning: When the skin is broken, the outside world invades the body and may cause infection. Before closing the skin, a doctor must wash out or thoroughly irrigate a wound to prevent the occurrence of an infection. Sometimes, it's necessary to cut out a small amount of dirty tissue (a process called debridement)."
How does the health care professional assess a wound?,"""Lacerations are common injuries treated in physicians' offices, walk-in clinics, and emergency departments. The approach to the injury is often the same. The history taken by the health care provider is very important to decide whether the benefit of repairing the wound outweighs the potential risk of complications. Infection is the most common worrisome complication. The provider will want to know the circumstances of the injury.""'Physical examination is key to making certain that underlying structures are undamaged. This is especially important in the extremities where arteries, nerves, and tendons run beneath the skin. When there is damage to skin over a ''broken bone'', it is called an open ''fracture'', and often patients with such a fracture require surgery and are taken to the operating room so that the wound can be extensively cleaned to prevent ''osteomyelitis'' (an infection of the bone). This same situation may also occur if the laceration goes deep into a joint.''It may be necessary to take ''X-rays'' to look for foreign material that may be imbedded in the laceration. While metal objects are easier to see, it may also be possible to identify nonmetallic foreign objects.''A doctor has many options when it comes to repairing a wound: sutures, staples, glue, Steri-Strips, and Band-Aids. First, the wound needs to be prepared for sewing (or suturing or stitching; the words all describe the same procedure).' Where did the accident occur? Was it washing dishes in the sink, or did it occur in a farm field, cleaning dirty equipment covered in mud? When did it happen? The older the wound, the higher the potential for infection since there is more time for bacteria to invade the wound and begin the infection/inflammation process. Was it due to a fall or other trauma? Is there damage to other parts of the body? Were there unusual circumstances, like an animal bite, or did it occur underwater in a river or lake (both situations posing a high risk for infection)? One can imagine a variety of scenarios that may greatly increase the infection risk. Ideally, the injured area is exposed and cleaned with water, saline (salt water), and/or soap. A health care provider administers a local anesthetic to allow full exploration of the wound, looking for foreign objects or damage to underlying structures. Minimizing the pain in the area allows for better exploration and visualization of the underlying anatomy. A health care provider may wash or irrigate a wound a second time to try to minimize the risk of infection."
How do health care providers choose the type of closure material?,"'The purpose of repairing a wound is to provide good cosmetic results. All wounds will eventually heal by themselves; however, bringing the edges together and without tension will allow for a better result. All lacerations will leave a scar, and a good wound closure will minimize the visibility of that scar.''Since there are many layers of skin, a doctor uses layers of suture to bring those layers together. A deep wound increases the risk of infection, and if only the skin is closed, empty spaces may exist beneath the outer skin layer. Fluid can accumulate within these empty spaces, and stagnant fluid can increase the risk for infection.''For skin sutures, the hope is to cause minimal inflammation so that the scar will form nicely. When a doctor places deep sutures, that suture material gradually disintegrates or dissolves as part of the inflammatory response of the body.''The strength of the suture depends upon the thickness of the suture material. Some suture materials used to repair nerves may be so thin that the surgeon needs a microscope to see the suture and be able to sew. Some suture material is as thick as string. The thinner the suture, the less tension it can tolerate and the more stitches need to be placed closer together, to keep the wound from breaking open as it heals.''Doctors use different types of needles depending upon the situation. The two major kinds are cutting and non-cutting. The cutting needles have a diamond-shaped tip designed to ""cut"" through skin. The non-cutting needle tips are circular and designed for use on deep tissues that do not have the resistance of skin. There are different shapes of the needle curve as well to help guide the needle and the attached suture on its path.''Almost all suture material is preloaded on a needle and does not need to be hand-threaded. The care provider will specify the type of suture, the thickness, and the type of needle when planning to repair a laceration.' "
How do doctors close a wound?,"'Most frequently, the closure of choice for the skin layer repair is a single filament suture, meaning that it is not braided. This non-absorbable suture does not cause irritation and inflammation, minimizing scar formation. The two main choices are nylon and ''polypropylene'"" (Prolene). Doctors may use staples when potential scarring isn't as important. They often use staples to close scalp wounds. Often surgeons who have made a long incision on the abdomen, back, or extremity use staples to close the skin.""'If the laceration follows the crease lines of the body (lines of Langerhans) and is not under ''stress'' or stretch, Steri-Strips or butterfly Band-Aids may be considered. Dermabond or skin glue is another potential option for repairing the skin. For this option, the wound must be superficial and run along the crease lines, not be under ''stress'' or stretch, and not have blood or hair present at the wound site. If a doctor uses Steri-Strips or Dermabond, the principles of wound cleaning and exploration still are important considerations.''In some circumstances, doctors use very thin absorbable sutures to close the skin. A medical professional may use material made of polyglycolic acid (Dexon), polyglactic acid (Vicryl), poliglecaprone (Monocryl), or polydioxanone (PDS II) just beneath the epidermis (subcuticular area) to allow for good skin closure. The decision to use absorbable suture in the skin depends upon the situation and the skill and experience of the provider performing the repair.' "
How do doctors repair wounds to deep tissues?,"'If the laceration requires layered closures in which it will not be possible to remove the sutures, dissolvable suture material may be used. Polyglycolic, polyglactic acid, poliglecaprone, and polyglyconate (Maxon) may be considered. Other materials may include silk or catgut (chromic). Depending upon the type of material and the circumstances, absorbable suture may take from 3 weeks to 3 months to dissolve.' "
What actually happens when a medical professional places stitches?,"""Once a doctor decides to sew or stitch up a wound, a medical professional brings an instrument tray to the patient's side. The tray usually contains the following items:""'The care provider will need to decide the type of suture or thread required, including whether it is absorbable or non-absorbable and its thickness. (The thicker the suture, the higher its tensile strength, and the stronger it is.) Another decision is the size and type of needle; this also affects the size of needle holder required. Tinier needles need smaller instruments to guide them through tissue and skin.''The first step is to clean the wound and inject local anesthetic. Wound exploration and cleansing follows.''How a doctor closes an incision depends upon how the wound was made. A wound created due to a sharp scalpel in the operating room will need less planning for closure than one with a jagged wound edge because of a burst laceration from a fall.''The medical professional needs to bring the skin edges close together with minimal tension. The doctor grasps one side of the wound skin edge with the forceps and brings it near to the other edge. If possible, the doctor passes the needle through both skin edges and by pulling on the suture thread, brings the skin edges together. It is important that there is not too much pulling because the stitch can pull right through the skin.''The skin edges need to be everted, meaning that the undersides of the skin, the layer just below the epidermis, on each side of the laceration need to contact each other. When a health care provider ties and knots the stitch, the edges tend to relax, and the epidermis tends to lay flatter. Without eversion, the scar can cave in and potentially appear ''depressed''.''It is important that a doctor ties the knot with the right amount of tension; too loose and the wound edges separate, widening the scar, but too tight and the skin edges can strangulate and cause damage to the skin surface.''There are different types of stitches, depending upon the situation and the expertise of the care provider. Examples include the following:''Knot tying is very important. The stitch needs to be secure so that it does not unravel and fall out prematurely. The surgical knot really consists of multiple layered knots to prevent the suture from falling out. A doctor needs to tie a knot to make removal easy when the time comes. Tying the knot too tightly results in skin damage from the knot itself.''The equipment used in urgent care or the emergency department to stitch a wound is the same as that found in the operating room. Surgical sutures in the operating room are the same as those used as an outpatient. Those used inside the body for specific purposes may be of different sizes and made of different materials, depending on the tissue they are being used to repair, from arteries and nerves to muscles and bowel and everything in between.''While the surgical incision in the skin is all the patient and family can see, it is the surgical sutures located deep in the body that a doctor really needs to place precisely. Those stitches cannot fail to hold tissue together because a doctor cannot replace them without another surgical procedure.' A needle holder (to grasp the needle and suture material) Forceps (medical tweezers) to help grasp the wound edges Scissors to cut the suture. A syringe with local anesthetic Sponges Cleansing liquids Simple interrupted suture Simple running or continuous suture Purse-string suture Horizontal mattress suture Vertical mattress suture Subcuticular running suture"
When and how do medical professionals remove sutures?,"'The optimal time for suture removal depends upon both the location of the laceration and how much stress one places on the laceration. For example, a knee laceration will require the suture to remain in place longer than on the thigh, since the skin will be stressed each time the knee flexes and extends with ''walking'', sitting, and standing.''Sutures form a loop that surrounds the laceration and when pulled tight cause the wound to close. The body can start to form a scar around the suture itself, and it is important to remember this when deciding the appropriate time to remove the sutures. This scarring tends to occur within 7 to 8 days and can have an appearance resembling crosshatching or railroad tracks.''Follow-up for suture removal on the face usually occurs within 3 to 5 days, since there is such good blood supply in this region and healing occurs more quickly. The goal is to minimize scarring; therefore, the risk of the sutures causing a scar in their own right is balanced against the strength and potential ''weakness'' of the healing laceration. Elsewhere on the body, health care providers may leave sutures in for 7 to 10 days. In some circumstances, in which scarring is not an issue or if there is concern that wound is under mechanical stress (like a laceration over a joint), the sutures may be left in longer.' "
What happens to the site after suture removal?,"'After suture removal, the scar continues to mature over time. For the first 3 months, there will be a raised, red healing ridge at the laceration site. Over the next 2 to 3 months, the ridge will flatten and then will start to weather and lighten. It may take 6 to 8 months or longer before a patient can appreciate the result of the laceration repair.'  "
Are there any special considerations regarding wound repair?,"'People with ''diabetes'' or those with ''peripheral vascular disease'' may have delayed healing and increased risk of infection.''Animal bites are especially prone to infection, and the decision to repair a bite with sutures must balance the risk of infection with the benefit of a better-looking scar. Approximately 50% of dog bites, 80% of cat bites, and 100% of human bites will develop infections.''When the risk of infection is high, the health care provider may choose from different options to allow wound healing. When a health care provider cleanses and dresses a laceration but does not repair it, it will gradually heal on its own. This called healing by secondary intention. (Primary closure describes a wound that is sutured or stitched.)''Another alternative is delayed primary closure, in which a health care provider cleans and dresses a dirty or contaminated wound and then evaluates it in a few days (usually 2 or 3). If the wound is not infected, it might be possible to then suture it closed, as if it is a new injury.' "
What are wrinkles?,"'Although wrinkles can signify wisdom, or at least some level of maturity, there is no question that newly born infants also have wrinkles. The real concern that most of us have is that certain types of wrinkling are associated with the ''aging'' process. In our current ""pop"" culture, people do not view ''aging'' positively. Generally, the treatment of normal skin aging that does not result in a functional abnormality is termed ""cosmetic."" Most cosmetic procedures are not covered by health insurance.''Many products and procedures promise to reduce wrinkles. Some do little or nothing (like the products that claim they reduce ""the appearance of fine lines,"" which means that they don\'t reduce the lines themselves). Others can achieve a fair amount of success.''Although all of our skin ages, sun exposure dramatically enhances the rate at which this occurs. Changes brought on by sun damage (photoaging) include ''dry skin'' (really roughness), sagginess, skin growths like keratoses, lentigos (""''liver spots''""), and wrinkles. Just compare the skin on the face and neck of a poorly pigmented farmer to the skin of his buttocks.''Most wrinkles associated with aging appear on the parts of the body where sun exposure is greatest. These sites are the face, neck, the backs of the hands, and the tops of the forearms. Wrinkles come in two categories: fine surface lines and deep furrows related to muscular contraction. Some deep furrows are anatomical in nature and have little to do with aging.''Generally, it is only the aging wrinkles that really bother people. There are two basic approaches to the amelioration of these signs of aging: ''prevention'' and treatment.''Topical wrinkle treatments are, in general, much more effective for fine lines. Deeper creases may require more invasive techniques, such injection of fillers, local muscle ''paralysis'', or ''plastic surgery''.''There is a special form of wrinkling called ""''cellulite''"" that produces a ""cottage cheese-like"" appearance to the skin. ''Cellulite'' most commonly appears in the hips and buttocks of women and is due to fat deposition in certain anatomical areas in the dermis.' "
What causes wrinkles?,"'Factors that promote wrinkling include the following:''Some of these factors are beyond our control. The main preventive measures we can take are to minimize sun exposure and not smoke. These measures can, at best, delay wrinkles.''Sun protection'' factor ''SPF'' numbers on ''sunscreen'' labels refer to protection against UVB ''radiation'' (the ""''sunburn'' rays""). Higher SPF numbers (50) are better at protecting the skin than lower numbers. Broad-spectrum sunscreens offer protection against UVB and UVA radiation (longer-wave ultraviolet light). UVA rays are abundant in sunlight and produced by tanning salon light bulbs; they may not cause immediate ''sunburn'' but do produce aging and an increase ''skin cancer'' risk over time. (Sorry, but there is no such thing as a ""safe tan."") Sunscreens that block UVA indicate this on the label and contain ingredients such as Parsol, Mexoryl, and benzophenones.'  Smoking Degree of natural skin pigmentation (more is better) Sun and ultraviolet exposure Heredity (some families wrinkle more) The loss of subcutaneous fat on a person's body (people with more subcutaneous fat have fewer wrinkles)"
What are the best treatments to get rid of wrinkles?,"'There are several medical (topical medicines and creams) and many invasive techniques available for ameliorating wrinkled skin. They are all effective to the degree that (1) they change the nature of aging collagen, (2) they stretch the skin, (3) fill in the depressions in the skin, or (4) they paralyze muscles that cause the skin to crease. They include both medical and surgical methods:''Anyone considering any of the cosmetic procedures should be sure to consult doctors who have experience in one or several of these techniques. Patients should fully inform themselves about the risks and potential benefits of the procedure they are considering before going forward.'   Vitamin A acid (tretinoin [Retin A, Renova]): This ingredient, available by prescription, has the longest track record of success in treating aging skin and fine lines. People must use creams containing tretinoin on an ongoing basis. They may produce redness and peeling at first, but people usually can minimize discomfort by lowering the retinoid cream's concentration or applying it less often until the skin gets used to it. Alpha-hydroxy acids: These so-called ""fruit acids"" include glycolic and lactic acid. Preparations containing these fruit acids are quite safe and cause no more than mild and temporary irritation. They produce only subtle improvement though. Antioxidants: These include preparations that contain vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E, as well as beta-carotene. There is very little compelling evidence that these sorts of creams produce a significant cosmetic improvement. Ordinary moisturizers: Creams that don't contain any of the above substances can only moisturize the skin, making wrinkles look temporarily less prominent (""reduce the appearance of fine lines""). Glycolic acid peels: These superficial peels can make a very slight difference in the intensity of fine wrinkles. Deeper peels: These peels use ingredients like salicylic acid and trichloroacetic acid and penetrate somewhat deeper into the skin. Deeper peels do a better job of smoothing fine lines. The deeper the peel, however, the greater the risk of side effects such as long-lasting pigment changes (changes in the color of the skin) and scarring. Such peels may require anesthesia. Mild sedation helps ease short-term but intense discomfort. Microdermabrasion: This refers to ""sanding the skin"" with a machine containing silica or aluminum crystals; many estheticians offer this service, usually in ""packages"" of six or seven sessions. Microdermabrasion does not change skin anatomy, though it may make the face feel smoother. Cosmetic products marketed as ""home microdermabrasion"" are just mild exfoliants -- harmless but not likely to produce any meaningful change in wrinkles. Dermabrasion: This is a true surgical procedure, often performed under general anesthesia. The treating physician uses a rotating instrument to sand the skin down. Depending a great deal on the skill and experience of the operator, dermabrasion can result in excellent improvement but can also produce significant side effects, including scarring and permanent changes in skin color. Laser resurfacing: Using instruments such as the carbon dioxide and erbium lasers, physicians can achieve results similar to those of dermabrasion with greater reliability and precision. A medical professionals passes the laser several times over the area to be treated until the damage reaches the middle of the dermis, the skin's second layer. This helps stimulate the body's natural collagen synthesis (production), which plumps up sagging skin and wrinkles. Some dermatologists perform laser resurfacing under ""conscious sedation,"" in which the patient remains awake and receives intravenous medications to calm and ease pain. Doctors combine this sedation with the application of topical anesthetic creams such as EMLA, as well as injections of local anesthetics like lidocaine. Patients may need to repeat procedures to maximize improvement. Skin takes a long time to heal (weeks to months) after resurfacing. In addition, this procedure, like dermabrasion, can cause permanent pigment changes and scarring. Fractional resurfacing: Newer lasers work through a modification of traditional laser resurfacing. Treatments affect not the whole skin but instead only evenly spaced spots surrounded by undamaged skin. Healing is much faster than traditional resurfacing, with less ""downtime"" afterward. Patients may need several treatments to achieve full benefit. Non-ablative laser resurfacing: Newer lasers attempt to stimulate collagen synthesis under the skin without damaging the epidermis. Studies and clinical experience suggest that such procedures can improve fine wrinkles, though not as much as laser resurfacing. Several treatments may be necessary. These procedures are almost painless and there is little or no redness, peeling, or downtime afterward. Heat and radiofrequency: Another variation of noninvasive facial rejuvenation is to heat tissue using radiofrequency devices and infrared light sources. Techniques are still in development, but results to date suggest that such treatments are safe and can produce visible and lasting improvement, though not as much as surgical techniques like facelifts (rhytidectomy). Cosmetic surgery: Surgical facelifts, brow lifts, and similar operations can be very helpful for selected patients. Thread lift: In this procedure, a barbed, medical professionals insert a stiff thread into facial skin in the appropriate direction and the tissue is pulled to catch on the barbs, producing a lifted appearance. Whether or not the effect is sustained is controversial, but there is no doubt that in the short term there can be a modest cosmetic benefit using only a local anesthetic associated with minimal downtime. Botox: Injection of botulinum toxin, the muscle poison, can paralyze facial muscles that produce the ""frown lines"" on the forehead, fine lines around the eyes, and other wrinkles. Improvement lasts several months, and patients must have repeated injections to sustain improvement. Fillers: Medical professionals inject fillers into the skin to increase volume and flatten wrinkles and folds. In the past, the most popular filler was collagen. More recently, health care professionals use new filler substances such as hyaluronic acid (Restylane, Juvederm) and calcium hydroxylapatite (Radiesse), lactic acid (Sculptra), and autologous fat transplants because their effects can last six to nine months or even longer."
"Facts you should know about COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, Wuhan coronavirus)","   COVID-19 is a new disease caused by a newly identified and named type of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 that likely jumped from infecting only animal species to infecting humans that, in turn, developed person-to-person transmission that results in respiratory and other problems. The 2019 novel coronavirus is related to SARS and MERS coronaviruses. This is a new disease, and as more data is gathered and with ongoing research, some of the information will change as more information becomes available. Risk factors for infection with the 2019 novel coronavirus include the following:Recent travel to places where there is an outbreakClose contact with people who are diagnosed with the diseaseClose contact with anyone who has visited an outbreak zoneContact with secretions or feces from an infected personEating or handling wild animals native to China (and other countries)Touching surfaces exposed to the virus (door handles/counters)People in nursing homesObesity (BMI over 40)AsthmaType 1 and type 2 diabetesGestational diabetesOlder people (over 60-65 years old)Chronic lung disease (for example, COPD, bronchitis, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension)Serious heart conditions (for example, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease)Chronic kidney disease (for example, patients with decreased renal function, patients on dialysis)Chronic liver disease (for example, cirrhosis)Immunocompromised patients (for example, patients with cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV with a low CD4 cell countMen have a higher incidence of infections than women Recent travel to places where there is an outbreak Close contact with people who are diagnosed with the disease Close contact with anyone who has visited an outbreak zone Contact with secretions or feces from an infected person Eating or handling wild animals native to China (and other countries) Touching surfaces exposed to the virus (door handles/counters) People in nursing homes Obesity (BMI over 40) Asthma Type 1 and type 2 diabetes Gestational diabetes Older people (over 60-65 years old) Chronic lung disease (for example, COPD, bronchitis, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension) Serious heart conditions (for example, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease) Chronic kidney disease (for example, patients with decreased renal function, patients on dialysis) Chronic liver disease (for example, cirrhosis) Immunocompromised patients (for example, patients with cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV with a low CD4 cell count Men have a higher incidence of infections than women Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection from the CDC currently include the following:FeverCoughShortness of breath or difficulty breathingRepeated shaking with chillsMuscle painHeadacheSore throatNew loss of taste or loss of smell Fever Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Repeated shaking with chills Muscle pain Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or loss of smell Sometimes people infected with COVID-19 may also experience a runny or stuff nose, aches and pains, tiredness, upset stomach, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and a sore throat. There have been many reported cases where patients infected with the virus have no symptoms. The virus initially spread in an animal species (currently unidentified) and then jumped to humans where it is transferred person to person. There is no antiviral drug or vaccine to treat infected individuals. Treatment is supportive in nature, and it may be necessary for a medical professional to administer treatments in a hospital. Complications may includehigh fever,severe cough,difficulty breathing,pneumonia,organ failure, anddeath. high fever, severe cough, difficulty breathing, pneumonia, organ failure, and death. People may prevent or lower the risk of this viral infection by good hygiene, avoiding contact with infected people, social distancing, not going into an outbreak area, and by leaving an outbreak zone. There is no vaccine or recommended antiviral compounds specific for treating COVID-19."
"What is COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, Wuhan coronavirus)?","'SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA coronavirus that causes an illness called COVID-19 (note that many people still equate and interchange the disease name COVID-19 with the new official virus named SARS-CoV-2). It is a new strain of coronavirus (means ''crown'') that first caused an outbreak of serious respiratory problems in Wuhan, China. Researchers think it originated from infected animals and jumped over to infecting people in a large open seafood/animal market. Also, the virus is capable of person-to-person transmission, spreading to at least to over 150 countries in about 3 months. It is related to the SARS and MERS coronaviruses.  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020.' "
What are risk factors for COVID-19 (Wuhan coronavirus) infections?,"'Initial risk factors for the virus included close contact with someone who has recently visited China, Italy, England, Spain, and many other countries and cities experiencing this outbreak. Close contact with anyone diagnosed with the virus and coming in contact with secretions (for example, those produced by sneeze or cough) or feces from an infected person are risk factors. Some investigators suggested that no wild animals be used for food in China or elsewhere. Since those initial risk factors were presented, many others have been noted and are as follows:' Asthma Chronic kidney disease (for example, patients with decreased renal function, patients on dialysis) Chronic liver disease (for example, cirrhosis) Chronic lung disease (for example, COPD, bronchitis, emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension) Gestational diabetes Immunocompromised patients (for example, patients with cancer treatment, bone marrow or organ transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV with a low CD4 cell count) Men have a higher incidence of infections than women
 Obesity (BMI over 40) Older people (over 60-65 years of age) People in nursing homes Serious heart conditions (for example, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, congenital heart disease) Type 1 and type 2 diabetes"
What are the signs and symptoms of infection with COVID-19 (Wuhan coronavirus)?,"'COVID-19 symptoms may begin like the ''flu'' but go on to develop''\xa0Occasionally, infected individuals may also experience''COVID toes is a syndrome where young adults and children develop a reddish-purplish discoloration of the toes and may indicate COVID-19 infection even before any other symptoms develop. In addition, doctors have noted an increase of COVID-19 patients with ''strokes'"". Mount Sinai Health in New York report a seven-fold increase in young patients (all under 50) with strokes. Doctors found that patients' blood clotted abnormally fast and found many clots in the bodies in about 20%-25% of patients. Although early in this outbreak, Chinese researchers' suggestion that people who are infected but don't show symptoms (incubation period) may be ""'contagious'' actually proved to be correct. This allows the virus to spread more effectively from person to person and makes it more difficult to isolate infected patients.''As more experience with COVID-19 occurs, other additional signs and symptoms may emerge (for example, ''stroke symptoms'').' fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath (difficulty breathing) that is so serious enough to warrant hospitalization in many patients. nasal congestion or a runny nose, aches and/or muscle pains, tiredness, headache, upset stomach, belly pain, diarrhea, repeated shaking with chills, sore throat, or loss of senses of taste and smell (anosmia)."
How does COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) spread?,"'Many coronavirus types infect species of animals that occasionally (or rarely) are able to infect humans. MERS coronavirus is an example where the virus that usually only infected camels became able to infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is similar as the initially infected people frequented an open-air food market that sold fish and animals, including wild animals. Medical researchers currently do not know the animal species infected, but wild animals are a suspected source. However, the rapid spread of the virus was due to person-to-person contact that has been responsible for the wide outbreak of this infection. Close contact with someone who is infected or with their secretions (for example, cough-generated droplets) or feces is how the virus spreads.' "
What is the incubation period for COVID-19?,'Medical researchers estimate that the incubation period for a COVID-19 infection varies from 2 days to about 14 days (average about 5 days).' 
Is COVID-19 contagious? What is the contagious period for COVID-19?,"'Although this virus is contagious, the contagious period remains to be determined. Recent findings showed that it is contagious even in the incubation period when the patient shows no symptoms. The virus also survives on surfaces for different time periods adding to the incident of transmission.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose COVID-19 infections? Are accurate COVID-19 tests available?,"""In the early phases of the pandemic in the U.S., only the CDC had tests to determine if an individual is infected with the virus, so doctors must safely package blood, swabs, and other specimens and send them to the CDC. It took days to get a result. However, early tests had some accuracy problems that researchers have since resolved. In addition, the FDA has approved about 20 different suppliers of various tests of blood and/or swab samples to quickly diagnose (from about 5-15 minutes) infected or uninfected people. In general, most tests rely on detection of pieces of the viral genes (nasal swab test) or detection of virus surface structure antigens by immunoglobulins (serology blood test). Testing is now available at many sites, hospitals, and doctors' offices around the country, but availability of these tests varies in many parts of the U.S. In addition, the FDA (Pixel Covid-19 test) approved a LabCorp COVID-19 at-home testing kit for emergency use. It should be available soon."" "
What are treatment options for COVID-19 (Wuhan coronavirus) infections?,"'Unfortunately, to date, there is no antiviral drug or vaccine to treat this infection. Symptom relief and supportive care (many requiring hospital care and some need ventilator respiratory support) are the current treatment methods. However, early supportive care may reduce the disease severity. If you have been exposed to the virus, put on a mask if one is available and call your doctor. However, ''clinical trials'' for ''hydroxychloroquine'' (Plaquenil), ''chloroquine'', and remdesivir are ongoing, as well as immune serum and monoclonal antibody treatments. Because of the nature of the pandemic, some centers are using these medications although there is no full scientific support at this time. ' "
What are the complications associated with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infections?,"'Complications associated with this viral\xa0infection include' difficulty breathing (may require a breathing machine), high fever, pneumonia, severe cough, organ failure (for example, kidney failure), and death."
How can people prevent a COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection?,"'The following are the directions given by the CDC for coronavirus ''prevention'':''In addition, because of the need of hospitalization for many infected people, many governments have taken steps to limit the chances to spread infections by isolation techniques such as closing down public events and even preventing public transportation, and closing schools and work places. The U.S. and other countries have chartered planes to remove their citizens from outbreak areas in the world. In the U.S., airports are screening people arriving from high-risk areas. Many states issued orders for social distancing (keep 6 ''feet'' away from other people), meaning that all people should remain in their homes (except for essential workers) except for emergencies and getting food supplies until the COVID-19 pandemic remits.' Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, and then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Follow social distancing protocols."
What is the mortality rate for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infections?,"'This outbreak is only a few months old, so determination of the mortality rate may change as the disease outbreak continues. For example, if hospitals become unable to give supportive care to patients because of lack of hospital beds due to overcrowding, the mortality rate will likely increase. However, if the outbreak is contained quickly and the hospitals have enough beds available to treat patients, the mortality rate may decrease. However, as of Dec. 1,\xa02020, there were about 63,876,767 infected people worldwide with 1,480,516\xa0deaths, which gives COVID-19 a current mortality rate of about 2.32%. These rates will change, perhaps drastically, once widespread testing accurately calculates the true infected rates.' "
