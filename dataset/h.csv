Questions,Answer
What is the hematocrit?,"'The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of ''red blood cells''. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.' "
How is the hematocrit measured?,"'The hematocrit is typically measured from a blood sample by an automated machine that makes several other measurements of the blood at the same time. Most of these machines in fact do not directly measure the hematocrit, but instead calculate it based on the determination of the amount of ''hemoglobin'' and the average volume of the red blood cells. The hematocrit can also be determined by a manual method using a centrifuge. When a tube of blood is centrifuged, the ''red cells'' will be packed into the bottom of the tube. The proportion of red cells to the total blood volume can then be visually measured.' "
What is a normal hematocrit ranges by ages?,"'The normal ranges for hematocrit are depended on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are:''These values may vary slightly among different laboratories.' "
What does a low hematocrit mean?,"'A person who has a low hematocrit is referred to as being ''anemic''. There are many reasons for ''anemia''. Some of the more common reasons are' loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, and colon cancer), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by cancer, suppression by chemotherapy drugs, kidney failure), and abnormal hemoglobin (sickle cell anemia)."
What does a high hematocrit mean?,"'Higher than normal hematocrit levels represent abnormally elevated red blood cell counts.''Some other infrequent causes of an elevated hematocrit are' High hematocrits can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in chronic smokers. Dehydration produces a falsely high hematocrit that disappears when the proper fluid balance is restored. lung disease, certain tumors, a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera, and abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for ""blood doping"" purposes."
What is Helicobacter pylori (stomach bacteria)?,"'Helicobacter'' pylori'' (''H. pylori'' or, as it is sometimes termed, stomach bacteria) is a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium that can cause chronic inflammation of the inner lining of the stomach (gastritis) and in the duodenum (first part of the small bowel) in humans. This bacterium also is considered a common cause of ulcers worldwide; as many as 90% of people with ulcers are infected with ''H. pylori''. However, many people have these organisms residing in (colonising or mucosa-associated) their stomach and upper digestive tract and have few or no symptoms. LPS (lipopolysaccharide) is part of the ''H. pylori ''outer membrane and can be toxic when the bacteria die and lyse.'  "
How do you get H. pylori?,"'H. pylori'' bacteria may cause a stomach infection in some individuals. ''H. pylori'"" infections start with a person acquiring the bacterium from another person (via either the fecal-oral or oral-oral route). Although the majority of individuals who have these bacteria in their gastrointestinal (GI) tracts have few if any symptoms (see symptoms), most people develop stomach inflammation (gastritis) from the body's response to the bacterium itself and to a cytotoxin-associated substance termed Vac-A, a chemical that the bacterium produces.""'Researchers also suggest that stomach acid stimulates the bacterium to grow and produce the cytotoxin, and increases invasion of the lining of the stomach by the bacteria, with resulting inflammation, and ''peptic ulcer'' formation (''peptic ulcer'' disease). Other investigators have shown that these bacteria and their products cause alterations in the cells of the stomach lining that when altered are associated with stomach and other ''cancers'', although these are infrequently seen diseases.''The frequency of people infected may somehow be related to race. About 60% of Hispanics and about 54% of African Americans have detectable organisms as compared to about 20% to 29% of White Americans. In developing countries, children are very commonly infected.' "
What are the early and serious symptoms and signs of Helicobacter pylori infections?,"'Most individuals with ''Helicobacter pylori'' infections have few or no symptoms. Some may experience a few symptoms from mild gastritis episodes, for example,''Often, these symptoms simply go away. However, those individuals who have more serious infection experience signs and symptoms of stomach and duodenal ulcers or severe gastritis which include:''Other symptoms may include:''Persons with symptoms of black, ''tarry stools'' and ''fatigue'' should seek immediate medical help or go to an emergency department to be evaluated for intestinal bleeding.'   minor belching, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Abdominal pain and/or discomfort that usually does not wax and wane Nausea and vomiting sometimes with blood that is red, or the color is like coffee grounds or like vomitus Dark or tar-like stools (black color of feces due to bleeding ulcers) Fatigue Low red blood cell counts due to bleeding Full feeling after consuming a small amount of food Decreased appetite that is more constant Diarrhea Heartburn Bad breath (halitosis)"
Is H. pylori contagious?,"'Yes, ''H. pylori'' is ''contagious''. However, sometimes there is a gray area between the terms contagious and colonized. Contagious usually implies that a disease-causing agent is transferred from person to person, while colonization usually implies an agent that simply populates an organ but does not cause disease, even when transferred from person to person. The gray area occurs when many people have the agent that causes disease in some of them, but not in many others. Some microbiologists consider such organisms as adapting to their human hosts by slowly changing from infecting humans to colonizing them. Although this is a speculation, it seems to fit the ongoing situation with ''H. pylori''. However, others think the bacteria become infecting agents when ''H. pylori''’s genetic ''makeup'' is triggered by the surrounding GI environment to produce and release enough toxic chemicals to cause the GI tract to become inflamed.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat H. pylori infection?,"'Many individuals can be treated by their primary care doctors; however, some people may need specialists like infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, and possibly a surgeon to help manage and/or treat the person with ''H. pylori'' infection.' "
Is there a test to diagnose H. pylori infection?,"'Accurate and simple tests for the detection of ''H. pylori'' infection are available (''H. pylori'' infection tests). They include blood antibody tests, urea breath tests, ''stool'' antigen tests, and endoscopic biopsies.''Blood tests'' for the presence of antibodies to ''H. pylori'' can be performed easily and rapidly. However, blood antibodies can persist for years after complete eradication of ''H. pylori'' with antibiotics. Therefore, blood antibody tests (immunoglobulin G or IgG and/or IgA) may be good for diagnosing infection, but they are not good for determining if antibiotics have successfully eradicated the bacterium.''The urea breath test ''(UBT) is a safe, easy, and accurate test for the presence of ''H. pylori'' in the stomach. The breath test relies on the ability of ''H. pylori'' to break down the naturally occurring chemical, urea, into carbon dioxide, which is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated from the body in the breath. Ten to 20 minutes after swallowing a capsule containing urea labeled with either a minute amount of radioactive carbon or heavy but not radioactive carbon, a breath sample is collected and analyzed for labeled carbon dioxide. The presence of labeled carbon dioxide in the breath (a positive test) means that there is active infection. The test becomes negative (there is no radioactive carbon dioxide in the breath) shortly after eradication of the bacterium from the stomach with antibiotics. Individuals who are concerned about even minute amounts of radioactivity can be tested with urea labeled with heavy, nonradioactive carbon.''Endoscopy'' is an accurate test for diagnosing ''H. pylori'' as well as the inflammation and ulcers that it causes. For endoscopy, the doctor inserts a flexible viewing tube (endoscope) through the mouth, down the ''esophagus'', and into the stomach and duodenum. During endoscopy, small tissue samples (biopsies) from the stomach lining can be removed. A biopsy specimen is placed on a special slide containing urea (for example, CLO test slides). If the urea is broken down by ''H. pylori'' in the biopsy, there is a change in color around the biopsy on the slide. This means that there is an infection with ''H. pylori'' in the stomach. Endoscopy also allows determination of the severity of gastritis with biopsies as well as the presence of ulcers, MALT lymphoma, and ''cancer''.''Biopsies'' also may be cultured in the bacteriology laboratory for the presence of ''H. pylori''; however, this is done infrequently since other simpler tests are available.''Stool sample: A recently-developed test for ''H. pylori'' is a test in which the presence of the bacterium can be diagnosed from a sample of stool. The test uses an antibody to ''H. pylori'' to determine if ''H. pylori'' antigen is present in the stool. If it is, it means that ''H. pylori'' is infecting the stomach. Like the urea breath test, in addition to diagnosing infection with ''H. pylori'', the stool test can be used to determine if eradication has been effective soon after treatment.''In 2012, the FDA gave approval for the urea breath test to be done in children aged 3 years to 17 years old.'  "
What treatment medications cure H. pylori infections?,"'Chronic infection with ''H. pylori'' weakens the natural defenses of the lining of the stomach to the ulcerating action of acid. Medications that neutralize stomach acid (antacids), and medications that decrease the secretion of acid in the stomach (H2-blockers and ''proton pump inhibitors'' or ''PPIs'') have been used effectively for many years to treat ulcers.''Treating ''H. pylori'' with acid-reducing antacids, H2-blockers, and PPIs, however, does not eradicate ''H. pylori'' from the stomach, and ulcers frequently return promptly after these medications are discontinued. Hence, antacids, H2-blockers, or PPIs have to be taken daily for many years to prevent the return of the ulcers and the complications of ulcers such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of the stomach. Even such long-term treatments can fail.''Eradication of ''H. pylori'', however, usually prevents the return of ulcers and ulcer complications even after appropriate medications such as PPIs are stopped. Eradication of ''H. pylori'' also is important in the treatment of the rare condition known as MALT lymphoma of the stomach.''Treatment of ''H. pylori'' to prevent ''stomach cancer'' is controversial and discussed in this article.' ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), and nizatidine (Axid). omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), and esomeprazole (Nexium)."
Is H. pylori infection easy to cure?,"'H. pylori'' is difficult to eradicate (cure) from the stomach because it is capable of developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics (antibiotic-resistant ''H. pylori''). Therefore, two or more antibiotics usually are given together with a PPI and/or bismuth containing compounds to eradicate the bacterium. (Bismuth and PPIs have anti-''H. pylori'' effects.) Examples of combinations of medications that are effective are:''These combinations of medications can be expected to cure 70% to 90% of infections. However, studies have shown that resistance of ''H. pylori'' (failure of antibiotics to eradicate the bacterium) to clarithromycin is common among patients who have prior exposure to clarithromycin or other chemically similar macrolide antibiotics (such as ''erythromycin'').''Similarly, ''H. pylori'' resistance to metronidazole is common among patients who have had prior exposure to metronidazole. In these patients, doctors have to find other combinations of antibiotics to treat the ''H. pylori''. Antibiotic resistance is another reason why antibiotics should be used carefully and judiciously for the right reasons, and indiscriminate use of antibiotics for improper reasons should be discouraged.''First-line regimens for'' Helicobacter pylori'' eradication or cure are taken from the guidelines developed by the American College of Gastroenterology as follows:''*PPI = proton pump inhibitor; pcn = ''penicillin''; p.o. = orally; q.d. = daily; b.i.d. = twice daily; t.i.d. = three times daily; q.i.d. = four times daily.''A recent investigation reported that triple therapy of either ''levofloxacin'' (''Levaquin'') or ''rifabutin'' in combination with amoxicillin and esomeprazole yielded cure rates of 90% and 88.6%. The treatments lasted 10 to 12 days respectively (10 days of levofloxacin 20=50 mg b.i.d. or rifabutin 150 mg q.d. for 12 days. Amoxicillin dose was 1 gm, esomeprazole was 40 mg, both b.i.d.).''Some doctors may want to confirm eradication of ''H. pylori'' after treatment with a urea breath test or a stool antigen test, particularly if there have been serious complications of the infection such as perforation or bleeding in the stomach or duodenum. Endoscopic biopsies to determine eradication of the bacterium are not necessary, and blood tests are not good for determining eradication since it takes many months or years for the antibodies to ''H. pylori'' to decrease. The best tests for determining eradication are the breath and stool tests discussed previously. Patients who fail to eradicate ''H. pylori'' with treatment are retreated, often with a different combination of medications. Also, a meta-analysis study of patients started on low-dose aspirin showed less than 20% were tested for H. pylori; this is concerning because low-dose aspirin roughly doubles the risk factors for getting an upper GI bleed in individuals with H. pylori infection.'   a PPI, amoxicillin (Amoxil), and clarithromycin (Biaxin) a PPI, metronidazole (Flagyl), tetracycline, and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Bismuth) Standard dose of a *PPI (proton pump inhibitor) *b.i.d.

What natural treatments cure H. pylori infection?,"'There are many claims about natural treatment and cures for ''H. pylori'' infection. None of these have been scientifically proven to cure ''H. pylori'' infection, and include''Discuss all natural herbs and ''supplements'' with your doctor before taking them.''Nutritionists and health care professionals suggest avoiding spicy foods, coffee, carbonated ''drinks'', and pickled foods as these may increase the symptoms associated with the infection.' mastic gum, broccoli, matuka tea, manuka honey, coconut oil, and many others."
Does everyone have H. pylori bacteria in their stomach?,"'There is a general consensus among doctors that individuals should be treated if they are infected with ''H. pylori'"" and have ulcers. The goal of treatment is to eradicate the bacterium, heal ulcers if they are present, and prevent the ulcers' return. Patients with MALT lymphoma of the stomach also should be treated. MALT lymphoma is rare, but the ""'tumor'' often quickly regresses upon successful eradication of ''H. pylori''.''There currently is no formal recommendation to treat patients infected with ''H. pylori'' without ulcers or MALT lymphoma. Since antibiotic combinations can have side effects, and stomach cancers are infrequent in the United States, some health care professionals feel that the risks of treatment to eradicate ''H. pylori'' in patients without symptoms or ulcers may not justify the unproven benefits of treatment for the purpose of preventing ''stomach cancer''. On the other hand, ''H. pylori'' infection is known to cause atrophic gastritis (chronic inflammation of the stomach leading to atrophy of the inner lining of the stomach). Some doctors believe that atrophic gastritis can lead to cell changes (intestinal metaplasia) that can be precursors to stomach ''cancer''. Studies have also shown that eradication of ''H. pylori'' may reverse atrophic gastritis. Thus, some doctors are recommending treatment of ulcer- and symptom-free patients infected with ''H. pylori''.''Many physicians believe that ''dyspepsia'' (non-ulcer symptoms associated with meals) may be associated with infection with ''H. pylori''. Although it is not clear if ''H. pylori'' causes the dyspepsia, many doctors will test patients with dyspepsia for infection with ''H. pylori'' and treat them if infection is present.''Scientists studying the genetics of ''H. pylori'' have found different ''strains'' (types) of the bacterium. Some strains of ''H. pylori'' appear to be more prone to cause ulcers and stomach cancer. Meta-analysis of ''H. pylori'' eradication treatment seems to reduce ''gastric cancer'' risk. Further research in this area may help doctors to intelligently select those patients who need treatment. Vaccination against ''H. pylori'' is unlikely to be available in the near future.' "
Can you prevent H. pylori infections?,"'With at least 50% of the world population having detectable ''H. pylori'' in their stomachs, it seems likely that with no vaccine available, it will be very difficult or impossible for people to have no exposure to these bacteria. The chance of the organisms causing symptomatic infection is low, but certainly not absent. Currently, suggestions have been made to prevent ulcers, but the effectiveness of these recommendations are unknown. The following is a list of recommendations to help prevent ulcers:''Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent either the infection or colonization of the stomach by ''H pylori''. However, research is ongoing, and the NIH is funding vaccine studies in conjunction with vaccine makers (For example, Helicovax to prevent ''H. pylori'' colonization of human GI tracts by EpiVax, Inc.). Moreover, some nutritionists suggest that a ''diet'' high in fruits and vegetables, and low in ''sugar'' may help reduce or stop ''H. pylori'' infection. In many individuals, the immune response to infection is ineffective and leads to life-long infection.' Reduce or stop the intake of alcohol. Stop smoking. For pain control, use acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) instead of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Avoid caffeine in coffee and many ""power"" drinks. Check for GI symptoms and treat immediately during or after radiation therapy. Identify and reduce or avoid stress. Wash hands with uncontaminated water to avoid contracting the bacterium. If infected with H. pylori, antimicrobial treatment may prevent ulcer formation and extension of disease."
What is the prognosis for H. pylori infections? What if it is not  treated?,"'Many infections are mild and produce few, if any, symptoms. The prognosis of these infections is excellent. Patients with more serious symptoms who are treated appropriately usually have a good prognosis although up to 20% may have reoccurrence of the infection. Those with ulcers who have effective eradication of their infection heal their ulcers well (with usually minor scarring in the tissue).''Untreated and severe infections have a more guarded prognosis because extensive damage can occur with bleeding, scarring, anemia, and ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure'') occurring. Some patients with these symptoms will die if not treated quickly. About 1% of people with the infection go on to develop gastric cancer. Researchers have suggested that it may be possible to use special inhibitors that will block the bacteria from adhering to the lining of the stomach gastric tissue.' "
What are H. pylori symptoms?,"'Helicobacter pylori''\xa0or\xa0''H. pylori''\xa0infection occurs when H. pylori bacteria infects the lining of the stomach. H. pylori are responsible for 80% of gastric ulcers and 90% of duodenal ulcers. H. pylori infection can continue throughout life without any symptoms. If H. pylori infection persists, it can cause:' Longstanding redness and swelling in the inner lining of the stomach Tissue damage Peptic ulcers Gastric cancer Burning sensation in the abdomen Nausea Loss of appetite Bloating Unintentional weight loss Bloating Frequent burping"
Natural treatments,"'Natural remedies have been effective in inhibiting the growth of H. pylori; however, they cannot completely eradicate the presence of H. pylori. Before trying out natural remedies, it is better to consult your doctor for their appropriateness. Natural remedies shouldn’t replace medical therapy and should be tried as alternative therapy only. ''Some of the natural remedies to treat H. pylori infection include:''Most of the strains of H. pylori were destroyed using 20% strength of the honey. Honey isn’t a substitute for the standard therapy and shouldn’t be taken alone. Raw honey and Manuka honey may have the most antibacterial properties.''Also, some studies have shown that white vinegar and ''cranberry'' juice may be useful in reducing H. pylori infection. But these aren’t a substitute for the standard treatment regimen.''The standard treatment of H. pylori infection includes a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medications. Acid-reducing medications include:' Green tea: It has proven to be effective in inhibiting the growth of H. pylori. Catechins present in the green tea are antioxidants that have antibacterial properties. Green tea consumed regularly prevents the inflammation of the stomach. Green tea, when consumed during infection, helps in reducing the severity of gastritis as well as the bacterial load. Garlic: Garlic, Allium sativum, has therapeutic properties that may help treat H. pylori infection. These effects are attributable to specific oil- and water-soluble organosulfur compounds such as thiosulfinates. H. pylori-related disease has an inverse relationship between garlic consumption and the incidence of gastric cancer. Red wine: Resveratrol present in red wine has been linked with some antibacterial activity. It leads to inhibition of the growth of H. pylori. Consuming red wine has been associated with limiting the damage of the stomach’s lining. Overall, red wine has exhibited a protective effect against H. pylori infection. Olive oil: Virgin olive oil or unrefined olive oil has a considerable amount of phenolic compounds. Phenolic compounds can remain stable for hours in the gastric juices. These compounds also show strong antibacterial properties against eight strains of H. pylori bacteria, three of which are resistant to some antibiotics. Probiotics: Probiotics are live microorganisms when administered in a sufficient amount, that can produce an array of health benefits in the consumer. It maintains a balance between good bacteria and harmful bacteria. Probiotics may help in the complete eradication of H. pylori bacteria. Besides, they may also improve the H. pylori gastritis as well as a reduction in bacterial load. As antibiotics destroy the good bacteria, the consumption of probiotics may replenish this loss. Long-term consumption of probiotics may be useful in reducing the complications of H. pylori infection. Honey: Honey has been associated with antibacterial activity against H. pylori and few other bacteria. The antibacterial properties of honey can be attributed to:The osmotic effect due to its sugar contentHydrogen peroxide contentAcidityOther substances derived from the flower The osmotic effect due to its sugar content Hydrogen peroxide content Acidity Other substances derived from the flower Broccoli sprouts: Broccoli sprouts are rich in a compound known as isothiocyanate sulforaphane (SF). SF has strong antibacterial effects on H. pylori bacteria and also reduces gastric inflammation. Studies have shown that broccoli sprouts reduce the H. pylori load; however, it doesn’t completely eradicate them. It also reduces cardiovascular risk factors. Licorice root: Licorice roots have been effective in killing H. pylori bacteria. They also prevent adhesion of H. pylori to the stomach cell walls.  Phototherapy: H. pylori contain a substance that makes it susceptible to inactivation by light. Phototherapy has shown a significant reduction in bacterial count in the stomach. Its use is safe in the stomach. Proton pump inhibitors Histamine blockers Bismuth subsalicylate"
Summary,"'Hailey-Hailey disease is a genetic skin disease that causes blistering. Signs and symptoms include a painful ''rash'' and blistering in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, neck, under the breasts, and between the buttocks. Secondary ''bacterial infections'' are not uncommon. Symptoms are often worse in summer months due to heat, ''sweating'', and friction. Hailey-Hailey disease is caused by mutations in the ATP2C1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment focuses on reducing symptoms and preventing flares, and may include topical medication, laser, and other procedures.'  "
Symptoms,"'This table lists symptoms that people with this disease may have. For most diseases, symptoms will vary from person to person. People with the same disease may not have all the symptoms listed. This information comes from a database called the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). The HPO collects information on symptoms that have been described in medical resources. The HPO is updated regularly.' "
Inheritance,"'Hailey-Hailey disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having only one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the disease. Some people with Hailey-Hailey disease inherit the disease from a parent with the disease. Other cases are due to a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no family history of the disease. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene.' "
Diagnosis,"'The diagnosis of Hailey-Hailey disease usually is made based on symptoms and family history. As it can be mistaken for other blistering ''skin conditions'', a ''skin biopsy'' might be needed. Genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis, but is not required. ATP2C1 is the only gene known to be associated with Hailey-Hailey disease. Genetic testing for at-risk relatives and ''prenatal'' testing are also possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known.' "
Treatment,"'There is no specific treatment for Hailey-Hailey disease and management generally focuses on the specific symptoms and severity in each person.''People with Hailey-Hailey disease are encouraged to avoid ""triggers"" such as ''sunburn'', sweating, and friction, and to keep the affected areas dry. ''Sunscreen'', loose clothing, moisturizing creams, and avoiding excessive heat may help prevent outbreaks. Trying to prevent bacterial, viral, and ''fungal infections'' in the affected areas is also important, and ''drugs'' used to treat or prevent these infections are commonly used.''Topical medications (such as mild ''corticosteroid'' creams and topical antibiotics) may improve symptoms in milder forms. Cool compresses and dressings may also help. More severe cases may require systemic antibiotics (especially ''erythromycin'' and ''tetracycline'') and/or stronger corticosteroid creams. Topical ''tacrolimus ointment'' can be used to control the disease, even without the use of ''topical corticosteroids''.''When the disease does not improve with these treatments and it is widespread, additional treatment options may include:''Botulinum toxin, CO''2'' ablation laser, and dermabrasion are the most studied and have shown to be effective treatments. Some reports show that low-dose botulinum toxin type A injections should be given first in hard-to-treat cases because it is well-tolerated, effective, and has few or mild negative side effects.''Find a Specialist If you need medical advice, you can look for doctors or other healthcare professionals who have experience with this disease. You may find these specialists through advocacy organizations, ''clinical trials'', or articles published in medical journals. You may also want to contact a university or tertiary medical center in your area, because these centers tend to see more complex cases and have the latest technology and treatments.'""If you can't find a specialist in your local area, try contacting national or international specialists. They may be able to refer you to someone they know through conferences or research efforts. Some specialists may be willing to consult with you or your local doctors over the phone or by email if you can't travel to them for care.""'To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.'

What are causes and risk factors for hair loss?,"'Because there are many types of hair loss, finding the cause can be challenging. This review will cover the most common causes of hair loss occurring on normal unscarred scalp skin. The medical term for hair loss is alopecia.''Most hair loss is not associated with systemic or internal disease, nor is poor ''diet'' a frequent factor. Hair may simply thin as a result of predetermined genetic factors and the overall ''aging'' process. Many men and women may notice mild physiologic thinning of hair starting in their 30s and 40s. Life vicissitudes, including illness, emotional ''trauma'', protein deprivation (during strict ''dieting''), and hormonal changes like those in ''pregnancy'', ''puberty'', and ''menopause'' may cause hair loss.''Several health conditions, including thyroid disease, ''iron deficiency anemia'', and secondary ''syphilis'', can cause hair loss. While ''thyroid blood tests'' and other lab tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), on people who have ordinary hair loss are usually normal, it is important to exclude treatable causes of hair loss.' "
What types of doctors treat hair loss?,"'A family physician, internist, or gynecologist can perform a basic health screening. Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in problems of skin, hair, and nails and may provide more advanced diagnosis and treatment of hair thinning and loss. Sometimes a scalp biopsy may be necessary.''Although many medications list ""hair loss"" among their potential side effects, most ''drugs'' are not likely to induce hair loss. On the other hand, ''cancer'' treatment (for example, chemotherapy or ''radiation therapy'') and immunosuppressive medications commonly produce hair loss. Complete hair loss after chemotherapy usually regrows after six to 12 months.' "
How do physicians classify hair loss?,"'There are numerous ways to categorize hair loss. One must first examine the scalp to determine if the hair loss is due to the physical destruction and loss of hair follicles (scarring or cicatricial alopecia). If the scalp appears perfectly normal with plenty of empty hair follicles, this is called non-scarring hair loss. On the other hand, cicatricial alopecia permanently destroys the follicles. Non-scarring hair loss also happens in situations where there is physical or chemical damage to the hair shaft, resulting in breakage. Occasionally, it may be necessary to do a biopsy of the scalp to distinguish these conditions. Sometimes, a physician may pull a hair to examine the appearance of the hair shaft as well as the percentage of growing hairs (anagen phase). This article will concentrate on the non-scarring types of hair loss.''Some conditions produce small areas of hair loss, while others affect large areas of the scalp. Common causes of patchy hair loss are''Some common causes of diffuse hair loss are'   alopecia areata (small circular or coin size bald patches on the scalp that usually grow back within months), traction alopecia (thinning from tight braids or ponytails), trichotillomania (the habit of twisting or pulling hair out), tinea capitis (fungal infection), and secondary syphilis. pattern alopecia, drug-induced alopecia, protein malnutrition, and systemic disease-induced alopecia (cancer, endocrine disease, and telogen effluvium)."
What is alopecia areata?,"""A common skin condition, alopecia areata usually starts as a single quarter-sized circle of perfectly smooth bald skin. These patches usually regrow in three to six months without treatment. Sometimes, white hair temporarily regrows and then becomes dark. The most extensive form is alopecia totalis, in which the entire scalp goes bald. It's important to emphasize that patients who have localized hair loss generally don't go on to lose hair all over the scalp. Alopecia areata can affect hair on other parts of the body, too (for example, the beard or eyebrows).""'Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own hair follicles. Most patients, however, do not have systemic problems and need no medical tests. While people frequently blame alopecia areata on ""''stress'',"" in fact, it may be the other way around; that is, having alopecia may cause ''stress''.''Treatments for alopecia areata include injecting small amounts of steroids like triamcinolone into affected patches to stimulate hair growth. Although localized injections may not be practical for large areas, often this is a very effective treatment in helping the hairs return sooner. Other treatments, such as oral steroids, other immunosuppressives, or ultraviolet light therapy, are available for more widespread or severe cases but may be impractical for most patients because of potential side effects or risks. In most mild cases, patients can easily cover up or comb over the affected areas. In more severe and chronic cases, some patients wear hairpieces; nowadays, some men shave their whole scalp now that this look has become fashionable. Recently, investigators have noted some beneficial results in small groups of patients with extensive alopecia areata or alopecia totalis with a JAK1/2 inhibitor, baricitinib (Olumiant). Long-term studies are under way.' "
What is traction alopecia?,"""This is a small or localized hair loss area caused by repetitive or persistent pulling or traction on hair roots. Tight braids and ponytails can pull hard enough on hairs to make them fall out. If this happens, it's best to choose hairstyles that put less tension on hair. Doing this sooner helps to avoid permanent damage."" "
What is trichotillomania?,"""This refers to the habitual pulling or twisting of one's own hair. The scalp and eyelashes are often affected. Unlike alopecia areata patches, which are perfectly smooth, hair patches in trichotillomania show broken-off hairs. Treatment is often entirely behavioral. One has to notice the behavior and then consciously stop. Severe or resistant cases may require stress counseling with a therapist or psychologist or medical treatment with a psychiatrist. Several ""'antidepressant'' or anti-''anxiety'' medications can help with this condition.' "
What is tinea capitis?,"'Tinea'' is the medical word for fungal infection, and ''capitis'' means head. ''Tinea capitis'' is fungal infection of the scalp that for the most part affects school-age children. Tinea capitis is more common in black African or African-American scalps. This condition is rare in healthy adults. Bald spots usually show broken-off hairs accompanied by a ''dermatitis''. Oral antifungals can penetrate the hair roots and cure the infection, after which hair grows back. Sharing hats or combs and brushes may transmit tinea capitis.' "
What is generalized (diffuse) hair loss?,"'This is an overall hair thinning without specific bald spots or patterns. While this type of hair loss may not be noticeable to others, often the individual will feel their hair is not as thick or full as it previously was. Common conditions in this category are' telogen effluvium (rapid shedding after childbirth, fever, or sudden weight loss); androgenetic or androgenic hair loss (""male-pattern baldness,"" ""female-pattern baldness"")."
What is telogen effluvium?,"'Under normal conditions, scalp hairs live for about three years (the anagen, or growing, phase); they then enter the telogen, or resting, phase. During the three-month telogen period, the hair root shrivels up into a small ""club,"" then the hair falls out. It is therefore normal to lose about 100 hairs every day, more of them on days when shampooing loosens the hairs that are ready to fall out. The body then replaces the hairs.'""Sometimes people who worry about losing their hair start noticing hairs on their pillow or in the sink, not realizing that they've always been there. A close look at these will usually reveal the club at the end, showing that these hairs shed normally. Normally, about 10% of scalp hairs are in the telogen phase.""'Several circumstances produce a ""''shock'' to the system"" that alters the hair growth rhythm. As a result, as much as 30%-40% of the hairs can cycle into telogen. Three months later, hairs come out in a massive shedding (effluvium), especially near the front of the scalp. These include'""None of these need be life threatening, nor does hair loss usually follow them. (Moreover, it can happen after one pregnancy, but not the next.) But when the hair falls out, it's all over the place -- covering the pillow, clogging the drain, and so forth. Paradoxically, the more dramatic the hair loss, the better the prognosis, because when the body gets back into normal rhythm, most if not all of that hair comes back; these people need no special treatment. Normal shampooing can continue, because this only loosens hairs that were going to come out anyway.""   childbirth, high fever, sudden weight loss (crash dieting), surgery, severe illness, severe emotional stress or loss."
"What is androgenetic or androgenic alopecia (""male-pattern baldness,"" ""female-pattern baldness"")?","'This type of alopecia is often attributed to genetic predisposition and family history. Androgenic alopecia appears in both men and women. The hair loss in men is often faster, earlier onset, and more extensive.''Doctors refer to common baldness as ""androgenetic alopecia"" or ""androgenic alopecia,"" which implies that a combination of hormones and heredity (genetics) is necessary to develop the condition. The exact cause of this pattern is unknown. (The male hormones involved are present in both men and women.)''Even men who never ""go bald"" thin out somewhat over the years. Unlike those with reversible telogen shedding, those with common male-pattern hair loss don\'t notice much hair coming out; they just see that it\'s not there anymore. Adolescent boys notice some receding near the temples as their hairlines change from the straight-across boys\' pattern to the more ""M-shaped"" pattern of adult men. This normal development does not mean they are losing hair.' People inherit baldness through their mother's male relatives. Actually, genes from both the mother and the father determine baldness. Looking at one's family can give someone at best an educated guess about how he or she will turn out. Studies are ongoing in this field, and current research has been inconclusive about the inheritance patterns. Longer hair puts a strain on roots. It doesn't. And hats don't choke off the circulation to the scalp to cause hair loss either. Shampooing does not accelerate balding. ""Poor circulation"" does not cause hair loss, and massaging doesn't stop it."
What treatment is there for hair loss in men?,"'There are few scientifically proven and FDA-approved treatments for hair loss. There are thousands of unproven claims and products to help with hair regrowth. Many conditioners, shampoos, ''vitamins'', and other products claim to help hair grow in some unspecified way. Nioxin has been a popular brand of shampoo for hair loss, but there is no compelling evidence showing it is any more effective than regular shampoos. These products are usually harmless but generally not scientifically proven and therefore potentially useless. To slow down hair loss, there are at least four potentially effective, basic options. These include medications like Minoxidil, and Propecia, which are for long-term use. Stopping these drugs does not seem to worsen or exacerbate the prior hair loss. The patient will simply revert to the state he would have been in had he never started treatment.'   Minoxidil (Rogaine): This topical medication is available over the counter, and no prescription is required. Men and women can use it. It works best on the crown, less on the frontal region. Minoxidil is available as a 2% solution, 4% solution, an extra-strength 5% solution, and a new foam or mousse preparation. Rogaine may grow a little hair, but it's better at holding onto what's still there. There are few side effects with Rogaine. The main problem with this treatment is the need to keep applying it once or twice daily, and most men get tired of it after a while. In addition, minoxidil tends to work less well on the front of the head, which is where baldness bothers most men. Inadvertent application to the face or neck skin can cause unwanted hair growth in those areas. Finasteride (Propecia): This medication is FDA approved for use in only men with androgenic hair loss. Finasteride is in a class of medications called 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. It helps reduce hair loss by blocking the action of natural hormones in scalp hair follicles. Propecia is a lower-dose version of a commercially available drug called Proscar that helps shrink enlarged prostates in middle-aged and older men. Women of child-bearing potential should avoid finasteride. Propecia 1 mg tablets are available by prescription and taken once daily. Propecia may grow and thicken hair to some extent for some people, but its main use is to keep (maintain) hair that's still there. Studies have shown that this medication works well in some types of hair loss, and patients should use it for about six to 12 months before full effects are determined. This medication does not ""work"" in days to weeks, and its onset of visible improvement tends to be gradual. It may be best for men who still have enough hair to retain but also can help some regrow hair. Possible but very unlikely side effects include impotence or a decreased sex drive (libido). Studies show that these side effects were possibly slightly more common than seen in the general population and are reversible when patients stop taking the drug. The cost is about $70-$100/month, and most health insurers do not reimburse for the expense. A group of topical medications called prostaglandin analogs have recently began undergoing testing for potential hair regrowth. They may be used in men and women. These drugs are not currently FDA approved for scalp hair loss. Currently, these are primarily used for eyelash enhancement. One of the new medications is called bimatoprost (Latisse). Further testing and studies are required to assess the efficacy of these products in scalp hair loss. Bimatoprost solution is sometimes used off-label for help in selected cases of hair loss. It is currently FDA approved for cosmetic eyelash enhancement. Studies have shown it can treat hypotrichosis (short or sparse) of the eyelashes by increasing their growth, including length, thickness, and darkness. This medication is also commercially available as Lumigan, which is used to treat glaucoma. It is not known exactly how this medication works in hair regrowth, but it is thought to lengthen the anagen phase (active phase) of hair growth. Interestingly, during routine medical use of Lumigan eyedrops for glaucoma patients, it was serendipitously found that eyelashes got longer and thicker in many users. This led to clinical trials and the approval of cosmetic use of Latisse for eyelashes."
What other options do people have for hair loss?,"'There are many options and alternative cosmetic treatments for hair loss. Some of these are listed here and include hair-''fiber'' powders, hairpieces, synthetic wigs, human hair wigs, hair extensions, hair weaves, laser, and surgery.'   Hair-fiber powders: Colored, powdery fiber sprinkles are commercially available and may work to camouflage balding areas. These colored sprinkles have special properties that help them attach to hair and give a fuller appearance. Toppik is one manufacturer of these products and can be found online. These cosmetic products are available without a prescription, are fairly inexpensive ($20-$40 range), and quite safe with minimal risk. Often these may be used in addition to medical treatments like Rogaine, Propecia, and hair transplants, and they are a great temporary measure to tide one over for special occasions. Hairpieces: Among the time-honored ways to add hair temporarily are hairpieces or hair weaving, in which a mesh is attached to the remaining hair and artificial or human hair of similar color and texture is woven with existing hair. Quality varies considerably with price; also, hairpieces and weaves may stretch, oxidize, and loosen. Surgery or hair transplants: Surgical hair restoration approaches include various versions of hair transplantation (taking hair from the back and putting it near the front) or scalp reduction (cutting away bald areas and stitching the rest together). Transplant procedures have improved greatly in recent years. They can produce much more attractive and natural-looking results than older methods that sometimes leave a ""checkerboard"" or hair plug look. Many transplant patients now take Propecia to maintain or keep what they've transplanted. When considering a hair transplant, check the surgeon's credentials and experience carefully. Micrografts are some of the newest techniques whereby surgeons transplant single one to two hair follicles. Hair transplants may be very expensive and time-consuming procedures ranging widely anywhere from $1,000-$20,000, depending on the number of hair grafts transplanted. Typically, 500 or more hairs may be transplanted in a session. Low level laser devices approved by the FDA are promoted for use in male pattern hair loss. These devices are used at home without a physician's prescription and vary in cost from $50 to over $1,000. They come in the form of combs, helmets, and hats. Limited studies are moderately persuasive that they stimulate hair growth. Platelet rich plasma obtained from the processed whole blood of male patients with pattern hair loss and then reinjected into their own scalp has been suggested as an adjuvant treatment. The efficacy of this form of therapy is currently under investigation."
Is hair loss in women different than men?,"'Women lose hair on an ''inherited'' (genetic) basis, too, but female pattern hair loss tends to be more diffuse, with less likelihood of the crown and frontal hairline being lost. Although some women may notice hair thinning as early as their 20s, the pace of hair loss tends to be gradual, often taking years to become obvious to others. There seems to be a normal physiologic thinning that comes with age and occurs in many women in their early to mid-30s. More women have underlying causes of hair loss than men. These include treatable conditions like ''anemia'' and thyroid disease and ''polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS'""). These conditions are diagnosed by blood tests along with a historical and physical evidence. Although a few studies have suggested that baldness may be inherited through the mother's family genes, these theories require further testing. Current studies are inconclusive. Although not indicated for female pattern balding, ""'spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') has had some success in treating this condition.''While stories about hats choking off follicles or long hair pulling on the roots may be more folklore, repeat hair trauma like tightly woven hair pulled back and consistent friction can potentially worsen or cause localized hair loss in some individuals. Individuals who pull their hair tightly back in a rubber band can develop a localized hair loss at the front of the scalp.'   Longer hair does not necessarily put a strain on roots. Shampooing does not accelerate hair loss; it just removes those that were ready to fall out anyway. Coloring, perming, and conditioning the hair do not usually cause hair loss. Burns or severe processing may produce hair fragility and breakage. Styles that pull tight may cause some loss, but hair coloring and ""chemicals"" usually don't."
What about pregnancy hair loss?,"'Pregnancy may cause many changes in the scalp hair. As the hormones fluctuate during pregnancy, a large number of women feel their hair thickens and becomes fuller. This may be related to change in the number of hairs ''cycling'' in the growth phase of hair growth, but the exact reason is unknown. Quite often, there may be a loss of hair (telogen effluvium) after delivery or a few months later which will eventually normalize.' "
What specific treatments are there for hair loss in women?,"'Female hair loss treatments include minoxidil (Rogaine), hair transplants, hair-powder fibers like Toppik, wigs, hair extensions, and weaves.' Minoxidil (Rogaine) is available over the counter and available in 2%, 4%, and 5% concentrations. It may be something of a nuisance to apply twice daily, but it has been shown to help conserve hair and may even grow some. Minoxidil tends to grow very fine small hairs wherever it is applied. It is important to avoid running the liquid onto the face or neck where it can also grow hair. It is marketed for women at the 2% concentration but may be used in higher strengths as directed by a doctor. Surgical procedures like hair transplants can be useful for some women as well as men to ""fill in"" thinned-out areas."
What vitamins are good for hair loss? Are there home remedies for hair loss?,"'A good daily multivitamin containing zinc, vitamin B, folate, iron, and calcium is a reasonable choice, although there is no good evidence that ''vitamins'' have any meaningful benefit in alopecia. Newer studies suggest that ''vitamin D'' may be somewhat helpful and worth considering. Specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies like iron or vitamin B12 may be diagnosed by blood tests and treated.''Multiple vitamins, including biotin, have been promoted for hair growth, but solid scientific studies for many of these claims are lacking. While taking biotin and other ''supplements'"" marketed for hair, skin, and nails probably won't worsen anything, it may also not necessarily help the situation. Therefore, advertised hair-regrowth ""'supplements'' should be approached with mild caution. There is only anecdotal evidence that oral or topical application ''garlic'', onion juice, saw palmetto, coconut oil, ''evening primrose oil'', apple cider vinegar, creatine, and pumpkin seed oil are of benefit for hair loss.'  "
Can itchy scalp cause hair loss?,"'Itchy scalp'' may be a symptom of a scalp disease that could produce hair loss. Causes may include ''seborrheic dermatitis'' (''dandruff'') and ''psoriasis''. Treatments may include medicated shampoos like ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''), OTC ''dandruff'' shampoos, and topical steroid creams and lotions to help decrease ''itching''.' "
What is the prognosis for hair loss?,'The prognosis for androgenic non-scarring hair loss is guarded due to the fact that there is no cure for the problem. Medications must be taken indefinitely. Other types of hair loss have a good chance of spontaneously resolving.' 
How do people prevent hair loss?,"'Hair-loss prevention depends on the underlying cause. Good hair hygiene with regular shampooing is a basic step but is probably of little benefit. Good ''nutrition'', especially adequate levels of iron and vitamin B, is helpful. Treatment of underlying medical conditions like thyroid disease, anemia, and hormonal imbalances may useful in prevention.' "
What are the different types of hair?,"""All hair is dead protein. Hair's superficial appearance depends upon its anatomical location. Fine poorly pigmented hair tends to grow on certain parts of the face like the upper cheeks and forehead. Thick darker hairs grow on the edges of the eyelids and brows, the male jaw-line, the ""'scalp'', nostrils, and pubic areas. These characteristics often change as one ages. The palms, soles, and the red portion of the lips do not have hair or hair follicles.' "
What are the pros and cons of electrolysis?,"'Electrolysis'' procedures involve threading a thin wire into a single follicle and then applying an electric current. Depending on the nature of the device, the ''hair follicle'' is destroyed either by the production of heat or sodium hydroxide. This process is painful and requires each follicle to be treated individually so that it is quite time-consuming. Multiple treatments of a follicle are often necessary to achieve permanent destruction. Pigmentation at the site of treatment is common. Since each follicle is treated individually, electrolysis of large areas is quite arduous.' "
What are the pros and cons of laser hair removal?,"'Laser light is absorbed by pigment in the hair causing the production of heat that can be used to destroy both the hair and adjacent tissues. When done correctly in the appropriate patient, only the follicular tissues are damaged resulting in local hairlessness for an extended period of time. The process may have to be repeated several times before there is any permanent result. Those with contrasting light skin color and dark hair are the easiest to treat where as those in whom there is little color difference between skin and hair can be challenging. Those with darker skin often require lasers that generate longer wavelength light. Occasionally, it may be necessary to add an exogenous pigment to the hair if the hair is naturally uncolored. Laser hair removal is relatively expensive and should only be performed by an experienced operator. Laser hair removal can be painful. Poor results are frequently due to darkening of the treated skin and actual thermal ''burns'"". There are laser and light systems (Tria, E-ONE, Silk'n, and No!No! are trade names for use-at-home devices.) available for use at home by the untrained consumer. Whether this is a safe and effective approach to hair removal remains to be seen."" "
What are the pros and cons of shaving?,"'Depilation is hair removal above the level of the pore (follicular opening). Shaving is the most popular and cheapest type of depilation, and if performed safely, it results in a satisfactory appearance. In order to minimize follicular irritation (''folliculitis''), one should move the razor in the same direction that the hairs seem to be growing and pull the razor blade over the skin smoothly and evenly for only a single pass. It is important to use a good lubricant to reduce friction between the blade and the skin. It is also important to use a very sharp blade. Electric razors seem to be somewhat less likely to produce irritation, but repeated passes can produce ''folliculitis''. Safe shaving technique does not produce perfectly smooth skin. There should be a short fragment of hair that remains, extending above the surface of the skin. Shaving must be repeated frequently. There are devices (No!No!) available for home use that ""shave"" hair by burning it close to the skin surface. This is probably no more effective than shaving.' "
What are the pros and cons of depilatory creams?,"'Depilatory creams (Nair, Veet) rely on chemical means to destroy the hair shaft by breaking disulfide bonds of the hair proteins. They require a three- to five-minute application to be effective. They produce a softer feel to the severed shaft than does shaving. Chemical depilatories may produce irritation or ''dermatitis'' in certain sensitive individuals.' "
What are the pros and cons of sugaring and waxing?,"'These are two ancient techniques used to remove hair over larger body surfaces. These methods involve applying a molten solution of ''sugar''-impregnated cloth or wax. After these solutions solidify, they are abruptly yanked away from the skin, pulling out the adherent hairs. It is necessary for the hairs to be long enough to be ""grabbed"" by the material. These types of procedures can be quite painful. If the solutions are too hot, skin ''burns'' can occur.' "
What are the pros and cons of plucking and tweezing?,'Plucking or pulling hairs out one at a time is a very effective but tedious method of depilation. This can result in sufficient inflammation to produce dark spots around plucked follicles. Permanent ''hair loss'' can ensue if plucking is performed repeatedly over long periods of time.' 
What are the pros and cons of twist-threading?,"'This is an ancient method of depilation popular in the Middle East. A skilled practitioner holds a twisted length of thread in one hand while the other end is held in the mouth or in the other hand. Then hairs are trapped in the twisted thread and pulled out. Although this can be performed by oneself, it probably is more easily accomplished by a technician. It is reasonably costly and must be repeated frequently.' "
Do any prescription medications or products stop hair growth?,"'There is a prescription medication, ''eflornithine'' cream (''Vaniqa''), that inhibits hair growth by inhibiting an enzyme in the hair follicle that is required for hair growth. This does not result in a permanent hair removal since after the medication is no long applied the enzyme reestablishes hair growth. Of note, many prescription medications for illnesses and conditions can affect the growth of hair as side effects.' "
Which hair-removal method provides the longest lasting results?,'Epilating methods are the only techniques likely to produce long-term permanent results. Those are electrolysis and laser hair treatment.' 
What are the hamstrings?,"'The hamstrings are the tendons that attach the large muscles at the back of the thigh to bone. The hamstring muscles are the large muscles that pull on these tendons. It has become common in layman\'s terminology (and by some medical personnel) to refer to the long muscles at the back of the thigh as the ""hamstrings"" or ""hamstring muscles."" Academic anatomists refer to them as the posterior thigh muscles, and more specifically as the semimembranosus, the semitendinosus, and the biceps femoris muscles. These muscles span the thigh, crossing both the hip and the knee. They originate or begin at just below the buttocks, arising from the bone on which we sit (the ischium). They connect by means of their tendons onto the upper parts of the lower leg bones (the tibia and the fibula).''The origin of the word ''hamstring'' comes from the old English ''hamm'', meaning thigh. ''String'' refers to the characteristic appearance and feel of the tendons just above the back of the knee. Although the tendons are sometimes involved in injuries, this article will refer to the ""hamstrings"" as the large muscle group at the back of the thigh because the most frequent problems involve this muscle group.' "
What is the function of the hamstrings?,"'The hamstring muscles actively bend (flex) the knee. They also act to straighten or (extend) the hip (as in the motion of moving the thigh backward). Surprisingly, these large muscles are not very active with normal ''walking'' or standing. However, they are extremely important in power activities such as ''running'', jumping, and climbing. Thus, sedentary individuals can get by with quite weak or deconditioned hamstrings, whereas athletes and very physically active individuals absolutely depend on healthy, well-conditioned hamstrings.''The power advantages of strong hamstrings have been known for a long time. In times past, a sword-wielding knight would disable an opponent by a slice across the back of the thigh. Cruel masters were known to have severed the hamstrings of domestic slaves or prisoners in order to make escape less likely. The origin of the term ''hamstrung'', meaning to have been crippled or held back, is derived from these practices.' "
"What causes hamstring injuries, and what are types of hamstring injuries?","'Hamstring injuries'' are muscle strain injuries. Hamstring injuries typically are caused by rapid acceleration activities when running or initiating running activity. Hamstring injuries are common in sports such as soccer, football, and track.''Injuries to the hamstring group of muscles can range from a minor strain to a major rupture. A minor strain is classified as a grade I tear, whereas a complete rupture, or tear, is classified as a grade III tear. Grade II tears are partial ruptures. Given the function of these muscles, it should not be surprising that grade III injuries most frequently occur in the athletically active.''Severely torn muscle causes impaired function. Grade I injuries tend to be mild in that they tend to heal fully with only minor aggravation to the injured, especially in the sedentary individual. On the other hand, in power athletes, hamstring injuries can be severe and debilitating.''Many a promising or successful athletic career has been limited or ended by such injuries. One such memorable image is that of Yankee baseball star Mickey Mantle sprawled in agony at first base, having sustained a massive grade III tear while lunging to beat out a throw.''Even common exercises, such as jumping rope, tennis, and elliptical machine walking, can lead to injury of the hamstring muscles.'  "
What are risk factors for hamstring injury?,"'Any activity that is associated with sudden acceleration when initiating or during running can lead to a hamstring injury. Common athletic activities where hamstring injuries occur include track and field events with running and sprinting, football, baseball, soccer, and tennis.' "
What are symptoms and signs of injury to the hamstring muscles?,"'Hamstring injuries usually occur with sudden lunging, running, or jumping, resulting in muscle injury. The sudden jerking pulls on the tissues of the hamstring muscle. In fact, it is commonly referred to as a ""pulled hamstring."" Oftentimes, a ""pop"" is heard or felt by the injured athlete. A variable amount of ''pain'' is experienced immediately. The athlete is usually unable to continue and oftentimes cannot even stand.''Examination of the individual with a hamstring injury reveals spasm, tightness, and tenderness. With more severe injury, swelling and a black and blue or bruised appearance will follow. In some cases, a palpable defect (detectable by touching) will be present in the muscle. Tears and ''strains'' most often occur at the middle of the back of the thigh where the muscle joins its tendon or at the origin of the hamstring at the base of the buttocks (at the ischium).'  "
What specialties of doctors treat hamstring injuries?,"'Hamstring injuries are treated by primary care physicians, including family medicine and general-medicine doctors, as well as internists. Doctors who specialize in athletic injury evaluation and treatment are orthopedic surgeons. Physiatrists also can care for hamstring injuries. Ancillary caregivers who are frequently involved in the treatment of hamstring injuries include physical therapists and ''massage'' therapists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hamstring injuries?,"'Injury to the hamstring muscle is diagnosed by the rapid onset of intense ''pain'' in the back of the mid-thigh during running or similar activity. Athletes will often instantly grab in pain at the back of the thigh, being unable to walk without ''limping''. There is often focal tenderness where there is pain that is aggravated by stretching the affected thigh. In most patients, imaging is not necessary. However, if imaging is done to more completely view the muscle, tendon, or bone involvement with the injury, ''MRI'' gives the best views, although CT and ''ultrasound'' studies have also been used.'  "
What are home remedies for hamstring injury?,"'The goal of treatment is to restore muscle function and prevent ''scar'' formation. Initially, treatment consists of rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Rest refers to avoidance of offending activities and oftentimes includes immobilization. In severe cases, crutches or splinting may be necessary. Ice, compression, and elevation all help in controlling pain and swelling. A short course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'"", Children's Advil/""'Motrin'', Medipren, Motrin, ''Nuprin'', PediaCare ''Fever'', and others), or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'', ''Anaprox'', ''Naprelan'', ''Naprosyn''), may be helpful (avoid aspirin use in children).' "
What is the treatment for hamstring injuries?,"'Most hamstring injuries heal without surgery. Rarely, when there is a complete rupture at the ischium, or when a significant piece of ischial bone is jerked away, surgery is necessary. Essentially, all other grade I-III tears are best treated without surgery.''As soon as pain permits, it is important to begin a program of stretching and range-of-motion rehabilitation exercises because prolonged immobilization and inactivity results in muscle shrinkage (atrophy) and ''scar tissue'' (fibrosis). Excessive scar tissue is incompatible with healthy muscle function. Atrophy and fibrosis are best avoided or reduced by a program of motion and stretching implemented early in the rehabilitation process.''It should be emphasized that an early rehabilitation program does not mean a quick return to the desired usual activity. Given the type of individual that usually sustains a significant hamstring injury, it is usually a difficult task to keep athletic patients off the playing field. Reinjury is extremely common and is often due to avoidable premature return to sport. Reinjury not only prolongs recovery, it also increases the risk of permanent damage. People with these injuries should be informed early in the rehabilitation program about the risks of reinjury.''After pain and swelling have been controlled and acceptable range of motion and flexibility has been attained, a gradual strengthening program should follow. After adequate strength has returned, then a gradual return to the desired activity is attempted. Full return is usually possible only after maximal flexibility and optimal strength have been obtained. Depending on the severity of injury, the entire rehabilitative process may take several months. Physical therapists can assist in guiding the ''exercise'' program.' "
Is it possible to prevent a hamstring injury?,"'There is no foolproof way to completely avoid hamstring injuries. However, the risks can be minimized by paying attention to the principles of muscle strength and flexibility. Individual flexibility should be maximized by a regular stretching program as well as a period of warm-up and stretching before the intended athletic activity.''Optimal individual hamstring strength is at least half of the strength of the ''quadriceps'' muscle (muscle of the front of the thigh). Also, there should be minimal imbalance in strength between the right and left legs (the injured hamstrings should be about 90% as strong as the uninjured hamstrings). If necessary, a weight-training program should be instituted to optimally achieve these goals.''A well-balanced ''diet'' and appropriate fluid intake are essential to avoid ''electrolyte'' imbalance and ''dehydration''. ''Dehydration'' can lead to muscle cramping, thereby increasing the chance of muscle injury. Excessive body weight increases the risk of muscle injuries in the lower extremities. Some experts have also advocated the use of nutritional ''supplements'', such as antioxidants. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts at ''prevention'' and treatment, hamstring injuries will continue to be a common problem for high-performance athletes, as well as ""weekend warriors.""'  "
What is the prognosis for hamstring injuries?,"'The outlook is generally good, but can require a period of rest by avoiding running and athletic competition. The length required for recovery varies depending on the severity of the muscle injury.' "

What happens in joint replacement surgery?,"'Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. In knee or ''hip replacement'' surgery, the artificial joint is made out of metal and ''plastic'"".  In the case of joint replacement in the hand, the new joint is most commonly composed of silicone rubber or the patient's own tissues such as a portion oftendon.""'Joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty, is very common. Each year, orthopedic surgeons perform thousands of joint replacement surgeries in the U.S.  (Most of these procedures are performed on the large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.) Joint replacement surgery in the hand is typically used in treating severe ''arthritis'' that involves the small joints of the hand.''The hips and knees receive continuous ''stress'' from ''walking'',  ''running'', sporting activity, or injury and are more commonly affected by the wearing of cartilage (''degenerative arthritis'') than the  hand joints.  However, the joints of the hand do experience ''stress'' in everyday use, and because the hand joints are smaller, these stresses are concentrated over a smaller surface area. The high ratio of stress to surface area can cause the smooth joint cartilage to wear over the years.  As the cartilage degenerates, the underlying bone becomes exposed.  When the deteriorated joint moves, bone rubs upon bone causing ''pain'', swelling, limiting motion, and frequently causing a grinding or popping sensation.  Furthermore, forms of arthritis that are caused by inflammation of the tissues lining the joint frequently affect the small joints of the hands and wrists to cause joint destruction.  Examples include ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and  ''psoriatic arthritis''.' "
"What are symptoms and signs of arthritis of the hand and 
wrist?","'The most common symptoms of arthritis of the hands include ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and swelling over the joints. The pain is usually worsened when the joint is moved.  Moreover, motion of the joint is frequently limited due to pain and joint contractures.  Symptoms can lead to difficulty with daily living activities including tying shoes, buttoning buttons, opening jars, or turning a key in a lock.''Physical signs of arthritis of the hand include changes in the appearance of the joints.  The joints most commonly affected by degenerative arthritis are those at the ends of the fingers.  Swelling and ''bumps'', or nodes, can occur at the small joints at the area of the base of the nail.  These bumps are called Heberden nodes and can become extremely painful.  The joint at the base of the thumb can also become swollen with ''bone spurs'' and cause pain and deformity.  The joint destruction also leads to severe pain when pinching the fingers together and gripping forcefully.  Joint motion limitation can also decrease the ability to grip.''Wrist arthritis can cause pain with motion of the wrist or grasping and lifting.  Wrist range of motion is frequently limited by the arthritis.  Patients typically experience relief when the wrist is stabilized by a splint.''Rheumatoid arthritis'' frequently causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the wrists, as well as the small joints in the middle and at the base of the fingers. This disease frequently causes hand deformities.  Tissue lumps called rheumatoid nodules can form over the joints of the hand and wrist.  The joints of the fingers and thumb can become deformed and contracted by the destruction of the supporting ligaments, so that grasping and pinching movements are not possible.' "
How are patients with hand joint abnormalities evaluated?,"'The diagnosis of hand joint problems typically involves evaluating symptoms, physical examination, and the x-ray appearance of the joints.  Blood testing is sometimes also helpful in the assessment process.  Joint replacement surgery becomes a treatment option when significant joint destruction and/or deformity are present.' "
What are the different surgical options?,"'Surgical options include'""The optimal surgical treatment of arthritis of the hand and wrist varies from patient to patient and is based on many factors.  These factors include the patient's age, hand dominance, employment, level of pain, functional goals, and underlying disease."" cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, including removal of bone 
spurs, fusion of the joint, and joint replacement surgery."
When is surgical cleaning of the joint the best alternative?,"'Surgical cleaning of the joint, or salvage procedure, is usually performed in cases of early ""wear and tear"" arthritis where there are painful bone spurs or, in cases of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', where there is a large amount of inflamed tissue.  Removal of bone spurs is especially helpful when the arthritis involves the joints at the ends of the fingers (distal interphalangeal or DIP joints).' "
"What is a joint fusion? When is it the best surgical 
option?","'Fusion of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically ""fusing"" the bone ends so that the two bones effectively become one solid bone.  This procedure terminates all motion at that joint and thus eliminates the pain. The benefit of fusion is pain relief and the downside is elimination of motion at the fused joint, which can hinder function. This surgical option is reserved for patients with advanced arthritis.''Joint fusion is usually the best surgical option in patients who are younger and very active. Younger patients may not be candidates for joint replacement because of the increased stress demand on the joints which accompany higher activity levels.  This increased stress demand can quickly wear out an artificial joint.' "
When is joint replacement surgery the best surgical option?,"'Joint replacement surgery in the hand is an excellent option for treating arthritis of the hand in older, low-activity patients and for those with ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Joint replacement surgery can provide pain relief, increase finger range of motion, and improve hand function.' "
"How do the surgical options vary with the different joints of 
the hands and wrists?","'Hand joint replacement surgery options differ according to the specific joint(s) involved.''1. ''DIP joint (joint closest to the fingertip)'': This joint is not a good candidate for joint replacement.  The bones are very small and do not hold the implant very well. The best treatment option for advanced arthritis at this joint is fusion.  Hand function is only minimally compromised by lack of motion at this joint after a fusion procedure, while pain is relieved.''2. ''PIP joint (second joint from the fingertip)'': Joint replacement is commonly performed in the PIP joint.  Hand function, especially power grasp, can be hindered by fusion of this joint.  The small and ring fingers are the best candidates for joint replacement as they are the most important for power grasp.  The index finger is not a good candidate for a PIP joint replacement, as it must withstand sideways forces which accompany movements such as key turning and fine manipulation of objects.  These forces cause excess stress on the joint implant and can lead to early implant breakage.''There have been numerous false (prosthetic) joints designed for PIP joint replacement, but only one has stood the test of time.  The only nonexperimental PIP joint replacement is the silicone interpositional arthroplasty.  These joints are made of silicone rubber and have a flexible hinge in the middle and stems at the ends which insert into the shaft of the bone, providing stability.  The most frequently used silicone joint implants are termed the Swanson implant and the Sutter implant.''The best results with PIP joint replacement are in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in older, lower-activity patients.''3. ''MCP joint (third joint from the fingertip)'': ''Osteoarthritis'' rarely affects the MCP joints.  The most common need for joint replacement in this joint is destruction from rheumatoid arthritis.  Silicone joint replacement of the MCP joint has been used since the 1960s and has produced excellent long-term results.''4. ''Thumb basal joint (where the thumb meets the wrist)'': This joint is exposed to very high stresses with normal activities.  Forces felt at the tip of the thumb are multiplied 12 times in their effect to the thumb base, thus predisposing this joint to wear.  Arthritis of this joint is very common, especially in women, and frequently requires joint replacement.  Attempts at silicone replacement of this joint have not been as successful as hoped due to implant failure and bone destruction.  Thus, the most common joint replacement procedure for the thumb base is done with natural material.  The procedure is termed the ligament reconstruction-tendon interposition procedure (LRTI).  This procedure uses the patient\'s own tendon to stabilize the thumb and resurface the joint.  LRTI provides stability and pain relief. Long-term results have been excellent.  This has also been called the tendon roll or ""anchovy"" procedure because the tendon used is curled to form the new joint cushion.''5. ''Wrist joint'': Most patients with wrist arthritis are best treated with surgical joint cleaning or fusion and not joint replacement.  Most wrist-joint prostheses on the market are currently investigational and for use in extremely low activity patients with ''osteoarthritis'' or rheumatoid arthritis. ''Summary''''Arthritis of the hand and wrist is a very common and complex problem with many nonsurgical and surgical treatment options.  Deciding which alternative is best can require the skills of the primary doctor, the arthritis specialist (''rheumatologist''), and/or an orthopedic surgeon.' "
Joint Replacement Surgery of the Hand At A Glance," Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. This procedure is typically employed in treating severe arthritis involving certain joints. Surgical options for treatment of arthritis of the hand include cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, fusion, and replacement surgery."
What is excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)?,"'The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis, excessive sweat or excessive sweating, produces a lot of embarrassment and unhappiness. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no apparent cause. Secondary hyperhidrosis is much less common and can be due to certain ''drugs'', a variety of serious systemic diseases, neurological disorders, facial surgery, and ''anxiety''. Of the approximately 3% of Americans who suffer from excessive sweating, 50% involve the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis). Underarm problems tend to start around ''puberty'', while palm and sole sweating may begin earlier, often during childhood. Untreated, these problems may continue throughout life.''Sweating is embarrassing, stains clothes, and may complicate business and social interactions. Excessive sweat can have serious practical consequences, like making it difficult to hold tools, grip a steering wheel, or shake hands.'  "
What is the cause of excessive sweating?,"'Otherwise healthy people with excessive sweating have primary hyperhidrosis. Heat and emotions may trigger hyperhidrosis in some, but many who suffer from hyperhidrosis perspire nearly all the time, regardless of their mood or the weather.''Secondary hyperhidrosis can be caused by medications such as ''dopamine'' agonists, ''antidepressants'', antipsychotics, ''alcohol'', and ''insulin''. Systemic disorders such as ''diabetes mellitus'', ''hyperthyroidism'', '""Parkinson's""' disease, and tumors such as ''pheochromocytoma'' and ''lymphoma'' have been associated with secondary hyperhidrosis.'  "
What signs and symptoms accompany hyperhidrosis?,"'Generally, the only sign of excessive sweating is the presence of abundant moisture in the anatomical area affected. The presence of this moisture can predispose to skin infections.''As stated above, there are a number of conditions and diseases that produce secondary hyperhidrosis. Treating the underlying condition can help relieve at least some of the excessive sweating.''The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweat.''Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating ''skin conditions''. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hyperhidrosis?,"""The diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination. If the sweating is excessive and constant, then the diagnosis is obvious. It is not unusual that one must rely on the patient's history to determine the diagnosis. Research centers measure sweat production by comparing the weight of filter paper left on the skin for a specified interval before and after sweating.""'Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating skin conditions. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
What are medical treatment options for hyperhidrosis?,"'Through a systematic evaluation of causes and triggers of excessive sweating, followed by a judicious, stepwise approach to medical treatment, many people with this annoying disorder can achieve improved quality of life. The decision on initial treatment depends upon the severity of the condition and the anatomical areas that are affected.''The approach to treating hyperhidrosis generally proceeds as follows:''When regular antiperspirants fail, as they often do, to remedy hyperhidrosis, most doctors start by recommending aluminum chloride hexahydrate (''Drysol'', various generics), a prescription-strength version of aluminum chloride. It is applied just before bedtime seven to 10 nights in a row, then roughly once a week as a maintenance medication. The aluminum salts in this preparation collect in the sweat ducts of the patient and block them. Over time, the excessive ''perspiration'"" may diminish to such an extent that no further treatment is needed. This method works reasonably well for many patients whose problem is excessive underarm sweating, but it's not satisfactory for most of those with clammy palms and sweating of the soles of the ""'feet''.''The main side effect with aluminum chloride is irritation, which can sometimes, but not always, be overcome by reducing the frequency of use or applying anti-inflammatory medications such as lotions containing hydrocortisone.'""Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago to treat excessive sweating. Its exact mechanism of action is still unclear. The procedure uses water to conduct an electric current to the skin, which combats the production of sweat. The current is applied typically for 10-20 minutes per session, initially with two to three sessions per week followed by a maintenance program of treatments at one- to three-week intervals, depending upon the patient's response. Iontophoresis treatments sound painful but in fact are not.""""Patients purchase devices for this treatment through a doctor's prescription. There are three iontophoresis devices that are registered with and cleared by the U.S. FDA; the R.A. Fischer and the Hidrex USA devices require a prescription, whereas the Drionic device is available without a prescription. They work best on palms and soles but can be adapted for use in the underarms. Medical insurers sometimes cover the cost.""'Oral anticholinergic drugs such as ''glycopyrrolate'' (''Robinul''), ''oxybutynin'', and ''propantheline'' bromide can be quite effective for this condition, but they can produce side effects like ''dry mouth'', ''insomnia'', and ''blurred vision''. The dosage should be titrated carefully.''Topical anticholinergic pads''Recently, a new topical treatment using glycopyrronium tosylate impregnated gauze pads (Qbrexza) has received approval for the treatment of axillary (armpit) hyperhidrosis.''Botulinum toxin (Botox), a muscle poison much in the news as a cosmetic treatment for ''wrinkles'', has actually been used in many areas of medicine for some time, such as in the treatment of ''muscle spasms'' and certain types of ''headaches''. Its latest medical use is for treating excessive underarm sweating.''Botox is injected into tissues of the armpit or hand. The drug works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, which is the chemical that activates sweat glands. This may produce approximately six months of relief from sweating. The injections are uncomfortable, but use of a very small needle minimizes discomfort.''Now that this treatment option has received FDA approval, many health insurers are providing coverage for the injections and the Botox itself, which is quite costly.''Currently, the FDA has not approved Botox for treating sweating of the palms and soles of the feet, though some physicians are administering it as an off-label use, with some success. Drawbacks of using this treatment for the palms and soles are ''pain'', requiring ''nerve blocks'' to numb the hands in order to make the injections tolerable, and the potential for temporary muscle ''weakness''.'""These new techniques produce energy that presumably destroys sweat glands while preserving other tissues. Currently, only the armpits seem to be appropriate treatment sites. Treatments occur in a doctor's office and in recent studies have been accompanied by local swelling and irritation as well as a variety of other relatively minor side effects. Sweating seems to be significantly decreased for a time with these treatments. How these would be used in other anatomical areas aside from the armpits is not clear.""   Over-the-counter antiperspirants: Patients usually try home remedies like these first because they are readily available. Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride (for example, Certain-Dri) may be more effective when other antiperspirants have failed. So-called ""natural"" antiperspirants are often not very helpful for patients. Prescription-strength antiperspirants: those containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate Iontophoresis: a device that uses a direct current to drive ions into the sweat gland using tap water occasionally mixed with aluminum ions or other substances Oral medications: from the group of medications known as anticholinergics, which reduce sweating Topical medicated pads: pads impregnated with anticholinergic medications for use in the armpits Botox (botulinum toxin): approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating excessive axillary sweating Microwave destruction: a device destroys the sweat glands, purportedly causing minimal damage to other tissues Surgery: paraspinal sympathectomy, or interruption of certain nerve pathways, as a last resort"
Are there home remedies for hyperhidrosis?,"'Over-the-counter antiperspirants may be effective, but usually the patient has already tried these.' "
Can surgery treat hyperhidrosis? What are potential side effects of surgery for hyperhidrosis?,"'Localized axillary hyperhidrosis has been treated by surgical removal of a substantial portion of axillary skin. Another approach is the use of ''liposuction'' curettage, although how this effectively damages the dermal sweat glands is hard to visualize.''Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) refers to surgical interruption of the sympathetic nerves responsible for sweating. Sympathectomy is an operation intended to destroy part of the nerve supply to the sweat glands in the skin. The surgeon inserts a special endoscopic instrument into the chest between two ribs just below the armpit. The lung is briefly deflated to better visualize and destroy the nerves. Sympathectomy is both effective and risky. Even with newer endoscopic techniques, complications of the procedure can include compensatory, excessive sweating in other parts of the body as well as lung and nerve problems. As many of these complications are serious and not reversible, this option is rarely used, and then only as a last resort.'  "
Is it possible to prevent hyperhidrosis?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent hyperhidrosis.''Most hyperhidrosis patients can be effective and safely treated.' "
Where can people find more information about hyperhidrosis?,'An excellent source of information is the International Hyperhidrosis Society (https://www.sweathelp.org/).' 
"What is hand, foot, and mouth (HFMD) disease?","'Hand, foot, and mouth disease (''HFMD'') is a viral infection characterized by ''fever'' and a typical rash most frequently seen on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and inside the mouth. It should not be confused with foot (hoof) and mouth disease that affects cattle, sheep, and swine.\xa0' "
"What are the early symptoms and signs of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'HFMD is most commonly an illness of the summer and fall seasons.'   Initial symptoms of a low-grade fever (101 F-102 F) and malaise are followed within 1 or 2 days by a characteristic skin rash. Small (2 mm-3 mm) red spots that quickly develop into small blisters (vesicles) appear on the palms, soles, and oral cavity.The gums, tongue, and inner cheek are most commonly involved in the mouth.The foot lesions may also involve the lower calf region and rarely may appear on the buttocks.Oral lesions are commonly associated with a sore throat, uncomfortable eating and drinking, and as a result, a diminished appetite. It is very rare for an infected child to become dehydrated due to oral discomfort. The gums, tongue, and inner cheek are most commonly involved in the mouth. The foot lesions may also involve the lower calf region and rarely may appear on the buttocks. Oral lesions are commonly associated with a sore throat, uncomfortable eating and drinking, and as a result, a diminished appetite. It is very rare for an infected child to become dehydrated due to oral discomfort. It is estimated that approximately 50% of those infected with this enterovirus never develop symptoms. Symptoms are much more common in infants, toddlers, and young children. Older children, teens, and adults are more likely to incur no symptoms."
"What causes hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'HFMD is one of several infectious diseases caused by different members of the ''enterovirus'' family of ''viruses''. The most common cause is Coxsackievirus A16; less frequently enterovirus 71 is the infectious agent. The clinical manifestations of routine HFMD are the same regardless of the responsible virus. However, patients infected with enterovirus 71 are more likely to experience rare complications (for example, viral meningitis or ''cardiac muscle'' involvement).'  "
"Is hand, foot, and mouth disease contagious? How does is it spread?","'HFMD is spread person to person by direct contact with the infecting virus (either Coxsackievirus A16 or less commonly enterovirus 71). These viruses are most commonly found in the nasal and throat regions but also in the ''blister'' fluid or ''stool'' of infected individuals. The virus can survive on inanimate surfaces such as desktops, faucets, etc. It can then be transferred by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes before washing your hands. Likewise, changing diapers from an infected infant without wearing gloves or hand-washing can transmit disease. Water contaminated with the virus can also transmit the infection. Women who are infected shortly prior to delivery may pass on the infection to their infant. The baby will generally have a mild illness but should be monitored closely since in rare cases they could develop a more severe infection or experience complications. Infected individuals are most ''contagious'' during the first week of their illness. HFMD cannot be contracted from pets or animals.'""The viruses that cause HFMD may remain in the person's respiratory or intestinal tract for several weeks to months after all symptoms have resolved. It is possible, therefore, to transmit the infection even though the formerly ill individual has completely recovered. Some individuals (most commonly adults) may exhibit no symptoms or signs during their infection but may unwittingly transmit the illness to those (commonly infants and children) who are not immune."" "
"What is the contagious period for hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Once exposed to the virus, those who develop symptoms and signs will do so within 1-3 days. They are most contagious during the first week of the illness. However, the virus may continue to be shed for one to three weeks in respiratory secretions (saliva and/or nasal mucous) and in the ''stool'' for two to eight weeks after the primary infection.' "
"What is the incubation period for hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'HFMD is moderately contagious and spreads from person to person. It cannot be spread by animals. Usually, the virus is passed via oral secretions (nasal discharge and saliva, etc.) or via stool. There is a short 1- to 3-day incubation period between exposure and development of initial symptoms (fever and malaise). A person is most contagious during the first week of illness.' "
"Can adults get hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'An adult who was never exposed to the viruses that cause HFMD as a child could develop the characteristic symptoms and physical signs (vesicular rash with the characteristic distribution) if infected by the virus. Interestingly, the majority of adults exposed to enteroviruses will remain without symptoms. Unfortunately, an infected person is still contagious even though he lacks objective physical findings.' "
"Where does hand, foot, and mouth disease usually occur?","'In the temperate northern hemisphere, summer and fall are the most frequent seasons for community epidemics of HFMD. The illness is year-round in the tropics. While anyone exposed to the viral causes of HFMD may develop disease, not everyone infected will develop symptoms and signs.' "
"How long does hand, foot, and mouth disease last?","'The total duration of illness from HFMD is approximately 5-7 days. One to three days after viral invasion of the patient, the first symptoms become evident. These include fever, reduced appetite, ''sore throat'', and a general sense of feeling ill (malaise). One to two days later, the characteristic painful ''mouth sores'' develop. The final stage of the illness is manifested by small, tender red spots which progress to blisters in the mouth, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and less frequently on the arms and legs, as well as the buttock and genital areas. ' "
"What is the course of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'The illness is characteristically self-limited and is usually resolved within a week, particularly when due to its most common cause, Coxsackievirus A16. In those outbreaks due to enterovirus 71, the illness may be more severe with complications such as infection of the ''heart'' muscle and/or viral meningitis and ''encephalitis'' and paralytic disease. As a rule, HFMD is generally a mild and self-limited illness.' "
"What are the risk factors for hand, foot and mouth disease?","'Risk factors for developing HFMD include' summer and fall seasons, toddler age range, high-risk exposure location (such as daycare and preschool) and close contact (for example, family home) locations, ineffective hygiene -- infrequent soap and water hand-washing or not wearing disposable gloves when changing stool-containing diapers, and a compromised immune system."
"What tests diagnose hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Usually, the diagnosis of HFMD is made on a combination of clinical history and characteristic physical findings. Laboratory confirmation is rarely necessary unless severe complications develop.' "
"What is the treatment for hand, foot, and mouth disease?",'Treatment of HFMD is directed toward symptomatic relief of fever and sore throat. Antibiotics are not indicated in the treatment of this viral disease. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been tried as a therapy for severely ill patients or immunocompromised older patients with variable success.'  
"How does hand, foot, and mouth disease affect pregnancy and the baby?","'Commonly, HFMD is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. Information regarding fetal exposure to HFMD during ''pregnancy'' is limited. No solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or ''congenital defects''. However, should a baby be born to a mother with active HFMD symptoms and signs, the risk of ''neonatal'' infection is high. While such newborns often have a mild illness, a ''newborn'' infant is highly vulnerable and may develop an overwhelming and potentially fatal infection involving vital organs such as ''liver'', heart, and brain, which could be fatal.' "
"When can children with hand, foot, and mouth disease return to school?",'Children may return to school once without fever for 24 hours (usually day three or four of the disease).' 
"What are complications of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Complications of HFMD are relatively rare. The more common cause of HFMD (Coxsackievirus A16) is less likely to cause complications when compared with enterovirus-71.''Complications include the following:' ""Aseptic"" (also called ""viral"") meningitis (rare): Symptoms of meningitis are moderate-severe headache, discomfort when bending the head forward (classically tested by trying to touch the chin to the chest), and nausea and vomiting. Meningitis is an infection of the tissues and spinal fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. The diagnosis is confirmed by a lumbar puncture (also known as a ""spinal tap""). Depending upon severity of the patient's symptoms, they may need to be hospitalized. Encephalitis (brain infection): Encephalitis is much less common but more ominous when compared with meningitis and requires hospitalization for close monitoring. Other rare neurologic complications include paralysis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and cerebellar ataxia. Transient and permanent impairment can both occur. Occasionally, the virus may infect the heart muscle fibers and thus compromise the heart's blood-pumping capabilities. Young infants may very rarely become dehydrated due to refusal to take oral fluids as a consequence of mouth pain. In very rare circumstances, the skin vesicles may develop a secondary bacterial infection. A short course of antibiotics are used to treat the secondary infection."
"What is the prognosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","""The prognosis for routine HFMD is excellent. A patient's symptoms are bothersome but not debilitating. Medications designed to reduce fever and/or ""'pain'' relievers are helpful, such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' or ''Motrin''). Young children often find that cool/soft foods (ice cream, smoothies, etc.) provide some pain relief and are psychologically helpful as ""special treats."" An individual assessment is required for those unique individuals who develop complications (such as meningitis). As would be anticipated, those with an immunocompromised status are more likely to develop either a more serious infection or an illness of a more intense nature than those with a normally functioning immune system.' "
"Can you prevent hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'There is no ''vaccine'"" to prevent HFMD. Routine hygiene (soap and water washing of the hands) is a primary strategy to limit transmission of the virus. Cleaning a child's toys (especially those which would be placed into the mouth or drooled upon) is important. Avoidance of direct saliva exposure (kissing, sharing eating utensils, etc.) is also very helpful to limit transmission. Since transmission of the virus is also possible via stool, wearing disposable gloves during changing of diapers (especially in a preschool or day care setting) is also beneficial."" "
"Why haven't we heard more about hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Recognition of hand, foot, and mouth disease is relatively recent (when contrasted with ''mumps'', ''measles'', and ''chickenpox'', for example). HFMD was first reported in 1956 in Australia. By the early 1960s, it had emerged as a common childhood illness around the world.' "
What is leprosy?,"'Leprosy is a disease mainly caused by the bacteria ''Mycobacterium leprae'', which causes damage to the skin and the peripheral nervous system. The disease develops slowly (from six months to 40 years) and results in skin lesions and deformities, most often affecting the cooler places on the body (for example, eyes, nose, earlobes, hands, ''feet'', and testicles). The skin lesions and deformities can be very disfiguring and are the reason that historically people considered infected individuals outcasts in many cultures. Although human-to-human transmission is the primary source of infection, three other species can carry and (rarely) transfer ''M. leprae'' to humans: chimpanzees, mangabey monkeys, and nine-banded armadillos. The disease is termed a chronic granulomatous disease, similar to ''tuberculosis'', because it produces inflammatory nodules (granulomas) in the skin and peripheral nerves over time.' "
What is the history of leprosy (Hansen's disease)?,"'Unfortunately, the history of leprosy and its interaction with man is one of suffering and misunderstanding. The newest health research suggests that ''M. leprae'"" has infected people since at least as early as 4000 B.C., while the first known written reference to the disease was found on Egyptian papyrus in about 1550 B.C. The disease was well recognized in ancient China, Egypt, and India, and there are several references to the disease in the Bible. Many cultures thought the disease was a curse or punishment from the gods because they did not understand the disease, it's very disfiguring, slow to show symptoms and signs, and had no known treatment. Consequently, priests or holy men treated leprosy, not physicians.""'Since the disease often appeared in family members, some people thought it was hereditary. Other people noted that if there was little or no contact with infected individuals, the disease did not infect others. Consequently, some cultures considered infected people (and occasionally their close relatives) as ""unclean"" or as ""lepers"" and ruled they could not associate with uninfected people. Often infected people had to wear special clothing and ring bells so uninfected people could avoid them.''The Romans and the Crusaders brought the disease to Europe, and the Europeans brought it to the Americas. In 1873, Dr. Hansen discovered bacteria in leprosy lesions, suggesting leprosy was an infectious disease, not a hereditary disease or a punishment from the gods. However, many societies still ostracized patients with the disease, and religious personnel at missions cared for those with leprosy. Patients with leprosy were encouraged or forced to live in seclusion up to the 1940s, even in the United States (for example, the leper colony on Molokai, Hawaii, that was established by a priest, Father Damien and another colony or leprosarium established at Carville, La.), often because no effective treatments were available to patients at that time.'""Because of Hansen's discovery of ""'M. leprae'', researchers made efforts to find treatments (anti-leprosy agents) that would stop or eliminate ''M. leprae.'"" In the early 1900s to about 1940, medical professionals injected oil from Chaulmoogra nuts into patients' skin was with questionable efficacy. At Carville in 1941, promin, a sulfone drug, showed efficacy but required many painful injections. ""'Dapsone'' pills were found to be effective in the 1950s, but soon (1960s-1970s), ''M. leprae'' developed resistance to dapsone. Fortunately, drug trials on the island of Malta in the 1970s showed that a three-drug combination (dapsone, rifampicin [''Rifadin''], and ''clofazimine'' [''Lamprene'']) was very effective in killing ''M. leprae''. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended this multi-drug treatment (MDT) in 1981 and remains, with minor changes, the therapy of choice. MDT, however, does not alter the damage done to an individual by ''M. leprae'' before starting MDT.''Currently, there are several areas (India, East Timor) of the world where the WHO and other agencies (for example, the Leprosy Mission) are working to decrease the number of clinical leprosy cases and other diseases such as ''rabies'' and ''schistosomiasis'' that occur in remote regions. Although health researchers hope to eliminate leprosy like ''smallpox'', endemic (meaning prevalent or embedded in a region) leprosy makes complete eradication unlikely. In the U.S., leprosy has occurred infrequently but is endemic in Texas, Louisiana, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands by some investigators.''Leprosy is often termed ""Hansen\'s disease"" by many clinicians in an attempt to have leprosy patients forgo the stigmas attached to a leprosy diagnosis.' "
What causes leprosy?,"'Leprosy is caused mainly by ''Mycobacterium leprae'', a rod-shaped slow-growing bacillus that is an obligate intracellular (only grows inside of certain human and animal cells) bacterium. ''M. leprae'' is termed an ""acid fast"" bacterium because of its chemical characteristics. When medical professionals use special stains for microscopic analysis, it stains red on a blue background due to mycolic acid content in its cell walls. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain is an example of the special staining techniques used to view the acid-fast organisms under the microscope.'""Currently, the organisms cannot be cultured on artificial media. The bacteria take an extremely long time to reproduce inside of cells (about 12-14 days as compared to minutes to hours for most bacteria). The bacteria grow best at 80.9 F-86 F, so cooler areas of the body tend to develop the infection. The bacteria grow very well in the body's macrophages (a type of immune system cell) and Schwann cells (cells that cover and protect nerve axons). ""'M. leprae'' is genetically related to ''M. ''tuberculosis'' (the type of bacteria that cause tuberculosis) and other mycobacteria that infect humans. They are leprosy-related diseases. As with ''malaria'', patients with leprosy produce anti-endothelial antibodies (antibodies against the lining tissues of blood vessels), but the role of these antibodies in these diseases is still under investigation.''In 2009, investigators discovered a new ''Mycobacterium'' species, ''M. lepromatosis'', which causes diffuse disease (''lepromatous leprosy''). Considered one of the tropical diseases, this new species (determined by genetic analysis) appeared in patients located in Mexico and the Caribbean islands.' "
What are the risk factors for leprosy?,"'People at highest risk are those who live in the areas where leprosy is endemic (parts of India, China, Japan, Nepal, Egypt, and other areas) and especially those people in constant physical contact with infected people. In addition, there is some evidence that genetic defects in the immune system may cause certain people to be more likely to become infected (region q25 on chromosome 6). Additionally, people who handle certain animals known to carry the bacteria (for example, armadillos, African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque) are at risk of getting the bacteria from the animals, especially if they do not wear gloves while handling the animals.'  "
What are leprosy early symptoms and signs?,"'Unfortunately, the early signs and symptoms of leprosy are very subtle and occur slowly (usually over years). The symptoms are similar to those that may occur with ''syphilis'', ''tetanus'', and ''leptospirosis''. The following are the major signs and symptoms of leprosy:''This long-term developing sequence of events begins and continues on the cooler areas of the body (for example, hands, feet, face, and knees).'

Are there different forms (classifications) of leprosy?,"""There are multiple forms of leprosy described in the literature. The forms of leprosy depend on the person's immune response to ""'M. leprae''. A good immune response can produce the so-called tuberculoid form of the disease, with limited skin lesions and some asymmetric nerve involvement. A poor immune response can result in the lepromatous form, characterized by extensive skin and symmetric nerve involvement. Some patients may have aspects of both forms. Currently, two classification systems exist in the medical literature: the WHO system and the Ridley-Jopling system. The Ridley-Jopling system is composed of six forms or classifications, listed below according to increasing severity of symptoms:''Globally, health care professionals use the Ridley-Jopling classification in evaluating patients in clinical studies. However, the WHO classification system is more widely used. It has only two forms or classifications of leprosy. The 2009 WHO classifications depend on the number of skin lesions as follows:''However, the WHO further modifies these two classifications with clinical criteria because ""of the non-availability or non-dependability of the skin-smear services. The clinical system of classification for the purpose of treatment includes the use of number of skin lesions and nerves involved as the basis for grouping leprosy patients into multibacillary (MB) and paucibacillary (PB) leprosy."" Investigators state that up to about four to five skin lesions constitutes paucibacillary leprosy, while about five or more constitutes multibacillary leprosy.''Multidrug therapy (MDT) with three antibiotics (dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine) treat multibacillary leprosy, while a modified MDT with two antibiotics (dapsone and rifampicin) is recommended for paucibacillary leprosy and composes most current treatments today (see treatment section below). Paucibacillary leprosy usually includes indeterminate, tuberculoid, and borderline tuberculoid leprosy from the Ridley-Jopling classification, while multibacillary leprosy usually includes the double (mid-) borderline, borderline lepromatous, and lepromatous leprosy.' Indeterminate leprosy: a few hypopigmented macules; can heal spontaneously, this form persists or advances to other forms Tuberculoid leprosy: a few hypopigmented macules, some are large and some become anesthetic (lose pain sensation); some neural involvement in which nerves become enlarged; spontaneous resolution in a few years, persists or advances to other forms; cell-mediated immune response appears in this classification but is almost absent in lepromatous leprosy Borderline tuberculoid leprosy: lesions like tuberculoid leprosy but smaller and more numerous with less nerve enlargement. This form may persist, revert to tuberculoid leprosy, or advance to other forms Mid-borderline leprosy: many reddish plaques that are asymmetrically distributed, moderately anesthetic, with regional adenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). The form may persist, regress to another form, or progress Borderline lepromatous leprosy: many skin lesions with macules (flat lesions) papules (raised bumps), plaques, and nodules, sometimes with or without anesthesia; the form may persist, regress or progress to lepromatous leprosy Lepromatous leprosy: Early lesions are pale macules (flat areas) that are diffuse and symmetric. Later medical professionals can find many M. leprae organisms in the lesions. Alopecia (hair loss) occurs. Often patients have no eyebrows or eyelashes. As the disease progresses, nerve involvement leads to anesthetic areas and limb weakness. Progression leads to aseptic necrosis (tissue death from lack of blood to area), lepromas (skin nodules), and disfigurement of many areas, including the face. The lepromatous form does not regress to the other less severe forms. Histoid leprosy is a clinical variant of lepromatous leprosy that presents with clusters of histiocytes (a type of cell involved in the inflammatory response) and a grenz zone (an area of collagen separating the lesion from normal tissue) seen in microscopic tissue sections. Paucibacillary leprosy: skin lesions with no bacilli (M. leprae) seen in a skin smear Multibacillary leprosy: skin lesions with bacilli (M. leprae) seen in a skin smear"
How does leprosy spread? Is leprosy contagious?,"'Researchers suggest that ''M. leprae'' spreads person to person by nasal secretions or droplets from the upper respiratory tract and nasal mucosa. However, the disease is not highly ''contagious'' like the ''flu'"". They speculate that infected droplets reach other peoples' nasal passages and begin the infection there. Some investigators suggest the infected droplets can infect others by entering breaks in the skin. ""'M. leprae'' apparently cannot infect intact skin. Rarely, humans get leprosy from the few animal species mentioned above. Occurrence in animals makes it difficult to eradicate leprosy from endemic sources. Medical researchers are still investigating routes of transmission for leprosy. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that several genes (about seven) are associated with an increased susceptibility to leprosy. Some researchers now conclude that susceptibility to leprosy may be partially inheritable. The incubation period for leprosy varies from about six months to 20 years.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose leprosy?,"'Physicians diagnose the majority of cases of leprosy by clinical findings, especially since most current cases are diagnosed in areas that have limited or no laboratory equipment available. Hypopigmented patches of skin or reddish skin patches with loss of sensation, thickened peripheral nerves, or both clinical findings together often comprise the clinical diagnosis. Skin smears or biopsy material that show acid-fast bacilli with the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or the Fite stain (biopsy) can diagnose multibacillary leprosy, or if bacteria are absent, diagnose paucibacillary leprosy. Other tests can be done, but specialized labs perform most of these, which may help a clinician to place the patient in the more detailed Ridley-Jopling classification and are not routinely done (lepromin test, phenolic glycolipid-1 test, ''PCR'', lymphocyte migration inhibition test or LMIT). Health care providers may perform other tests such as ''CBC'' test, ''liver function'' tests, ''creatinine'' test, or a nerve biopsy to help determine if other organ systems have been affected.' "
What is the treatment for leprosy?,"'Antibiotics treat the majority of cases (mainly clinically diagnosed) of leprosy. The recommended antibiotics, their dosages, and length of time of administration are based on the form or classification of the disease and whether or not the patient is under medical supervision. In general, two antibiotics (dapsone and rifampicin) treat paucibacillary leprosy, while multibacillary leprosy is treated with the same two plus a third antibiotic, clofazimine. Usually, medical professionals administer the antibiotics for at least six to 12 months or more to cure the disease.''Antibiotics can treat paucibacillary leprosy with little or no residual effects on the patient. Multibacillary leprosy can be kept from advancing, and living ''M. leprae'' can be essentially eliminated from the person by antibiotics, but the damage done before antibiotics are administered is usually not reversible. Recently, the WHO suggested that single-dose treatment of patients with only one skin lesion with rifampicin, ''minocycline'' (''Minocin''), or ''ofloxacin'"" (Floxin) is effective. Studies of other antibiotics are ongoing. Each patient, depending on the above criteria, has a schedule for their individual treatment, so a clinician knowledgeable about that patient's initial diagnostic classification should plan a patient's treatment schedules. .""'Medical professionals have used steroid medications to minimize pain and acute inflammation with leprosy; however, controlled trials showed no significant long-term effects on nerve damage.''The role for surgery in the treatment of leprosy occurs after a patient completes medical treatment (antibiotics) with negative skin smears (no detectable acid-fast bacilli) and is often only needed in advanced cases. Medical professionals individualize surgery for each patient with the goal to attempt cosmetic improvements and, if possible, to restore limb function and some neural functions that were lost to the disease.'""Special clinics run by the National Hansen's Disease Program may treat some people in the United States.""'As is the case with many diseases, the lay literature contains home remedies. For example, purported home remedies include a paste made from the neem plant, ''Hydrocotyle'', also known as ''Cantella asiatica'', and even aromatherapy with frankincense. Patients should discuss any home remedies with their physician before using such methods; often there is little or no scientific data to uphold these cure claims.'

What are the complications of leprosy?,"'The complications of leprosy depend on how quickly medical professionals diagnose and effectively treat the disease. Very few complications occur if physicians treat the disease early enough, but the following is a list of complications that can occur when diagnosis and treatment is either delayed or started late in the disease process:''In addition, the sensory loss causes people to injure body parts without the individual being aware that there is an injury. This can lead to additional problems such as infections and poor ''wound'' healing.' Sensory loss (usually begins in extremities) Permanent nerve damage (usually in extremities) Muscle weakness Progressive disfigurement (for example, eyebrows lost, disfigurement of the toes, fingers, and nose)"
What health care specialists treat leprosy?,"'Although pediatricians and primary care doctors usually follow patients with leprosy, health care professionals often make the initial diagnosis and treatment in consultation with infectious disease specialists, dermatologists, neurologists, and/or immunologists. Some patients may require consultation with a surgeon to restore some functions of movement and/or do cosmetic repairs.' "
Is it possible to prevent leprosy?,"'Prevention'' of contact with droplets from nasal and other secretions from patients with untreated ''M. leprae'' infection is currently the most effective way to avoid the disease. Treatment of patients with appropriate antibiotics stops the person from spreading the disease. People who live with individuals who have untreated leprosy are about eight times as likely to develop the disease, because investigators speculate that family members have close proximity to infectious droplets. Leprosy is not hereditary, but recent findings suggest susceptibility to the disease may have a genetic basis.'""Many people have exposures to leprosy throughout the world, but the disease in not highly contagious. Researchers suggest that most exposures result in no disease, and further studies suggest that susceptibility depends, in part, on a person's genetic ""'makeup''. In the U.S., there are about 200-300 new cases diagnosed per year, with most coming from exposures during foreign travel. The majority of worldwide cases occur in the tropics or subtropics (for example, Brazil, India, and Indonesia). The WHO reports about 500,000 to 700,000 new cases per year worldwide, with curing of about 14 million cases since 1985.''There is no commercially available ''vaccine'' available to prevent leprosy. However, there are reports that using BCG vaccine alone, the BCG vaccine along with heat-killed ''M. leprae'' organisms, and other preparations may be protective, help to clear the infection or possibly shorten treatment. Except for BCG being obtainable in some countries, these other preparations are not readily available.''Animals (chimpanzees, mangabey monkeys, and nine-banded armadillos) rarely transfer ''M. leprae'' to humans. Nonetheless, it is not advisable to handle such animals in the wild. These animals are a source for endemic infections.' "
What is the prognosis of leprosy?,"""The prognosis of leprosy varies with the stage of the disease when medical professionals diagnose and treat it. For example, early diagnosis and treatment limits or prevents tissue damage so the person has a good outcome. However, if the patient's infection has progressed to more advanced disease, the complications listed above can markedly affect the patient's lifestyle, and thus the condition has a fair to poor prognosis.""

What is hantavirus and pulmonary syndrome (HPS)?,"'The term ''hantavirus'' represents several groups of RNA-containing ''viruses'' (that are members of the virus family of ''Bunyaviridae'') that are carried by rodents and can cause severe respiratory infections termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and hemorrhagic ''fever'' with renal syndrome (HFRS).''HPS is found mainly in the Americas (Canada, U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Panama, and others) while hemrrhatic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)\xa0is found mainly in Russia, China, and Korea but may be found in Scandinavia and Western Europe and occasionally in other areas.''Like HPS, HFRS results from hantaviruses that are transmitted by''The goal of this article is to discuss HPS; however, much of what is presented about HPS applies to HFRS -- the main difference is that the predominant symptoms in the late stages of disease vary somewhat between the two diseases (lung fluid and ''shortness of breath'' in HPS and ''low blood pressure'', fever, and ''kidney failure'' in HFRS).''HPS is a disease caused by hantavirus that results in human ''lungs'' filling with fluid (''pulmonary edema'') and causing death in about 38% of all infected patients.' rodent urine, rodent droppings, or saliva (rodent bite), by direct contact with the animals by aerosolized dust contaminated with rodent urine or feces to human skin breaks or to mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes. The vast majority of HPS and HFRS infections do not transfer from person to person."
What are the early symptoms and signs of HPS?,"'The symptoms and signs of HPS fall into early and late stages.''Early HPS\xa0signs and symptoms begin about one to five weeks after the person contacts hantavirus associated with rodent urine, feces, or saliva. The ''early symptoms'' are ''flu-like'', last about four to 10 days, and include''Almost every infected person develops these symptoms. Other symptoms of HPS that may occur in about half of infected patients include''Early symptoms of can cause diagnostic ''confusion''.'' In 2018, Kiley Lane, a 27-year-old mother who lived in New Mexico, was diagnosed as having the ''flu'' but her symptoms got worse. She\xa0was diagnosed with having hantavirus about a month after her flu diagnosis and died about one month later of the disease.''Late symptoms ''of HPS occur about four to 10 days after the early symptoms and include;''Some infected people may develop hemorrhagic fever and ''kidney failure'' that may require ''dialysis'' (HFRS or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome).'  ffatigue, fever, and muscle aches, especially large muscles in the legs, back, and hips). abdominal pain (with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), headaches, chills, and dizziness. coughing, chest pain, and shortness of breath that can become severe."
What are the causes and risk factors for HPS?,"'The cause of HPS is infection of the patient by hantavirus. Currently, about 14 subtypes of hantaviruses have been identified. Many subtypes have been named''Some researchers and doctytors simply them under the term of ""New World hantaviruses."" The Sin Nombre subtype has caused the majority of current HPS disease.''Hantavirus apparently damages cells that compose blood vessel capillaries, causing them to leak fluids. This fluid leak, if it is profound in the lungs, causes the life-threatening pulmonary syndrome.'""Hantaviruses live their lifecycle in rodents but apparently do no harm; the viruses multiply and shed in the rodent's urine, feces, and saliva. A recent study in California suggested about 15% of all deer mice examined tested positive for hantavirus. Although the deer mouse has been the source of most HPSinfections, many other rodents may carry a different hantavirus subtype virus (for example, the white-footed mouse, the cotton rat, and the rice rat).""'The major risk factor for HPS is association with'   Sin Nombre Black Creek hantavirus Seoul virus New York hantavirus Rodent infestation. Rodent saliva. Rodent urine. Feces or with dust, dirt. Surfaces contaminated with such rodent excretions, either by direct contact or by aerosol. Barns, sheds, homes, or buildings easily entered by rodents (for example, deer mouse or Peromyscus maniculatus) are potential places for hantaviruses to come in contact with humans. Rural areas that have forests and fields that can support a large rodent population are areas that increase the risk of exposure to hantavirus. Camping and hiking in areas known to have a high rodent population and occupying areas where rodents may seek shelter increase one's risk. Working in areas that may be shelter for rodents (for example, crawl spaces, vacated buildings, construction sites) may also have increased risk of hantavirus syndrome. The risk is higher in people who work in areas known to have produced hantavirus pulmonary syndrome infections."
"Is hantavirus contagious, and how long is it before symptoms begin?","'There is no evidence that HPS is not contagious from person to person contact in the US. The virus spreads from rodents to humans. Although outbreaks seem like there is person-to-person transfer, outbreaks are usually noted among groups of people exposed to the same infected rodent population while those with hantavirus infections do not transfer them to other uninfected individuals.' As of January 2017 in the US, hantavirus has affected about 800 people. South America, an estimated 16-35 days was the contagious period for a rare few patients who investigators considered to have exhibited person-to-person transfer with a type of hanta virus termed Andes virus. While this is the situation in North America, there are reports that in 1996, mild infections with hantaviruses were transmissible in an outbreak in Argentina.  Small outbreaks are reported each year; for example, Texas had its first person diagnosed with hantavirus in 2015. According to the CDC, in North America, the incubation period (time from initial exposure to the virus and development of the first symptoms) is between one to five weeks after initial exposure to infected rodent urine, droppings, or saliva. In South American outbreaks, researchers estimate that the incubation period varies from about 12-27 days."
What exams and tests diagnose HPS?,"'A test considered to diagnose HPS, is a\xa0positive serological test result, which is\xa0evidence of viral antigen in tissue by immunohistochemistry, or the presence of amplifiable viral RNA sequences in blood or tissue, with compatible history of HPS, is considered diagnostic for HPS.' "
What is the treatment for HPS?,"'Consequently, most patients diagnosed with HPS are usually cared for in the intensive care unit by specialists trained in critical care, and usually, in consultation with an infectious-disease doctor. Because the lungs are the most compromised organ in these infections, a lung doctor (''pulmonologist'') also is usually consulted. Moreover, specialists from the CDC are often involved to help locate the outbreak source and to help healthcare personnel at the outbreak site prevent further infections.' Unfortunately, hantavirus infections can lead to HPS. According to the CDC, hantavirus infections according have a mortality rate of about 38%. At this time, there is no definitive treatment for HPS other than early recognition of HPS and subsequent medical support (usually consisting of symptomatic medical treatment and respiratory support or mechanical ventilation). The CDC suggests that early treatment in an intensive care unit may allow the patient to survive severe HPS. Experimentally, doctors have administered the antiviral medication ribavirin (Rebetol, Copegus), but there are no clear data currently that establish that the drug is effective against HPS; however, its use against HFRS early in the disease suggests ribavirin can decrease illness and deaths. There is no vaccine available to protect against any hantaviruses to date."
What are the complications of HPS?,'The major complication of HPS is death from respiratory failure. Those who survive may take a few weeks to recover fully. Those patients who survive do not have chronic infections nor do they experience other chronic problems or complications.' 
Can you die from HPS?,"'The prognosis of HPS is fair to poor because currently, about 62% of patients recover, while about 38% will die. The prognosis may be better if the patient gets his/her diagnosis early and given support in an intensive care unit in a hospital. However, the early diagnosis of HPS is difficult; some patients did not know they had been exposed to rodents that carried hantavirus.' "
Can you prevent HPS?,"'There are no ''vaccines'' available to protect against any hantavirus types. The CDC recommends elimination or reduction of contact with any rodents (for example, at home, worksites, campsites, barns, sheds) by reducing rodent access or rodent-proofing. Sealing up gaps and holes, placing traps, and keeping areas as clean and food free as possible will help. If a person must come in contact with rodents or areas where they live, precautions such as gloves and masks may reduce the chances for infection; disinfectant treatment of possible contaminated surfaces may also help prevent the disease.''Do not attempt to use a vacuum or use a broom to remove rodent urine or feces; this action may increase the risk of HPS by generating an aerosol. The risk of HPS can be reduced by inactivating hantaviruses in the environment by using a household detergent and 1½ cups of bleach per gallon of water to wipe or spray the potentially infected area and while minimizing contact by wearing gloves and a mask. Take similar precautions with rodents caught in traps.' "
When was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome first discovered?," In 1993, health officials noted the first recognized outbreak of HPS in the ""Four Corners"" area of the U.S., where the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah meet. Two otherwise healthy young people, a Navajo Indian and his fiancée, suddenly became short of breath and died. This unusual situation triggered a review of deaths in the four states that resulted in identification of five other young people who recently died with similar breathing problems. During the next few weeks, health care providers treated additional people in the same geographic area with similar pulmonary syndromes. Tissues from affected patients were sent to the CDC, where researchers searched for causes and found a link among the patients: infection with a previously unknown type of hantavirus. Since other known hantaviruses (in Asia and Europe) were known to be transmitted to people by rodents, the researchers started trapping rodents from June to August 1993 to determine if the virus was associated with the animals. In November 1993, a rodent (a deer mouse) trapped by CDC researchers in a house where a person who developed the pulmonary syndrome lived yielded the previously unknown virus. In addition, army researchers soon isolated the same virus from an infected patient who also had exposures to mice. This new hantavirus was first termed Muerto Canyon virus, then Sin Nombre virus (SNV), and eventually simply hantavirus. The disease caused by this virus was termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Further investigations suggested that other people had died from this infection in the past, as autopsy tissue contained the virus. When health researchers studied Navajo Indian medical traditions, the Navajo medical culture apparently recognized the disease and had associated it with mice. The outbreak in 1993 probably occurred because environmental factors led to favorable survival and proliferation of mice. The mouse population was about tenfold greater in 1993 than in 1992 in the Four Corners area. A large, more recent outbreak of HPS occurred at Yosemite National Park, California, in 2012. The outbreak was linked to deer mouse dropping contamination in campsites (tent-cabins) used by tourists. This zoonotic (animal-to-person) transmission probably happened with a rodent infestation augmented by favorable nesting conditions like woodpiles in or near the campsites. At least three deaths occurred, and seven other infected people recovered."
"What is Hashimoto's thyroiditis? Where is ithe thyroid gland located, and what does it look like?","""Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition that is a common cause of hypothyroidism. In Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the body mounts an immune reaction against its own thyroid gland tissue, leading to inflammation of the gland (thyroiditis).""""The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the lower part of the neck, below Adam's apple. The thyroid gland wraps around the windpipe and has a shape that is similar to a butterfly - formed by two wings or lobes (lobes)\xa0and is attached by a middle part."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"""Symptoms and signs of Hashimoto's thyroiditis resemble those of hypothyroidism generally and are often subtle. They are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to ""'aging'"". Patients with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. The symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens, and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. Common symptoms and signs of Hashimoto's thyroiditis include:""'As hypothyroidism becomes more severe, there may be puffiness around the eyes, a slowing of the ''heart'' rate, a drop in body temperature, and ''heart failure''. In its most profound form, severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening ''coma'' (''myxedema coma''). In a severely hypothyroid individual, myxedema ''coma'' tends to be triggered by severe illness, surgery, ''stress'', or traumatic injury. This condition requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormone.'""Hashimoto's thyroiditis can be easily treated with thyroid hormone replacement if it is diagnosed properly. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to an ""'enlarged heart'' (''cardiomyopathy''), worsening heart failure, and an accumulation of fluid around the ''lungs'' (''pleural effusion'') or heart (''pericardial effusion'').'""People with Hashimoto's thyroiditis often initially experience a hyperthyroid phase (too much thyroid hormone), called hashitoxicosis, as thyroid hormone leaks out of the damaged gland as it is destroyed. Eventually, they become hypothyroid.""'Other symptoms and signs include:'   Fatigue Depression Modest weight gain Cold intolerance Excessive sleepiness Dry, coarse hair Constipation Dry skin Muscle cramps Increased cholesterol levels Decreased concentration Vague aches and pains Swelling of the legs Swelling of the thyroid gland (due to the inflammation), which can cause a feeling of tightness or fullness in the throat A lump in the front of the neck from the enlarged thyroid gland called a goiter Difficulty swallowing solids and/or liquids due to the enlargement of the thyroid gland with compression of the esophagus"
What causes Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"""Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a condition caused by inflammation of the thyroid gland. It is an autoimmune disease, which means that the body inappropriately attacks the thyroid gland - as if it was foreign tissue. The underlying cause of the autoimmune process remains unknown. Hashimoto's thyroiditis tends to occur in families. It can be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as ""'type 1 diabetes'' or ''celiac disease'"". Hashimoto's thyroiditis is 5 to 10 times more common in women than in men and most often starts in adulthood. Blood is drawn from people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis typically reveals an increased number of antibodies against thyroid-specific proteins, including thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin. T lymphocytes, a type of cell involved in the inflammation process, invade the thyroid gland cause silent, painless inflammation that destroys it; ultimately, the individual produces little or no thyroid hormone and becomes hypothyroid."" "
What about Hashimoto's thyroiditis and pregnancy or trying to conceive?,"""Hashimoto's thyroiditis is not a reason to avoid ""'pregnancy'"". However, some women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis do have trouble conceiving. In addition to careful obstetric care, management of thyroid hormone replacement by an endocrinologist is helpful. Before ""'conception'' and during pregnancy, levels of thyroid hormones need to be monitored and optimized by checking TSH levels, and if necessary, adjusting the medication dose. The target goal is usually within the range for nonpregnant women but at the higher end of the normal range.'  "
Is there a special diet for someone with Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"""People with Hashimoto's thyroiditis do not need to follow a special ""'diet''. There is no evidence to suggest that specific foods have any effect on worsening or improving the condition.' "
What tests diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"""To diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a physician should assess symptoms and complaints commonly seen in hypothyroidism, carefully examine the neck to look for enlargement of the thyroid gland, and take a detailed history of family members. Blood tests are essential to diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Specific blood tests determine the level of thyroid function.""'During the early stage of thyroiditis, the levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) may be normal. With chronic hypothyroidism, the thyroid hormone levels fall, and the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) becomes high. The most useful assay for determining thyroid status is the measurement of TSH in the blood. As mentioned earlier, ''TSH is secreted by the ''pituitary gland''. As the level of thyroid hormone falls, the pituitary gland responds by releasing more thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The increase in TSH can actually precede the fall of thyroid hormone too low levels by months or years, so the first sign of hypothyroidism may be an elevated TSH level even when levels of thyroid hormones are normal.'""The blood work mentioned above confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism but does not point to an underlying cause. The combination of the patient's clinical history, antibody screening (as mentioned above), and a ""'thyroid scan'' can help diagnose the precise underlying thyroid problem. If a pituitary or hypothalamic cause is suspected, ''MRI'' of the brain and other studies may be warranted. These investigations should be made on a case-by-case basis.''If the gland is large, or there are symptoms of esophageal compression, an ''ultrasound'' may be performed to see if the gland is compressing either the esophagus (the food tube) or the trachea (the ''airway'').'  "
What are the treatment options for Hashimoto's thyroiditis? Is there a cure?,"""There is no cure for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The timeframe of the autoimmune process and inflammation will continue is not predictable. In the vast majority of patients, hypothyroidism results from the inflammatory process.""""Thyroid hormone medication can replace the hormones the thyroid made before the inflammation started. There are two major thyroid hormones made by a healthy gland (T3 and T4). Replacing one or both of these hormones can alleviate the symptoms caused by the absolute or relative lack of hormones as a result of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.""""The treatment of choice for Hashimoto's thyroiditis is typically synthetic T4 or thyroxine (levothyroxine). Brand names for this medication include ""'Synthroid'', ''Levothroid'' and ''Levoxyl''. The medication must be taken indefinitely, and successful treatment alleviates the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. Without medication, there is very little chance the thyroid would be able to maintain hormone levels within the normal range, and symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism would occur or worsen. The dosage of levothyroxine may need to be modified after checking TSH levels once yearly. Adjustment of the dose may also be required in ''pregnant'' women.'  "
Are there natural treatment treatments for Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"""Treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis involves administration of prescription thyroid hormones. There is no scientific evidence that natural treatments are able to reverse hypothyroidism."" "
What is the prognosis for someone with Hashimoto's thyroiditis? Can it be prevented?,"""The prognosis for someone with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is excellent with proper treatment. Restoration of thyroid hormone levels with medical treatment will reverse the signs and ""'symptoms of hypothyroidism''. Without treatment, hypothyroidism can worsen over years, potentially leading to organ damage and severe illness.'""Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition in which the body perceives its own tissue as foreign. There is no known way to prevent this condition."" "

The hepatitis A virus typically spreads through contact with food or water that has been contaminated by an infected person’s ''stool''.''Hepatitis A is an acute or short-term infection, which means people usually get better without treatment after a few weeks. Hepatitis A does not lead to long-term complications, such as ''cirrhosis'', because the infection only lasts a short time.''You can take steps to protect yourself from hepatitis A, including getting the hepatitis A vaccine. If you have hepatitis A, you can take steps to prevent spreading hepatitis A to others.' "
How common is hepatitis A?,"'In the United States, hepatitis A has become relatively uncommon.

How do doctors treat hepatitis A?,"'Treatment includes resting, drinking plenty of liquids, and eating healthy foods to help relieve symptoms. Your doctor may also suggest medicines to help relieve symptoms.''Talk with your doctor before taking any prescription or ''over-the-counter'' medicines, ''vitamins'' or other ''dietary supplements'' , or complementary or alternative medicines—any of these could damage your liver. You should avoid alcohol until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered from hepatitis A.''See your doctor regularly to make sure your body has fully recovered. If you have symptoms for longer than 6 months, see your doctor again.'  "
How can I protect myself from hepatitis A infection?,"'You can protect yourself from hepatitis A by getting the hepatitis A vaccine. If you have not had the vaccine, you can take steps to reduce your chance of infection.''If you have had hepatitis A in the past, you cannot get hepatitis A again. You can still get other types of ''viral hepatitis'' though.' "
Hepatitis A vaccine,"'All children should receive the hepatitis A vaccine between 12 and 23 months of age. People who are more likely to be infected and people with chronic ''liver disease'' should also receive the vaccine.''Doctors give the hepatitis A vaccine in two shots. You should get the second shot 6 to 12 months after the first shot. You need to get both shots to be fully protected against the virus.''If you are traveling to a developing country where hepatitis A is common and you haven’t received the hepatitis A vaccine, try to get both shots before you go. If you don’t have time to get both shots, get the first shot as soon as you can. Most people gain some protection within 2 weeks of the first shot.' "
Reduce your chance of infection,"'When traveling in a developing country, drink bottled water. Use bottled water to brush your ''teeth'', make ice cubes, and wash fruits and vegetables.' after using the toilet after changing diapers before and after handling or preparing food"
Prevent infection after contact with the virus,"'If you think you have come in contact with the hepatitis A virus, see your doctor right away. A dose of the hepatitis A vaccine or a medicine called hepatitis A immune globulin may protect you from getting the infection. Your doctor may recommend a vaccine dose or medicine if''You must get the vaccine dose or medicine shortly after coming into contact with the virus to prevent infection.' you live with, have had sex with, or have had close contact with someone who has hepatitis A you shared illegal drugs with someone who had hepatitis A you ate food or drank water possibly containing the hepatitis A virus"
How can I prevent spreading hepatits A to others?,"'If you have hepatitis A, you can reduce your chance of spreading the infection by washing your hands with warm, soapy water after using the toilet and before fixing or eating food. While you are sick, avoid close contact with others, and don’t prepare food or serve food to others. Also, tell your doctor, dentist, and other health care professionals that you have hepatitis A.''Talk with a blood donation center before you donate blood. If you had hepatitis A when you were younger than 11, you may be able to donate blood. If you had hepatitis A when you were age 11 or older, you should not donate blood.''You are most ''contagious''—able to spread the virus to others—during the 2 weeks before you have symptoms. You may be contagious for up to 3 weeks after you develop symptoms. Children are often contagious longer than adults.' "
What should I eat and drink if I have hepatits A?,"'If you have hepatitis A, you should eat a balanced, healthy diet. Talk with your doctor about healthy eating. You should also avoid alcohol because it can cause more liver damage.' "
Is there any way to have a baby after a hysterectomy?,"'Hysterectomy'"" is the surgical removal of a woman's uterus\xa0(also known as the womb). Hence, a woman who has had a hysterectomy cannot have ""'babies'' in the normal way. However, with the development of research in medical science, a couple may have a baby after a hysterectomy via''Adoption or fostering may be an option to consider in these cases.' Surrogacy: When a woman loses her uterus, it does not necessarily mean that she loses her ovaries. Therefore, her eggs can be used to carry out an in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. However, embryo transfer cannot be performed on this woman because she has no uterus. For this reason, it will be necessary to transfer the embryos into a surrogate. Thus, surrogacy with IVF is the only alternative for a woman without a uterus to have her own genetically related children. It should be noted that depending on the legislation of each country, surrogacy may or may not be permitted. Uterus transplantation: After a hysterectomy, once a woman recovers, they may opt for uterus transplantation. Uterine transplantation is a highly complex surgical technique in which a healthy donor’s uterus is introduced into the recipient woman. Through uterine transplantation, the female recipient of the organ can achieve pregnancy and become a genetic mother. However, this surgical procedure is still in the experimental phase and involves risks for both the donor and recipient. To be more precise, there have currently only been 70 uterine transplants done worldwide."
Why can’t I have a baby in a normal way after a hysterectomy?,"'A couple may not have a baby in normal way after a hysterectomy for the following reasons' Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of a woman's womb. In most cases, other reproductive organs such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed with the womb.  However, in a few scenarios, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are left intact. This leaves behind the organs that produce the eggs with the possible chances of fertilization and embryo formation. However, chances of having a baby is zero without the womb. The uterus or womb is a very critical reproductive organ. During the conception of a baby, the egg and sperm fuse to form an embryo. The womb serves as the vessel in which the embryo attaches and grows. The unformed fetus attaches to the wall of the womb and anchors itself for further growth and development. In women who have undergone a hysterectomy, the womb is unavailable for the embryo to anchor. Therefore, a woman cannot have a baby even if the fallopian tubes and ovaries are not removed during a hysterectomy."
Can I get pregnant after a hysterectomy?,"'Yes, women may get ''pregnant'' after a hysterectomy if the fallopian tubes and ovaries are intact, but it is rare. After a hysterectomy, if a woman is in her ''fertile'' period of life, there are chances for the formation of an embryo. However, due to lack of the womb, the embryo sometimes attaches and grows in a fallopian tube. This type of pregnancy is termed an ''ectopic pregnancy'' and it is a condition that requires immediate medical attention. The fallopian tube is a very narrow passage and therefore does not have enough space for the developing fetus. This can lead to the rupture of the tube and heavy blood loss. An ''ectopic pregnancy'' is not a normal pregnancy and it does not result in the formation of a healthy baby. As soon as it is detected, it is terminated. Here are some of the signs and symptoms of a tubal or ectopic pregnancy' Cramping pain in the abdomen, particularly on one side Bleeding or spotting from the vagina all of a sudden Nausea and vomiting Dizziness and fatigue Pain in the neck, shoulder or rectum"
How does a hysterectomy affect my sexual life?,"'Many studies show an improvement in sexual function after a hysterectomy.\xa0This is likely because''If a woman has a hysterectomy yet has intact ovaries, sexual desire may not change much. However, the immediate effect of the loss of the womb may affect the ''mental health'' of the woman. The impact on a woman’s sexual life after a hysterectomy usually depends on the type of hysterectomy. If the doctor removes the ovaries along with the uterus, sexual desire may change due to the drop in estrogen that is important for sexual desire and intercourse. Half of these hormones are usually produced by the ovaries.' The surgery eliminates the pain, bleeding or other symptoms that may have caused problems with sex. The surgery eliminates the possibility of pregnancy, thus making sex more gratifying for some women. Estrogen: This hormone keeps the vaginal tissue healthy. Estrogen also keeps the vagina thick, moist and flexible. Without estrogen, the vaginal tissue becomes drier and thinner and is more likely to tear and lead to painful intercourse."
What is hay fever? What are hay fever symptoms and signs?,"'Hay fever affects up to 30% of all people worldwide, including up to 10% of U.S. children under 17 years of age and 7.8% of U.S. adults. The medical cost of allergic rhinitis is approximately $3.4 billion, mostly due to the cost of prescription medications. These figures are probably an underestimate because many of those affected may attribute their discomfort to a chronic ''cold''. Although childhood hay fever tends to be more common, this condition can occur at any age and usually occurs after years of repeated ''inhalation'' of allergic substances. The incidence of allergic disease has dramatically increased in the U.S. and other developed countries over recent decades.''""Hay fever"" is a misnomer. Hay is not a usual cause of this problem, and it does not cause fever. Early descriptions of sneezing, ''nasal congestion'', and eye irritation while harvesting field hay promoted this popular term. ''Allergic rhinitis'' is the correct term used to describe this ''allergic reaction'', and many different substances cause the allergic symptoms noted in hay fever. ''Rhinitis'' means ""inflammation of the nose"" and is a derivative of ''rhino'', meaning nose. Allergic rhinitis that occurs during a specific season is called ""seasonal allergic rhinitis."" When it occurs throughout the year, it is called ""perennial allergic rhinitis."" ''Rhinosinusitis'' is the medical term that refers to inflammation of the nasal lining as well as the lining tissues of the sinuses. This term is sometimes used because the two conditions frequently occur together.''Symptoms of allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, frequently include''Postnasal dripping of clear mucus frequently causes a ''cough''. Loss of the sense of smell is common, and loss of taste sense occurs occasionally. Nose bleeding may occur if the condition is severe. Eye ''itching'', redness, and excess tears in the eyes frequently accompany the nasal symptoms. The eye symptoms are referred to as ""''allergic conjunctivitis''"" (inflammation of the whites of the eyes). These allergic symptoms often interfere with one\'s quality of life and overall health.''Many people with ''allergies'' have difficulty with social and physical activities. For example, concentration is often difficult while experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms.'   nasal congestion, a runny nose with clear mucus, sneezing, nose, eye itching, and excess tear production in the eyes."
Why does an allergic reaction occur?,"'An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system attacks a usually harmless substance called an ''allergen'' that gains access to the body. The immune system calls upon a protective substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to fight these invading allergic substances or allergens. Even though everyone has some IgE, an allergic person has an unusually large amount of IgE. This army of IgE antibodies attacks and engages the invading army of allergic substances of allergens.''Specialized cells called mast cells also participate in the allergic reaction. Mast cells release a variety of chemicals into the tissues and blood, one of which is known as histamine. These chemicals frequently cause allergic reactions. These chemicals are very irritating and cause itching, swelling, and fluid leaking from cells. Through various mechanisms, these allergic chemicals can cause ''muscle spasm'' and can lead to lung and throat tightening as is found in ''asthma'' and ''loss of voice'' (''laryngitis'').' "
What causes hay fever (allergic rhinitis)?,"'Any substance can cause an ''allergy'' if exposed to an allergic person in the right way. But for all practical purposes and with few exceptions, allergic rhinitis is caused by proteins. Commonly, allergic rhinitis is a result of an allergic person coming in contact several times with protein from plants. Many trees, grasses, and weeds produce extremely small, light, dry protein particles called pollen. This pollen is spread by the wind and is inhaled. These pollen particles are usually the male sex cells of the plant and are smaller than the tip of a pin or less than 40 microns in diameter.''Even though pollen is usually invisible in the air, pollen is a potent stimulator of ''allergy''. Pollen lodges in the nasal lining tissues (mucus membranes) and other parts of the respiratory tract, where it initiates the allergic response. Up to 7.8% of American adults suffer from allergic rhinitis. Approximately one in four people with allergic rhinitis also has ''asthma''.' "
What are risk factors for allergic rhinitis?,"'A person is programmed to be allergic by his/her genetic ''makeup'' and is destined to be allergic from birth. People of all races are affected, and the condition affects both males and females equally. Symptoms commonly begin in childhood. Having frequent exposure to the particular allergic substance is a risk factor for frequent attacks.' "
When and where does allergic rhinitis occur?,"'Since allergic rhinitis is frequently caused by pollen, symptoms occur when pollen is in the air. Trees primarily pollinate in the spring, while grasses pollinate in the spring and summer. Weeds usually pollinate in the late summer and fall. Of allergy sufferers in the United States, many are allergic to ragweed, about half are allergic to grasses, and fewer are allergic to trees. Of course, many people are allergic to other substances such as ''mold'"" spores, animal dander protein, and dust mites, to name a few. If you wish to know the pollen count in your area, this information can often be found in the newspaper in the weather section or you can access the National Allergy Bureau's pollen count information at their web site (http://www.aaaai.org/nab/index.cfm).""'Food is an uncommon cause of allergic rhinitis.' "
Is allergic rhinitis contagious?,"'Allergic rhinitis, like other allergic reactions, is not ''contagious''. However, the symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be confused with those of a ''common cold'', which can be spread from person to person.' "
What specialists treat allergic rhinitis?,"'Allergists are medical specialists trained in the diagnosis and treatment of ''allergies'', including hay fever. People with hay fever also often seek care from a primary care physician, including internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose allergic rhinitis? How do health care professionals identify allergies?,"'Typically, allergies are initially diagnosed by a combination of characteristic symptoms coupled with exam findings that correspond with allergies.'""If a person is experiencing the typical symptoms of hay fever, a consultation with an allergy specialist can help identify the offending substances. Since the ideal way to manage an allergy is to avoid the substances that cause allergic reaction, it is important to first identify these substances (allergens). Many allergens can be suspected from information obtained in a patient's history. For example, if symptoms usually worsen with exposure to cats, then cat dander protein is a probable allergen causing the symptoms. If cutting grass is associated with the onset of symptoms, then grass allergy is probable. A patient's history of reactions is important in determining his/her unique allergies. Allergy testing is only done when allergies are debilitating enough that patients desire ""'allergy immunotherapy''.''Because the identification of allergens is important and often difficult to pinpoint, skin testing is often needed to identify exactly the specific substance causing the allergy. Skin testing is done with minimal discomfort and is performed as follows:''A number of blood tests are also available to aid in the diagnosis of allergy. These blood tests may be useful in people who cannot be skin tested due to skin diseases, who are taking medications that interfere with skin testing, or who are at a high risk of having an anaphylactic reaction to skin testing. These blood tests typically use various techniques to look for IgE antibodies in the blood and by inference suggest allergy in the tissues. If the allergy testing agrees with the history of symptoms upon exposure to the substance, then a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is likely.' A small amount of the suspected allergy substance is placed on the skin. The skin is then gently scratched through the small drop with a special sterile needle. This is known as the prick-puncture method and is typically used for initial evaluations. A second method, known as the intradermal method, involves injection of a small amount of the test substance into the skin. Intradermal testing is more sensitive but also tends to lead to more false-positive results. If the skin reddens and, more importantly, swells, then an individual is said to be ""sensitized"" to the particular allergen. If typical symptoms occur when a sensitized individual is exposed to the suspected substance, then allergy to that substance is probable. The skin testing described is tolerated by the youngest of patients and should be the standard of testing. Skin testing is not indicated for people who are at risk of a severe (anaphylactic) allergic reaction, who have certain skin conditions, or who are taking certain medications."
What is the treatment for hay fever?,"'Avoidance of identified allergens is the most helpful factor in controlling ''allergy symptoms''. Attempts to control the environment and avoidance measures often significantly aid in resolving symptoms. However, allergy avoidance is often not easy. A thorough discussion with your physician is needed, and control measures may be required daily.''If avoidance is not possible or does not relieve symptoms, additional treatment is needed. Many patients respond to medications that combat the effects of histamine, known as antihistamines. Antihistamines do not stop the formation of histamine, nor do they stop the conflict between the IgE and antigen. Therefore, antihistamines do not stop the allergic reaction but rather protect tissues from the effects of the allergic response.''The first-generation antihistamines, such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp and others), ''clemastine'' fumarate (''Tavist'', Allerhist), and dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral) frequently cause mouth dryness and sleepiness as side effects.''Newer, so-called ""non-sedating"" or second-generation antihistamines are also available. These include ''loratadine'' (''Claritin''), ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra''), ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec''), and ''azelastine'' (''Astelin'' Nasal Spray). In general, this group of antihistamines is slightly more expensive, has a slower onset of action, is longer acting, and induces less sleepiness. Many of these medications are available over the counter.''Discuss with a physician other ''antihistamine'' side effects that occasionally occur (for example, urine retention in males, fast ''heart'' rate, and others). Always discuss the potential side effects of any medication with a physician and/or pharmacist.''Decongestants help control allergy symptoms but not their causes. Decongestants shrink the swollen membranes in the nose and make it easier to breathe. Decongestants can be taken orally or by nasal spray. ''Decongestant'' nasal sprays should not be used for more than five days without a doctor\'s advice, and if so, usually only when accompanied by a nasal steroid. Decongestant nasal sprays often cause a so-called ""rebound effect"" if taken for too long. A rebound effect is the worsening of symptoms when a drug is discontinued. This is a result of a tissue dependence on the medication.''Some people with allergies need specialized prescription medications such as ''corticosteroids'', ''cromolyn'', and ipratropium (''Atrovent'') nasal sprays. These nasal sprays do not cause the rebound effect noticed with decongestant nasal sprays. Cortisone nasal sprays are very effective in reducing the inflammation that causes swelling, sneezing, and a runny nose. Cortisone can also decrease the formation of many chemicals involved in the allergic response. Many cortisone nasal sprays are on the market through prescription only. Intranasal steroids are typically the first-line medications for patients suffering from persistent allergies. Fluticasone (''Flonase'') is one medication available over the counter.''Cromolyn is also an anti-inflammatory medication available over the counter. Although cromolyn is not as potent as cortisone, it is very safe. Cromolyn must be used well in advance of anticipated allergy symptoms to be useful. Ipratropium (Atrovent) nasal spray is available for drying a wet runny nose. It will not prevent allergic reactions. This is an ''atropine'' derivative and although usually very safe, a person sensitive to atropine should be cautious when taking this drug.''Montelukast'' (''Singulair'') is an inhibitor of leukotriene action, another chemical involved in the allergic reaction. This medication is used for therapy of ''asthma'' and has also been approved for treatment of allergic rhinitis, but it is not a first-line therapy. It has been shown to be most effective in those for whom significant congestion is a primary complaint. It may also be used in some cases together with antihistamines.''If antihistamines and nasal sprays are not effective or not tolerated by the patient, other types of therapy are available. ''Allergy desensitization'' or immunotherapy may be needed. Allergy immunotherapy stimulates the immune system with gradually increasing doses of the substances to which a person is allergic. Because the patient is being exposed to the allergy-inducing substance, an allergic reaction can occur and this treatment should be supervised by a physician. Although the exact way allergy desensitization works is not completely known, allergy injections appear to modify or stop the allergic reaction by reducing the strength of the IgE and its effect on the mast cells. This form of treatment is very effective for allergies to pollen, mites, cats, and especially stinging insects (for example, bees). Allergy immunotherapy usually requires a series of injections (''allergy shots'') and takes three months to one year to become effective. The required length of treatment may vary, but three to five years is a typical course. Frequent office visits are necessary.''The duration of the effect of allergy immunotherapy should last many years, if not a lifetime. Although rare, serious allergy reactions can occur while receiving allergy injections. One cannot predict who will have a severe reaction. Even after years of receiving allergy shots, a patient can experience a reaction.'  "
Are there home remedies for hay fever?,"'A number of herbal or alternative treatments have been used for symptoms of hay fever. Scientific review of the use of these preparations has been limited, although there are some reports that suggest potential benefit for a number of different herbal remedies, at least in certain patients. These include the following:''Many herbal formulations contain a number of different ingredients, each with potentially varying effects and properties. People who wish to try one of these treatments should learn about potential side effects. These kinds of products are not evaluated for safety, like ''over-the-counter'' and prescription medications.' Certain Ayurvedic herbal mixes Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) Timofend (from Tinospora cordifolia) Cinnamon bark Benifuuki green tea"
What is the prognosis of allergic rhinitis?,"'Allergic rhinitis is a chronic condition, meaning that it persists over time. Some people who experience allergic rhinitis as children will notice their symptoms improve as they get older. Others may have symptoms for life. Allergic rhinitis is not associated with severe complications and can be managed effectively with medications and, in some cases, desensitization therapy.' "
Is it possible to prevent allergic rhinitis?,"'Because allergic rhinitis is related to genetic susceptibility, ''prevention'' of the condition is not possible. However, it may be possible for some people to prevent attacks by avoiding exposure to the triggering allergic substance.' "
What is hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in ''red blood cells'' that carries oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.""'Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. The normal adult hemoglobin (abbreviated Hgb or Hb) molecule contains two alpha-globulin chains and two beta-globulin chains. In fetuses and infants, beta chains are not common and the hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two gamma chains. As the infant grows, the gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains, forming the adult hemoglobin structure.''Each globulin chain contains an important iron-containing porphyrin compound termed heme. Embedded within the heme compound is an iron atom that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood.''Hemoglobin also plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells. In their natural shape, red blood cells are round with narrow centers resembling a donut without a hole in the middle. Abnormal hemoglobin structure can, therefore, disrupt the shape of red blood cells and impede their function and flow through blood vessels.' "
How is hemoglobin measured?,"'Hemoglobin is usually measured as a part of the routine ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') test from a blood sample.''Several methods exist for measuring hemoglobin, most of which are done currently by automated machines designed to perform different tests on blood. Within the machine, the red blood cells are broken down to get the hemoglobin into a solution. The free hemoglobin is exposed to a chemical containing cyanide that binds tightly with the hemoglobin molecule to form cyanomethemoglobin. By shining a light through the solution and measuring how much light is absorbed (specifically at a wavelength of 540 nanometers), the amount of hemoglobin can be determined.' "
What are normal hemoglobin values?,"'The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters.''The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are:''All of these values may vary slightly between laboratories. Some laboratories do not differentiate between adult and ""after middle age"" hemoglobin values. ''Pregnant'' females are advised to avoid both high and low hemoglobin levels to avoid increasing risks of stillbirths (high hemoglobin – above the normal range) and premature birth or low-birth-weight baby (low hemoglobin – below the normal range).' Newborns: 17 to 22 gm/dL One (1) week of age: 15 to 20 gm/dL One (1) month of age: 11 to 15 gm/dL Children: 11 to 13 gm/dL Adult males: 14 to 18 gm/dL Adult women: 12 to 16 gm/dL Men after middle age: 12.4 to 14.9 gm/dL Women after middle age: 11.7 to 13.8 gm/dL"
What does a low hemoglobin level mean?,"'A ''low hemoglobin level'' is referred to as ''anemia'' or low red blood count. A lower than normal number of red blood cells is referred to as ''anemia'' and hemoglobin levels reflect this number. There are many reasons (causes) for anemia.''Some of the more common causes of anemia are:' loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, colon cancer, or stomach ulcer), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by cancer), suppression by red blood cell synthesis bychemotherapy drugs, kidney failure, and abnormal hemoglobin structure (sickle cell anemia or thalassemia)."
What does a high hemoglobin level mean?,"'Higher than normal hemoglobin levels can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in people who smoke. ''Dehydration'' produces a falsely high hemoglobin measurement that disappears when proper fluid balance is restored.''Some other infrequent causes are high hemoglobin levels are:' advanced lung disease (for example, emphysema); certain tumors; a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera, and; abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for blood doping purposes (increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body by chemically raising the production of red blood cells)."
What is sickle cell disease?,"'Sickle cell disease'' is a genetic condition in which the quality of hemoglobin is defective. This condition can cause abnormal hemoglobin that can result in abnormally-shaped (sickled) red blood cells (see illustration). These abnormal red blood cells cannot easily pass through small blood vessels leading to inadequate oxygen for the tissues of the body.''Sickle cells also have a shorter life span than normal red blood cells (10 to 20 days compared to 120 days). This rapid turnover may result in inadequate time to replace the red blood cells and may result in anemia.''In ''sickle cell anemia'', one defective hemoglobin gene is ''inherited'' from each parent. If only one gene is inherited from one parent, then the condition is milder and referred to as sickle cell trait.''Symptoms of sickle cell anemia vary depending on its severity. Patients with sickle cell trait may experience mild, if any, symptoms at all. In sickle cell disease, symptoms are more significant, especially in episodes of acute crisis. These symptoms can include:' generalized body aches and pain, chest pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, ulceration of skin, fatigue, strokes, blindness, and delayed growth and puberty."
What is thalassemia?,"""Thalassemia is a group of hereditary conditions with quantitative hemoglobin deficiency. The body's failure to make globulin molecules will lead to a compensatory mechanism to make other less compatible globulin molecules. The different types of thalassemia are defined based on what type of globulin molecule is deficient. The severity of these conditions depends on the type of deficient globulin chain, the number of deficient globulins, and the severity of the underproduction. Mild disease may only present as mild anemia whereas severe deficiency may not be compatible with life."" "
What is the hemoglobin A1c test?,"'Hemoglobin A1c'' or glycosylated hemoglobin is a rough indication of blood ''sugar'' control in people with ''diabetes mellitus'' over the preceding 3 months. As more glucose (blood ''sugar'') circulates in the blood on a daily basis, more glucose is bound to the circulating hemoglobin. Normal hemoglobin A1c levels range between 4% to 5.9%. As this number reaches 6% or greater, it signifies poorer ''diabetes'' control.''A hemoglobin A1c of 6% roughly correlates with an average blood sugar level of 135 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliters) over the previous 3 months. Each 1% increase in hemoglobin A1c above 6% represents an average blood sugar of approximately 35 mg/dL over 135 mg/dL. For example, a hemoglobin A1c measurement of 7% corresponds to an average blood sugar level of 170 mg/dL in the previous 3 months.' "
How can a person increase his or her hemoglobin level?,"'There are a number of ways to increase hemoglobin levels. In general, low hemoglobin levels that need to be increased are caused by three circumstances: decreased red blood cell production (for example, altered bone marrow hemoglobin production, ''iron deficiency''), increased red blood cell destruction (for example, ''liver disease''), and by blood loss (for example, ''trauma'' from a gunshot or knife ''wound''). Addressing these underlying causes of low hemoglobin levels initially determines what method to use to increase hemoglobin levels.''Methods to increase hemoglobin levels are varied and their use depends on the underlying problems. Some of the ways to increase hemoglobin include:''Individuals should not take iron ''supplements'' or other treatments for low hemoglobin levels without first discussing such treatments with their physician as side effects from these treatments and/or excess iron intake may cause additional problems. Also, iron ''supplements'' should be kept away from children as iron poisoning in young children can be fatal.' transfusing red blood cells receiving erythropoietin (a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell production in individuals with decreased red blood cell production or increased red cell destruction) taking iron supplements increasing the intake of iron-rich foods (eggs, spinach, artichokes, beans, lean meats, and seafood) and foods rich in cofactors (such as vitamin B6, folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin C) important for maintaining normal hemoglobin levels. Such foods include fish, vegetables, nuts, cereals, peas, and citrus fruits."
What is high blood pressure? What is normal blood pressure?," High blood pressure (hypertension) is defined as high pressure (tension) in the arteries, which are the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers:The systolic blood pressure (the top number) equals the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts.The diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes. The systolic blood pressure (the top number) equals the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts. The diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology released new guidelines for high blood pressure.Blood pressure between 120/80 and 129/80 is elevated blood pressure, and a blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. Blood pressure between 120/80 and 129/80 is elevated blood pressure, and a blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. The American Academy of Cardiology defines blood pressure ranges as:Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg, and hypertension stage 2 is 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg or higher. Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg, and hypertension stage 2 is 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg or higher. Complications of high blood pressure include heart disease, kidney (renal) disease, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), eye damage, and stroke (brain damage). Hypertension is a major public health problem. With the new guidelines for defining high blood presure, The American Heart Association estimates high blood pressure affects nearly half of all adults (46%) in the United States."
What do blood pressure readings mean? (blood pressure readings chart) ,"'Blood pressure readings can vary in a single person throughout the day depending on the situation. Factors such as ''stress'', ''anxiety'', foods are eaten (''caffeine'' or salt intake), ''smoking'' or ''exercise'' can cause pressure to rise.''The American Heart Association defines normal blood pressure as less than 120/80. Elevated blood pressure ranges between 120/80 and 129/80, and high blood pressure is 130/80 and higher. In ''pregnancy'', normal blood pressure should be below 120/80.''If your blood pressure reaches into the high range, you should see your doctor about lifestyle changes, and possibly medication especially if you have other risk factors, such as ''diabetes'' or ''heart disease''.''High blood pressure (for example, 180/110 or higher) may indicate an emergency situation. If this high blood pressure is associated with ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', ''headache'', ''dizziness'', or back or ''abdominal pain'', seek medical care immediately. If you are experiencing no associated symptoms with a high blood pressure reading such as this, re-check it again within a few minutes and contact your doctor or go to an emergency room if it is still high.''If your blood pressure is lower than about 100/60 you may have ''low blood pressure'', depending on the associated symptoms. If you are unsure, check with your doctor.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of high blood pressure?,"'High blood pressure may not have any symptoms and so hypertension has been labeled ""the silent killer."" Longstanding high blood pressure can lead to multiple complications including ''heart attack'', ''kidney disease'', or ''stroke''.''Some people experience symptoms with their high blood pressure. These symptoms include:'

What causes high blood pressure?,"'The causes of hypertension are multifactorial, meaning there are several factors whose combined effects produce hypertension.'   High salt intake or salt sensitivity: This occurs in certain populations such as the elderly, African Americans, people who are obese, or people with kidney (renal) problems. Genetic predisposition to high blood pressure: People who have one or two parents with hypertension have high blood pressure incidence about twice as high as the general population. A particular abnormality of the arteries, which results in an increased resistance (stiffness or lack of elasticity) in the tiny arteries (arterioles): This increased peripheral arteriolar stiffness develops in individuals who are also obese, do not exercise, have high salt intake, and are older."
How is blood pressure measured?,"'Blood pressure is measured by a blood pressure cuff (sphygmomanometer). The blood pressure cuff consists of an air pump, a pressure gauge, and a rubber cuff. The instrument measures the blood pressure in units called millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).''The cuff is placed around the upper arm and inflated with an air pump to a pressure that blocks the flow of blood in the main artery that travels through the arm. The arm is held at the side of the body at the level of the heart, and the pressure of the cuff is gradually released. As the pressure decreases, a health practitioner listens with a stethoscope over the artery at the front of the elbow or an electronic machine senses the pulsation. The pressure at which the practitioner (or machine) first hears a pulsation from the artery is the systolic pressure (the top number). As the cuff pressure decreases further, the pressure at which the pulsation finally stops is the diastolic pressure (the bottom number).' "
How is high blood pressure diagnosed?,"'To make an official diagnosis of high blood pressure you will need to see your doctor. Often your blood pressure will be checked on at least two different visits, at different times of the day. Your doctor may ask you to keep a blood pressure log for a short time in order to see your overall blood pressure trends. If your blood pressure is consistently over 134/80, your doctor will work with you to determine the best regimen for treating your high blood pressure.' "
What is the treatment for high blood pressure?,"'Blood pressure is caused by many different factors, so there are many different treatments. The goal of treating high blood pressure is to keep the blood pressure below 134/80.''Treatments for high blood pressure include:'   Lifestyle modifications:Quit smokingLose weight if you are overweightExerciseAvoid alcoholEat a low-sodium, low-fat diet like the DASH diet. Quit smoking Lose weight if you are overweight Exercise Avoid alcohol Eat a low-sodium, low-fat diet like the DASH diet.

What changes in diet help lower blood pressure naturally?,"'Dietary changes are often the first line of treatment recommended by your doctor. You may be advised to:''Doctors often recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet created by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), which focuses on whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, and lean meats.''In addition to dietary modification, quitting ''smoking'' is extremely beneficial in managing high blood pressure.'   Limit caffeine intake Reduce salt intake Limit fatty foods Avoid alcohol Manage cholesterol Add potassium-rich foods to your diet (unless you are being treated for kidney failure, as potassium rich foods may be harmful to you)"
Can exercise help lower high blood pressure?,"'Exercise and physical activity help lower blood pressure by helping you lose weight and keeping your heart and blood vessels in good condition.''Weight loss'' achieved through diet and exercise helps control factors such as blood ''sugar'', and other complications of obesity. Avoiding these complications helps lower blood pressure and prevent high blood pressure.''Consult your doctor before starting any new exercise program. Cardiovascular activities including ''walking'', jogging, biking, or ''swimming'' for 30 to 45 minutes per day can help lower blood pressure.' "
What alternative therapies help lower and mangage high blood pressure?,"'Some ''complementary and alternative medicine'' strategies can help you manage your high blood pressure and prevent it from becoming elevated further.' Reduce stress. Use relaxation methods such as deep breathing, imagery relaxation, yoga, meditation, and biofeedback. Keep a daily blood pressure chart. Get adequate sleep. Some home remedies, such as garlic, coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10), calcium, magnesium, fish oil, and flaxseed have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure. Consult your physician before taking any supplements."
What is hepatitis?,"""The term 'hepatitis' simply means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis may be caused by a variety of viruses or other infections, medications, or a toxin such as ""'alcohol''. Hepatitis viruses that can cause injury to liver cells in addition to hepatitis B include the ''hepatitis A'' and ''hepatitis C'' viruses. These viruses are not related to each other or to the hepatitis B virus, and they differ in their structure, the ways they are spread among individuals, the severity of symptoms they can cause, the way they are treated, and the outcome of the infection. Other hepatitis viruses (hepatitis D, ''hepatitis E'', and ''hepatitis G'') cause disease much less commonly.''Other viruses that infect the liver but which are not specifically ""hepatitis viruses"" include ''Epstein-Barr virus'' (''EBV'', the virus that causes ''mononucleosis'') and ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'').''Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).''In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in 887,000 deaths, mostly from complications (including cirrhosis and hepatocellular ''carcinoma'').''It is estimated that 257 million people are living with hepatitis B virus infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-positive). According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 19,000 new cases of hepatitis B occurred in the United States in 2016.''After a marked decline in acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections reported to CDC since the 1990s, due to the widespread introduction of hepatitis B vaccination, there has been no consistent trend in acute HBV cases since 2012; that is, reported cases have been fluctuating around 3,000 cases each year. In 2016, there were 3,218 cases reported to the CDC. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, the estimated number of new HBV infections in 2016 was 20,900.'""When a person first gets hepatitis B, they are said to have an 'acute' infection. Most people are able to eliminate the virus and are cured of the infection. Some are not able to clear the virus and have a 'chronic' infection with hepatitis B that is usually life-long (see below). In the United States, an estimated 2.2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B.""'Hepatitis B is found throughout the world. Some countries have much higher rates of infection than the United States; for example, in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10% to 30% of adults are chronically infected with hepatitis B.''The hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is made up of deoxyribonucleic acids. It belongs to a family of viruses known as ''Hepadnaviridae''. The virus is primarily found in the liver but is also present in the blood and certain body fluids.''Hepatitis B virus consists of a core particle (central portion) and a surrounding envelope (outer coat). The core is made up of DNA and the core antigen (HBcAg). The envelope contains the surface antigen (HBsAg). These antigens are present in the blood and are markers that are used in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with suspected ''viral hepatitis''.''The hepatitis B virus reproduces in liver cells, but the virus itself is not the direct cause of damage to the liver. Rather, the presence of the virus triggers an immune response from the body as the body tries to eliminate the virus and recover from the infection. This immune response causes inflammation and may seriously injure liver cells. Therefore, there is a balance between the protective and destructive effects of the immune response to the hepatitis B virus.'  "
What are the symptoms of acute hepatitis B?,"'Acute hepatitis B is the period of illness that occurs during the first one to four months after acquiring the virus.Most healthy adults do not develop significant symptoms during acute infection. Early symptoms may be non-specific, including ''fever'', a ''flu-like'' illness, and ''joint pains''. Symptoms of acute hepatitis may include:''Rarely, acute hepatitis damages the liver so badly it can no longer function. This life-threatening condition is called ""fulminant hepatitis."" Patients with fulminant hepatitis are at risk of developing bleeding problems and ''coma'' resulting from the failure of the liver. Patients with fulminant hepatitis should be evaluated for liver transplantation.\xa0'""The body's immune response is the major determinant of the outcome in acute hepatitis B. Individuals who develop a strong immune response to the infection are more likely to clear the virus and recover. However, these patients also are more likely to develop more severe liver injury and symptoms due to the strong immune response that is trying to eliminate the virus. On the other hand, a weaker immune response results in less liver injury and fewer symptoms but a higher risk of developing chronic hepatitis B. People who recover and eliminate the virus will develop life-long immunity, that is, protection from subsequent infection from hepatitis B.""'Most infants and children who acquire acute hepatitis B viral infection have no symptoms. In these individuals, the immune system fails to mount a vigorous response to the virus. Consequently, the risk of an infected infant developing chronic hepatitis B is approximately 90%. In contrast, only 30% to 50% of people older than 5 years who have acute hepatitis B develop chronic hepatitis B.' fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and pain in the upper right abdomen (due to the inflamed liver)."
What are the symptoms of chronic hepatitis B?,"'The liver is a vital organ that has many functions. These include a role in the immune system, production of clotting factors, producing bile for ''digestion'';\xa0storing nutrients including sugars, ''fats'' and ''minerals'' for use by the body later; processing medications; and breaking down toxic substances. Patients with chronic hepatitis B develop symptoms in proportion to the degree of abnormalities in these functions. The signs and symptoms of chronic hepatitis B vary widely depending on the severity of the liver damage. They range from few and relatively mild signs and symptoms to signs and symptoms of severe ''liver disease''\xa0(cirrhosis or liver failure).'""Most individuals with chronic hepatitis B remain symptom free for many years or decades. During this time, the patient's ""'liver function'' blood tests usually are normal or only mildly abnormal. Some patients may deteriorate and develop inflammation or symptoms, putting them at risk for developing cirrhosis.''Inflammation from chronic hepatitis B can progress to cirrhosis (severe scarring) of the liver. Significant amounts of scarring and cirrhosis lead to liver dysfunction.''Symptoms may include:''Decreased absorption of ''vitamins'' A and D can cause impaired vision at night and thinning of bones (''osteoporosis''). Patients with liver cirrhosis also are at risk of infections because the liver plays an important role in the immune system.''In patients with advanced cirrhosis, the liver begins to fail. This is life-threatening condition.''Several complications occur in advanced cirrhosis:''Patients with chronic hepatitis B are at risk of developing ''liver cancer''. The way in which the ''cancer'' develops is not fully understood. ''Symptoms of liver cancer'' are nonspecific. Patients may have no symptoms, or they may experience ''abdominal pain'' and swelling, an ''enlarged liver'', ''weight loss'', and ''fever''. The most useful diagnostic screening tests for liver ''cancer'' are a blood test for a protein produced by the ''cancer'' called alpha-fetoprotein and an ''ultrasound'' imaging study of the liver. These two tests are used to screen patients with chronic hepatitis B, especially if they have cirrhosis or a family history of liver cancer.''Rarely, chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to disorders that affect organs other than the liver. These conditions are caused when the normal immune response to hepatitis B mistakenly attacks uninfected organs.''Among these conditions are:' weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, breast enlargement in men, a rash on the palms, difficulty with blood clotting, and spider-like blood vessels on the skin. Confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) results from the inability of the liver to detoxify certain toxic substances. Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) causes fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and may result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and may cause massive bleeding. Portal hypertension can also cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia, increased risk of infection and bleeding. In advanced cirrhosis, liver failure also results in decreased production of clotting factors. This causes abnormalities in blood clotting and sometimes spontaneous bleeding. Patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound, called bilirubin. Polyarteritis nodosa: a disease characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels throughout the body. This condition can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, nerve damage, deep skin ulcers, kidney problems, high blood pressure, unexplained fevers, and abdominal pain. Glomerulonephritis: another rare condition, which is inflammation of the small filtering units of the kidney."
How is the hepatitis B virus spread (transmitted)?,"'Hepatitis B is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. In infected individuals, the virus can be found in the blood, semen, ''vaginal discharge'', ''breast milk'', and saliva. Hepatitis B is not spread through food, water, or by casual contact.''In the United States, sexual contact is the most common means of transmission, followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs, tattooing, body piercing, or ''acupuncture''. Additionally, hepatitis B can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood.''Hepatitis B also may be spread from infected mothers to their ''babies'"" at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). This is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis B rates are high. The rate of transmission of hepatitis B from mother to ""'newborn'' is very high, and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis B. Fortunately, transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis (see below). ''Rarely, hepatitis B can be transmitted through transfused blood products, donated livers and other organs. However, blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.'  "
How is hepatitis B diagnosed?,"'Infection with hepatitis B is suspected when the medical history and the physical examination reveal risk factors for the infection or symptoms and signs that are suggestive of hepatitis B. Abnormalities in the ''liver tests'' (blood tests) also can raise suspicion; however, ''abnormal liver tests'"" can result from many conditions that affect the liver. The diagnosis of hepatitis B can be made only with specific hepatitis B virus blood tests. These tests are known as hepatitis 'markers' or 'serologies.'""'Markers found in the blood can confirm hepatitis B infection and differentiate acute from chronic infection. These markers are substances produced by the hepatitis B virus (antigens) and antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the virus. Hepatitis B virus has three antigens for which there are commonly-used tests - the surface antigen (HBsAg), the core antigen (HBcAg) and the e antigen (HBeAg).''The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood indicates that the patient is currently infected with the virus. HBsAg appears an average of four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. Individuals who recover from acute hepatitis B infections clear the blood of HBsAg within approximately four months after the onset of symptoms. These individuals develop antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Anti-HBs provides complete immunity to subsequent hepatitis B viral infection. Similarly, individuals who are successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B produce anti-HBs in the blood.''Patients who fail to clear the virus during an acute episode develop chronic hepatitis B. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is made when the HBsAg is present in the blood for at least six months. In chronic hepatitis B, HBsAg can be detected for many years, and anti-HBs does not appear.''In acute hepatitis, a specific class of early antibodies (IgM) appears that is directed against the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM). Later, another class of antibody, anti-HBc IgG, develops and persists for life, regardless of whether the individual recovers or develops chronic infection. Only anti-HBc IgM can be used to diagnose an acute hepatitis B infection.''Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is present when the hepatitis B virus is actively multiplying, whereas the production of the antibody, anti-HBe, (also called HBeAg seroconversion) signifies a more inactive state of the virus and a lower risk of transmission.''In some individuals infected with hepatitis B virus, the genetic material for the virus has undergone a structural change, called a pre-core mutation. This mutation results in an inability of the hepatitis B virus to produce HBeAg, even though the virus is actively reproducing. This means that even though no HBeAg is detected in the blood of people with the mutation, the hepatitis B virus is still active in these people and they can infect others.'""The best marker of hepatitis B virus reproduction is the level of hepatitis B virus DNA in the blood. Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in a blood sample signals that the virus is actively multiplying. In acute hepatitis, HBV DNA is present soon after infection, but is eliminated over time in patients' who clear the infection. In chronic hepatitis, levels of HBV DNA often continue to be elevated for many years and then decrease as the immune system controls the virus. HBV DNA levels are sometimes referred to as the 'viral load'.""'The following table gives the usual interpretation for sets of results from hepatitis B blood (serological) tests.'""*Interpretation of the hepatitis B virus blood tests should always be made by an experienced clinician with knowledge of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and results of the standard ""'liver blood tests''. Other conditions present in a patient can alter the way these test results are interpreted.'  "
What is the role of a liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis B?,"'During a ''liver biopsy'', a small sample of liver tissue is collected and examined under the microscope. This test is valuable because this sample reflects the health of the liver. It can show the amount of liver injury (inflammation or cirrhosis). Liver biopsy is not routinely needed to diagnose hepatitis B, but it is used for monitoring the progression of liver damage in people with chronic hepatitis and helping to choose or evaluate treatment options.' "
What is the natural course of chronic hepatitis B?,"""The course of chronic hepatitis B is variable and depends on several factors. These factors are the patient's age at which the infection began, the extent of viral multiplication, and the immune system's ability to control the infection.""'The infection can progress from an: ''For individuals infected at birth or at a young age, the immune system initially does not react to the hepatitis B virus. This phase of the infection is known as the immune tolerant phase. Despite high levels of virus in the body, there may be little evidence of inflammation and no symptoms. This phase typically lasts for years, even up to two or three decades. It is important to know that the immune tolerant phase is generally not seen in individuals who become infected during adulthood.''During the third to fourth decade of chronic hepatitis B acquired in childhood, the immune system may start to react to the virus. This is known as the immune clearance phase. In contrast, an infection acquired in adulthood usually begins with the immune clearance phase. In the immune clearance phase, the immune system attacks the hepatitis B virus-infected liver cells in an attempt to clear the virus. This causes inflammation, liver injury, and the development of ''scar tissue''. Standard liver blood tests are abnormal, and the liver biopsy shows inflammation and/or formation of ''scar'' tissue (fibrosis). The severity of liver cell destruction, the degree of fibrosis, and the duration of the immune clearance phase determine the outcome of chronic hepatitis B. The more severe the destruction and fibrosis and the longer the phase, the more likely it is that cirrhosis will develop.''Following the immune clearance phase, the viral infection may enter a less active phase known as the quiescent phase. During this phase, there are no symptoms, the levels of hepatitis B virus become very low, and the standard liver blood tests become normal or nearly normal. Advanced scaring or cirrhosis that may have developed earlier, however, remains. Occasionally, during the quiescent phase, the virus becomes active again. This is known as a ""flare,"" and often is associated with symptoms, abnormal liver blood tests, and further injury to the liver. The flares are caused by reactivation of the immune system against the virus. Flares can be very severe and result in further scarring of the liver. The disease in many of these individuals will progress to cirrhosis and eventually to advanced or end-stage cirrhosis with its associated complications, including liver cancer.''Infected individuals who experience a mild immune clearance phase and move into the quiescent phase are known as healthy carriers of hepatitis B virus. These individuals usually have normal liver tests and do not have symptoms; however, they can still transmit the hepatitis B viral infection to others. The risk of hepatitis B virus carriers developing cirrhosis and liver cell cancer is small although the risk is higher as compared to people without chronic hepatitis B.' immune tolerant phase (in which the immune system ignores the virus) immune clearance phase (in which the immune system attempts to eliminate the virus) quiescent phase (in which the virus is less active)"
What medications are used to treat hepatitis B?,"'Acute infection with hepatitis B usually does not require treatment. In rare cases, however, the infection may cause life-threatening liver failure. Patients with liver failure due to acute hepatitis B should be evaluated for liver transplantation.\xa0'""If a person is chronically infected with hepatitis B and has few signs or symptoms of complications, medications usually are not used. These patients are watched carefully and given periodic blood tests. One test measures the 'viral load,' that is, the amount of viral DNA in the blood. Doctors will recommend treatment if there are signs that the virus is beginning to cause damage or if the viral load is high. Another reason to prescribe medication is if the patient has a positive test for the Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) in the blood. HBeAg is associated with an increased risk of progression of ""'liver disease'' and its complications.''In chronic hepatitis B, the goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of complications including cirrhosis and liver failure. However, it takes decades for complications to occur, which makes it difficult to study the effect of medications. As a substitute for waiting years to find out what happens, scientists have used tests like the viral load or liver function tests to evaluate if medicines are working. This is logical because it is known that people who have large amounts of the virus in their blood are at highest risk to get cirrhosis. Up to one-third of people with very high viral loads (more than one million viral copies per milliliter of blood) will develop cirrhosis over a decade, compared to only 4.5% of those with low viral loads (fewer than 300 viral copies per milliliter).''Medications can reduce the number of viruses in the body and may be able to eliminate the virus from the bloodstream. Logically, this should lead to them having a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (<1% per year), although large, long-term studies have not been done. Even in people who clear the virus from their blood, low numbers of viruses still live in the liver and other cells. Thus, the medications do not cure the disease, but they can prevent or delay complications and symptoms. People who have a good response to treatment can still transmit the virus. Doctors follow blood tests that measure viral load and liver function and they may recommend liver biopsies to evaluate if the medications are working.''The medications in current use for chronic hepatitis B include the interferons and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. New agents are being developed although they are still under investigation and considered experimental. There are no accepted guidelines that tell how every patient should be treated. As a result, treatment is individualized.''Interferon'""-alpha has been used to treat hepatitis B for more than 20 years. Interferon-alpha is a naturally occurring protein that is made in the body by white blood cells to combat viral infections. In addition to its direct anti-viral effects, interferon works against the hepatitis B virus by stimulating the body's immune system to clear the virus. Compared to older interferon alpha agents, pegylated interferon alpha, marketed as Pegasys or Pegintron, has a more convenient dosing schedule, may be slightly more effective and suppresses the virus for a longer period of time. Pegylated interferon alpha is given once a week for 48 weeks.""'Only about a third of people who have Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) in their blood will be able to eliminate HBeAg and produce antibodies against the HBe antigen after treatment with interferon. Relapse may occur after treatment is stopped.'""Sustained response (undetectable viral load in the blood, normal liver function tests) occurs in approximately less than a third of patients after the drug is stopped. Although this is not a cure (some virus still lives in the liver and elsewhere), people with sustained response are at low risk for complications of liver disease. If the responder's immune system is compromised, for example through the use of steroids or acquiring ""'HIV'', the disease can recur. Periodic monitoring of blood tests can help confirm that the response continues to be sustained.''Interferon causes several side effects including:''The side effects may be severe enough that the patient is unable to continue treatment. During treatment, the normal immune response to the virus is stimulated and may cause worsening inflammation in the liver. This is normally a good sign showing that the interferon is working, but more extreme responses may in rare cases cause liver failure. Thus, physicians will monitor blood tests closely during therapy. People with unstable liver disease due to cirrhosis usually should not take interferon because of the increased risk of liver failure.''Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are man-made chemicals that mimic the nucleosides and nucleotides that are used for making DNA. When the virus tries to use the analogues to make its own DNA, it is unable to make the DNA and, therefore, cannot reproduce. Examples of these agents include adefovir (''Hepsera''), entecavir (Baraclude), ''lamivudine'' (''Epivir''-HBV, Heptovir, Heptodin), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and ''tenofovir'' (''Viread'').''Unfortunately, the hepatitis B virus may become resistant to NAs over time (see below). Adefovir may be effective against ''strains'' of virus that have become resistant to lamivudine and may be added to lamivudine when resistance appears. Simply switching from one NA to another is not recommended because this leads to virus strains that are resistant to multiple medications.''Currently, the optimal duration of treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is uncertain. people with HBeAg may be treated until six months after the HBeAg disappears from the blood and is replaced by antibodies (anti-HBe), if this occurs. In people without HBeAg, the endpoints are less clear. Some experts advocate treating until the viral load (viral DNA) is undetectable and the surface antigen (HbsAg) has been cleared from the blood. Others suggest continuing medications for prolonged periods to suppress the virus. All of these strategies are hampered by the risk of the virus becoming resistant to the medications. Patients who discontinue treatment with NAs should be monitored carefully for recurrent hepatitis, which may be severe.''There are no clear guidelines to recommend which agent to use first in treating chronic hepatitis B, as there are multiple options. Interferon is given for a defined period of time and may have a more prolonged response after the medication is discontinued than NAs. However, interferon is given as an injection, and side effects often are troublesome. NAs are given as a pill and have few side effects, but the duration of treatment is unclear, and prolonged therapy (years) may be required. NAs may be preferred in patients with unstable disease and cirrhosis because they are thought to be less likely to cause serious flares of hepatitis with more severe liver disease.' A significant reduction in the viral load or elimination of detectable viral DNA from the blood occurs in 25%-37% of people during treatment. Blood tests for liver functions normalize in approximately 23%-39% people treated with interferon or pegylated interferon. People who have significant abnormalities in liver function before therapy are more likely to respond to treatment. Those who have normal liver blood tests before treatment are less likely to respond to interferon therapy. Liver biopsy results show improvement in about one-third of patients. fatigue, generalized muscle aches, fever, chills and loss of appetite. These flu-like symptoms occur in approximately 80% of treated patients; mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects may occur; and thyroid gland abnormalities resulting inhypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone); significant suppression of thebone marrow and production of blood cells; infection; or hair loss may occur."
What are the effects of alcohol on hepatitis B?,"'Agents that damage the liver are particularly harmful in patients who already have hepatitis B. For this reason, it is recommended that people with hepatitis B avoid drinking alcohol.' "
What are the effects of immunosuppressive medications on hepatitis B?,"'Even in people with chronic hepatitis B, the immune system is working to suppress the virus. Medications that suppress the immune system allow the virus to reproduce in large numbers and may cause the hepatitis to flare. ''Examples of medications that suppress the immune system are:'""If an immunosuppressant drug is stopped, the body's immune system's activity may rebound and cause severe inflammation of the liver. "" prednisone: used to treat many diseases, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain types of skin disease and arthritis methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall): used to treat certain types of skin disease, arthritis, and cancer;  cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan): used to treat some cancers. 
"
What is delta hepatitis?,"'Delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis B. The delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis D or HDV) is an RNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. It is spread through exposure to contaminated blood, especially with illicit, intravenous ''drug use'', and by sexual contact. Delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis B. When this happens, infected people are quite sick but most are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. People who already have chronic hepatitis B can acquire delta hepatitis as well. This often causes severe inflammation of the liver, and the viruses are less likely to be cleared.''Delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis B much worse. It increases the risk of complications, especially cirrhosis, which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients.''There is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. Interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis, but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. ''Prevention'' includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners, using barrier methods of ''contraception''). Universal vaccination of newborns with ''hepatitis B vaccine'' effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis B virus.' "
What about co-infection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus?,"'Hepatitis C'' is caused by a virus that is spread through contaminated needles or blood products and, less commonly, through sexual intercourse. Few patients with chronic hepatitis B also are co-infected chronically with hepatitis C virus (''HCV''). The two viruses interfere with each other and one usually predominates. If hepatitis C is the predominant infection, treatment is directed against the hepatitis C. Patients infected with both viruses are at higher risk for complications of liver disease. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C. People with hepatitis C should be vaccinated against hepatitis B to prevent co-infection.' "
What happens in co-infection with hepatitis B virus and HIV?,"'The ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') and hepatitis B virus are transmitted in similar ways, and it is not uncommon for an individual to have both infections. People with ''HIV'' who acquire hepatitis B are more likely to become chronically infected with hepatitis B than people who do not have HIV. The reason for this is thought to be that HIV suppresses the immune system and impairs the ability of the body to eliminate the hepatitis B virus. Some nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (a class of antiretroviral drugs) are used to treat both HIV and hepatitis B, although dosages may vary in the two different infections. Stopping one of these agents when the HIV regimen is adjusted may cause hepatitis to flare.' "
What is new in the treatment of hepatitis B?,'New agents are under development to treat hepatitis B. Many of these are nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that investigators hope will be more effective than older agents. Experts also are working on treatment guidelines and the use of multi-drug therapy. Vaccination remains the key to preventing hepatitis B and holds the most promise for reducing disease burden.'  
What is the role of liver transplantation in hepatitis B?,"'Liver transplantation has been successful in patients who have irreversible, life-threatening complications of hepatitis B. This includes patients with liver failure due to end-stage cirrhosis or unusually severe (fulminant) hepatitis. Liver transplantation does not cure hepatitis B, and hepatitis may occur in the new liver. The incidence of recurrent hepatitis has been reduced to less than 10% through use of lamivudine and HBIG in transplant recipients. Use of these agents has also improved long-term survival, with 75% of patients alive after five years.' "
What can be done to prevent hepatitis B?,"'Hepatitis B is a preventable disease. Vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis have significantly reduced rates of infection. Risk can also be reduced by avoiding unprotected sex, contaminated needles, and other sources of infection.''The hepatitis B vaccine contains a protein (antigen) that stimulates the body to make protective antibodies. Examples of hepatitis B ''vaccines'' available in the United States include hepatitis B vaccine-injection (''Engerix-B'', Recombivax-HB). Three doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 months) are necessary to assure protection. There are also combination ''vaccines'' on the market that provide protection against hepatitis B and other diseases.''Examples include:''Hepatitis B ''vaccines'' are effective and safe. Most vaccinated individuals form effective antibodies and are protected from hepatitis B when they get full three-dose series of vaccine. In healthcare workers, high-risk public safety workers, ''dialysis'' patients, and sexual partners of infected people, a blood test for antibodies is recommended after vaccination to ensure that the person produced antibodies. For the few who do not form antibodies, revaccination may improve response, especially in infants. However, a small proportion of individuals will never respond to hepatitis B vaccination. Side effects from the vaccine are usually mild and include soreness at the site of injection. The risk of serious ''allergic'' reactions (''anaphylaxis'') is less than one per million doses. Vaccination has reduced the number of new cases of hepatitis B in the United States.''In the United States, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants at birth. Older children and adolescents should receive the vaccine if they did not do so at birth.''Adults in high risk situations also are advised to receive hepatitis B vaccine. This includes:''Centers that serve high-risk individuals are encouraged to provide the vaccine to their clients. Such centers include dialysis units, drug treatment facilities, ''sexually transmitted diseases'' clinics and correctional facilities. Some countries have a high prevalence of hepatitis B in their population. ''Travelers'' who visit these countries for a prolonged period of time (usually six months) and those who may be exposed to blood or semen should consider vaccination.''HBIG is a product that contains antibodies against hepatitis B. When injected, it provides temporary protection against hepatitis B. HBIG is used when people have had significant exposure to the virus. An example would be an accidental needle stick in an unvaccinated health care worker from a needle contaminated with blood from a person with hepatitis B. HBIG should be given as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within seven days. People who need HBIG should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. HBIG also is given to patients with hepatitis B following liver transplantation to suppress the hepatitis B virus in the transplanted liver.''Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to a known case of hepatitis B or to a person at high risk for hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician. Examples of such exposures include needle stick injuries in health care workers or sexual intercourse with an infected person. If the exposure is significant, the physician will recommend vaccination and also may recommend an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is prepared from the plasma of blood donors and contains antibodies to hepatitis B. Vaccination and HBIG can substantially reduce the risk of disease in people exposed to hepatitis B if given within one week of a needle stick or two weeks of sexual intercourse.''Vaccination provides long-term immunity in people who respond to the vaccine. There is no need for HBIG if an exposure occurs to a vaccinated person who is known to respond to the vaccine; however, a blood test might be drawn to verify that the person did respond to the vaccine.''Infected mothers can pass hepatitis B to their newborn infants. All ''pregnant'' women should have blood tested to determine if they are infected. Infants born to infected mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine at birth.' Hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a vaccine - injection (Twinrix), which provides protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

What is the hematocrit?,"'The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of ''red blood cells''. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.' "
How is the hematocrit measured?,"'The hematocrit is typically measured from a blood sample by an automated machine that makes several other measurements of the blood at the same time. Most of these machines in fact do not directly measure the hematocrit, but instead calculate it based on the determination of the amount of ''hemoglobin'' and the average volume of the red blood cells. The hematocrit can also be determined by a manual method using a centrifuge. When a tube of blood is centrifuged, the ''red cells'' will be packed into the bottom of the tube. The proportion of red cells to the total blood volume can then be visually measured.' "
What is a normal hematocrit ranges by ages?,"'The normal ranges for hematocrit are depended on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are:''These values may vary slightly among different laboratories.' "
What does a low hematocrit mean?,"'A person who has a low hematocrit is referred to as being ''anemic''. There are many reasons for ''anemia''. Some of the more common reasons are' loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, and colon cancer), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by cancer, suppression by chemotherapy drugs, kidney failure), and abnormal hemoglobin (sickle cell anemia)."
What does a high hematocrit mean?,"'Higher than normal hematocrit levels represent abnormally elevated red blood cell counts.''Some other infrequent causes of an elevated hematocrit are' High hematocrits can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in chronic smokers. Dehydration produces a falsely high hematocrit that disappears when the proper fluid balance is restored. lung disease, certain tumors, a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera, and abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for ""blood doping"" purposes."
What is PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method to analyze a short sequence of DNA (or RNA) even in samples containing only minute quantities of DNA or RNA. PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA. Previously, amplification of DNA involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria, and took weeks. But now, with PCR done in test tubes, it takes only a few hours. PCR is highly efficient in that untold numbers of copies can be made of the DNA. Moreover, PCR uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying DNA: ' Two ""primers"", short single-stranded DNA sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the DNA stretch to be copied;  An enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of DNA, reading its code and assembling a copy; and  A pile of DNA building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."
How is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) done?,"'As illustrated in the ''animated picture of PCR'', three major steps are involved in a PCR. These three steps are repeated for 30 or 40 cycles. The cycles are done on an automated cycler, a device which rapidly heats and cools the test tubes containing the reaction mixture. Each step -- denatauration (alteration of structure), annealing (joining), and extension -- takes place at a different temperature: ''With one cycle, a single segment of double-stranded DNA template is amplified into two separate pieces of double-stranded DNA. These two pieces are then available for amplification in the next cycle. As the cycles are repeated, more and more copies are generated and the number of copies of the template is increased exponentially.' Denaturation: At 94 C (201.2 F), the double-stranded DNA melts and opens into two pieces of single-stranded DNA.  Annealing: At medium temperatures, around 54 C (129.2 F), the primers pair up (anneal) with the single-stranded ""template"" (The template is the sequence of DNA to be copied.) On the small length of double-stranded DNA (the joined primer and template), the polymerase attaches and starts copying the template.  Extension: At 72 C (161.6 F), the polymerase works best, and DNA building blocks complementary to the template are coupled to the primer, making a double stranded DNA molecule."
What is the purpose of doing a PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'To do PCR, the original DNA that one wishes to copy need not be pure or abundant. It can be pure but it also can be a minute part of a mixture of materials. So, PCR has found widespread and innumerable uses -- to diagnose genetic diseases, do DNA fingerprinting, find bacteria and ''viruses'', study human evolution, clone the DNA of an Egyptian mummy, establish paternity or biological relationships, etc.. Accordingly, PCR has become an essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and many other laboratories that study genetic material.' "
How was PCR (polymerase chain reaction) discovered?,"'PCR was invented by Kary Mullis. At the time he thought up PCR in 1983, Mullis was working in Emeryville, California for Cetus, one of the first biotechnology companies. There, he was charged with making short chains of DNA for other scientists. Mullis has written that he conceived of PCR while cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway 128 one night on his motorcycle. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region. Mullis has said that before his motorcycle trip was over, he was already savoring the prospects of a Nobel Prize. He shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry with Michael Smith in 1993. ''As Mullis has written in the Scientific American: ""Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat."" ' "
What is RT PCR?,"'RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) is a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of mRNA (messenger RNA). The technique consists of two parts:''RT-PCR has been used to measure viral load with ''HIV'' and may also be used with other RNA viruses such as ''measles'' and ''mumps''.''Previous contributing author and editor: ''Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor:  Leslie J.

What is hepatitis C infection? How many people are infected?,"'Hepatitis C virus infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (also referred to as HCV or hep C). It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate hepatitis C from the body, and infection with hepatitis C usually becomes chronic. Over decades, chronic infection with hepatitis C damages the liver and can cause liver failure. In the U.S., the CDC has estimated that approximately 41,200 new cases of hepatitis C occurred in 2016. When the virus first enters the body there usually are no symptoms, so this number is an estimate. About 75%-85% of newly infected people become chronically infected. In the U.S., more than 2 million people are estimated to be chronically infected with hepatitis C. Infection is most commonly detected among people who are 40 to 60 years of age, reflecting the high rates of infection in the 1970s and 1980s. There are 8,000 to 10,000 deaths each year in the U.S. related to hepatitis C infection. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is a risk factor for ''liver cancer''. In 2016, 18,153 death certificates listed HCV as a contributing cause of death; this is believed to be an underestimate.''About 10%-20% of those who develop chronic HCV will develop ''cirrhosis'' within 20-30 years. Progression to cirrhosis may be accelerated by age over 50, male gender, ''alcohol'' consumption, nonalcoholic ''fatty liver disease'' (NASH), co-infection with ''hepatitis B'' or ''HIV'', and immune suppressing ''drugs''. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation due to liver failure in the U.S.''Those who have cirrhosis from HCV also have a yearly risk of liver ''cancer'' (hepatoma or hepatocellular ''carcinoma'') of about 1%-5%.' "
What is the hepatitis C virus?,"'Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C is one of several viruses that can cause viral hepatitis. It is unrelated to the other common hepatitis viruses (for example, ''hepatitis A'' or ''hepatitis B''). Hepatitis C is a member of the ''Flaviviridae'' family of viruses. Other members of this family of viruses include those that cause ''yellow fever'' and ''dengue fever''.''There are at least six different genotypes (''strains'') of the virus which have different genetic profiles (genotypes 1 to 6). In the U. S., genotype 1 is the most common strain of hepatitis C. Even within a single genotype there may be some variations (genotype 1a and 1b, for example). Genotyping is used to guide treatment because some viral genotypes respond better to some therapies than to others.''Like ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), hepatitis C multiplies very fast and attains very high levels in the body. The genes that make the surface proteins of the virus also mutate (change) quickly, and thousands of genetic variations of the virus (""quasi-species"") are produced daily. It is impossible for the body to keep up with making anti-HCV antibodies against all of the quasi-species circulating at one time. It has not been possible yet to develop an effective ''vaccine'' because the vaccine must protect against all genotypes.''Hepatitis C infection in the liver triggers the immune system, which leads to inflammation. About 20%-30% of those acutely infected will experience typical hepatitis symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', ''jaundice'', ''dark urine'' or clay-colored stools. However, chronic hepatitis C usually causes no symptoms until very late in the disease, and hepatitis C has been referred to by sufferers as the ""sleeping dragon."" Over several years or decades, chronic inflammation may cause death of liver cells and scarring (""fibrosis""). Extensive scarring in the liver is called cirrhosis. This progressively impairs vital functions of the liver. Cirrhotic livers are more prone to liver ''cancer''. Drinking alcohol speeds up liver damage with hepatitis C. Concurrent ''HIV'' infection, as well as acute ''hepatitis A'' or B infection, will also accelerate progression to cirrhosis.' "
What are the symptoms of hepatitis C infection?,"'About 70%-80% of people have no symptoms when they first get HCV infection. The remaining 20%-30% may have''Early ''symptoms of hepatitis C'' may include dark urine, yellow eyes, or clay-colored stools though this is unusual. Over time, people with chronic HCV infection may develop signs of liver inflammation that suggests that the infection may be present. Infected individuals may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. The later symptoms and signs of cirrhosis are often absent until inflammation is fairly advanced. As cirrhosis progresses, symptoms and signs increase and may include:'   fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, or fever. Elevated liver enzymes in the blood Weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss Breast enlargement in men (gynecomastia) Redness of the palms of the hands Difficulty with the clotting of blood Spider-like blood vessels on the skin Abdominal pain Clay-colored stools Bleeding from the esophagus Fluid in the abdomen Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Confusion Coma"
What is the contagious period for hepatitis C?,"'Because hepatitis C is transmitted by exposure to blood, there is no specific period of contagiousness. People who develop chronic hepatitis C carry the virus in their blood and, therefore, are ''contagious'' to others for their entire life, unless they are cured of their hepatitis C.' "
How long does it take for symptoms to appear (incubation period) after contracting hepatitis C?,"'This is hard to say for certain what the incubation period for hepatitis C is, because most people who are infected with hepatitis C do not have symptoms early in the course of the infection. Those who develop symptoms early after getting infected (2 to 12 weeks on average, but may be longer) experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms that may not prompt a visit to the doctor.' "
How is hepatitis C spread?," Like HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus, or HCV) is spread by exposure to infected blood (blood-borne pathogen). The most common way of getting hepatitis C is from contaminated blood on needles shared by IV drug users. In a multi-state survey in 2017, about 53% of people who inject drugs were estimated to be HCV-infected. Accidental needlesticks in health care workers also have transmitted the virus. The average risk of getting hepatitis C infection from a stick with a contaminated needle is 1.8%. Before 1992, most people acquired the hepatitis C virus from blood transfusions or blood products. Since 1992, all blood products have been screened for hepatitis C, and cases of hepatitis C due to blood transfusion now are extremely rare. Hepatitis C infection also can be passed from mother to unborn child. Approximately 4%-7% of children born to mothers infected with hepatitis C become infected. Hepatitis C is not transmitted by breast milk. However, nipples may crack and bleed during the first few weeks until the nipples are adapted to nursing, and the infant may be exposed to infected blood. If this occurs, breastfeeding should stop, and milk production can be maintained by pumping the milk and discarding it until healed. A very small number of hepatitis C cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse. The risk of hepatitis C transmission from an infected individual to a non-infected spouse or sexual partner without the use of condoms over a lifetime has been estimated to be between 1% and 4%. Hepatitis C is not transmitted by casual contact, kissing, coughing, sneezing, or sharing eating utensils. There is no transmission by bug bites. However, because of the potential for blood exposure, members of the household are advised not to share shaving razors, nail clippers, or toothbrushes. Poor infection control practices during tattooing and body piercing potentially can lead to spread of infection. This may occur in prison or nonprofessional situations, but it has not been reported in licensed, commercial tattooing facilities where it has been studied. There have been some outbreaks of hepatitis C when instruments exposed to blood have been re-used without adequate cleaning and sterilization between patients. Hepatitis C can be transmitted from an organ donor to an organ recipient. Donors of organs are tested for hepatitis C.If the donor who provides the organ is infected with hepatitis C, it is offered to a recipient who also is infected with hepatitis C.For kidney transplant recipients, however, this does not seem to affect long-term outcome after transplantation.For liver transplant recipients who have hepatitis C and receive an organ from a person who is not infected with hepatitis C, the transplanted organ is expected to become infected within a few weeks. Fortunately, newer medications are allowing successful treatment of hepatitis C after transplants, and this area of medicine continues to evolve. If the donor who provides the organ is infected with hepatitis C, it is offered to a recipient who also is infected with hepatitis C. For kidney transplant recipients, however, this does not seem to affect long-term outcome after transplantation. For liver transplant recipients who have hepatitis C and receive an organ from a person who is not infected with hepatitis C, the transplanted organ is expected to become infected within a few weeks. Fortunately, newer medications are allowing successful treatment of hepatitis C after transplants, and this area of medicine continues to evolve."
Can hepatitis C infection affect other organs besides the liver?,"'Most of the signs and symptoms of hepatitis C infection relate to the liver. Less often, hepatitis C infection can affect organs other than the liver.''Hepatitis C infection can cause the body to produce abnormal antibodies called cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins cause inflammation of arteries (''vasculitis''). This may damage skin, joints, and kidneys. Patients with ''cryoglobulinemia'' (cryoglobulins in the blood) may have'""In addition, infected individuals with cryoglobulinemia may develop Raynaud's phenomenon in which the fingers and toes turn color (white, then purple, then red), and become painful at ""'cold'' temperatures.' joint pain, arthritis, a raised purple rash on the legs, and generalized pain or swelling of their bodies."
Who is at high risk and should be tested for hepatitis C infection?,"'The U.S. Preventive Health Services task force recommends that all adults born between 1945 and 1965 be tested once routinely for hepatitis C, regardless of whether risk factors for hepatitis C are present. One-time testing also is recommended for:''People who may have been exposed to hepatitis C in the previous 6 months should be tested for viral RNA load rather than anti-HCV antibody, because antibody may not be present for up to 12 weeks or longer after infection, although HCV RNA may be detectable in blood as soon as 2-3 weeks after infection.''In general, yearly screening may be appropriate for people with ongoing risk factors such as repeated ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') or many sex partners, ongoing IV ''drug use'', or long-term sex partners of people with hepatitis C. Whether or not to test these people is determined on a case-by-case decision.' People who currently inject drugs or snort drugs, or ever did so, even once many years previously People with persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, a liver enzyme found in blood People who have HIV infection Children born to HCV- or HIV-infected mothers People who were ever on long-term hemodialysis People who got a tattoo in an unregulated setting, such as prison or by an unlicensed person People who received clotting factor produced before 1987 People who received transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992, or who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for hepatitis C infection Health care, emergency medical, and public safety workers after a needlestick, eye or mouth exposure to hepatitis C-infected blood"
Is screening for hepatitis C recommended during pregnancy?,"'There is a 4%-7% risk of transmitting HCV from mother to infant with each ''pregnancy''. Currently, there is no CDC recommendation for routine hepatitis C screening during pregnancy, and there is no currently recommended medicine to prevent transmission from mother to infant (prophylaxis). However, CDC is monitoring research findings and may make recommendations in the future as evidence arises.''While data is still limited, a recent study of over 1,000 cases in the United Kingdom found that 11% of infants had been infected at birth, and that these infants were likely to develop cirrhosis in their early 30s. The case for screening for HCV during pregnancy includes the potential to safely treat mothers during pregnancy with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) to treat the mother before cirrhosis develops, prevent infant transmission, and prevent transmission to others. Children born to HCV-infected mothers may also be offered treatment at an early age to prevent cirrhosis, as well as transmission to others. Coordination of care between multiple specialists will be important to accomplish these goals.''Children of HCV-infected mothers may be screened for hepatitis C as early as 1-2 months of age using hepatitis C viral load or ''PCR'' testing (See Blood tests for hepatitis C). Antibodies to hepatitis C passed from the mother to child will be present for up to 18 months, so children should be tested for HCV antibody no earlier than this.' "
What type of doctor treats hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C is treated by either a ''gastroenterologist'', a hepatologist (a gastroenterologist with additional training in ''liver disease''), or an infectious disease specialist. The treatment team may include more than one specialist, depending on the extent of liver damage.Surgeons who specialize in surgery of the liver, including liver transplantation, are part of the medical team and should see patients with advanced disease (liver failure or cirrhosis) early, before the patient needs a liver transplant. They may be able to identify issues that need to be addressed before surgery can be considered. Other persons who can be helpful in managing patients include dietitians to consult on nutritional issues and pharmacists to assist with management of drugs.' "
How is hepatitis C diagnosed?,"'There are several blood tests for the diagnosis of hepatitis C infection. Blood can be tested for antibody to hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody). It takes about 8-12 weeks on average, and up to 6 months, for antibodies to develop after the initial infection with hepatitis C, so screening for antibodies may miss a few newly infected individuals. Having antibodies is not an absolute indication of active, multiplying hepatitis C virus, but if the antibody test is positive (antibody is present), the statistical probability of active infection is greater than 99%.'""Several tests are available to measure the amount of hepatitis C virus in a person's blood (the viral load). The hepatitis C virus's RNA can be identified by a type of test called ""'polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) that detects circulating virus in the blood as early as 2-3 weeks after infection, so it can be used to detect suspected acute infection with hepatitis C early infection. It also is used to determine whether active hepatitis is present in someone who has antibodies to hepatitis C, and to follow the viral load during treatment.''Blood tests are also performed to identify the genotypes of HCV. Genotypes respond differently to different treatment, so this information is important in selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen.''Estimation of liver fibrosis using blood tests also is quite reliable in diagnosing clinically significant scarring; these include FIB-4, FibroSure, Fibrotest, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).'  "
Liver biopsy and non-invasive tests for hepatitis C,"'The next step is to determine the level of liver scarring that has occurred. ''Liver biopsy'' allows examination of a small sample of liver tissue under a microscope, however, liver biopsy is an invasive test, and has significant risks of bleeding. It also might miss abnormal areas in early disease.''Non-invasive tests have largely replaced liver biopsy except in special situations. Liver ''stiffness'' indicates that advanced liver scarring or cirrhosis may be present. Transient elastography may be used to measure this stiffness by ''ultrasound'' or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'').''Pre-treatment evaluation for hepatitis C also should include:' Testing for HIV Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B and hepatitis A and vaccination if antibodies are not present If past or current hepatitis B infection is detected, it may need to be treated at the same time. There are reports of hepatitis B that reactivated or progressed to serious liver failure or death in some patients who were treated only for hepatitis C. This has been reported to occur during or even after HCV treatment. Recommending abstinence from alcohol use Counseling about measures to prevent the spread of hepatitis C and HIV If cirrhosis is present, vaccination against pneumococcal infection, regardless of age"
What medications cure hepatitis C infection?,"'Interferons, for example, Roferon-A and Infergen, and pegylated interferons such as Peg-Intron''T'', Pegasys, were mainstays of treatment for years. Interferons produced sustained viral response (SVR, or cure) of up to 15%. Later, peglatedll forms produced SVR of 50%-80%. These drugs were injected, had many adverse effects, required frequent monitoring, and were often combined with oral ''ribavirin'', which caused ''anemia''. Treatment durations ranged up to 48 weeks.''Direct-acting anti-viral agents (DAAs) are antiviral drugs that act directly on hepatitis C multiplication.' 

Read Doctor's View
   They are taken by mouth, are well tolerated, and cure over 90% of patients. Treatment time is much shorter, often 12 weeks, depending on drug and genotype. Similar to treatments for HIV, treatment of HCV is most effective if the drugs are given in combination. The earliest options were sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and simeprevir (Olysio). These were approved by the FDA in 2013. Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) followed as a once-a-day combination pill, in 2014. With this combination of DAAs, about 94%-99% of people achieve an SVR (cure) in 12 weeks with few side effects. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets (Viekira Pak), is a combination approved in 2014. SVR with this combination is 91%-100%. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) was approved in 2016. SVR with this combination depends on the HCV genotype and whether individual patient factors require the addition of ribavirin. Genotype 1 has a 94%-97% SVR, and SVR is 97%-100% in genotype 4. In August 2017, FDA approved an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (Mavryet) for all HCV genotypes. Unlike some of the earlier regimens, this combination is effective whether or not the patient has cirrhosis. It also can be given to people on kidney dialysis, whose kidney function limits treatment options. Moreover, this regimen is effective in people with genotype 1 who have failed treatment with some of the other regimens."
What are the treatment guidelines for hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C treatment is best discussed with a doctor or specialist familiar with current and developing options as this field is changing, and even major guidelines may become outdated quickly.''The latest treatment guidelines by the American Association for the Study of ''Liver Disease'' (AASLD) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends use of DAAs as first-line treatment for hepatitis C infection. The choice of DAA varies by specific virus genotype, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. In the U.S., specific insurance providers also might influence the choice due to the high cost of DAAs. Although the individual, public health, and cost benefits of treating all patients with hepatitis C is clear, the most difficult barrier to treating all people with HCV is the very high cost of the drug regimens. Patients are encouraged to discuss options with their health care professional.''Treatment is recommended in all patients with chronic hepatitis C unless they have a short life expectancy that is not related to liver disease. Severe life-threatening liver disease may require liver transplantation. Newer therapies with DAAs have allowed more and more patients to be treated.''The ultimate goals of antiviral therapy are to''A side goal is preventing co-infections with other hepatitis viruses, such as A and B, which can cause more liver disease than HCV alone. These can be prevented by ''vaccines'' and treatment.' prevent transmission of hepatitis C, normalize liver tests, reduce inflammation and scarring, prevent progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer, and improve survival and quality of life."
What is the treatment for people with acute hepatitis C infection?,"'When people first get hepatitis C, the infection is said to be acute. Most people with acute hepatitis C do not have symptoms so they are not recognized as being infected. However, some have low-grade ''fever'', ''fatigue'' or other symptoms that lead to an early diagnosis. Others who become infected and have a known exposure to an infected source, such as a needlestick injury, are monitored closely.''Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Response to treatment is higher in acute hepatitis infection than chronic infection. However, many experts prefer to hold off treatment for 8-12 weeks to see whether the patient naturally eliminates the virus without treatment. Approaches to treatment are evolving. Patients with acute hepatitis C infection should discuss treatment options with a health care professional who is experienced in treating the disease. There is no established treatment regimen at this time.''If the hepatitis C RNA remains undetectable at the end of the treatment and follow-up period, this is called a sustained virologic response (SVR) and is considered a cure. Over 90% of people treated with DAAs are cured. These people have significantly reduced liver inflammation, and liver scarring may even be reversed.''About 5% of people who are treated for HCV infection are not cured by some of the older regimens. These people may still have options for cure with the newer regimens.''Few people with hepatitis C are at risk for problems if they are treated, however there are some factors that affect treatment regimens, such as concurrent HIV medications and kidney dysfunction. Some drugs are not safe for people with cirrhosis. Individuals who are unable to comply with the treatment schedule for psychological reasons or ongoing drug or ''alcohol abuse'' may not be good candidates for treatment because the drugs are very costly and require adherence to ''the pill'' regimen and regular follow-up visits. There are some important ''drug interactions'' with some of the medications that should be considered by the health care professional.''People with past hepatitis B or who have chronic active hepatitis B should not be treated for HCV without treating for ''HBV'' as well. As highly effective treatment for HCV has emerged, reports of serious hepatitis B have come to light. Similar to HCV, hepatitis B usually does not clear from the liver after acute infection, even though it is far less likely to cause chronic active hepatitis than hepatitis C infection. It remains dormant in most people, but it can reactivate with changes in the immune system. It is not clear why eliminating the HCV can allow the HBV infection to flare up. Hepatitis B screening is an important part of the hepatitis C evaluation. Those who have laboratory evidence of active or past infection with HBV should be monitored while receiving HCV treatment.' "
What are the side effects of treatments for hepatitis C infection?,"'Compared to interferons and ribavirin drugs, the side effects of DAAs are far fewer and more tolerable. These side effects usually do not require discontinuation of therapy and are self-limiting after completion of therapy.''Patients with hepatitis B co-infection should be monitored for symptoms of reactivation of hepatitis, which are the same as the symptoms of acute hepatitis. The treating doctor may perform blood screening for this as well.'   The most common side effects of interferon or pegylated interferon include fever, flu-like symptoms, and depression. Patients must be monitored closely for depression. Risk of suicide is a reason to avoid interferons. Interferons also reduce white blood cell and/or red blood cell counts (leucopenia and anemia, respectively). This may cause increased susceptibility to infection. Interferons also increase the risk of certain cancers. Death rarely occurs as a result of therapy, but may occur from progression of liver failure in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Ribavirin most commonly causes anemia due to destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). This can be severe enough that people with heart disease may suffer a heart attack from insufficient blood flow, so people with heart disease should not receive this drug. Anemia improves with a reduction in the dose of ribavirin. Injected growth factor (erythropoietin) that stimulates the production of red blood cells often is used to improve the anemia associated with ribavirin. Ribavirin also accumulates in the testicles and ovaries and causes birth defects in animals. Although no birth defects have been reported in humans, both men and women should use contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy during and for at least six months after ribavirin treatment. The most common and significant side effects of boceprevir (Victrelis), sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) includefatigue (feeling tired),headache, andtrouble sleeping (insomnia). fatigue (feeling tired), headache, and trouble sleeping (insomnia). The most common side effects of simeprevir (Olysio) includeitching,skin rash, andphotosensitivity (tendency to get sunburns). itching, skin rash, and photosensitivity (tendency to get sunburns). Simeprevir has significant drug interactions with other medications. Certain medications can affect levels of simeprevir in the body and make simeprevir less effective or more toxic. The combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir tablets with dasabuvir tablets (Viekira Pak) is very well tolerated, and the most commonly reported side effects arefatigue,trouble sleeping, anditching. fatigue, trouble sleeping, and itching. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) is well-tolerated. Most common side effects includefatigue,headache, andnausea.It may be used with ribavirin, which adds the side effect of anemia.About 1% of people in studies may develop elevated liver enzyme blood tests last into treatment or afterward, so these tests are closely monitored. fatigue, headache, and nausea.

Use of milk thistle should be discussed with the treating doctor, because it interacts with several DAAs."
Is liver transplantation an option for a person with hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C is the leading reason for 40% to 45% of liver transplants in the U.S. Hepatitis C usually recurs after transplantation and infects the new liver. Approximately 25% of these patients with recurrent hepatitis will develop cirrhosis within five years of transplantation. Despite this, the five-year survival rate for patients with hepatitis C is similar to that of patients who are transplanted for other types of liver disease.''Most transplant centers delay therapy until recurrent hepatitis C in the transplanted liver is confirmed. Oral, highly effective, direct-acting antivirals have shown encouraging results in patients who have undergone liver transplantation for hepatitis C infection and have recurrent hepatitis C. The choice of therapy needs to be individualized and is rapidly evolving.' "
How is monitoring done after treatment for hepatitis C?,"'Once patients successfully complete treatment, the viral load after treatment determines if there is an SVR or cure. If cure is achieved (undetectable viral load after treatment), no further additional testing is recommended unless the patient has cirrhosis. Those who are not cured will need continued monitoring for progression of liver disease and its complications.''While cure eliminates worsening of fibrosis by hepatitis C, complications may still affect those with cirrhosis. These individuals still need regular screening for liver cancer as well as monitoring for esophageal varices that may bleed.''Because hepatitis B co-infection may reactivate or worsen even after treatment for HCV, monitoring for hepatitis symptoms may be needed after the end of therapy.' "
What home remedies are available for hepatitis C?,'At this time there are no effective home or ''over-the-counter'' treatments for hepatitis C.' 
What are the complications of undiagnosed hepatitis C?,"'Over several years or decades, chronic inflammation may cause death of liver cells and cirrhosis (scaring, fibrosis). When the liver becomes cirrhotic, it becomes stiff, and it cannot perform its normal functions of clearing waste products from the blood. As fibrosis worsens, symptoms of liver failure begin to appear. This is called ""''decompensated cirrhosis''"" or ""''end-stage liver disease.''"" Symptoms of end-stage liver disease include:''The liver and spleen have an important function of clearing bacteria from the blood stream. Cirrhosis affects many areas of immune function, including attraction of white blood cells to bacteria, reduced killing of bacteria, reduced production of proteins involved in immune defenses, and decreased life span of white blood cells involved in immune defenses. This may be referred to as having'' cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome'' or CAIDS.' Hepatitis C is known to be associated with two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda. Diabetes, heart disease, and arterial blockage are more common among patients with chronic hepatitis C infection than in the general population. It may be that liver damage and chronic inflammation caused by hepatitis C may affect the levels of blood fats (lipids) and blood sugar. Low platelet counts may occur as a result of the destruction of platelets by antibodies. Hepatitis C also is associated with B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. Small spider veins begin to appear on the skin as the stiff, scarred liver obstructs the forward flow of blood. Body fluids back up and accumulate in the abdomen (ascites). The spleen enlarges because of back-pressure. Yellowing of eyes and skin (jaundice) occurs because the liver is not clearing bilirubin (a yellow pigment from breakdown of red blood cells) from the blood. A serious complication is severe bleeding from varicose veins that develop in the swallowing tube or esophagus (esophageal varices). Fluid in the abdomen often becomes infected (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and preventive antibiotics may be given for this type of infection. Bacteria also may enter the bloodstream easily (bacterial translocation), referred to as sepsis, especially when esophageal varices bleed. Individuals may succumb to many types of bacterial infections more easily than normal, but some are specific to liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C and fibrosis should avoid being exposed to these bacteria.Vibrio species of bacteria are a serious risk from eating raw oysters or exposure to sea water. Vibrio vulnificus may cause sepsis, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis, a “flesh-eating” infection.Listeria species may cause sepsis and meningitis, and are a risk from unpasteurized dairy products and salty processed meats.Yersinia species may be picked up from raw or undercooked pork, especially intestines (chitterlings).

Can hepatitis C be prevented?,"'Transmission of hepatitis C can be prevented in several ways.''Prevention'' programs aim at needle sharing among drug addicts. Needle exchange programs and education have reduced transmission of hepatitis C infection. However, IV drug users are a difficult to reach population, and rates of hepatitis C remain high among them.''Among health care workers, safe needle-usage techniques have been developed to reduce accidental needlesticks. Newer needle systems prevent manual recapping of needles after use of syringes, which is a frequent cause of accidental needlesticks''There is no clear way to prevent hepatitis C transmission from mother to fetus at this time.''People with multiple sexual partners should use barrier precautions such as condoms to limit the risk of hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.''If one partner is infected, monogamous couples may want to consider the low risk of transmission of hepatitis C infection when deciding whether to use condoms during sex. Some couples may decide to use them and some may not.''Screening of the blood supply has almost eliminated the risk of transmission of hepatitis C infection through transfusion.''People with hepatitis C infection should not share razors or toothbrushes with others because of the possibility that these items may be contaminated with blood.''People who want to get a body piercing(s) or ''tattoo''(s) are encouraged to do so only at licensed piercing and tattoo shops (facilities), and verify that the body piercing or tattoo shop uses infection-control practices.''It is critical that physicians and clinics follow manufacturers and regulatory agency directions for sterilizing/cleaning instruments and that disposable instruments be discarded properly. There is no need to use special isolation procedures when dealing with hepatitis C infected patients.' "
What is the prognosis of hepatitis C?,"'In general, among patients with untreated hepatitis C:''Drinking alcohol and acquiring other hepatitis viruses are risk factors for worse liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C should avoid drinking alcohol and should be screened for antibodies to hepatitis A and B. If they do not have antibodies, they should be vaccinated against these other hepatitis viruses.''People with hepatitis C should be educated about preventing HIV infection. Infection with both HIV and hepatitis C speeds up and worsens liver damage caused by hepatitis C. Hepatitis C also can affect the HIV infection and how it is treated. About 25% of people with HIV infection are co-infected (also infected) with hepatitis C, and up to 90% of IV drug users with HIV are co-infected with hepatitis C. Screening for hepatitis viruses is important in all people infected with HIV, just as screening for HIV is important in people who have hepatitis C.''Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or hepatoma) is associated with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis C. Some experts recommend screening patients with hepatitis C infection and cirrhosis for liver cancer periodically.' 75% to 85% become chronically infected, 60% to 70% develop liver disease, 5% to 20% develop cirrhosis, and 1% to 5% will die from complications of cirrhosis or liver cancer."
What is the current research and what is in the future for hepatitis C?,"'As our knowledge of hepatitis C increases, more and more patients are being diagnosed with chronic infection. Current research is very active and includes diagnosis, natural history, treatment, and vaccine development. Thus the field is constantly changing, with new guidelines added frequently.' "
What is PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method to analyze a short sequence of DNA (or RNA) even in samples containing only minute quantities of DNA or RNA. PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA. Previously, amplification of DNA involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria, and took weeks. But now, with PCR done in test tubes, it takes only a few hours. PCR is highly efficient in that untold numbers of copies can be made of the DNA. Moreover, PCR uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying DNA: ' Two ""primers"", short single-stranded DNA sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the DNA stretch to be copied;  An enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of DNA, reading its code and assembling a copy; and  A pile of DNA building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."
How is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) done?,"'As illustrated in the ''animated picture of PCR'', three major steps are involved in a PCR. These three steps are repeated for 30 or 40 cycles. The cycles are done on an automated cycler, a device which rapidly heats and cools the test tubes containing the reaction mixture. Each step -- denatauration (alteration of structure), annealing (joining), and extension -- takes place at a different temperature: ''With one cycle, a single segment of double-stranded DNA template is amplified into two separate pieces of double-stranded DNA. These two pieces are then available for amplification in the next cycle. As the cycles are repeated, more and more copies are generated and the number of copies of the template is increased exponentially.' Denaturation: At 94 C (201.2 F), the double-stranded DNA melts and opens into two pieces of single-stranded DNA.  Annealing: At medium temperatures, around 54 C (129.2 F), the primers pair up (anneal) with the single-stranded ""template"" (The template is the sequence of DNA to be copied.) On the small length of double-stranded DNA (the joined primer and template), the polymerase attaches and starts copying the template.  Extension: At 72 C (161.6 F), the polymerase works best, and DNA building blocks complementary to the template are coupled to the primer, making a double stranded DNA molecule."
What is the purpose of doing a PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'To do PCR, the original DNA that one wishes to copy need not be pure or abundant. It can be pure but it also can be a minute part of a mixture of materials. So, PCR has found widespread and innumerable uses -- to diagnose genetic diseases, do DNA fingerprinting, find bacteria and ''viruses'', study human evolution, clone the DNA of an Egyptian mummy, establish paternity or biological relationships, etc.. Accordingly, PCR has become an essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and many other laboratories that study genetic material.' "
How was PCR (polymerase chain reaction) discovered?,"'PCR was invented by Kary Mullis. At the time he thought up PCR in 1983, Mullis was working in Emeryville, California for Cetus, one of the first biotechnology companies. There, he was charged with making short chains of DNA for other scientists. Mullis has written that he conceived of PCR while cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway 128 one night on his motorcycle. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region. Mullis has said that before his motorcycle trip was over, he was already savoring the prospects of a Nobel Prize. He shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry with Michael Smith in 1993. ''As Mullis has written in the Scientific American: ""Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat."" ' "
What is RT PCR?,"'RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) is a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of mRNA (messenger RNA). The technique consists of two parts:''RT-PCR has been used to measure viral load with ''HIV'' and may also be used with other RNA viruses such as ''measles'' and ''mumps''.''Previous contributing author and editor: ''Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor:  Leslie J.

What is cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat that the body needs to produce important structures and chemicals. It is one of the main components of cell membranes, the outer lining that protects the internal structures that make body cells work and function properly. Cholesterol is also a building block for many of the hormones in the body including mineralocorticoids that control ''electrolyte'' levels in the body, glucocorticoids involved in carbohydrate ''metabolism'', and sex hormones including testosterone, ''estrogen'', and ''progesterone''. Cholesterol is one of the building blocks that assists in forming ''vitamin D'' in the body. ''Vitamin D'' is responsible for calcium ''metabolism'' in the body.''There are two important types of cholesterol, ''high density lipoprotein (HDL)'' and ''low density lipoprotein (LDL)''. LDL is the bad cholesterol that deposits in arteries when too much is present. HDL is considered the good cholesterol because it can bind to ''LDL cholesterol'' and return it to the ''liver'' where it can be removed from the body. ''While most of the cholesterol in the body is obtained through the foods we eat, it is also produced in the ''liver'"" to meet the body's demands. The body attempts to regulate the amount of total cholesterol, but when too much cholesterol is present, the excess can be deposited in arteries throughout the body. This leads to artery narrowing and increases the risk of ""'heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. Elevated LDL levels increase the risk of these diseases, and elevated HDL levels decrease the risk.' "
What does a cholesterol test measure?,"'Cholesterol tests are blood tests that measure the amount of cholesterol in the body. The health-care professional may order only a cholesterol test with results showing:''In addition to cholesterol level, the health-care professional also may order a ''lipid profile'' test. \xa0The ''lipid'' profile test will also measure ''triglyceride levels'' and another fatty substance found in the blood.'   The total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels."
How do I prepare for a cholesterol test?,"'For the best and most accurate results, it is important to fast for many hours before the cholesterol blood test is taken. Each laboratory has its own guidelines for not eating, and the fast may range from 9-16 hours. It is acceptable to drink water.' "
Do I need to call my doctor for my test results?,"'It usually takes a day or two from the time the blood is drawn until your health-care professional receives the results of the cholesterol test. Ideally, the health-care professional will contact you with those results and explain their significance. However, if you have not been contacted in a short period of time, it is reasonable to contact your health-care professional and ask for the test results.''There are home cholesterol test kits available that have been U.S. FDA approved, but their accuracy is not necessarily as good as that of a certified laboratory. These tests usually measure total cholesterol only, but some also can measure HDL, LDL and cholesterol. If you use one of the home kits, it is wise to discuss the results with your health-care professional.''The purpose of the cholesterol blood test is to determine whether treatment is needed for ''high cholesterol''. That treatment may include dietary and lifestyle modifications, medications, or both to control ''cholesterol levels'' and decrease the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and peripheral ''vascular disease''. ' "
How do I interpret my cholesterol test results?,"'Cholesterol levels'' are but one of the risk factors for ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. It is important to control cholesterol levels to minimize risk just as it is important to control ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', and avoid ''smoking''.''Guidelines for cholesterol levels have been developed by many health organizations including the American ''Heart'' Association. It is important to remember that tests may need to be repeated over time to help monitor treatment and disease risk ''prevention''.\xa0' "
What are HDL (good) and LDL (bad) cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol'' is a fat-like (''lipid''-like) substance that your body uses as a building block to produce hormones, ''vitamin D'', and digestive juices that help you break down ''fats'' in your ''diet''. ''HDL'' (high-density lipoprotein, or “good” cholesterol) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or “bad” cholesterol) are two types of lipoproteins that carry cholesterol to and from the body’s cells in the blood.''The body needs some cholesterol to function, but when levels get too high, fatty deposits can accumulate in blood vessels, which causes them to narrow. This narrowing of the blood passageways by these ''lipids'' can lead to ''heart attacks'', ''coronary artery disease'', ''strokes'', or other vascular diseases.''Triglycerides'' are components found in body fat, and fats from the foods you eat. ''Triglycerides'' show what you have recently eaten, and cholesterol shows what you have eaten over a long period. If you eat a fatty meal, it gets absorbed as ''triglycerides'', so in the first few days after eating a fatty meal you will have high levels of triglycerides in your blood. The ''liver'' then packages these triglycerides as fats in your adipose tissue, and turns some of it into cholesterol. This leads to high ''cholesterol levels'' in the blood for a few days to weeks after eating a fatty meal. Like cholesterol, you need some triglycerides to keep the body healthy, but increased levels can cause health problems.' "
What do HDL and LDL mean?,"'LDL and HDL are the two main types of cholesterol (blood fats, or lipids) that make up your total cholesterol.''There is a third type of cholesterol called VLDL (very-low-density lipoproteins), which is another type of “bad” cholesterol produced in the liver, and contains a high amount of triglycerides.' HDL (high-density lipoproteins), or “good” cholesterol, may protect the body against narrowing blood vessels LDL (low-density lipoproteins), or “bad” cholesterol, may make arterial narrowing worse"
Why is HDL the good cholesterol and LDL the bad?,"'Your total cholesterol is the sum of the fats in your blood, which includes the LDL and ''HDL cholesterol''. This number can give you an indication of your risk factors for developing ''cardiovascular disease'', ''coronary artery disease'', ''vascular disease'', or ''stroke''.''More importantly, the amounts of each type of cholesterol are a better predictor of risk for disease than the total amount. Doctors and other health care professionals consider ''LDL cholesterol'' the “bad” cholesterol. Increased numbers of ''LDL cholesterol'' indicate more risk for blocked arteries and health problems.''Doctors consider ''HDL cholesterol'' the “good” cholesterol, and they interpret its levels in the opposite manner of LDL. The higher your HDL cholesterol numbers, the lower your risk is for ''heart disease'', vascular disease, and ''stroke''. HDL cholesterol also may have a protective effect on the blood vessels, and a high level of HDL in your body may keep cardiovascular disease from developing.''Triglycerides also are part of a cholesterol profile, and these numbers are more indicative of the amount of fats you have eaten recently. High ''triglyceride levels'' greatly increase your risk for developing coronary artery disease, vascular disease, and ''stroke''.' "
Chart of normal HDL and LDL cholesterol numbers and ratios,'Chart courtesy of the National Institutes of Health.' 
What causes high levels of LDL cholesterol?," High-fat diet Obesity (including metabolic syndrome, also called syndrome X) Sedentary lifestyle Genetics Alcoholism Liver disease Smoking Diabetes"
What can lower LDL cholesterol levels?,"'Lifestyle and ''diet'' modifications are the main way to prevent high ''LDL cholesterol'', and to keep a healthy level of ''HDL cholesterol''. Eat a low-fat/high-''fiber'' ''diet'', ''exercise'' regularly, maintain a healthy weight, and do not smoke.''Some risk factors for high ''LDL cholesterol'' are genetic and may require medical treatment to keep ''cholesterol levels'' in a healthy range.' "
What foods help lower LDL cholesterol?,"'A ''heart''-healthy diet that is high in ''fiber'' and plant-based foods can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels. Mainly ''vegetarian'' or vegan diets have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and the risk of blocked arteries. Foods that can help lower LDL cholesterol include:'   Oatmeal Whole grains Barley Beans Fruits and vegetables Leafy greens such as spinach, kale, collard greens, lettuce Avocado Eggplant Nuts Soybeans and tofu Fatty fish such as salmon and tuna (in moderation) Red wine (in moderation) Black tea Garlic Fiber supplements"
What lifestyle changes and medications help lower LDL cholesterol numbers?,"'The first step in ''lowering cholesterol'' is diet and ''exercise''. Talk with your doctor, nutritionist, or other healthcare professional to come up with a diet and ''exercise'' plan that is right for you.''Other lifestyle modifications and changes can be made to help lower your cholesterol, for example;''If diet, ''exercise'', and lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your cholesterol to healthy ranges, then your doctor may prescribe medication. The type of cholesterol lowering medication depends upon your levels of LDL, ''HDL'', and ''triglycerides''; and any current medications you are currently taking, and your overall health.''Medication options to reduce cholesterol include ''statins'', ''niacin'', and fibric acid agents (''fibrates''). Your doctor may prescribe one or several types of these ''drugs'' to reduce your cholesterol levels to a healthy range.'   quit smoking, reduce the amount of alcohol you drink or avoid it, and reduce stress by using stress reduction techniques like Yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation."
What increases HDL (good) cholesterol?,"'Raising your HDL levels by diet alone is very difficult. Your best solution to increase your HDL levels is to eat a heart-healthy diet low in fat and high in fiber. You also can help improve your HDL number if you ''lose weight'', ''quit smoking'', and cut ''sugar'' out of your diet.''Some statin medications may potentially increase HDL levels moderately. Discuss this treatment option with your doctor.' "
What are cancers of the head and neck?,"'Cancers that are known collectively as head and neck cancers usually begin in the squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck (for example, inside the mouth, the nose, and the throat). These squamous cell cancers are often referred to as squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Head and neck cancers can also begin in the salivary glands, but salivary gland cancers are relatively uncommon. Salivary glands contain many different types of cells that can become cancerous, so there are many different types of ''salivary gland cancer''.''Cancers of the head and neck are further categorized by the area of the head or neck in which they begin. These areas are described below and labeled in the image of head and neck cancer regions.''Oral cavity'': Includes the lips, the front two-thirds of the tongue, the gums, the lining inside the cheeks and lips, the floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue, the hard palate (bony top of the mouth), and the small area of the gum behind the ''wisdom teeth''.''Pharynx'': The pharynx (throat) is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and leads to the ''esophagus''. It has three parts: the nasopharynx (the upper part of the pharynx, behind the nose); the oropharynx (the middle part of the pharynx, including the soft palate [the back of the mouth], the base of the tongue, and the ''tonsils''); the hypopharynx (the lower part of the pharynx).''Larynx'': The larynx, also called the voicebox, is a short passageway formed by cartilage just below the pharynx in the neck. The larynx contains the vocal cords. It also has a small piece of tissue, called the ''epiglottis'', which moves to cover the larynx to prevent food from entering the air passages.''Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity'': The paranasal sinuses are small hollow spaces in the bones of the head surrounding the nose. The nasal cavity is the hollow space inside the nose.''Salivary glands'': The major salivary glands are in the floor of the mouth and near the jawbone. The salivary glands produce saliva.' "
What causes head and neck cancers?,"'Alcohol and tobacco use (including ''smokeless tobacco'', sometimes called ""''chewing tobacco''"" or ""''snuff''"") are the two most important risk factors for head and neck cancers, especially cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. At least 75% of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk of developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone. Tobacco and alcohol use are not risk factors for salivary gland cancers.''Infection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (''HPV''), especially HPV type 16, is a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancers that involve the ''tonsils'' or the base of the tongue. In the United States, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV infection is increasing, while the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers related to other causes is falling.''Other risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:''Paan (betel quid)''. Immigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk of ''oral cancer''.''Preserved or salted foods''. Consumption of certain preserved or salted foods during childhood is a risk factor for ''nasopharyngeal cancer''.''Oral health''. Poor oral hygiene and missing ''teeth'' may be weak risk factors for cancers of the oral cavity. Use of mouthwash that has a high alcohol content is a possible, but not proven, risk factor for cancers of the oral cavity.''Occupational exposure''. Occupational exposure to wood dust is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer. Certain industrial exposures, including exposures to asbestos and synthetic fibers, have been associated with ''cancer of the larynx'', but the increase in risk remains controversial. People working in certain jobs in the construction, metal, textile, ceramic, logging, and food industries may have an increased risk of ''cancer of the larynx''. Industrial exposure to wood or nickel dust or formaldehyde is a risk factor for cancers of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.''Radiation exposure''. Radiation to the head and neck, for noncancerous conditions or cancer, is a risk factor for cancer of the salivary glands.''Epstein-Barr virus infection''. Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer of the salivary glands.''Ancestry''. Asian ancestry, particularly Chinese ancestry, is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer.'  "
What are common symptoms of head and neck cancers?,"'The symptoms of head and neck cancers may include a lump or a sore that does not heal, a ''sore throat'' that does not go away, difficulty in swallowing, and a change or ''hoarseness'' in the voice. These symptoms may also be caused by other, less serious conditions. It is important to check with a doctor or dentist about any of these symptoms. Symptoms that may affect specific areas of the head and neck include the following:''Oral cavity''. A white or red patch on the gums, the tongue, or the lining of the mouth; a swelling of the jaw that causes ''dentures'' to fit poorly or become uncomfortable; and unusual bleeding or ''pain'' in the mouth.''Pharynx''. Trouble ''breathing'' or speaking; ''pain'' when swallowing; pain in the neck or the throat that does not go away; frequent ''headaches'', pain, or ''ringing in the ears''; or trouble ''hearing''.''Larynx''. Pain when swallowing or ear pain.''Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity''. Sinuses that are blocked and do not clear; chronic ''sinus infections'' that do not respond to treatment with antibiotics; bleeding through the nose; frequent ''headaches'', swelling or other trouble with the eyes; pain in the upper ''teeth''; or problems with ''dentures''.''Salivary glands''. Swelling under the chin or around the jawbone, numbness or ''paralysis'' of the muscles in the face, or pain in the face, the chin, or the neck that does not go away.'  "
How common are head and neck cancers?,"'Head and neck cancers account for approximately 4% of all cancers in the United States. These cancers are more than twice as common among men as they are among women. Head and neck cancers are also diagnosed more often among people over age 50 than they are among younger people.''Researchers estimated that more than 65,000 men and women in this country would be diagnosed with head and neck cancers in 2017.' "
How can I reduce my risk of developing head and neck cancers?,"'People who are at risk of head and neck cancers -- particularly those who use tobacco -- should talk with their doctor about ways that they may be able to reduce their risk. They should also discuss with their doctor how often to have checkups. In addition, ongoing ''clinical trials'' are testing the effectiveness of various medications in preventing head and neck cancers in people who have a high risk of developing these diseases.''Avoiding oral HPV infection may reduce the risk of HPV-associated head and neck cancers. However, it is not yet known whether the Food and Drug Administration-approved HPV ''vaccines'' ''Gardasil''®, Gardasil 9®, and Cervarix® prevent HPV infection of the oral cavity, and none of these ''vaccines'' has yet been approved for the ''prevention'' of oropharyngeal cancer.' "
How are head and neck cancers diagnosed?,"""To find the cause of the signs or symptoms of a problem in the head and neck area, a doctor evaluates a person's medical history, performs a physical examination, and orders diagnostic tests. The exams and tests may vary depending on the symptoms. Examination of a sample of tissue under a microscope is always necessary to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.""'If the diagnosis is cancer, the doctor will want to learn the stage (or extent) of disease. Staging is a careful attempt to find out whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to which parts of the body. Staging may involve an examination under anesthesia (in an operating room), x-rays and other imaging procedures, and laboratory tests. Knowing the stage of the disease helps the doctor plan treatment.'  "
How are head and neck cancers treated?,"""The treatment plan for an individual patient depends on a number of factors, including the exact location of the tumor, the stage of the cancer, and the person's age and general health. Treatment for head and neck cancer can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of treatments.""'People who are diagnosed with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer may be treated differently than people with oropharyngeal cancers that are HPV-negative. Recent research has shown that patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors have a better prognosis and may do just as well on less intense treatment. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating this question.''The patient and the doctor should consider treatment options carefully. They should discuss each type of treatment and how it might change the way the patient looks, talks, eats, or breathes.'  "
What are the side effects of treatment?,"""Surgery for head and neck cancers often changes the patient's ability to chew, swallow, or talk. The patient may look different after surgery, and the face and neck may be swollen. The swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, if lymph nodes are removed, the flow of lymph in the area where they were removed may be slower and lymph could collect in the tissues, causing additional swelling; this swelling may last for a long time.""'After a laryngectomy (surgery to remove the larynx) or other surgery in the neck, parts of the neck and throat may feel numb because nerves have been cut. If lymph nodes in the neck were removed, the shoulder and neck may become weak and stiff.''Patients who receive radiation to the head and neck may experience redness, irritation, and sores in the mouth; a ''dry mouth'' or thickened saliva; difficulty in swallowing; changes in taste; or ''nausea''. Other problems that may occur during treatment are loss of taste, which may decrease appetite and affect ''nutrition'', and earaches (caused by the hardening of ''ear wax''). Patients may also notice some swelling or drooping of the skin under the chin and changes in the texture of the skin. The jaw may feel stiff, and patients may not be able to open their mouth as wide as before treatment.''Patients should report any side effects to their doctor or nurse, and discuss how to deal with them.' "
Where can I find more information about clinical trials for patients with head and neck cancers?,'Clinical trials are research studies conducted with people who volunteer to take part. Participation in clinical trials is an option for many patients with head and neck cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are testing the effectiveness of treatments for head and neck cancers.''People interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor.' 
What rehabilitation or support options are available for patients with head and neck cancers?,"'The goal of treatment for head and neck cancers is to control the disease, but doctors are also concerned about preserving the function of the affected areas as much as they can and helping the patient return to normal activities as soon as possible after treatment. Rehabilitation is a very important part of this process. The goals of rehabilitation depend on the extent of the disease and the treatment that a patient has received.''Depending on the location of the cancer and the type of treatment, rehabilitation may include physical therapy, dietary counseling, speech therapy, and/or learning how to care for a stoma. A stoma is an opening into the windpipe through which a patient breathes after a laryngectomy, which is surgery to remove the larynx.''Sometimes, especially with cancer of the oral cavity, a patient may need reconstructive and ''plastic'' surgery to rebuild bones or tissues. However, reconstructive surgery may not always be possible because of damage to the remaining tissue from the original surgery or from radiation therapy. If reconstructive surgery is not possible, a prosthodontist may be able to make a prosthesis (an artificial dental and/or facial part) to restore satisfactory swallowing, speech, and appearance. Patients will receive special training on how to use the device.''Patients who have trouble speaking after treatment may need speech therapy. Often, a speech-language pathologist will visit the patient in the hospital to plan therapy and teach speech exercises or alternative methods of speaking. Speech therapy usually continues after the patient returns home.''Eating may be difficult after treatment for head and neck cancer. Some patients receive nutrients directly into a vein after surgery or need a feeding tube until they can eat on their own. A feeding tube is a flexible plastic tube that is passed into the stomach through the nose or an incision in the abdomen. A nurse or speech-language pathologist can help patients learn how to swallow again after surgery.' "
Is follow-up treatment necessary? What does it involve?,"'Regular follow-up care is very important after treatment for head and neck cancer to make sure that the cancer has not returned, or that a second primary (new) cancer has not developed. Depending on the type of cancer, medical checkups could include exams of the stoma, if one has been created, and of the mouth, neck, and throat. Regular dental exams may also be necessary.''From time to time, the doctor may perform a complete physical exam, blood tests, x-rays, and computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scans. The doctor may monitor thyroid and ''pituitary gland'' function, especially if the head or neck was treated with radiation. Also, the doctor is likely to counsel patients to stop ''smoking''. Research has shown that continued ''smoking'' by a patient with head and neck cancer may reduce the effectiveness of treatment and increase the chance of a second primary cancer.' "
How can people who have had head and neck cancer reduce their risk of developing a second primary (new) cancer?,"'People who have been treated for head and neck cancers have an increased chance of developing a new cancer, usually in the head, neck, esophagus, or ''lungs''. The chance of a second primary cancer varies depending on the site of the original cancer, but it is higher for people who use tobacco and drink alcohol.'""Especially because patients who smoke have a higher risk of a second primary cancer, doctors encourage patients who use tobacco to quit. The federal government's main resource to help people quit using tobacco is BeTobaccoFree.gov. The government also sponsors Smokefree Women, a website to help women quit using tobacco, and Smokefree Teen, which is designed to help ""'teens'' understand the decisions they make and how those decisions fit into their lives. The toll-free number 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) also serves as a single point of access to state-based telephone quitlines.' "
What are cancers of the head and neck?,"'Cancers that are known collectively as head and neck cancers usually begin in the squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck (for example, inside the mouth, the nose, and the throat). These squamous cell cancers are often referred to as squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Head and neck cancers can also begin in the salivary glands, but salivary gland cancers are relatively uncommon. Salivary glands contain many different types of cells that can become cancerous, so there are many different types of ''salivary gland cancer''.''Cancers of the head and neck are further categorized by the area of the head or neck in which they begin. These areas are described below and labeled in the image of head and neck cancer regions.''Oral cavity'': Includes the lips, the front two-thirds of the tongue, the gums, the lining inside the cheeks and lips, the floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue, the hard palate (bony top of the mouth), and the small area of the gum behind the ''wisdom teeth''.''Pharynx'': The pharynx (throat) is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and leads to the ''esophagus''. It has three parts: the nasopharynx (the upper part of the pharynx, behind the nose); the oropharynx (the middle part of the pharynx, including the soft palate [the back of the mouth], the base of the tongue, and the ''tonsils''); the hypopharynx (the lower part of the pharynx).''Larynx'': The larynx, also called the voicebox, is a short passageway formed by cartilage just below the pharynx in the neck. The larynx contains the vocal cords. It also has a small piece of tissue, called the ''epiglottis'', which moves to cover the larynx to prevent food from entering the air passages.''Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity'': The paranasal sinuses are small hollow spaces in the bones of the head surrounding the nose. The nasal cavity is the hollow space inside the nose.''Salivary glands'': The major salivary glands are in the floor of the mouth and near the jawbone. The salivary glands produce saliva.' "
What causes head and neck cancers?,"'Alcohol and tobacco use (including ''smokeless tobacco'', sometimes called ""''chewing tobacco''"" or ""''snuff''"") are the two most important risk factors for head and neck cancers, especially cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. At least 75% of head and neck cancers are caused by tobacco and alcohol use. People who use both tobacco and alcohol are at greater risk of developing these cancers than people who use either tobacco or alcohol alone. Tobacco and alcohol use are not risk factors for salivary gland cancers.''Infection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (''HPV''), especially HPV type 16, is a risk factor for some types of head and neck cancers, particularly oropharyngeal cancers that involve the ''tonsils'' or the base of the tongue. In the United States, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV infection is increasing, while the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers related to other causes is falling.''Other risk factors for cancers of the head and neck include the following:''Paan (betel quid)''. Immigrants from Southeast Asia who use paan (betel quid) in the mouth should be aware that this habit has been strongly associated with an increased risk of ''oral cancer''.''Preserved or salted foods''. Consumption of certain preserved or salted foods during childhood is a risk factor for ''nasopharyngeal cancer''.''Oral health''. Poor oral hygiene and missing ''teeth'' may be weak risk factors for cancers of the oral cavity. Use of mouthwash that has a high alcohol content is a possible, but not proven, risk factor for cancers of the oral cavity.''Occupational exposure''. Occupational exposure to wood dust is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer. Certain industrial exposures, including exposures to asbestos and synthetic fibers, have been associated with ''cancer of the larynx'', but the increase in risk remains controversial. People working in certain jobs in the construction, metal, textile, ceramic, logging, and food industries may have an increased risk of ''cancer of the larynx''. Industrial exposure to wood or nickel dust or formaldehyde is a risk factor for cancers of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.''Radiation exposure''. Radiation to the head and neck, for noncancerous conditions or cancer, is a risk factor for cancer of the salivary glands.''Epstein-Barr virus infection''. Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer and cancer of the salivary glands.''Ancestry''. Asian ancestry, particularly Chinese ancestry, is a risk factor for nasopharyngeal cancer.'  "
What are common symptoms of head and neck cancers?,"'The symptoms of head and neck cancers may include a lump or a sore that does not heal, a ''sore throat'' that does not go away, difficulty in swallowing, and a change or ''hoarseness'' in the voice. These symptoms may also be caused by other, less serious conditions. It is important to check with a doctor or dentist about any of these symptoms. Symptoms that may affect specific areas of the head and neck include the following:''Oral cavity''. A white or red patch on the gums, the tongue, or the lining of the mouth; a swelling of the jaw that causes ''dentures'' to fit poorly or become uncomfortable; and unusual bleeding or ''pain'' in the mouth.''Pharynx''. Trouble ''breathing'' or speaking; ''pain'' when swallowing; pain in the neck or the throat that does not go away; frequent ''headaches'', pain, or ''ringing in the ears''; or trouble ''hearing''.''Larynx''. Pain when swallowing or ear pain.''Paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity''. Sinuses that are blocked and do not clear; chronic ''sinus infections'' that do not respond to treatment with antibiotics; bleeding through the nose; frequent ''headaches'', swelling or other trouble with the eyes; pain in the upper ''teeth''; or problems with ''dentures''.''Salivary glands''. Swelling under the chin or around the jawbone, numbness or ''paralysis'' of the muscles in the face, or pain in the face, the chin, or the neck that does not go away.'  "
How common are head and neck cancers?,"'Head and neck cancers account for approximately 4% of all cancers in the United States. These cancers are more than twice as common among men as they are among women. Head and neck cancers are also diagnosed more often among people over age 50 than they are among younger people.''Researchers estimated that more than 65,000 men and women in this country would be diagnosed with head and neck cancers in 2017.' "
How can I reduce my risk of developing head and neck cancers?,"'People who are at risk of head and neck cancers -- particularly those who use tobacco -- should talk with their doctor about ways that they may be able to reduce their risk. They should also discuss with their doctor how often to have checkups. In addition, ongoing ''clinical trials'' are testing the effectiveness of various medications in preventing head and neck cancers in people who have a high risk of developing these diseases.''Avoiding oral HPV infection may reduce the risk of HPV-associated head and neck cancers. However, it is not yet known whether the Food and Drug Administration-approved HPV ''vaccines'' ''Gardasil''®, Gardasil 9®, and Cervarix® prevent HPV infection of the oral cavity, and none of these ''vaccines'' has yet been approved for the ''prevention'' of oropharyngeal cancer.' "
How are head and neck cancers diagnosed?,"""To find the cause of the signs or symptoms of a problem in the head and neck area, a doctor evaluates a person's medical history, performs a physical examination, and orders diagnostic tests. The exams and tests may vary depending on the symptoms. Examination of a sample of tissue under a microscope is always necessary to confirm a diagnosis of cancer.""'If the diagnosis is cancer, the doctor will want to learn the stage (or extent) of disease. Staging is a careful attempt to find out whether the cancer has spread and, if so, to which parts of the body. Staging may involve an examination under anesthesia (in an operating room), x-rays and other imaging procedures, and laboratory tests. Knowing the stage of the disease helps the doctor plan treatment.'  "
How are head and neck cancers treated?,"""The treatment plan for an individual patient depends on a number of factors, including the exact location of the tumor, the stage of the cancer, and the person's age and general health. Treatment for head and neck cancer can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of treatments.""'People who are diagnosed with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer may be treated differently than people with oropharyngeal cancers that are HPV-negative. Recent research has shown that patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors have a better prognosis and may do just as well on less intense treatment. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating this question.''The patient and the doctor should consider treatment options carefully. They should discuss each type of treatment and how it might change the way the patient looks, talks, eats, or breathes.'  "
What are the side effects of treatment?,"""Surgery for head and neck cancers often changes the patient's ability to chew, swallow, or talk. The patient may look different after surgery, and the face and neck may be swollen. The swelling usually goes away within a few weeks. However, if lymph nodes are removed, the flow of lymph in the area where they were removed may be slower and lymph could collect in the tissues, causing additional swelling; this swelling may last for a long time.""'After a laryngectomy (surgery to remove the larynx) or other surgery in the neck, parts of the neck and throat may feel numb because nerves have been cut. If lymph nodes in the neck were removed, the shoulder and neck may become weak and stiff.''Patients who receive radiation to the head and neck may experience redness, irritation, and sores in the mouth; a ''dry mouth'' or thickened saliva; difficulty in swallowing; changes in taste; or ''nausea''. Other problems that may occur during treatment are loss of taste, which may decrease appetite and affect ''nutrition'', and earaches (caused by the hardening of ''ear wax''). Patients may also notice some swelling or drooping of the skin under the chin and changes in the texture of the skin. The jaw may feel stiff, and patients may not be able to open their mouth as wide as before treatment.''Patients should report any side effects to their doctor or nurse, and discuss how to deal with them.' "
Where can I find more information about clinical trials for patients with head and neck cancers?,'Clinical trials are research studies conducted with people who volunteer to take part. Participation in clinical trials is an option for many patients with head and neck cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are testing the effectiveness of treatments for head and neck cancers.''People interested in taking part in a clinical trial should talk with their doctor.'

Facts you should know about head injuries," Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) account for thousands of deaths each year in the U.S. As well, significant numbers of people suffer temporary or permanent disability due to brain injury. Head injury does not necessarily mean brain injury. The bony skull protects the brain. Scalp lacerations or skull fractures may or may not have associated brain injury. Bleeding into and surrounding the brain usually occurs at the time of injury and over time may continue so that there is increasing pressure within the skull. However, symptoms may develop immediately or appear gradually over time. Medical care should be sought for any patient who is not fully awake after an injury. Activate emergency medical services or call 9-1-1. Computerized tomography looks for bleeding and swelling in the brain. Not all patients with minor head injuries require CT scanning. Bleeding in the brain may require neurosurgery to remove blood clots and relieve pressure on the brain. Not all brain injuries require neurosurgery. Prevention is key to avoiding head injury. The use of bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets, and seat belts can decrease the risk of head injury.
"
What is a head injury?,"'While head injuries are one of the most common ''causes of death'' and disability in the United States, many patients with head injuries are treated and released from the emergency department after receiving treatment.Brain injury may be caused by a direct blow to the head, but shaking may also cause damage. The head is perched on the neck, and rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause the brain to be damaged. The face and jaw are located in the front of the head, and brain injury may also be associated with injuries to these structures. It is also important to note that a head injury does not always mean that there is also a brain injury.''The brain is a soft and pliable structure that is almost jelly-like in feel and is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained between layers of meninges, thin layers of tissue that cover the brain. There are three layers of meninges: 1) the pia mater, 2) the arachnoid mater, and 3) the dura mater. The CSF is present in the space beneath the arachnoid layer called the subarachnoid space.''The dura mater is very thick and has septae, or partitions, that help support the brain within the skull. The septae attach to the inner lining of the bones of the skull. The dura mater also helps support the large veins that return blood from the brain to the ''heart''.''The spaces between the meninges are usually very small and compressed, but they can fill with blood when ''trauma'' occurs. This buildup of blood takes up space and increases pressure within the skull, potentially pressing into brain tissue and causing damage.''The skull protects the brain from trauma but it does not absorb much impact from a blow. Direct blows may cause fractures of the skull. There can be a ''contusion'' or ''bruising'' and bleeding to the brain tissue directly beneath the injury site. However, the brain can bounce around, or slosh, inside the skull and because of this, the brain injury may not necessarily be located directly below the trauma site. A contre-coup injury describes the situation in which the brain is damaged when the initial blow to the head causes the brain to bounce away from that forceful blow and hit the skull directly opposite the trauma site. Acceleration/deceleration and rotation are the common types of forces that can cause injuries away from the area of the skull that received the trauma.''Head injuries due to bleeding are often classified by the location of the blood within the skull.''Skull fractures are described by which bone is broken, whether there is an associated laceration of the scalp (open ''fracture''), and whether the bone is ''depressed'' and potentially pushed into the brain tissue.''Brain injuries often occur in combination with one another. The effects of brain injury depend upon the amount of brain tissue damaged and the level of pressure within the skull and its effects on the brain.' Epidural hematoma: With an epidural hematoma, the bleeding is located between the dura mater and the skull (epi=outside). This injury 
most often occurs along the side of the head where the middle meningeal artery runs in a groove along the temporal bone. This bone is relatively thin and offers less protection than other parts of the skull. As the bleeding continues, the hematoma or clot expands. There is little space in the skull for the hematoma to grow and as it expands, the adjacent brain tissue is compressed. With increased pressure the brain begins to shift and becomes compressed against the bones of the skull. The pressure tends to build quickly because the septae that attach the dura to the skull bones create small spaces that trap blood. Symptoms of head injury and decreased level of consciousness occur as the pressure increases. Subdural hematoma: A subdural hematoma is located beneath the dura mater (sub=below), between it and the arachnoid layer. Blood in this space is able to dissipate into a larger space because there are no septae limiting the blood flow. However, after a period of time, the amount of bleeding may cause increased pressure and cause symptoms similar to those seen with an epidural hematoma. Subarachnoid bleed: Subarachnoid bleeding occurs in the space beneath the arachnoid layer where the cerebrospinal fluid is located. Often there is intense headache and vomiting with subarachnoid bleeding. Because this space connects with the spinal canal, pressure buildup tends not to occur. However, this injury often occurs in combination with the other types of bleeding in the brain and the symptoms may be compounded. Intracerebral bleed: Intracerebral bleeding occurs within the brain tissue itself. Sometimes the amount of bleeding is small, but like bruising in any other part of the body, swelling or edema may occur over a period of time, causing a progressive decrease in the level of consciousness and other symptoms of head injury. Sheer injury: Sometimes, the damage is due to sheer injury, where there is no obvious bleeding in the brain, but instead the nerve fibers within the brain are stretched or torn. Another term for this type of injury is diffuse axonal injury. Edema: All injuries to the brain may also cause swelling or edema, no different than the swelling that surrounds a bruise on an arm or leg. However, because the bones of the skull cannot stretch to accommodate the extra volume caused by swelling, the pressure increases inside the skull and causes the brain to compress against the skull. Skull fracture: The bones of the skull are classified as flat bones, meaning that they do not have an inside marrow. It takes a significant amount of force to break the skull, and the skull does not absorb any of that impact. It is often transmitted directly to the brain."
What are the causes of head injury?,"'By definition, trauma is required to cause a head injury, but that trauma does not necessarily need to be violent. Falling down a few steps or falling into a hard object may be enough to cause damage. Motor vehicle crashes account for about 17% of traumatic brain injuries, while 35% are from falls. The majority of head injuries occur in males.''Penetrating head injuries describe those situations in which the injury occurs due to a projectile, for example a bullet, or when an object is impaled though the skull into the brain. ''Closed head injuries refer to injuries in which no lacerations are present. ''The brain may also be injured without a direct blow to the skull. If there is trauma in which the head shakes back and forth, it may cause the brain to shake and slosh around inside the skull and become injured.'  "
What are the symptoms of a head injury?,"'The symptoms of head injury can vary from almost none to ''loss of consciousness'' and ''coma''. As well, the symptoms may not necessarily occur immediately at the time of injury. While a brain injury occurs at the time of trauma, it may take time for enough swelling or bleeding to occur to cause symptoms that are recognizable.''Initial symptoms may include a change in mental status, meaning an alteration in the wakefulness of the patient. There may be loss of consciousness, lethargy, and ''confusion''. ''Head injury symptoms may also include:''Some of these symptoms are similar to those of a ''stroke''. Other symptoms may be subtler and include''Late signs of significant head injury and raised pressure within the brain and skull include a dilated pupil, ''high blood pressure'', low pulse rate, and abnormal ''breathing'' pattern. These are critical changes in the physical examination and indicate that brain death may be near.''''Coma'"" may be present if the patient doesn't awaken completely and is defined as a prolonged episode of altered level of consciousness. There are different levels of coma, and the Glasgow coma scale is one way of measuring its depth.""   vomiting, difficulty tolerating bright lights, leaking cerebrospinal fluid from the ear or nose, bleeding from the ear, speech difficulty, paralysis, difficulty swallowing, and numbness of the body. nausea, dizziness, irritability, change in personality, sleep changes, including insomnia or persistent sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and thinking, and amnesia."
What is the Glasgow coma scale?,"'The Glasgow Coma Scale was developed to provide health care practitioners a simple way of measuring the depth of coma based upon observations of eye opening, speech, and movement. Patients in the deepest level of coma:''Those in lighter comas may offer some response, to the point they may even seem awake, yet meet the criteria of coma because they do not respond normally to their environment.''An awake person has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15, while a person who is dead would have a score of 3. The abnormal motor responses of flexion and extension describe arm and leg movement when a painful stimulus is applied. The term ""''decorticate''"" means that the cortex of the brain, the part that deals with movement, sensation, and thinking, is not working. ""''Decerebrate''"" means that the cerebrum (the whole brain), the cortex, and the brainstem that controls basic bodily functions like breathing and heartbeat, is not working.''The scale is used as part of the initial evaluation of a patient, but does not assist in making the diagnosis as to the cause of coma. Since it ""scores"" the level of coma, the Glasgow Coma Scale can be used as a standard method for pre-hospital emergency providers to determine the severity of head injury. It also allows the next provider in the chain of care to compare their assessment to the previous one. In this way, there is a standard score to determine whether the patient is improving or decompensating from the injury scene during the transitions to the ER, to the operating room, or ICU.' do not respond with any body movement to pain, do not have any speech, and do not open their eyes."
When should I contact a doctor about a head injury?,"'It is not normal to be unconscious or not fully awake. Emergency medical services (call 9-1-1 in your areas if it is available) should be activated for persons who have sustained an injury.'""Because head injuries may also be associated with neck injuries, victims should not be moved unless they are in harm's way. If possible, it is important to wait for trained medical personnel to help with immobilizing and moving the patient.""'If the patient is awake and feeling normal, it may be worthwhile seeking medical care if there was significant trauma. These patients may be considered to have a minor head injury or ''concussion''. There is a significant amount of research that has been done to decide which people with head injuries should be admitted to the hospital for observation or have a CT (computerized tomography) scan of the head to look for bleeding.''Many guidelines exist to help a physician decide who might have a brain injury associated with a head injury. These guidelines (Ottawa or Canadian CT rules, New Orleans CT rules) apply to people ages 16 to 65 who are fully awake and have a Glasgow coma scale of 15. Potential brain injury may exist if the patient had any of the following:''Those older than 65 years of age are at increased risk of bleeding from head injury because the ''aging'' brain shrinks away from the skull, causing the veins that ''bridge'' from the skull to the brain surface to be more easily torn.''The rules deciding what patient might need a ''CT scan'' do not apply when the patient is taking a blood thinner or anti-platelet medication. Even minor injury may cause significant bleeding within the skull, potentially causing brain injury.' amnesia to events preceding the injury, vomiting, alcohol or drug intoxication, seizure, trauma above the collarbones, significant headache, and dangerous mechanism of injury like a fall from more than five stairs or being hit by a car. Examples of blood thinners include warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Examples of anti-platelet medications include clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), and ticagrelor (Brilinta).

How do medical professionals diagnose a head injury?,"'As with most injuries and illnesses, finding out what happened to the patient is very important. The health care professional will take a history of the events. The information may be provided by the patient, people who witnessed the event, emergency medical personnel, and if applicable, the police. The circumstances are very important since it is important to find out the severity and intensity of the trauma sustained by the head. Please be aware, even ''small head'' ''bumps'' or shaking can cause a brain injury.''In all trauma patients, especially those who have an injury around the collarbone, care needs to be taken to consider whether a neck or cervical spine injury has occurred. Often the neck is immobilized until this concern can be addressed.''Physical examination begins with assessing the ABCs (''airway'', breathing, circulation) to make certain that the patient is stable and does not need emergent life-saving interventions. This is especially important in those patients who are unconscious and may not be able to maintain their own airway or breathe on their own.''If the patient is not fully awake, the examination will initially try to determine the level of coma. The Glasgow Coma Scale number is useful in tracking whether the patient is improving or declining in function over time.''If no other injuries are found on examining the body, attention will be paid to the head and the neurologic exam.''The skull may be examined for signs of trauma, including bruising (contusion) and swelling (hematoma). Palpating or feeling the skull may find evidence of a ''fracture''. If a laceration is present, it is important to know if there is a ''broken bone'' beneath it. The face may be examined as well, since the face provides protection to the front of the head.''The health care professional may also examine the patient for evidence of a basilar skull fracture, in which an injury has occurred to the bones that support the brain. Signs of this type of fracture include:''The neurologic exam may include evaluation of the cranial nerves, the short nerves that leave the brain and control the face muscles, eye movements, swallowing, ''hearing'', and sight, among other functions.''The exam may include evaluation of muscle tone and strength of the arms and legs; sensation in the extremities (including light touch, ''pain'"", and vibration); and if the neck is determined not to be injured, the patient's ability to walk may be assessed.""'Depending upon the findings of the physical examination, a CT scan may be needed to look for bleeding in the brain.''It is important to remember that injuries to other parts of the body may also be present, and the evaluation of the head injury may occur at the same time as the evaluation of other injuries.' bruising of the tissues around the eyes (called raccoon eyes), bruising behind the ear (Battle's sign), bleeding from the ear canal, or cerebrospinal fluid leaking from the ear or nose."
How is a head injury treated?,"'The treatment of a head injury depends upon the type of injury. For patients with minor head injuries (''concussions''), nothing more may be needed other than observation and symptom control. ''Headache'' may require pain medication. ''Nausea'' and vomiting may require medications to control these symptoms.''Bleeding''Intracerebral bleeding'"" or bleeding in the spaces surrounding the brain require a neurosurgical consultation, although not all bleeding requires an operation. The decision to operate will be individualized based upon the injury and the patient's medical status.""'One option may include craniotomy, drilling a hole into the skull or removing part of one of the skull bones to remove or drain a ''blood clot'', and thereby relieve pressure on brain tissue.''Other times, the treatment is supportive, and there may be a need to monitor the pressure within the brain. The neurosurgeon may place a pressure monitor through a drilled hole through the skull to monitor the pressure. The slang term for this procedure is ""placing a bolt.""''Supportive care is often required for those patients with significant amounts of bleeding in their brain and who are in coma. Many times, the patient requires ''intubation'' to help control breathing and to protect them from vomiting and aspirating vomit into the ''lungs''. Medications may be used to sedate the patient for comfort and to prevent injury if the bleeding causes combativeness. Medications may also be used to try to control swelling in the brain if necessary.'  "
What is the prognosis for a head injury?,"'The goal for the treatment of any patient is to return to the level of function that they had prior to the injury. This maybe a challenge with head injury, and the return of function depends upon the severity of the injury to the brain.'  "
How can a head injury be prevented?,"'Prevention is the best way to treat a head injury.'  In sporting activities, the use of a helmet may help decrease the risk of injury. Similarly, wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle or bicycle helps minimize the risk of brain injury. Seatbelts can help prevent a head injury during a motor vehicle crash. Since alcohol is a risk factor for falls and other injuries, it should be used responsibly. Falls are a concern in the elderly. Homes can be made less fall-prone by installing assist devices on walls and in bathrooms. Loose floor coverings such as area rugs should be avoided, since walking from one floor covering to another increases the risk of falls. If needed, canes and walkers may be helpful as walking assistive devices."
What about a head injury in infants and young children?,"'A minor head injury in an infant is described by the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' as the following, ""A history or physical signs of blunt trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain in an infant or child who is alert or awakens to voice or light touch.""''In children and infants younger than 2 years of age, it is more difficult to assess their mental status and guidelines that work for adults do not necessarily apply to this age group. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) has developed an algorithm that helps decide when a CT scan of the head might be appropriate.''For children younger than 2 years of age:''CT scan is recommended for those patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, ''altered mental status'', or a palpable skull fracture. ''For those with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 but with an occipital, temporal, or parietal hematoma (that is swelling on the back or side of the head), significant trauma, or loss of consciousness for greater than 5 seconds, or for those not acting normally according to their parents, a CT scan may be considered based upon the following: ''In some situations, observation instead of CT scan may be appropriate. For all others, CT scan is not recommended.''For children older than 2 years of age:''CT scan is recommended for those patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 15, altered mental status, or a basilar skull fracture.''For patients with loss of consciousness, vomiting, severe ''headache'', or a severe mechanism of injury, a CT scan may be considered based upon the following:''In some situations, observation instead of CT scan may be appropriate. For all others, CT scan is not recommended.'   physician experience, multiple physical findings, worsening symptoms during observation in the ER, age less than 3 months, or parental preference. physician experience, multiple physical findings, worsening symptoms during observation in the ER, or parental preference."
What are head lice?,"'Head lice (''Pediculus humanus capitis'') are parasites that can be found on the heads of people. ''Pediculosis'' is the term for an infection with head lice. (The head louse, ''Pediculus humanus capitis'', is different from the pubic louse (''Pthirus pubis''), which causes pubic hair infections, and the body louse (''Pediculus humanus corporis'').' "
How common is head lice infestation?,"'Head lice infestation is very common, and it has been around since ancient times. While the exact frequency of infections is unknown, estimates range from 6-12 million cases annually.'  "
Who is at risk for getting head lice?,"'Anyone who comes in close contact with someone who already has head lice, or even their contaminated clothing and other belongings, is at risk for acquiring head lice. So it is easy to transmit head lice from one person to another. Preschool and elementary-school children (3-11 years of age) and their families are infected most often. Girls contract head lice more often than boys, and women contract more head lice than men.' "
How in the world does a child get head lice?,"'A child can contract head lice in a number of ways.' Contact with an already infested person (Personal contact is common during play, school, or sports activities, and at school, home, slumber parties, or camp.) Wearing infested clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons Using infested combs, brushes, or towels Lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with a person with lice (though there is evidence that the risk is very low if more than 48 hours has passed since the exposure)"
Does getting an infection with head lice mean that the person has poor hygiene?,'No. Getting a head lice infection has nothing to do with personal hygiene. Anyone can become infested with head lice.' 
What do head lice look like? What is the life cycle of head lice?,"'There are three forms of lice, namely the ''nit'', the nymph, and the adult louse.''Nit'': Nits are lice eggs. Nits are hard to see and are often confused with ''dandruff'' or hair-spray droplets. Nits are found firmly attached to the hair shaft. They are oval shaped, 2-3 mm in length and usually yellow to white in color. Nits take about a week to hatch.''Nymph'': The nit hatches into a baby louse called a nymph. It looks like an adult head louse but is smaller. Nymphs mature into adults about seven days after hatching. To live, the nymph must feed on human blood.''Adult'"": The adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed, has six legs, and is tan to grayish-white in color. In people with dark hair, the adult louse looks darker. Females lay nits; they are usually larger than males. Adult lice can live up to 30 days on a person's head. To live, adult lice need to feed on human blood. If the louse falls off a person, it dies within two days.""'Life cycle'': The nits hatch into nymphs, which become full grown lice. In order to produce more nits, the adult lice must mate.' "
Where are head lice most commonly found?,"'Head lice are most frequently located on the ''scalp'' behind the ears and near the neckline at the back of the neck. Head lice hold on to hair with hook-like claws that are found at the end of each of their six legs. Head lice are rarely found on the body, eyelashes, or eyebrows.' "
Head lice vs. dandruff,"'Head lice are often confused with ''dandruff''. ''Dandruff'' can easily be distinguished by combing the hair or even just rubbing. Dandruff should be easily removed, but the nits of head lice are firmly attached to the hair shaft.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of head lice infestation?,'The signs and symptoms are'   a tickling feeling of something moving in the hair; itching (caused by the an allergic reaction to the bites); sores on the head (caused by scratching); these sores on the head can sometimes become infected; irritability.
How is a head lice infestation diagnosed?,"'Head lice can be detected by looking closely through the hair and scalp for nits, nymphs, or adults. Locating a nymph or adult may be difficult; there are usually only a few of them, and they can move quickly from searching fingers. However, the presence of nits close to the scalp confirms that a person is infested. If the nits are located more than ¼ inch from the scalp, the infestation is probably an old one. If you are not sure whether or not a person has head lice, the diagnosis should be made by a health care professional, school nurse, or a professional from the local health department or agricultural extension service. The nits of head lice are easily visible with a microscope. Dr. Ioffe-Uspensky performed a study that showed that using a louse comb was better than visual inspection alone when screening for lice infestations.' "
Does a black light help to diagnose lice infections?,'A black light is sometimes used to see if there are nits with live lice in them. Some reports indicate that nits with live lice will fluoresce.' 
What is the treatment for a head lice infestation (pediculosis)?,"'For effective elimination of head lice, the infested individual, family members that are also infested, and the home must all be treated. It is important to remember that treatment should only be started if there are clearly live lice identified. According to the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' in a recent clinical report, ""The ideal treatment of lice should be safe, free of toxic chemicals, readily available without a prescription, easy to use, effective and inexpensive.""''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) or prescription medications are used to treat the affected people and their families. Follow these treatment steps:'   Remove all clothing. Apply lice-killing medicine, also called pediculicide, according to the label instructions. If a child has extra-long hair, one may need to use a second bottle. Warning: Do not use a cream rinse or combination shampoo/conditioner before using lice medicine. Do not rewash hair for one to two days after treatment. Have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. If some live lice are still found eight to 12 hours after treatment but are moving more slowly than before, do not retreat. Comb dead and remaining live lice out of the hair using a fine-toothed comb (lice comb). The medicine sometimes takes longer to kill the lice. If no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before eight to 12 hours after treatment, the medicine may not be working. See a health care professional for a different medication and follow their treatment instructions. Nit (head lice egg) combs, often found in lice medicine packages, should be used to remove nits and lice from the hair shaft. Many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. After the initial treatment, check, comb, and remove nits and lice from hair every two to three days. Retreat in seven to 10 days. Check all treated people for two to three weeks until you are sure all lice and nits are gone."
What is the treatment for a head lice infestation (pediculosis)? (Continued),"'Treating the whole house is a laborious but important task. Follow these steps:' Machine wash all washable clothing and bed linens that the infested person touched during the two days before treatment (to kill the lice and nits). Use the hot water cycle (130 F; 55 C) to wash clothes. Dry laundry using the hot cycle for at least 20 minutes. Dry clean clothing that is not washable (coats, hats, scarves, etc.), or store all clothing, stuffed animals, comforters, etc., that cannot be washed or dry cleaned into a plastic bag and seal it for two weeks. (By this time, any nits that have survived will have hatched and the nymphs would die without a feeding source.) Soak combs and brushes for one hour in rubbing alcohol, Lysol, or wash with soap and hot (130 F; 55 C) water and then place in bag and leave in freezer for two days. Vacuum the floor and furniture. Do not use fumigant sprays. (They can be toxic if inhaled.)"
My child has head lice. I don't. Should I treat myself to prevent being infested?,"""No. Although anyone living with an infested person can get head lice, you don't need to be treated. Check household contacts for lice and nits every two to three days. Treat if lice and nits are found."" "
Should my pets be treated for head lice?,'No. Head lice do not live on pets.' 
My child is under 2 years of age and has been diagnosed with head lice. Can I treat my child with prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) drugs?,"'For children under 2 years old, remove nits, nymphs (immature adult lice), and adult lice by hand, and see a health care professional. Permethrins are approved for children older than 2 months of age; however, this should too be done after consultation with your physician.' "
What OTC medications are available to treat head lice?,"'Many head lice medicines are available at drugstores. Each OTC product usually contains one of the following active ingredients:' Pyrethrins (often combined with piperonyl butoxide, in brand name products: A-200, Pronto, R&C, RID, Triple X): Pyrethrins are natural extracts from the chrysanthemum flower. Though safe and effective, pyrethrins are not ovicidal (egg-killing) and can only kill crawling lice, not unhatched nits. It is applied to dry hair and allowed to remain for 10 minutes but no longer. After 10 minutes, the hair should be brought to a lather with warm water and then rinsed clear. Finally, towel dry (no hair dryer). A second treatment is recommended in seven to 10 days to kill any newly hatched lice. Treatment failures are common due to, in part, the development of resistance. They should not be used in people allergic to chrysanthemum or ragweed. Pyrethrins are approved for use on individuals 2 years of age or older. Permethrins 1% (NIX): Permethrins are similar to natural pyrethrins. Permethrins were introduced in 1986 and are safe and effective and may continue to kill newly hatched eggs for several days after treatment. The person should first wash their hair using a shampoo without a conditioner and towel dry the hair until it is still damp but not soaking wet. Apply the NIX to the damp hair and scalp. Make sure to get behind the ears and neck. Leave NIX in hair for 10 minutes but no longer. Rinse hair completely and towel dry. A second treatment may be needed in seven to 10 days to kill any newly hatched lice. Treatment failures are common, but NIX can be used on children as young as 2 months of age. Dimethicones (LiceMD, silicone oils, Hedrin, NYDA): Dimethicones are a type of silicone oil. These products are believed to work by coating surfaces and acting as a physical barrier that asphyxiates the louse. Unfortunately, there has been very limited research on their effectiveness. Nevertheless, some limited studies have shown moderately good rates of killing the lice. These dimethicones are biologically inert and are considered non-toxic in humans. In the United Kingdom, they are used almost exclusively, and they are considered highly effective by many physicians. Other agents: There are a number of other agents that have been used to treat lice. Some agents mix coconut oil and tea tree oil with permethrins or pyrethrins. It is not clear if these agents work alone or only in combination with other pediculocides. Other home remedies include using olive oil, mayonnaise, and even vinegar. However, there are no studies proving their efficacy."
What prescription drugs treat head lice?,"'Malathion .5%'' (''Ovide''): Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that is only available as a prescription and it kills live lice (pediculicidal) and the lice inside the eggs/nits (ovicidal). It has actually been pulled off the market twice due to safety concerns, but it was reintroduced in the United States (USA) in 1999 due to increasing resistance of head lice to other treatments. The formulation in the United States contains terpineol dipentene, isopropyl alcohol, and pine needle oil, both of which have pediculicidal properties. The product is used differently than other compounds. The product is extremely flammable and should never be around heat, hair dryers, or curling irons. The product is applied to dry hair until the scalp and hair are thoroughly coated. Make sure that the area behind the ears and the back of the neck are covered. Let the hair dry naturally (no hair dryers). The product is left in place for eight to 12 hours. After eight to 12 hours, wash and rinse the hair with shampoo. Use a nit comb (fine-toothed comb) to remove any nits. If live lice are noted after seven days, retreat. It is currently recommended only for individuals 6 years of age up to 60 years of age.''Benzyl alcohol 5%'' (Ulesfia): Benzyl alcohol is available in the U.S. as a 5% lotion. The product is applied to dry hair until the scalp and hair are thoroughly coated. Make sure that the area behind the ears and the back of the neck are covered. Leave it in the hair for only 10 minutes and then rinse thoroughly in a sink. Do not use a shower to avoid getting the solution over the rest of the body. You can immediately wash your hair with regular shampoo. It is not ovicidal and needs to be repeated in one week if there is any evidence of live lice.''Spinosad'' (Natroba): Spinosad is a derived from soil bacteria. It is both pediculicidal (kills the live lice) and ovicidal (kills the lice inside the eggs/nits). It is moderately more effective than the over-the-counter treatments but is available only by prescription and is very expensive. If live lice are noted after seven days, retreat. It is approved in children 6 months of age and older and contains benzyl alcohol, as well.''Ivermectin'' (Sklice): Ivermectin is available as both a 0.5% lotion (which is FDA approved for the treatment of lice) and as an oral medication (which is not approved in the U.S. for treatment of lice). It has been used to treat helminthic infestations (worms) for many years. Generally, only one treatment is needed. It is pediculocidal (kills live lice). Although it is not ovicidal (kills the lice inside the eggs/nits), it appears to prevent nymphs (newly hatched lice) from surviving. Topical ivermectin lotion may be used in the treatment of lice in children 6 months of age and older. While oral invermectin is commonly used in other countries for lice, it is currently not approved for the treatment of head lice in the U.S. In countries where it is approved, the dosage is usually a single dose, which is often repeated in nine days.''Lindane'' (Kwell): It is important to note that lindane 1% (Kwell) is no longer recommended as a treatment option for head lice due to its toxicity in children. It can still be prescribed, but most experts recommend against its usage.''Other treatments such as permethrin 5%, crotamiton 10%, and ''sulfamethoxazole''-''trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim'') are not currently approved by the FDA for the use in the treatment of head lice.' "
Which head lice medicine is best for me?,"'If unsure, please consult with a pharmacist or health care professional.' "
What are the rules with head lice medicines?,"'When using head lice medicine, as with any medicine, always follow the instructions provided.''When treating head lice,' do not use extra amounts of the lice medication, do not treat the infested person more than two times with the same medication (if it does not seem to work, see a health care professional), do not mix different head lice medications."
Are any home remedies effective at getting rid of head lice?,"'Occlusion therapy, nit combing, and ''hair removal'' have not been proven to be fully effective in completely eradicating head lice.''Home remedies that have been tried include vinegar, mayonnaise, petroleum jelly, olive oil, butter, rubbing alcohol, and prolonged water submersion. These all fail to eliminate infestation, because these therapies do not kill all of the eggs or lice. This is believed due to the specialized way the parasite ""breathes.""''Hair removal has never been proven to be effective, but since the louse requires a hair shaft to lay its eggs, it should prevent the lice from multiplying. This is not always considered a desirable option for many children.''There is also a device that uses hot air to kill the lice. The device, OneCure, is an FDA-cleared home device. Currently, there are no published studies looking at the efficacy of this product.'  "
Should household sprays be used to kill adult lice?,'No. Spraying the house is ''not'' recommended. Fumigants and room sprays can be toxic if inhaled.' 
Should I have a pest-control company spray my house to get rid of lice?,'No. Vacuuming floors and furniture is sufficient to treat the house.' 
Is it possible to prevent head lice?,"""It's not always so easy to prevent head lice 100% of the time since it is a common infestation. Whenever possible, do not share hats or head coverings. Also avoid sharing combs and brushes with other individuals, since it can be transferred this way. If exposed to another individual diagnosed with head lice, continue to check the hair for eggs or adult lice every couple of days, but do not treat unless head lice are discovered.""  "
What is the prognosis of a head lice infestation?,"'Once diagnosed and treated effectively, the prognosis is excellent. Eradication is of course the goal, and occasionally retreatment and alternative treatments are needed. Always consult a health care professional if one needs advice.' "
Should schools and day cares refuse children until no nits are present?,"'The American Academy of Pediatrics no longer recommends the so-called ""no nit"" policy of some schools and day cares. There is a very low risk of spreading lice within the classroom, and nits may not actually represent the continued presence of live lice.' "
Is reinfestation with head lice common?,"'Although a child could get a new infestation from being reexposed to an infested individual, self-reinfestation is the most common way for the infestation to recur. The CDC recommends checking the individual for two to three weeks to ensure that there are no new nits or lice.' "
What causes head lice infestation?,"'Lice'' (singular: louse) are tiny insects (known as parasites) that are most commonly found on the head (''scalp''). Hence, they are also referred to as ‘''head lice''’. The other sites where lice can be seen are behind the ears and on the back of the neck.''Head lice'' infestation is medically known as ‘''pediculosis'' capitis.’ It is caused due to the spread of lice from one person to another through ‘head-to-head’ (hair-to-hair) contact. ''Head lice'' cannot fly or jump but can crawl at a rapid pace on the scalp. They feed on the blood of the person whom they have infested.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a head lice infestation?,"'The most common symptom of head lice infestation is intense ''itching'', which is an ''allergic reaction'' to the saliva of the lice. Other signs and symptoms include:''Some children may also have''It is possible that children may have head lice on the scalp but do not develop any of the signs and symptoms for several weeks.' Feeling that something is crawling on the head Light brown bugs (head lice) moving swiftly on the scalp Yellow, brown, pin-sized lice eggs (nits) glued to the hair Red bumps (sores) on the scalp, head, or shoulders Swollen nodes (glands) on the neck Pink eye (an eye infection)"
What is the treatment of head lice infestation?,"'Getting rid of lice completely is a troublesome process and needs patience.''A head lice infestation will usually take about 4 to 6 weeks to clear up even with treatment.''The doctor will initially advise using ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) products that kill lice and some of the nits in the scalp of the child. The instructions written on the bottle or product information leaflet should be read before using the product.''OTC medications:''After applying any of the OTC lotions, it is necessary to comb the hair from the roots to the tips to remove any lice. This should be done once in a day to remove all the dead lice and their eggs.''Prescription medications:''If OTC medicines have failed to eliminate the lice, the doctor may recommend any of the prescription medicines that include:''All the members of the family need to be treated because they may have been infested with head lice as well. The other general measures to stop the spread within the family/house include:' Permethrin 1% (Nix): This medication is available in the form of lotion, which needs to be applied to the hair for 10 minutes followed by hair wash. It kills only the lice and not the nits. Hence, the application needs to be repeated after 9 to 10 days to kill the hatched eggs before they can produce new eggs. Pyrethrin in combination with piperonyl butoxide (A–200, Pronto, R&C, Rid, Triple X) Ivermectin (Sklice) Spinosad (Natroba) Malathion Use of the hot water cycle of the washing machine to wash clothes Dry cleaning of the clothing that is not washable (coats, hats, scarves, etc.) Storing or dry cleaning all clothing (such as comforters), which cannot be washed, and then placing them into a sealed plastic bag and keeping them away for at least 2 weeks Soaking combs and brushes for 1 hour in rubbing alcohol or washing it with soap and hot water Vacuuming the floor and all the furniture in the house"
How can head lice infestation be prevented?,"'It is difficult to prevent the spread of lice amongst school children because there is so much contact that happens between them. However, here is what can be instructed to the children:' To keep the garments away from other children's garments (by hanging on a hook) To avoid sharing personal items, such as combs and hats To not lie on the beds or couches that have been used by other children"
What are lice?,"'Lice are small parasites that can affect three areas of the ''human body''. ''Head lice'' (the subject of this article), ''body lice'', and ''pubic lice'' (also known as ''crabs'') are causes by three different but related parasites. Lice infestation occurs only in humans. ''Head lice'' infestation is by far and away the most common version of the three parasitic infections and is very ''contagious'"". Direct contact or sharing of items (fomites) that would touch the infected individual's hair/scalp is the primary mode of transmission from one person to another. Examples would include sharing caps, combs/hairbrushes, headphones, etc."" "
What is dandruff?,"'Dandruff, also called seborrheic dermatitis, is not an infection and not contagious. Rather it is a scalp abnormality that causes dry, scaly flakes to be shed in excess. Another manifestation of seborrheic dermatitis that may affect infants more frequently is commonly called cradle cap. This scalp change appears as scaly scalp areas that have a greasy character rather than the dryness of classical dandruff (which is not usually seen in infants or toddlers).' "
What are the causes and risk factors of lice infestations and dandruff?,"'Lice infestation is a person-to-person transmission of a parasite via contaminated agents (fomites) that facilitate transfer of the agent. Such agents would include caps, combs/hairbrushes, pillows, and headphones. Lice infestation is highly contagious and is very common in the toddler and early childhood grades. Between 6-12 million children from 3-11 years of age will develop a lice infestation annually. Crowded conditions, day care centers, and female gender (more likely to share hair brushes/combs) are risk factors. For reasons not fully understood, African-American hair is less likely to support a lice infection.''The presence of dandruff is extremely common. Many teen and adults have experienced such scalp changes. Some experience repeated exacerbations of the condition and may someday to be demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition to dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) is similarly a very common scalp situation found in the infant and toddler. Similar to dandruff, the situation may be of minimal consequence to some and a repeated experience to others. Neither condition reflects ''poor hygiene''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'While both lice infestation and dandruff share common signs and symptoms, both may also occasionally appear without symptoms. Common elements include moderate scalp ''itching'' and small (2 mm in length) ivory white/opalescent material on the hairs shaft. Scalp lice infestation tends to occur predominately at the nape of the neck and may demonstrate immature lice (called ""nits"") attached to hair shafts approximately 1-2 cm from the scalp. Mature forms of lice (3-5 mm in length, resembling a mobile sesame seed) may be observed moving over the scalp surface. Dandruff affects the entire scalp and is unique (vs. lice) in that small white flakes are easily demonstrated on the shoulders after rubbing the scalp. The scalp of an infant with cradle cap will characteristically demonstrate the area to have a yellow greasy character that may be loosened and removed by scraping with a fingernail.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'A history and physical examination allow accurate identification of the diagnosis. The characteristic changes in the scalp and examination for nits/mature lice help solidify the diagnosis. A Wood\'s lamp (""black light"") may be used to facilitate demonstration of nits on the hair shaft. It is rare that a specialist (such as a dermatologist) would need to be consulted.' "
What are the treatments for a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'Treatment for lice consists of application of over-the-counter shampoos that contain either ''permethrin'' 1% (Nix, Rid, A200) or ''pyrethrin'' (Pronto). The former agent is generally used in that it kills both nits and adult lice whereas the latter is only lethal against lice (but not nits). In addition, permethrin products continue to be effective for several days after the shampoo is washed out. A repeat shampoo is recommended for both agents seven to 10 days after the first application. A prescription shampoo (''ivermectin'' [Sklice]) is available if the above over-the-counter measures are not effective. ''Nit'' removal from hair shafts using a fine-toothed comb is worthwhile. Combs used to remove fleas from ''dogs'' and cats work well. All potential contact items (combs, caps, etc.) should be washed in water between 120-140 degrees. All other fomites (sofa cushions, pillows, towels, etc.) should be thoroughly vacuumed. The CDC recommends that all family members be screened for lice infestation and treated if demonstrated to be infected. Those not infected do not need to be treated.''Effective treatment of dandruff involves using an anti-dandruff shampoo (Head & Shoulders, T-Gel, etc.) that are effective but may require daily use to establish control of the situation. Infants and toddlers with seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) usually respond well to washing the scalp with routine baby shampoos. If the scalp is excessively involved, using the adult anti-dandruff shampoos detailed above may be safely used.' "
What is the prognosis for a lice infestation and for dandruff?,"'Both conditions carry an excellent prognosis. Repeated therapy may be required if the primary problem is not addressed (for example, not sharing hairbrushes). The symptoms (moderate itching of the scalp) are typically bothersome but not severe.' "
Is it possible to prevent a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'Following scalp/hair hygiene by not sharing items that may be contaminated by lice is effective prevention. Dandruff and/or cradle cap are not preventable at this time. However, they are only cosmetic by nature and not contagious and effectively treated by simple measures.' "
What are head lice?,"'Head lice'' (Pediculus humanus capitis) are tiny wingless insects that may be found on the head, eyebrows, and eyelashes of people. They feed on human blood many times a day and live close to the human ''scalp''.''Head lice'' infestation can affect anyone; however, it is more commonly seen in children. ''Head lice'' can easily spread from one person to the other, making it difficult at times to get rid of them. The infestation is often annoying because the ''lice'' bites can make the scalp ''itchy'' and irritated. Repeated scratching may lead to infection. Head lice as such are not dangerous and are not known to spread any diseases. Head lice must be treated right away to prevent the infestation from spreading.''Head lice infestation is very common in the United States. It is mostly seen in pre-school children attending childcare, elementary school children, and the household members of the affected children. An estimated 6 to 12 million head lice infestations occur each year in the United States among children between three to 11 years of age.' "
How do people get head lice?,"'Head lice are easily transmitted from person to person. Being wingless, head lice cannot hop or fly. They move by crawling and spread by direct contact with the head of the hair of an infected person. Coming in head-to-head contact with a person carrying head lice poses the greatest risk of transmission. Head lice can also spread by sharing or coming in contact with personal items, such as clothing (caps/hats, scarves, coats, etc.), combs, hairbrushes, hair bands, or towels, used by an infected person. They may also spread by lying on a bed, couch, pillow, or carpet that recently has been in contact with an infected person.' "
How would I know if I have head lice?,"'The surest way to know that you have a head lice infestation is by finding a live nymph (an immature louse) or adult louse on your scalp or hair. Using a magnifying ''lens'' and a fine-toothed comb may help to find live lice. If you cannot find crawling lice, you may look for the nits (tiny lice eggs) firmly attached within one-fourth of an inch from the base of the hair.''If you are unsure whether you have a head lice infestation, you may take the help of a healthcare provider or other person trained to identify live head lice.''The typical signs and symptoms of head lice infestation are:' Tickling feeling as if something is moving in the hair. Itching caused by allergic reactions due to the head lice bites. Irritability and difficulty sleeping since the head lice avoid light and are most active in the dark. Sores or small red bumps on the scalp, forehead, neck, and shoulders caused by scratching."
What is a headache?,"'Headache is defined as pain arising from the head or upper neck of the body. The pain originates from the tissues and structures that surround the skull or the brain because the brain itself has no nerves that give rise to the sensation of pain (pain fibers). The thin layer of tissue (periosteum) that surrounds bones, muscles that encase the skull, sinuses, eyes, and ears, as well as thin tissues that cover the surface of the brain and spinal cord (meninges), arteries, veins, and nerves, all can become inflamed or irritated and cause a headache. The pain may be a dull ache, sharp, throbbing, constant, intermittent, mild, or intense.' "
How are headaches classified?,"'In 2013, the International Headache Society released its latest classification system for headache. Because so many people suffer from headaches, and because treatment is difficult sometimes, the Headache Society hoped that the new classification system would help health care professionals make a more specific diagnosis as to the type of headache a patient has, and allow better and more effective options for treatment.''The guidelines are extensive, and the Headache Society recommends that health care professionals consult the guidelines frequently to make certain of the diagnosis.''There are three major categories of headache based upon the source of the pain.''The guidelines also note that a patient may have symptoms that are consistent with more than one type of headache, and that more than one type of headache may be present at the same time.' Primary headaches Secondary headaches Cranial neuralgias, facial pain, and other headaches"
What are primary headaches?,"'Primary headaches include migraine, tension, and cluster headaches, as well as a variety of other less common types of headaches.''Primary headaches can affect the quality of life. Some people have occasional headaches that resolve quickly while others are debilitating. While these headaches are not life-threatening, they may be associated with symptoms that can mimic ''strokes''.''Many patients equate severe headache with migraine, but the amount of pain does not determine the diagnosis of migraine. Read our ''Migraine Headache'' article for more information about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of ''migraines''.' Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache. Tension headaches occur more commonly among women than men. According to the World Health Organization, 1 in 20 people in the developed world suffer with a daily tension headache. Migraine headaches are the second most common type of primary headache. Migraine headaches affect children as well as adults. Before puberty, boys and girls are affected equally by migraine headaches, but after puberty, more women than men are affected. Cluster headaches are a rare type of primary headache. It more commonly affects men in their late 20s, though women and children can also suffer from this type of headache."
What are secondary headaches?,"'Secondary headaches are those that are due to an underlying structural or infectious problem in the head or neck. This is a very broad group of medical conditions ranging from dental pain from infected ''teeth'' or pain from an infected sinus, to life-threatening conditions like bleeding in the brain or infections like ''encephalitis'' or meningitis.''Traumatic headaches fall into this category including post-''concussion'' headaches.''This group of headaches also includes those headaches associated with ''substance abuse'' and excess use of medications used to treat headaches (medication overuse headaches). ""''Hangover''"" headaches fall into this category as well. People who drink too much ''alcohol'' may waken with a well-established headache due to the effects of alcohol and ''dehydration''.' "
"What are cranial neuralgias, facial pain, and other headaches?","'Neuralgia means ''nerve pain'' (neur=nerve + algia=pain). Cranial neuralgia describes inflammation of one of the 12 cranial nerves coming from the brain that control the muscles and carry sensory signals (such as pain) to and from the head and neck. Perhaps the most commonly recognized example is ''trigeminal neuralgia'', which affects cranial nerve V (the trigeminal nerve), the sensory nerve that supplies the face and can cause intense facial pain when irritated or inflamed.' "
17 types of headaches,"'The different types of headaches depend upon the class to which they belong. Some common types include:' Primary tension headaches that are episodic Primary tension headaches that are chromic Primary muscle contraction headaches Primary migraine headaches with aura Primary migraine headaches without aura Primary cluster headache Primary paroxysmal hemicrania (a type of cluster headache) Primary cough headache Primary stabbing headache Primary headache associated with sexual intercourse Primary thunderclap headache Hypnic headache (headaches that awaken a person from sleep) Hemicrania continua (headaches that are persistently on one side only, right or left [unilateral]) New daily-persistent headache (NDPH) (a type of chronic headache) Headache from exertion Trigeminal neuralgia and other cranial nerve inflammation Secondary headaches due to:TraumaDisordersInfectionStructural problems with the bones of the face, teeth, eyes, ears, nose, sinuses or other structuresSubstance abuse or withdrawal Trauma Disorders Infection Structural problems with the bones of the face, teeth, eyes, ears, nose, sinuses or other structures Substance abuse or withdrawal"
What causes headaches?,"'Migraine headache is caused by inflammation or irritation of structures that surround the brain or affect its function. While the brain itself has no pain nerve fibers, everything else above the shoulders, from the neck, skull, and face, can cause a person to have head pain. Systemic illnesses, including infection or ''dehydration'', can have associated headache. These are known as toxic headache. Changes in circulation and blood flow or trauma can also cause headache.''Changes in brain chemistry may also be associated with headache: Medication reactions, ''drug abuse'' and drug withdrawal can all cause pain.''Every person is different so the history of the headache is important. Recognizing patterns or precipitating (foods eaten, ''stress'"", etc.) factors, in combination with the physical examination and associated symptoms, can help identify the cause for each individual's""' ''specific headache.' "
What causes tension headaches?,"'While tension headaches are the most frequently occurring type of headache, their cause is not known. The most likely cause is contraction of the muscles that cover the skull. When the muscles covering the skull are stressed, they may become inflamed, go into spasm, and cause pain. Common sites include the base of the skull where the trapezius muscles of the neck insert, the temples where muscles that move the jaw are located, and the forehead.''There is little research to confirm the exact cause of tension headaches. Some believe that tension headaches occur because of physical ''stress'' on the muscles of the head. For example, these stressors can cause the muscles surrounding the skull to clench the teeth and go into spasm. Physical stressors include difficult and prolonged manual ''labor'', or sitting at a desk or computer concentrating for long periods. Emotional stress also might cause tension headaches by causing the muscles surrounding the skull to contract.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of tension headaches?,"'Common signs and symptoms of tension headaches include:' Pain that begins in the back of the head and upper neck and is often described as a band-like tightness or pressure. It may spread to encircle the head. The most intense pressure may be felt at the temples or over the eyebrows where the temporalis and frontal muscles are located. The pain may vary in intensity but usually is not disabling, meaning that the sufferer may continue with daily activities. The pain usually is bilateral (affecting both sides of the head). The pain is not associated with an aura (see below), nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound. The pain occurs sporadically (infrequently and without a pattern) but can occur frequently and even daily in some people. The pain allows most people to function normally, despite the headache."
How are tension headaches diagnosed?,"'The key to making the diagnosis of any headache is the history given by the patient. The health care professional will ask questions about the headache to try to help make the diagnosis. Those questions will try to define the quality, quantity, and duration of the pain, as well as any associated symptoms. The person with a ''tension headache'' will usually complain of mild-to-moderate pain that is located on both sides of the head. People with tension headaches describe the pain as a non-throbbing tightness, that is not made worse with activity. There usually are no associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity.''The physical examination, particularly the neurologic portion of the examination, is important in tension headaches because to make the diagnosis, it should be normal. However, there may be some tenderness of the ''scalp'' or neck muscles. If the health care professional finds an abnormality on neurologic exam, then the diagnosis of tension headache should be put on hold until the potential for other causes of headaches has been investigated.' "
How are tension headaches treated?,"'Tension headaches are painful, and patients may be upset that the diagnosis is ""only"" a tension headache. Even though it is not life threatening, a tension headache can make daily activities more difficult to accomplish. Most people successfully treat themselves with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications to control tension headaches. The following work well for most people:''If these fail, other supportive treatments are available. Recurrent headaches should be a signal to seek medical help. Physical therapy, ''massage'', biofeedback, and ''stress management'' can all be used as adjuncts to help control tension headaches.''It is important to remember that OTC medications, while safe, are medications and may have side effects and potential interactions with prescription medications. It always is wise to ask a health care professional or pharmacist if one has questions about OTC medications and their use. This is especially important with OTC pain medications, because they are used so frequently.''It is important to read the listing of ingredients in OTC pain medications. Often an OTC medication is a combination of ingredients, and the second or third listed ingredient may have the potential of interfering with the action of other ''drugs'"" based upon a patient's other medical issues. For example:""'Other examples where caution should be used include the following:'   aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol) and naproxen (Aleve). Some OTC medications include caffeine, which may trigger rapid heartbeats in some patients. In nighttime preparations, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be added. This may cause sedation, and driving or using heavy machinery may not be appropriate when taking a sedative medication. Some OTC cold medications have pseudoephedrine mixed in with the pain medication. This drug can cause elevated blood pressure and palpitations. Aspirin should not be used in children and teenagers because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a life threatening complication that may occur when a viral infection is present and aspirin is taken. Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are anti-inflammatory medications that can be irritating to the stomach and may cause intestinal bleeding. They should be used with caution in patients who have peptic ulcer disease. Most anti-inflammatory medicines also cause the potential for bleeding elsewhere in the body, and you should not take them if you also take blood thinners. Talk with your doctor or other health care professional about the benefits and risks of anti-inflamatory drugs. Blood thinners include warfarin (Coumadin), heparin (Lovenox), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa), clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and prasugrel (Effient). Overuse of aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen also may cause kidney damage. Acetaminophen, if used in amounts greater than recommended, can cause liver damage or failure. It also should be used with caution in patients who drink significant amounts of alcohol or who have liver disease because even lesser doses than are normally recommended may be dangerous. Medication overuse headache can be mistaken for chronic tension headaches. When pain medications are used for a prolonged period, headaches may recur because the effects of the medication wear off. (This type of headache was referred to as a ""rebound headache,"" and is classified as a secondary headache.)"
What causes cluster headaches?,"'Cluster headaches are so named because they tend to occur daily for periods of a week or more followed by long periods of time -- months to years -- with no headaches. They occur at the same time of day, often waking the patient in the middle of the night.'""The cause of cluster headaches is uncertain but may be due to a sudden release of the chemicals histamine and serotonin in the brain. The hypothalamus, an area located at the base of the brain, is responsible for the body's biologic clock and may be the source for this type of headache. When brain scans are performed on patients who are in the midst of a cluster headache, abnormal activity has been found in the hypothalamus.""'Cluster headaches also:''If an individual is in a susceptible period for cluster headache, ''cigarette smoking'', alcohol, and some foods (for example, ''chocolate'',\xa0and foods high in nitrites like smoked meats) also are potential causes for headache.' tend to run in families and this suggests that there may be a role for genetics; may be triggered by changes in sleep patterns; and may be triggered by medications (for example, nitroglycerin, used for heart disease)"
What are the symptoms of cluster headaches?,"'Cluster headaches are headaches that come in groups (clusters) separated by pain-free periods of months or years. A patient may experience a headache on a daily basis for weeks or months and then be pain-free for years. This type of headache affects men more frequently. They often begin in adolescence but can extend into middle age.''Unlike people with migraine headaches, those with cluster headaches tend to be restless. They often pace the floor and/or bang their heads against a wall. People with cluster headaches can be driven to desperate measures, including ''suicidal thoughts''.'   During the period in which the cluster headaches occur, pain typically occurs once or twice daily, but some patients may experience pain more than twice daily. Each episode of pain lasts from 30 to 90 minutes. Attacks tend to occur at about the same time every day and often awaken the patient at night from a sound sleep. The pain typically is excruciating and located around or behind one eye. Some patients describe the pain as feeling like a hot poker in the eye. The affected eye may become red, inflamed, and watery. The nose on the affected side may become congested and runny."
How are cluster headaches diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of cluster headache is made by taking the patient's history. The description of the pain and its clock-like recurrence is usually enough to make the diagnosis.""'If examined in the midst of an attack, the patient usually is in a painful crisis and may have the eye and nose watering as described previously. If the patient is seen when the pain is not present, the physical examination is normal and the diagnosis will depend upon the history.' "
How are cluster headaches treated?,"'Cluster headaches may be very difficult to treat, and it may take trial and error to find the specific treatment regimen that will work for each patient. Since the headache recurs daily, there are two treatment needs. The pain of the first episode needs to be controlled, and the headaches that follow need to be prevented.''Initial treatment options may include one or more of the following:''Prevention'' of the next cluster headache may include'   inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen (though this will not work if the headache is well established); injection of triptan medications, like, sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), and rizatriptan (Maxalt) which are common migraine medications; spraying or dripping lidocaine, a local anesthetic, into the nostril; dihydroergotamine (DHE, Migranal), a medication that causes blood vessels to constrict; and caffeine. calcium channel blockers, for example, verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Verelan PM, Isoptin, Covera-HS) and diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor, Tiazac); prednisone (Deltasone, Liquid Pred); antidepressant medications; lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid); and antiseizure medications including valproic acid, divalproex (Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakene, Depacon), and topiramate (Topamax)."
Can cluster headaches be prevented?,"""Since cluster headache episodes may be spaced years apart, and since the first headache of a new cluster episode can't be predicted, daily medication may not be warranted.""'Lifestyle changes may help minimize the risk of a cluster headache flare. Stopping ''smoking'' and minimizing alcohol may prevent future episodes of cluster headache.' "
What diseases cause secondary headaches?,"'Headache is a symptom associated with many illnesses. While head pain itself is the issue with primary headaches, secondary headaches are due to an underlying disease or injury that needs to be diagnosed and treated. Controlling the headache symptom will need to occur at the same time that diagnostic testing is performed to identify the underlying disease. Some of the causes of secondary headache may be potentially life threatening and deadly. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential if damage is to be limited.''The International Headache Society lists eight categories of secondary headache. A few examples in each category are noted (This is not a complete list.).''Oral contraceptives'', medications used to treat ''erectile dysfunction'', blood pressure or other cardiac medications can all lead to or cause headaches. Medication overuse headache, occurring when pain medications are taken too frequently, can be caused by acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil and others), OTC analgesics with caffeine (Excedrin and others), as well as ''narcotic analgesics'' and other prescription pain medications.' Injuries to the head may cause bleeding in the spaces between the meninges, the layers of tissue that surround the brain (subdural, epidural, and subarachnoid spaces) or within the brain tissue itself (intracerebral hemorrhage: intra=within + cerebral=brain, hemorrhage=bleeding). Edema or swelling within the brain, not associated with bleeding, may cause pain and a change in mental function. Concussions, where head injury occurs without bleeding. Headache is one of the hallmarks of post-concussion syndrome. Whiplash and neck injury also cause head pain. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) when they leak Cerebral aneurysm and subarachnoid hemorrhage. An aneurysm, or a weakened area in a blood vessel wall, can expand and leak a small amount of blood causing what is called a sentinel headache. This may be a warning sign of a future catastrophic bleed into the brain. Carotid artery inflammation Temporal arteritis (inflammation of the temporal artery) Brain tumors, either primary, originating in the brain, or metastatic from a cancer that began in another organ Seizures Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, historically called pseudotumor cerebri, where pressure within the spinal canal increases. The cause is unknown and while it can occur in all ages, it often affects young, obese females. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension can cause significant headache and if left untreated may, on occasion, lead to blindness. Meningitis Encephalitis HIV/AIDS Systemic infections (for example, pneumonia or influenza) High blood pressure (hypertension) Dehydration Hypothyroidism Kidney dialysis Sinus infection Dental pain Glaucoma Iritis"
How are secondary headaches diagnosed?,"'If there is time, the diagnosis of secondary headache begins with a complete patient history followed by a physical examination and laboratory and radiology tests as appropriate.''However, some patients present in crisis with a decreased level of consciousness or unstable vital signs due to the underlying cause of the headache. In these situations, the health care professional may decide to treat a specific cause without waiting for tests to confirm the diagnosis.''For example, a patient with headache, ''fever'', stiff neck, and ''confusion'' may have meningitis. Since meningitis can be rapidly fatal, antibiotic therapy may be started before blood tests and a ''lumbar puncture'' are performed to confirm the diagnosis. It may be that another diagnosis ultimately is found, for example, a ''brain tumor'' or subarachnoid hemorrhage, but the benefit of early antibiotics outweighs the risk of not giving them promptly.' "
What are the exams and tests for secondary headaches?,"""The patient history and physical examination provide the initial direction for determining the cause of secondary headaches. Therefore, it is extremely important that patients with a new, severe headache seek medical care and give their health care professional an opportunity to assess their condition. Tests that may be useful in making the diagnosis of the underlying disease causing the headaches will depend upon the doctor's evaluation and what specific disease, illness, or injury is being considered as the cause of the headaches (the differential diagnosis). Common tests that are considered include the following:""'Specific tests will depend upon what potential issues the health care professional and patient want to address.''Blood tests''Blood tests provide helpful information in association with the history and physical examination in pursuing a diagnosis. For example, an infection or inflammation in the body may cause a rise in the white blood cell count, the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR), or ''C-reactive protein'' (CRP). These two tests are very nonspecific; that is, they may be abnormal with any infection or inflammation, and abnormalities do not point to a specific diagnosis of the cause of the infection or inflammation. The ESR is often used to make the tentative diagnosis of ''temporal arteritis'', a condition that affects an older patient, usually over the age of 65, who presents with a sharp, stabbing temporal headache, due to inflammation of the arteries on one side of the head.''Blood tests may be used to assess ''electrolyte'' imbalance, and a variety of other potential problems involving organs like the liver, kidney, and thyroid.''Toxicology tests may be helpful if the patient is suspected of abusing alcohol, or prescription or other drugs of abuse.''Computerized tomography of the head''Computerized tomography (CT scan) is able to detect bleeding, swelling, and some tumors within the skull and brain. It also can show evidence of a previous ''stroke''. With intravenous contrast injection (''angiogram''), it may also be used to look at the arteries of the brain for aneurysms.''Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head''MRI is able to show the anatomy of the brain and the layers that cover the brain and the spinal cord (meninges). It is more precise than computerized tomography. This type of scan is not available at all hospitals. Moreover, it takes much longer to perform, requires the patient to cooperate by holding still, and requires that the patients have no metal in their body (for example, a ''heart'' ''pacemaker'' or metal foreign objects in the eye).''Lumbar puncture''Cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, can be obtained with a needle that is inserted into the spine in the lower back. Examination of the fluid looks for infection (such as meningitis due to bacteria, virus, fungus, or ''tuberculosis'') or blood from hemorrhage. In almost all cases, computerized tomography is done prior to lumbar puncture to make certain there is no bleeding, swelling, or ''tumor'' within the brain. Pressure within the space can be measured when the lumbar puncture needle is inserted. Elevated pressures may make the diagnosis of idiopathic ''intracranial hypertension'' (previously known as ''pseudotumor cerebri'') in combination with the appropriate history and physical examination.' blood tests; computerized tomography (CT scan) of the neck; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head; and lumbar puncture (spinal tap)."
When should I seek medical care for a headache?,"'Seek medical care if the headache is:'   The ""worst headache of your life."" This is the wording often used in textbooks as a cue for medical practitioners to consider the diagnosis of a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The amount of pain will often be taken in context with the appearance of the patient and other associated signs and symptoms. Too often, patients are prompted to use this expression by a health care professional and do not routinely volunteer the phrase. Different than your usual headaches Starts suddenly or is aggravated by exertion, coughing, bending over, or sexual activity Associated with persistent nausea and vomiting Associated with fever or stiff neck. A stiff neck may be due to meningitis or blood from a ruptured aneurysm. However, most patients who complain of a stiff neck have muscle spasm and inflammation as the cause. Associated with seizures Associated with recent head trauma or a fall Associated with changes in vision, speech, or behavior Associated with weakness or change in sensation on one side of the body that may be a sign of stroke Not responding to treatment or is getting worse Requires more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter medications for pain Disabling and interfering with work and quality of life"
How do you get rid of a headache? Are home remedies effective for headaches?,"'It is important to consider that an unusual headache may need to be evaluated by a health care professional, but in most instances, primary tension headaches may be initially treated at home.''Those with migraine headaches often have a treatment plan that will allow treatment at home. Prescription medications are available to abort or stop the headache. Other medications are available to treat the nausea and vomiting. Most patients with migraine headaches get much relief after resting in a dark room and falling asleep.''Patients who have secondary headaches will often need to seek medical care.' First steps include maximizing rest and staying well hydrated. Recognizing and minimizing stressful situations may be of help, if that is one of the contributing causes of the headache. If there has been a cold or runny nose recently, humidifying air may be helpful in allowing sinuses to drain. Rubbing or massaging the temples or the muscles at the back of the neck may be soothing, as might warm compresses. Over-the-counter pain medication may be helpful, in moderation."
What home remedies relieve headache pain?,"'Many people are occasionally bothered by ''headaches'' and wonder how to get rid of a ''headache'' quickly. The way to end a ''headache'' quickly depends on what brought it on in the first place. For many people, causes of ''headaches'' or triggers are related to ''dehydration'', ''high blood pressure'',\xa0tight muscles in the neck and shoulders due to physical or emotional ''stress'', or\xa0a reaction to foods, additives, medications, or chemicals that trigger inflammatory reactions in the blood vessels.''To resolve a ''headache'', the cause needs to be evaluated.'  "
Caffeine,'Many ''headaches'' respond to ''caffeine'' – a cup of ''caffeinated'' tea or coffee can often be used to resolve a ''headache''. ''Cluster headaches'' and ''migraines'' are most responsive to ''caffeine''.' 
Hydrate,"'The first thing to try to get rid of a ''headache'' without ''drugs'' is to drink water or an ''electrolyte'' beverage. This helps because\xa0''dehydration'' is a common cause of a ''headache''. This is especially useful to get rid of a ''headache'' that results from drinking alcoholic ''beverages'' (a ''hangover'' headache). Ideally, choose an ''electrolyte'' beverage without artificial colors and sweeteners as these can add to a headache. Packets of powdered drink mixes, such as those mixed with ''vitamin C'', are good options. If you have ''diabetes'', it is important to look carefully at the ''sugar'' content of the drink.' "
Hot or cold compress,"'Applying a hot compress to the back of the neck or forehead can relax tension and ease vasoconstriction. For some people, a ''cold'' compress may feel better. A combination of heating creams (''Bengay'' or similar) and self-''massage'' into the sore muscles of the neck or upper back can help relax the muscles.' "
"Essential oils, herbs, and vitamins that soothe and get rid of a headache",'Headaches'' sometimes can be cured naturally. Herbal medicines can help people who get ''headaches'' often or suffer from ''migraines''.' 
Yoga,"'One research study has shown that ''yoga'' can be effective for ''headaches''. The ''yoga'' practice included ''breathing'' techniques (pranayama) and yoga postures (asana).''3'' Simple stretching can also be helpful for headaches. Try doing some gentle neck rolls, stretching the jaw, and stretching each ear toward the shoulder. ' "

What foods trigger headaches?,"'Headaches in some people can be triggered by certain foods that cause histamine release and vasospasm. This is often the cause of cluster headaches. Foods that trigger histamine release can include:''Another category of foods that can trigger headaches are tyramine-rich foods. Some people have a deficiency of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme that breaks down tyramine and other amines. In this situation, too many tyramine-rich foods overwhelm the enzyme and cause headaches. Tyramine-rich foods include:''Salt also can cause headaches because it leads to fluid retention and ''high blood pressure''. Salt is added to most packaged and processed foods so it is best to avoid those. Check labels and keep sodium less than 1500 mg per day. Hidden sources of salt in the ''diet'' include:'   Preserved or highly processed foods Canned beans and meats Fermented and aged food Alcohol Shellfish Smoked fish and meat Nuts Beans Chocolate Aged cheeses Aged meats such as air-dried beef Aged sausage and salami Beer, especially on tap Red wine Fermented or aged foods like sauerkraut Soy sauce Miso soup Cottage cheese and cheese Pickles Olives Deli meat and sausages Snacks foods like pretzels and chips Sauces and salad dressings"
Natural home remedies for headaches during pregnancy,"'Many of the natural remedies work safely in ''pregnancy'"", but any treatment decision must be discussed with the woman's obstetrician or ""'midwife''.' Non-medication strategies help pregnant women get relief while avoiding both over-the-counter (OTC) medications and herbs that may not be safe. Hydration is critical. Dehydration is common in pregnancy. A large glass of mineral water or electrolyte-replacement beverage can resolve dehydration. Blood pressure is often high in pregnancy and can be a cause of headache. High blood pressure requires treatment. Relaxation, magnesium, and avoiding salt all help with headaches related to high blood pressure. Hydrotherapy, the therapeutic use of hot and cold, is helpful and safe in pregnancy. Apply a hot pack to the head and the back of the neck. This can be paired with a short application of an ice pack to maximize the relief."
Which types of specialists treat headaches naturally?,"'Many practitioners may have useful advice about treating headaches without medication. That advice will depend on the precise diagnosis for that particular individual.''Make your health care professional aware that you are interested in natural therapies. That will allow and open an\xa0educated discussion. Your health care professional should be able to help you make the right decisions and help diagnose the underlying cause of your headaches.''Sometimes natural remedies may be suggested.

What are the sinuses and what do they look like (pictures)?,"'Sinuses of the face are ''cavities'' or spaces within the bones that help humidify the air and secrete mucus to help with air filtration. Additionally, they contribute to the strength of the skull and its ability to resist ''trauma''. The sinus ''cavities'' also allow more resonance to be added to the voice.''The sinuses are often referred to as the paranasal sinuses because of their location and connection to the back of the nose. The sinuses develop as air sacs within the bones of the skull, which are named by their location.''While infants do have sinuses, they are very poorly developed. The maxillary sinuses cannot be seen on an X-ray until 1 to 2 years of age and the frontal sinuses are not seen until age 5 or 6.' Frontal sinus: located above the eyes within the frontal bone of the skull Maxillary sinus: located beneath the eyes under the cheekbones within the maxilla bone of the face Ethmoid sinus: located in the ethmoid bone separating the eyes from the nose Sphenoid sinus: located in the sphenoid bone at the base of the skull"
What is a sinus headache?,"'If the linings of the ducts or tubes that connect the sinuses to the back of the nose become inflamed, the sinuses may not be able to drain normally, and pressure may build up within the blocked sinus. There may also be associated swelling and inflammation of the lining of the sinuses, resulting in increased mucus and fluid secretion. This increase in fluid combined with the inability to drain increases pressure within the sinus ''cavity'', causing the ''pain'' of a ''sinus headache''. The term ''sinusitis'' is used to describe inflammation of the sinus.'  "
What causes sinus headaches?,"'While a sinus inflammation (''sinusitis'') may be caused by a viral infection and causes swelling in the nose (inflammation). This inflammation and decreased ability of the sinuses to drain also may be caused by an ''allergic reaction'' such as ''hay fever''. The inflammation causes swelling and increased fluid production. In the sinuses, this decreases the ability of the sinuses to drain. This increased inflammatory fluid production and the decrease in drainage causes the pain and pressure of a sinus ''headache''.''After a period, bacteria and ''viruses'' may travel from the nasal cavities into the stagnant fluid within the sinus ''cavity'' and cause an infection. Most ''sinus infections'' are due to ''viruses''. Viruses are the more likely cause if symptoms have been present for less than a week and are not getting worse. ''Bacterial infections'' typically will follow the initial period of inflammation from a viral infection or other significant sinus blockage. Less commonly, ''fungal infections'' may cause a ''sinus infection'', and even more rarely, tumors can invade the sinus.''The maxillary sinus sits underneath the eye within the cheekbone. The upper ''teeth'' attach to the lower portion of this bone, and dental infections can travel up the root of the tooth and infect the sinus directly.''Because there is almost always nasal inflammation associated with sinus inflammation, the illness is now often referred to as rhinosinusitis.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of sinus headaches vs. other types of headaches?,"   Pain and pressure are the primary symptoms of a sinus headache, usually due to the increased inflammation and decreased drainage from the affected sinus cavity. The pain of a sinus headache is often described as an increasing pressure sensation overlying the sinus that is blocked. This may be the cheek area (maxillary), the forehead (frontal area), or both. The part of the face in the area of the affected sinus can be tender to touch and reddened. Swelling also may occur. The pain can increase with changing head positions or when first getting up out of bed, again because of increased pressure within the sinus cavities."
What are the signs and symptoms of sinus infections and sinusitis?," If there is an infection, fever, chills, feeling poorly, or achy muscles occur. Opaque or greenish-yellow nasal drainage. Postnasal drainage, in which secretions drip down to the back of the throat. This can cause a cough and sometimes people have signs like coughing up yellow sputum. However, they may actually be coughing up the drainage that has dripped down from the sinuses instead of coughing up phlegm from the lungs. Swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands) may occur in the neck if an infection is present, which is no different than the swelling of lymph nodes that accompanies an acute sore throat (pharyngitis) or ear infection (otitis media). If there is no infection, ear drainage may be clear. If the maxillary sinus is inflamed, pain may also be felt in the upper teeth since the sinus is located within the bone that holds those teeth. Pain also may radiate to the temples, back of the neck, or top of the head."
How long does a take for a sinus headache to go away?," Acute sinusitis typically lasts less than eight weeks or occurs no more than three times per year with each episode lasting no longer than 10 days. Medications are generally effective against acute sinusitis. Successful treatment counteracts damage done to the mucous lining of the sinuses and surrounding bone of the skull. Chronic or recurring sinusitis lasts longer than eight weeks or occurs more than four times per year, with symptoms usually lasting more than 20 days."
What tests diagnose the causes of a sinus headache?,"'It is important that the cause of the ''headache'' be diagnosed. Many patients who believe that they have sinus ''headaches'' may instead have ''migraine'' or tension ''headaches''.''The health-care professional will likely begin by taking a history of the symptoms to help come to the diagnosis. Contributing factors in the development of sinusitis and headache may include a recent ''cold'' or ''upper respiratory tract infection'', history of ''smoking'', environmental ''allergies'' to dust or molds, as well as recent airplane travel, ''swimming'' or SCUBA diving, or other activities involving air pressure changes within the facial sinuses.''Physical examination may reveal tenderness to percussion, or tapping, over the affected sinus that reproduces the pain. Examination of the ears may reveal a serous otitis, or fluid levels behind the eardrum in the middle ear, that may suggest drainage problems in the face and sinuses. Examination of the nose may reveal swollen nasal passages and discharge. Evaluation of the mouth and teeth may find a source of infection, and the back of the throat may be examined for signs of postnasal drainage.''Routine ''X-rays'' of the face are not recommended to make the diagnosis of sinusitis or ''sinus infection''. If the doctor considers imaging studies of the sinuses, it is to confirm the diagnosis, and look for fluid collections or thickening of the mucus membranes that line the sinus walls. Limited ''CT scan'' of the sinuses is often recommended. Plain X-rays of the sinuses may sometimes be considered. Blood tests tend not to be helpful in making the diagnosis of the cause of sinus headache.' "
What is the treatment to cure a sinus headache?,"'Usually, a sinus headache can be cured with treatment, which can be two-fold. First, sinus inflammation is treated to help them drain. Once the sinuses are drained and the pressure is relieved, the pain should subside. Next, relief of headache pain and other signs and symptoms.'  "
"What home remedies relieve pain, pressure, and other sinus headache symptoms?",'Natural and home remedies that can be used at home to help decrease ''congestion'' include:' Drink plenty of fluids to help keep the body hydrated. Use a humidifier and a salt-water nasal spray to help with congestion Neti pots are an alternative way to get humidity into the nasal passages and assist with drainage to prevent inflammation and infection. Remember to read the instructions and use distilled or properly boiled water. Deaths have been caused by infections using tap water in the Neti-pot.
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications treat and relieve sinus headache pain and pressure?,"'OTC ''cold'' medications are available to help decrease inflammation within the sinuses and promote drainage. Brand name and generic ''drugs'' may be considered, but many contain pseudoephedrine (''Sudafed''), a medication that is related to adrenaline. People with ''high blood pressure'', ''heart'' conditions, or are ''pregnant'', should consult their doctor or pharmacist to assess their safety before taking these medications.''Some ''decongestant'' nasal sprays, other than salt-water sprays (Ocean Nasal Spray), may be used, but only for a short period because of side effects and complications. For example, Afrin and similar nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row; otherwise, rebound inflammation may occur. With rebound inflammation, when the spray medication is stopped, the linings of the nasal passages may swell and potentially cause even more drainage complications.' "
What prescription medications treat a sinus headache pain and pressure?,"'Headaches'' from ''allergies'' can be relieved with a prescription for nasal steroids sprays unless there is a contraindication. This may be helpful along with nasal saline rinses to decrease inflammation within the nasal passages and treat or prevent sinusitis.''If a bacterial infection is suspected, the health-care professional may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection and at the same time make suggestions to treat the underlying inflammation. To establish the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the need for antibiotics, your doctor should confirm that symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis have been present for 10 days or are worsening. Symptoms should include pus-like (purulent) nasal drainage, nasal obstruction, facial pain or pressure. If the inflammation does not resolve before the antibiotic course is complete, the bacterial infection may recur.' "
Will surgery cure sinus infections and inflammation?,"'If the sinus headache persists, and repeated courses of treatment fail to relieve the sinusitis, surgery may be an option. Otorhinolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat [ENT] surgeons) may be able to widen the openings that allow the sinuses to drain and decrease the risk of recurrent inflammation that may obstruct the sinuses from draining.' "
What are the complications of a sinus headache? Can you die?,"'Complications of a sinus infection (sinusitis) are rare; however, if left untreated a sinus infection may erode through the bony walls of the sinus and infect adjacent structures in the face. Two potential areas for spread of the infection include:'   The orbit (eye socket), causing pain, swelling, and redness of the eyelid and skin surrounding the orbit. There can also be pain with any eye motion. Decreased vision may develop. The brain, causing symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. The blood vessels that run near the sinuses can develop inflammation and blood may clot (thrombus). Cavernous sinus thrombosis is inflammation and clotting of the cavernous sinus (a collection of small veins located near the sphenoid sinus), that can potentially become infected and form blood clots."
Which type doctors treat sinus headaches?,"'Most primary health-care professionals, including those who practice family medicine, ''pediatrics'', and internal medicine, can care for routine ''sinus infections''. Often patients will seek care at a walk-in clinic or Urgent Care Center. If complications arise, otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat specialists) are often consulted to discuss the potential need for surgery and drainage of a sinus. On the rare occasion when ''fungal infections'' of the sinus are present, an infectious disease specialist may be consulted.' "
When should you call a doctor for a sinus headache?," Many people correctly self-diagnose sinusitis and treat themselves at home. Drinking plenty of fluids and humidifying the air is often enough to open the nasal passages and allow the sinuses to drain. This home treatment also may loosen secretions that are already present and promote drainage. However, medical care may be needed if a fever is present, if there is swelling that can be felt in the face (perhaps signaling an abscess formation), or if the person exhibits a change in behavior or thinking. Seeking medical care may also be appropriate if the pain does not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, and others) or acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or if symptoms last longer than 10 to 14 days."
Can sinus headaches be prevented?,"'Sinus ''headaches'' are due to inflammation of the sinuses and their ability to drain to the back of the nose.' Avoid smoking, secondhand smoke, and other allergens because they may decrease the risk of developing sinusitis and a sinus headache. Smoking reduces the ability of the sinuses to clear mucous and fluid. Avoid colds and other respiratory infections because it may decrease the risk of sinus inflammation, for example, frequent hand washing, and avoiding people who are sick. Flying is not recommended if you have a cold, sinus infection, or an upper respiratory infection because of the pressure changes in the face that occur with flying. Maintaining adequate hydration and breathing humidified air at home and work will allow the normal mucus that is produced in the sinuses to drain more easily."
What is the prognosis for a sinus headache?,"'Sinus ''headaches'' are short-lived temporary problems associated with colds or ''hay fever''. They recover quickly, once the underlying condition resolves.''Certain people develop chronic sinus inflammation and more long-standing symptoms associated with their sinusitis. Once the underlying condition is identified, preventive measures may be available and future recurrences of the sinus headache may be minimized. If the headache symptoms are not associated with inflammation of the sinuses, the underlying cause (such as a ''migraine headache'') needs to be adequately addressed to relieve symptoms.' "
Introduction to Spinal Headaches,"'A ''spinal headache'' can occur as a result of a procedure such as a ''spinal tap'' (''lumbar puncture'"") or epidural block (such as that performed during a woman's ""'labor and delivery''). In these procedures, a needle is placed within the fluid-filled space surrounding the spinal cord. This creates a passage for the spinal fluid to leak out, changing the fluid pressure around the brain and spinal cord. If enough of the fluid leaks out, a spinal ''headache'' may develop.''Because the design of spinal needles has been improved, spinal ''headaches'' after a spinal tap or administration of spinal anesthesia are rare. When epidural anesthetics are placed with a larger needle than that used for spinal anesthetics, however, the likelihood of ''headache'' is higher if the epidural needle should inadvertently pass through the dura matter (covering of the spinal cord).''A spinal ''headache'' may occur up to five days after the procedure is performed. Such a ''headache'' may be prevented with bed rest after a procedure.' "
What Are the Symptoms of a Spinal Headache?,"'The spinal headache often is described as ""a headache like no other."" Spinal ''headaches'' are much more severe when the person is in an upright position; they improve when the person lies down.' "
How Are Spinal Headaches Treated?,"'The first course of treatment for spinal ''headaches'' involves supplying adequate hydration to try to increase cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Sometimes intravenous fluids (fluids administered into the veins) are given; other times the person is advised to drink a beverage high in ''caffeine''. Strict bed rest for 24-48 hours is also recommended.'""In addition, if a person develops a spinal headache following a procedure, the anesthesiologist can create a blood patch with the person's blood to seal the leak. To administer a blood patch, the anesthesiologist inserts a needle into the same space as, or right next to, the area in which the anesthetic was injected. The doctor then takes a small amount of blood from the patient and injects it into the epidural space. The ""'blood clots'' and seals the hole that caused the leak.' "
What is a tension headache?,"""Headache -- a condition so common it's the punch line for a number of jokes, but when you're experiencing a headache, it's no laughing matter.""""When most people discuss headache, they're typically referring to the most frequently experienced type of headache, a tension headache (also known as tension-type or ""'stress'' headache). Almost half of adults experienced a headache in the past year; fortunately, for the majority of those individuals, the headache was mild, short-lived, and likely fell into the category of tension headache.''Children and ''teens'' can experience tension headache; with a significant percentage of children having experienced tension headache by age 15. Females are often diagnosed with tension headaches (more often, about twice as often) than males.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a tension headache?,"'Most tension headaches occur infrequently, and are usually short-lived (resolves within minutes to a few hours). In rare cases the headache may last for many days. A tension headaches that occur more than 15 days each month are referred to as chronic tension headaches.''Tension headaches are not associated with ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', and do not have symptoms like flashing lights, blind spots, or numbness or ''weakness'' of the arms or legs which precede the headache. These symptoms can help distinguish tension headaches from other types of headaches (for example, migraine headaches).'   The pain of chronic tension headache tends to wax and wane in severity. The pain associated with tension headache typically impacts the whole head, but may begin in the back of the head or above the eyebrows. Some people experience a cap or band-like sensation which encircles their skull, while others describe their pain as a muscle tension in their neck or shoulder regions. The pain is frequently described as constant and pressure-like. The pain tends to come on gradually and even at maximum intensity is not incapacitating. Most people who have a tension headache are able to continue their daily activities despite the pain. In some cases, people with tension headache report some sensitivity to light or sound."
What causes tension headaches?,"""The exact cause of tension headache isn't known; and many factors probably play a role in why people develop headache. These factors may include:""'Underlying diseases or conditions may frequently cause a headache, for example:''In children, headache may be seen as a response to changes in school or home situations such as:' lack of sleep, skipping meals, or increased stress (leading to a frequent description of these headaches as stress headaches). eye strain, muscular tension caused by poor posture, over exertion, or anxiety. a new sibling, testing at school, or social isolation."
How are tension headaches treated and diagnosed?,"""Tension headaches are diagnosed based on the patient's reported history of the headache and physical examination. There is no test to specifically confirm tension headache. Because the physical examination in patients with tension headache is generally normal, additional testing such as ""'CT scan'' or ''MRI'"" scan usually isn't required. Some basic blood work may be done to confirm that no underlying abnormality is present.""'Treatment for tension headaches include prescription medications, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) pain relievers, combination ''drugs'' containing ''aspirin'', ''acetaminophen'', ''caffeine'', and stress management.' "
What home remedies relieve pain and other symptoms of tension headaches?,"   Alternative treatments or therapies: Alternative therapies such as a hot compress or an ice pack may provide substantial benefit for some individuals. Hydrate: Sometimes headaches can be triggered by mild dehydration or lack of food; if so, drinking some non-caffeinated fluids or eating something may help. Flaxseed: People who eat flaxseed, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, may experience a decrease in headaches. This is thought to be related to the anti-inflammatory properties of the omega-3 fatty acids. Peppermint or lavender oil: Inhaling the scent of peppermint oil or lavender oil may help decrease headache pain (lavender oil should not be consumed orally). Scalp massage: A scalp massage is easily done and may provide significant relief; concentrating efforts over the temporal regions or the occipital area (the back of the scalp) may lead to the best response. Whole-body massage: Whole body massage may provide relief. Stress management: If stress seems to be a trigger, learning stress-management techniques or relaxation techniques can provide substantial benefit. Exercise: Exercise, whether regular aerobic activities or specific movements to improve posture, has been shown to be quite effective in decreasing the frequency of tension headaches."
What OTC and prescription medications treat pain and manage tension headaches?,"'Many people treat tension headache on their own, using OTC (over-the-counter) medications like acetaminophen (''Tylenol''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), or combination medications containing acetaminophen, aspirin, and ''caffeine'' (Excedrin). While these medications can be effective and when taken as directed are safe for most people, overuse can lead to headaches which are more frequent and severe. This can occur if these agents are used more than 2 days each week routinely. If tension headache occurs during ''pregnancy'', the patient should contact her physician about medications that are safe to use.''If a diagnosis of chronic tension headache is made or suspected, prescription medications may be used in an effort to lessen the frequency and decrease the severity of the headaches. Medications used include ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure drugs. A doctor can help determine which medicine is best for you.'   Products which contain aspirin should not be given to children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. Chronic use of acetaminophen, or use of acetaminophen in large amounts may lead to liver toxicity (current recommended maximal dose is 3 grams per 24 hours), and a number of medications are combined with acetaminophen so patients should discuss all OTC drugs they are taking with their doctors."
"What stress management techniques can help reduce headache pain, other symptoms, and the frequency of tension headaches?","'For people who experience recurrent tension headache, ''stress management techniques'' have been an effective way of helping to decrease headache frequency and severity. This can include regular exercise, deep ''breathing'' techniques, and relaxation training. Other non-medicinal approaches can include massage therapy, heat, ice, or ''acupuncture''. Learning to identify stressful situations which trigger headache and taking steps to avoid these is also a useful strategy for many individuals.' "
Can tension headaches be prevented?,"'Often, the best defense is a good offense and this approach is frequently effective when trying to prevent tension headache. Identifying ''headache triggers'' and then attempting to avoid or modify those triggers can be a successful strategy to decrease or even eliminate a tension headache. Some people find that scheduled exercise and eating on a regular basis is beneficial. Learning and practicing relaxation techniques, including deep breathing exercises, directed relaxation of specific muscles, or meditation, can also be effective.''See your doctor if any of the following situations occur:' If a person experiences regular headaches or if they have changed in severity, location or frequency If a person experiences a headache that is very different from his or her usual headaches If previously helpful treatments are no longer effective If someone is experiencing ""The worst headache of my life"" they need to be evaluated emergently."
Migraine vs. headache pain similarities and differences,"'The ''pain'' of ''migraine'' and ''tension headache'' are similar and tend to be mild, moderate, or severe in nature. The ''pain'' for each type of ''headache'' may be located on one side of the head or on both sides of the head.''The differences between the pain of ''migraine'' and ''headache'' are that migraine pain has a throbbing quality, and many people report even slight physical exertion (such as ''walking'' up a flight of stairs) may worsen their pain.''In contrast, the pain associated with tension-type ''headaches'' tends to be more chronic and steady. Many people with tension ''headache'' describe a band-like tightness or pressure.''If your are experiencing a ''headache'' very different in quality or severity (the worst headache of your life) than your usual ''headaches'', or which is associated with unusual symptoms, or is associated with an elevated temperature, you need medical evaluation immediately to exclude serious underlying causes.' "
Migraine or a another type of headache,"'Headaches'' are one of the most common health problems doctors and other health care professionals treat. Although many people describe all moderate to severe ''headaches'' as “''migraine'',” there are specific criteria used to identify ''migraine'', tension, and other less-common ''headache'' varieties. Doctors and other health professionals consider most ''headaches'' painful, annoying, or even transiently debilitating to a patient, but they cause little risk.''Migraine ''headaches'' tend to have some marked differences from other ''headaches'', which helps your doctor determine which type of headache you have. There are also several different types of migraine headaches. Migraine with aura and migraine without aura are the most common. An aura is a neurological symptom such as vision changes, numbness, tingling, or even difficulty speaking which precedes the onset of the headache.''Although many people believe that any moderate to severe headache is a migraine, there are specific criteria regarding the type of pain and associated symptoms, which lead to the diagnosis of migraine.'   Tension headache, also known as tension-type headache, is the most common form of headache. Most people have experienced a tension headache at some point in their lives. Migraine headache or migraine pain is also common, but occurs far less frequently than tension headache. The pain associated with migraine headache is different from tension-type headache and can help determine which type of headache a person is experiencing. Cluster headache, chronic daily headache, and medication overuse headache occur much less frequently than tension and migraine headache."
Symptoms and signs that are similar and different between migraine vs. headache,"'The only similarity between a migraine and a headache are that both cause pain. The headache may come on gradually or suddenly.''Migraine is different from other headaches because it may cause symptoms including:''These symptoms are often considered to be an acute migraine attack.''Tension-type headaches may be associated with tenderness of the muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders. If you have this type of headache, you do not have a change in pain with physical activity, and there are no associated sensitivities to light, sounds, or smells.'  Nausea or vomiting Sensitivity to light, sound, or smells Worsening of the headache with slight physical exertion"
Differences in causes between migraine vs. headache,"'Doctors believe the underlying cause of ''migraines'' is related to changes in the blood flow in certain areas of the brain, with subsequent alterations in the blood vessels in that region. Chemical reactions may lead to swelling and irritation of the blood vessels (thought to contribute to the characteristic “throbbing” quality of a migraine headache).''The specific cause of tension-type headache is unknown. Doctors believed at one time that chronic muscle tension was the underlying factor, but there now appears to be a more complicated combination of factors that are involved.' "
Difference between triggers for migraine vs. headache,"'Certain factors are common ''migraine triggers'', including:''The cause of tension-type headache tends to be related to ''stress'' and associated tightness or tension in the muscles of the neck or ''scalp''.'   Foods like red wine, chocolate, peanut butter, dairy products, and citrus fruits. Hormonal swings associated with menstrual cycles or pregnancy. Weather changes Certain smells Lack of sleep Gluten can be a migraine trigger for people who have true celiac disease. If you are concerned about this issue, eliminate gluten from your diet for a test period and keep a log for a possible trigger."
Migraine vs. headache diagnosis,"'Although there are no specific tests for migraine headaches, your doctor may order tests to exclude other conditions or problems that are triggering your headaches. This may include blood work or different brain imaging, such as CAT scan or ''MRI''. In rare cases, your doctor may order a ''spinal tap'' to exclude causes of more serious, severe headaches.''A doctor who is experienced in treating various headaches can help differentiate the type of headaches that you have. A ''sinus headache'' (caused by ''sinus infection'' or ''allergic rhinitis'') often mimics some signs and symptoms of ''migraines''.''Monitoring the duration of your headache can provide important information that can help diagnosis the type of headache you are experiencing. Migraine headaches may last a few hours to three days, while tension headaches may last only 30 minutes or linger for up to a week.' Keep a headache diary to help identify triggers that lead up to the onset of the headache, for example, menstrual cycles for women, hormone treatments, and alcohol intake. Keep track of when a headache begins, the severity of the pain, any associated symptoms, how long the headache lasts, and any medications that you have taken. If there does not seem to be any clearly identifiable cause for your headaches, maintain a diet diary, and keep track of any foods or drinks that you may have consumed the day before a headache to identify possible triggers."
Differences and similarities between treatments of migraine vs. headache,"'Treatment of ''migraines'' often focus on reversing the inflammatory changes of the blood vessels thought to be the source of the migraine pain.''Triptans are a class of ''drugs'' effective at helping reduce inflammation and decrease the swelling of the inflamed vessel, which tends to lead to decreased head pain in a relatively short time. Many of these medications also can reduce the associated ''nausea'', light-, and sound - sensitivity that occur with ''migraines''. Examples of triptans include ''sumatriptan'' (''Imitrex'', and Sumavel DosePro), ''eletriptan'' (''Relpax''), ''zolmitriptan'' (''Zomig''), and ''rizatriptan'' (''Maxalt''). These ''drugs'' are available as a pill, nasal spray, or injection.''Botox''. If you have chronic migraines (defined as migraine headache occurring more than 4 hours in one day and more than 15 days for 1 consecutive month), ''Botox''® (botulinum toxin) may help you to decrease the frequency and severity of your migraines. This treatment has not been shown to be of benefit in treating other types of frequent headache.''Erenumab (Aimovig) ''is a new class of drug called a ''calcitonin'' gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) antagonist approved in 2018 for the preventative treatment of migraine. It is a monthly injection used to prevent migraines.' "
Foods help decrease the frequency of migraines,"'Some people with frequent migraines find that avoiding eating certain trigger foods can help alleviate some of their headaches. For others, consuming products high in magnesium, riboflavin, and ''omega-3 fatty acids'' (spinach, whole grain or enriched breads, almonds, salmon) helps decrease some migraine frequency.' "
Home remedies and essential oils that help migraine and headache pain,"'Essential oils are a home remedy used to treat migraines and other types of headaches. Some people benefit by using lavender oil and ''peppermint oil'' as aromatherapy. You can even apply the oils to your scalp. Other home remedies include basil oil, ''feverfew'', , buckwheat, and ''flaxseed''. Consult your doctor before using any home remedies.' "
Can migraines and headaches be cured?,"'Migraine headache and tension-type headaches can occur frequently, even daily. If you have a headache for at least 15 days each month, your doctor or other medical healthcare professional may recommend daily medication. These may include:''Patients who experience migraine headache often will respond extremely well to therapeutic intervention, and their ultimate prognosis (which is good) is no different from patients who experience other types of headache.''Although it may be tempting to treat headaches at home, repeated or recurrent use of medication can lead to a condition known as Medication Overuse Headache, a condition in which headaches occur near daily.''If you are experiencing frequent headache or head pain, it is important to seek appropriate evaluation and treatment. Doctors trained in identifying different types of headaches, for example, internal medicine specialists, neurologists, or allergists, can help diagnose the cause of your headaches.' Antidepressants Anti-seizure medications Certain types of muscles relaxants, depending on the underlying headache. Botox® injections for people with chronic migraine headache."
Introduction,"'Kids get ''headaches'' and ''migraines'', too! Many adults with ''headaches'' started having them as kids -- in fact, 20% of adult ''headache'' sufferers say their ''headaches'' started before age 10, and 50% report their ''headaches'' started before age 20.' "
How Common Are Headaches in Children and Adolescents?,"'Headaches are very common in children and adolescents. In one study, 56% of boys and 74% of girls between the ages of 12 and 17 reported having had a ''headache'' within the past month. By age 15, 5% of all children and adolescents have had ''migraines'' and 15% have had tension headaches.'""Many parents worry that their child's ""'headache'' is the sign of a ''brain tumor'' or serious medical condition, but most headaches in children and adolescents are not the result of a serious illness.'

What Types of Headaches Do Children and Adolescents Get?,"'Children get the same types of headaches adults do, including: tension headaches, migraines, and sinus headaches.' "
What Causes Headaches in Children and Adolescents?,"'Children get headaches for many of the same reasons adults get headaches. But, most headaches in children are usually due to an illness, infection, ''cold'', or ''fever''. Other conditions that can cause headaches include ''sinusitis'' (inflammation of the sinuses), ''pharyngitis'' (inflammation or infection of the throat), or otitis (''ear infection'').'""The exact causes of migraines are unknown, although they are related to changes in the brain as well as to genetic causes. For many years, scientists believed that migraines were linked to the expanding (dilation) and constriction (narrowing) of blood vessels on the brain's surface. However, it is now believed that migraines are caused by ""'inherited'' abnormalities in certain areas of the brain.''Most children and adolescents (90%) who have migraines have other family members with migraines. When both parents have a history of migraines, there is a 70% chance that the child will also develop migraines. If only one parent has a history of migraines, the risk drops to 25%-50%. Children and adolescents with migraines may also inherit the tendency to be affected by certain ''migraine triggers'', such as ''fatigue'', bright lights, and changes in weather.''Some ''migraine'' triggers can be identified such as ''stress'', ''anxiety'', ''depression'', a change in routine or ''sleep'' pattern, bright light, loud noises, or certain foods, food additives, and ''beverages''. Too much physical activity or too much sun can trigger a ''migraine'' in some children or adolescents as well.''Common causes of tension headaches include striving for academic excellence as well as emotional ''stress'' related to family, school, or friends. Other causes of tension headaches include eyestrain and neck or back strain due to poor posture. ''Depression'' may also be a reason your child is having headaches.''When tension headaches worsen over time and occur along with other neurological symptoms such as ''loss of vision'', speech problems, or muscle ''weakness'', they can be the sign of a more serious problem, such as:''If you suspect any of the above listed conditions, immediately take your child to his or her doctor for evaluation.'

Treatment may include education, ''stress management'', biofeedback and medications.' Headache education includes identifying and recording what triggers your child's headache, such as lack of sleep, not eating at regular times, eating certain foods or additives, caffeine, environment, or stress. Helping your child keep a headache diary can help you and your child record this information. Avoiding headache triggers is an important step in successfully treating the headaches. Stress management: To successfully treat tension headaches, it is important for kids and their parents to identify what causes or triggers the headaches. Then they can learn ways to cope or remove the stressful activities or events. Biofeedback: Biofeedback equipment includes sensors connected to the body to monitor your child's involuntary physical responses to headaches, such as breathing, pulse, heart rate, temperature, muscle tension, and brain activity. By learning to recognize these physical reactions and how the body responds in stressful situations, biofeedback can help your child learn how to release and control tension that causes headaches. Medications: There are three categories of headache medications for children, including symptomatic relief and abortive and preventive medications. Many of the drugs used to treat adult headaches are used in smaller doses to treat headaches in children and adolescents. But, aspirinshould not be used to treat headaches in children under age 15. Aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome, a rare, but fatal condition, young kids can get."
What Happens After My Child Starts Headache Treatment?, 
Do Children Outgrow Headaches?,"'Headaches may improve as your child gets older. The headaches may disappear and then return later in life. By junior high school, many boys who have migraines outgrow them, but in girls, migraine frequency increases with age because of hormone changes. Migraines are three times more likely to occur in adolescent girls than in boys.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Who needs a myomectomy?,"'Myomectomy is a surgical procedure that removes fibroids from the uterus. Fibroids (also called leiomyoma) are noncancerous growths that commonly develop in women of childbearing age over the years. These may or may not cause symptoms, such as heavy bleeding during periods and feelings of heaviness, in the lower abdomen or pelvic region.''Doctors will prefer myomectomy to ''hysterectomy'' (surgical removal of the uterus) if''There are conservative (nonsurgical) options, such as GnRH agonist therapy and artery embolization therapy, that may help in the shrinking ''fibroid''. If these options fail to reduce the size of the fibroid, myomectomy can be done to remove the fibroid.' You want to have children in the future You have a large fibroid or multiple fibroids that are affecting your chances of bearing a child You want to preserve your uterus"
What are the different types of myomectomy?,"'There are three main types of myomectomy. As per their experience, type of fibroid, and the patient’s preference, surgeons can perform myomectomy with any of the following approaches:' Open myomectomy: This type of surgery is also known as laparotomy. In this surgery, the surgeon makes a single, large incision of about 6-12 inch over your lower abdomen to remove the fibroid from the uterus. Laparoscopic myomectomy: This type of surgery involves making a few (3-4) tiny incisions over the abdomen at first. Next, the surgeon inserts a long tube-like camera, known as a laparoscope, to visualize the uterus. The surgeon uses the remaining incisions to insert the surgical instruments to cut and remove the fibroids from the uterus. Hysteroscopic myomectomy: In contrast to the two approaches mentioned above, this type of myomectomy requires no incisions and makes use of the vaginal route to remove the fibroid from the uterus. A long tube-like camera known as a ‘hysteroscope’ is inserted through the vagina that goes through the cervix to reach the uterus. Instruments are inserted through the hysteroscope to remove the fibroid."
What is done before the myomectomy procedure?,"'Your doctor will see if you have a condition known as ''anemia'', which is low ''hemoglobin'' (Hb) level or red blood cell count. Treatment of ''anemia'' is crucial to avoid excessive bleeding after myomectomy. Here is what the doctor can recommend to you:''You will usually get admitted a night before the surgery and will be asked to not eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before the surgery (in case of abdominal myomectomy). Your doctor will instruct you when you should stop eating or drinking. Hysteroscopic myomectomy can generally be performed as an outpatient procedure. Your doctor will tell you when to get admitted.''Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding medicines that need to be stopped before the surgery.' Iron and multivitamin tablets GnRH therapy (a hormonal therapy that will stop your menstrual periods till your surgery)"
What is done after the myomectomy?,"'You are shifted to the surgical ward or the intensive care unit and observed for a few to several hours after the surgery.''If you have been given general anesthesia, you may feel sleepy or drowsy for a few to several hours, and so, you would not be allowed to ambulate for that period.''You will be allowed to eat only after you have your first bowel movement after the surgery.''Your hospital stay can last for 1-4 days depending on the type of surgery you had; it is shorter in case of a laparoscopic myomectomy and hysteroscopic myomectomy.' "
What are the complications of myomectomy?,"'Myomectomy carries a low chance of developing complications. Possible risks include:' Internal bleeding or vaginal bleeding: There is a rare chance of bleeding during the operation for which a blood transfusion is sometimes needed. Infection of the surgical site: A short course of antibiotics will help fight off the infection. Damage to the surrounding organs: Surgeons are generally successful in fixing this during the surgery. Scar formation: Bands of scar tissue (adhesions) can develop after the surgery. Anesthetic risks: You may suffer from side-effects of anesthesia, which can be dealt with in the operative room. Hysterectomy: This is rare but may happen in cases when the size of the fibroid encompasses the whole of the uterus and removal of the entire uterus cannot be avoided. Chances of cesarean delivery: If you become pregnant after a myomectomy that was done for deeply embedded fibroids, chances are that doctors will recommend a cesarean delivery."
Tips to Reduce and Manage Job and Workplace Stress,"'While some workplace ''stress'' is normal, excessive ''stress'"" can interfere with your productivity and impact your physical and emotional health. And your ability to deal with it can mean the difference between success or failure. You can't control everything in your work environment, but that doesn't mean you're powerless - even when you're stuck in a difficult situation. Finding ways to manage workplace stress isn't about making huge changes or rethinking career ambitions, but rather about focusing on the one thing that's always within your control: you. "" "
Coping with work stress in today's uncertain climate,"'For workers everywhere, the troubled economy may feel like an emotional roller coaster. ""Layoffs"" and ""budget ''cuts''"" have become buzz words in the workplace, and the result is increased fear, uncertainty, and higher levels of stress. Since job and workplace stress increase in times of economic crisis, it\'s important to learn new and better ways of coping with the pressure.''Your emotions are ''contagious'"", and stress has an impact on the quality of your interactions with others. The better you are at managing your own stress, the more you'll positively affect those around you, and the less other people's stress will negatively affect you.You can learn how to manage job stress""'There are a variety of steps you can take to reduce both your overall stress levels and the stress you find on the job and in the workplace. These include:'  Taking responsibility for improving your physical and emotional well-being. Avoiding pitfalls by identifying knee jerk habits and negative attitudes that add to the stress you experience at work. Learning better communication skills to ease and improve your relationships with management and coworkers.

Tip 1: Recognize warning signs of excessive stress at work,"'When you feel overwhelmed at work, you lose confidence and may become irritable or withdrawn. This can make you less productive and less effective in your job, and make the work seem less rewarding. If you ignore the warning signs of work stress, they can lead to bigger problems. Beyond interfering with job performance and satisfaction, chronic or intense stress can also lead to physical and emotional health problems.''Signs and symptoms of excessive job and workplace stress'  Feeling anxious, irritable, or depressed Apathy, loss of interest in work Problems sleeping Fatigue Trouble concentrating Muscle tension or headaches Stomach problems Social withdrawal Loss of sex drive Using alcohol or drugs to cope

"
Tip 2: Reduce job stress by taking care of yourself,"""When stress at work interferes with your ability to perform in your job, manage your personal life, or adversely impacts your health, it's time to take action. Start by paying attention to your physical and emotional health. When your own needs are taken care of, you're stronger and more resilient to stress. The better you feel, the better equipped you'll be to manage work stress without becoming overwhelmed.""""Taking care of yourself doesn't require a total lifestyle overhaul. Even small things can lift your mood, increase your energy, and make you feel like you're back in the driver's seat. Take things one step at a time, and as you make more positive lifestyle choices, you'll soon notice a reduction in your stress levels, both at home and at work.""'Regular ''exercise'' is a powerful stress reliever - even though it may be the last thing you feel like doing. ''Aerobic exercise'' - activity that raises your ''heart'"" rate and makes you sweat - is a hugely effective way to lift your mood, increase energy, sharpen focus, and relax both the mind and body. For maximum stress relief, try to get at least 30 minutes of heart-pounding activity on most days. If it's easier to fit into your schedule, break up the activity into two or three shorter segments.""'Low blood sugar'' can make you feel anxious and irritable, while eating too much can make you lethargic. Healthy eating can help you get through stressful work days. By eating small but frequent meals, you can help your body maintain an even level of blood ''sugar'', keep your energy up, stay focused, and avoid ''mood swings''.''Alcohol temporarily reduces ''anxiety'' and worry, but too much can cause ''anxiety'' as it wears off. Drinking to relieve job stress may also eventually lead to ''alcohol abuse'' and dependence. Similarly, ''smoking'"" when you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed may seem calming, but ""'nicotine'' is a powerful stimulant – leading to higher, not lower, levels of ''anxiety''.''Not only can stress and worry can cause ''insomnia'', but a lack of ''sleep'"" can leave you vulnerable to even more stress. When you're well-rested, it's much easier to keep your emotional balance, a key factor in coping with job and workplace stress. Try to improve the quality of your ""'sleep'' by keeping a sleep schedule and aiming for 8 hours a night.' "
Tip 3: Reduce job stress by prioritizing and organizing,"'When job and workplace stress threatens to overwhelm you, there are simple steps you can take to regain control over yourself and the situation. Your newfound ability to maintain a sense of self-control in stressful situations will often be well-received by coworkers, managers, and subordinates alike, which can lead to better relationships at work. Here are some suggestions for reducing job stress by prioritizing and organizing your responsibilities.' Create a balanced schedule. Analyze your schedule, responsibilities, and daily tasks. All work and no play is a recipe for burnout. Try to find a balance between work and family life, social activities and solitary pursuits, daily responsibilities and downtime. Don't over-commit yourself. Avoid scheduling things back-to-back or trying to fit too much into one day. All too often, we underestimate how long things will take. If you've got too much on your plate, distinguish between the ""shoulds"" and the ""musts."" Drop tasks that aren't truly necessary to the bottom of the list or eliminate them entirely. Try to leave earlier in the morning. Even 10-15 minutes can make the difference between frantically rushing to your desk and having time to ease into your day. Don't add to your stress levels by running late. Plan regular breaks. Make sure to take short breaks throughout the day to take a walk or sit back and clear your mind. Also try to get away from your desk or work station for lunch. Stepping away from work to briefly relax and recharge will help you be more, not less, productive. Prioritize tasks. Make a list of tasks you have to do, and tackle them in order of importance. Do the high-priority items first. If you have something particularly unpleasant to do, get it over with early. The rest of your day will be more pleasant as a result. Break projects into small steps. If a large project seems overwhelming, make a step-by-step plan. Focus on one manageable step at a time, rather than taking on everything at once. Delegate responsibility. You don't have to do it all yourself. If other people can take care of the task, why not let them? Let go of the desire to control or oversee every little step. You'll be letting go of unnecessary stress in the process. Be willing to compromise. When you ask someone to contribute differently to a task, revise a deadline, or change their behavior at work, be willing to do the same. Sometimes, if you can both bend a little, you'll be able to find a happy middle ground that reduces the stress levels for everyone concerned.

Tip 4: Reduce job stress by improving emotional intelligence,"""Even if you're in a job where the environment has grown increasingly stressful, you can retain a large measure of self-control and self-confidence by understanding and practicing emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to manage and use your emotions in positive and constructive ways. When it comes to satisfaction and success at work, emotional intelligence matters just as much as intellectual ability. Emotional intelligence is about communicating with others in ways that draw people to you, overcome differences, repair wounded feelings, and defuse tension and stress.""'Emotional intelligence in the workplace has four major components:''There are five key skills that you need to master in order to raise your emotional intelligence and manage stress at work.' Self-awareness – The ability to recognize your emotions and their impact while using gut feelings to guide your decisions. Self-management – The ability to control your emotions and behavior and adapt to changing circumstances. Social awareness – The ability to sense, understand, and react to other's emotions and feel comfortable socially. Relationship management – The ability to inspire, influence, and connect to others and manage conflict. Realize when you're stressed, recognize your particular stress response, and become familiar with sensual cues that can rapidly calm and energize you. The best way to reduce stress quickly is through the senses: through sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. But each person responds differently to sensory input, so you need to find things that are soothing to you. Stay connected to your internal emotional experience so you can appropriately manage your own emotions. Your moment-to-moment emotions influence your thoughts and actions, so pay attention to your feelings and factor them into your decision making at work. If you ignore your emotions you won't be able to fully understand your own motivations and needs, or to communicate effectively with others. Recognize and effectively use nonverbal cues and body language. In many cases, what we say is less important than how we say it or the other nonverbal signals we send out, such as eye contact, facial expression, tone of voice, posture, gesture and touch. Your nonverbal messages can either produce a sense of interest, trust, and desire for connection 
	- or they can generate confusion, distrust, and stress. You also need to be able to accurately read and respond to the nonverbal cues that other people send you at work. Develop the capacity to meet challenges with humor. There is no better stress buster than a hearty laugh and nothing reduces stress quicker in the workplace than mutually shared humor. But, if the laugh is at someone else's expense, you may end up with more rather than less stress. Resolve conflict positively. Resolving conflict in healthy, constructive ways can strengthen trust between people and relieve workplace stress and tension. When handling emotionally-charged situations, stay focused in the present by disregarding old hurts and resentments, connect with your emotions, and hear both the words and the nonverbal cues being used. If a conflict can't be resolved, choose to end the argument, even if you still disagree.
	"
Tip 5: Reduce job stress by breaking bad habits,"""As you learn to manage your job stress and improve your work relationships, you'll have more control over your ability to think clearly and act appropriately. You will be able to break habits that add to your stress at work – and you'll even be able to change negative ways of thinking about things that only add to your stress.""""Many of us make job stress worse with negative thoughts and behavior. If you can turn around these self-defeating habits, you'll find employer-imposed stress easier to handle.""  Resist perfectionism. No project, situation, or decision is ever perfect, so trying to attain perfection on everything will simply add unnecessary stress to your day. When you set unrealistic goals for yourself or try to do too much, you're setting yourself up to fall short. Aim to do your best, no one can ask for more than that. Clean up your act. If you're always running late, set your clocks and watches fast and give yourself extra time. If your desk is a mess, file and throw away the clutter; just knowing where everything is saves time and cuts stress. Make to-do lists and cross off items as you accomplish them. Plan your day and stick to the schedule - you'll feel less overwhelmed. Flip your negative thinking. If you see the downside of every situation and interaction, you'll find yourself drained of energy and motivation. Try to think positively about your work, avoid negative-thinking co-workers, and pat yourself on the back about small accomplishments, even if no one else does. Don't try to control the uncontrollable. Many things at work are beyond our control - particularly the behavior of other people. Rather than stressing out over them, focus on the things you can control such as the way you choose to react to problems. Take time away. When stress is mounting at work, try to take a quick break and move away from the stressful situation. Take a stroll outside the workplace if possible, or spend a few minutes meditating in the break room. Physical movement or finding a quiet place to regain your balance can quickly reduce stress. Talk it over with someone. In some situations, simply sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust can help reduce stress. Talking over a problem with someone who is both supportive and empathetic can be a great way to let off steam and relieve stress. Connect with others at work. Developing friendships with some of your co-workers can help buffer you from the negative effects of stress. Remember to listen to them and offer support when they are in need as well. Look for humor in the situation. When used appropriately, humor is a great way to relieve stress in the workplace. When you or those around you start taking things too seriously, find a way to lighten the mood by sharing a joke or funny story.

Tip 6: Learn how managers or employers can reduce job stress,"""It's in a manager's best interest to keep stress levels in the workplace to a minimum. Managers can act as positive role models, especially in times of high stress, by following the tips outlined in this article. If a respected manager can remain calm in stressful work situations, it is much easier for his or her employees to also remain calm.""'Additionally, there are a number of organizational changes that managers and employers can make to reduce workplace stress. These include:'  Share information with employees to reduce uncertainty about their jobs and futures. Clearly define employees' roles and responsibilities. Make communication friendly and efficient, not mean-spirited or petty. Give workers opportunities to participate in decisions that affect their jobs. Consult employees about scheduling and work rules. Be sure the workload is suitable to employees' abilities and resources; avoid unrealistic deadlines.
    Show that individual workers are valued. Offer rewards and incentives. Praise good work performance, both verbally and officially, through schemes such as Employee of the Month.
    Provide opportunities for career development. Promote an ""entrepreneurial"" work climate that gives employees more control over their work. Provide opportunities for social interaction among employees. Establish a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. Make management actions consistent with organizational values.

Menstruation and Menopause,"'The ''menstrual cycle'"" is the process by which a woman's body gets ready for the chance of a ""'pregnancy'' each month. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days from the start of one to the start of the next, but it can range from 21 days to 35 days.''Most menstrual periods last from three to five days. In the United States, most girls start menstruating at age 12, but girls can start menstruating between the ages of 8 and 16. ''Menopause'' is the absence of menstrual periods for 12 months. The menopausal transition begins with varying menstrual cycle lengths and ends with the final ''menstruation''.' "
Pregnancy and preconception care,"'Pregnancy is the term used to describe when a woman has a growing fetus inside of her. In most cases, the fetus grows in the uterus.''Human pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, or just more than 9 months, from the start of the ''last menstrual period'' to ''childbirth''.''Prenatal care'' is the care woman gets during a pregnancy. Getting early and regular ''prenatal'' care is important for the health of both mother and the developing baby.''In addition, health care providers are now recommending a woman see a health care provider for preconception care, even before she considers ''becoming pregnant'' or in between ''pregnancies''.''Both preconception care and prenatal care help to promote the best health outcomes for mother and baby.' "
Fertility and Infertility,"'Infertility'' is the term health care providers use for women who are unable to get ''pregnant'', and for men who are unable to impregnate a woman, after at least one year of trying.'""In women, the term is used to describe those who are of normal childbearing age, not those who can't get pregnant because they are near or past ""'menopause''. Women who are able to get pregnant but who cannot carry a pregnancy to term (birth) may also be considered ''infertile''.''Infertility'' is a complex problem – it does not have a single cause because ''getting pregnant'' is a multi-step chain of events. The cause of infertility can rest in the women or the man, or can be from unknown factors or a combination of factors.' "
Contraception,"'Contraception'', also known as ''birth control'', is designed to prevent pregnancy. Some types of ''birth control'' include (but are not limited to):'""The choice of birth control depends on factors such as a person's overall health, age, frequency of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, desire to have children in the future, and family history of certain diseases. A woman should talk to her health care provider about her choice of birth control method."" Barrier methods, such as condoms, the 
	diaphragm, and 
the cervical cap, are designed to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg for 
	fertilization. Intrauterine device, or IUD, is a small device that is inserted into the 
uterus by a health care provider. The IUD prevents a fertilized egg from 
implanting in the uterus. An IUD can stay in the uterus for up to 10 years until 
it is removed by a health care provider. Hormonal birth control, such as
	birth control pills, injections, skin 
patches, and vaginal rings, release hormones into a woman's body that interfere 
with fertility by preventing 
	ovulation, fertilization, or 
	implantation. Sterilization is a method that permanently prevents a woman from getting 
pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. Sterilization 
involves surgical procedures that must be done by a health care provider and 
usually cannot be reversed."

"
What is the most common cause of sex problems among men and women?,"'While they can take many forms, sexual problems are defined as any physical or emotional issue that prevents a couple from achieving a mutually satisfying intimate relationship. Among the most common for men include prostate problems, a decrease in the blood supply to the penis due to ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', or other health concerns, nerve damage to the spinal cord, or a decrease in the hormone testosterone. ''Common sexual problems in women common problems include a lack of desire caused by a decrease in the hormone estrogen, ''thyroid disorders'' (which can also affect some men), and ''pain'' during intercourse caused by any number of vaginal problems, including a lack of lubrication. ''Some couples also find that the use of certain ''drugs'' can also cause sexual problems. These include ''alcohol'', ''nicotine'', narcotics, ''stimulants'', some ''blood pressure'' drugs, ''antihistamines'', and certain ''antidepressant'' medications.' "
What is the most common sexual problem in men?,"'Studies show it is ''premature ejaculation'', which can affect up to 75% of men. Clinically it is defined as the release of the ejaculate from the penis either before intercourse can take place, or quickly after it starts, usually within less than 15 ""thrusts."" While every man will experience premature ejaculation at least once in their life, for some the problem is chronic. When this is the case causes can be linked to a highly sensitive and easily stimulated nervous system, ''obsessive compulsive disorder'"", or sometimes a lack of control over the body's response to excitement. A frequently overlooked cause of temporary premature ejaculation is an infection in the ""'prostate gland'' known as ''prostatitis''. When this is the case, a course of antibiotics often solves the problem. Temporary problems can also result from ''stress'', or from the use of certain medications including some ''cold'' pills.''Treatments for chronic premature ejaculation include the antidepressant medication ''Anafranil'' taken 12 hours before sex, and use of a ''condom'' to help reduce sensation. Sometimes a prescription ''lidocaine'' cream can also help by reducing sensation, but that can also impact the partner.' "
What is the true definition of erectile dysfunction -- and what are the most common causes?,"'Erectile dysfunction'' (''ED''), also known as ''impotence'', has a far broader definition than many couples realize. It includes, of course, not being able to obtain an erection, but also the inability to sustain an erection sufficient for intercourse, as well as the inability to ejaculate on a consistent basis. ''While once believed to be largely an emotional problem, today doctors know ''ED'' is often the result of other health concerns including ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', ''kidney failure'', early ''heart disease'', prostate problems, and ''depression''. Additionally, ''alcohol abuse'' is a major contributing factor, and in some men, ''cigarette smoking''. Chronic ''stress'' can also play a role. In some men certain drugs can result in ''erectile dysfunction'', most notably some ''high blood pressure'' medications and some treatments for ''depression''.' "
What causes sexual dysfunction in women?,"'Unlike men who require physiological events to have intercourse, women have no such restrictions. As such, the most common reasons for sexual dysfunction are often based in matters of desire, sexual arousal, or sometimes ''painful intercourse''. Some women also report an inability to have an ''orgasm'' or experience ''pain'' when achieving one.''While a decrease in desire can be caused by many things, including a negative relationship with a partner, or other life stresses, physical causes are often traced to a decrease in the hormones estrogen and testosterone that occur during ''menopause''. Not only can this put a damper on desire, it can also cause a decrease in vaginal lubrication making it more difficult to become aroused and causing intercourse to be painful. In addition, certain illnesses, most notably a thyroid disorder or ''depression'"", can also impact a woman's desire. The inability to achieve orgasm is seldom caused by a physical problem, but more often the result of inadequate stimulation by a woman's partner."" "
What causes pain in the penis?,"'Like in any other part of the body, pain in the penis can be the result of many things, including infection, ''trauma'', or disease. Excessive manipulation can sometimes lead to pain, as can simple things such as ''insect bites'' or ''pimples''. At the same time, painful lesions or sores on the penis may be ''genital herpes'' or another infection. Additionally, ''prostate inflammation'', ''urethritis'' (an infection of the urinary tube frequently caused by ''gonorrhea'' or''chlamydia''), and sometimes ''sickle cell anemia'"" can also cause penis pain. A condition known as Peyronie's disease results in an abnormal bend in the penis that makes intercourse painful for a man. In rare instances, pain can be a sign of ""'penile cancer'', so always check with your doctor if discomfort is significant and does not subside within a few days.' "
Why do some women have painful intercourse?,"'Medically known as dyspareunia, in up to 80% of women the cause is physiological. This can be the result of a decrease in female hormones leading to ''vaginal dryness'', the presence of yeast or other sexually transmitted infections, ''cystitis'' orurethritis (infections of the urinary tract), or certain orthopaedic problems. In some instances, even chronic ''constipation'' may play a role. A condition known as vulvar vestibulitis, an inflammation in a particular area of the vagina, is the most commonly overlooked cause of dyspareunia.''A specific type of dyspareunia known as vaginismus causes involuntary spasms of the muscles within the vagina. In some instances, they can be so strong, the vagina seals shut making penetration extremely painful or sometimes, impossible. It often has roots in psychological trauma.' "
"What is retrograde ejaculation, and how is it treated?","""A form of male sexual dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation means the ejaculate fluid that normally leaves the penis during orgasm takes a wrong biological turn and ends up depositing in the bladder. Here it mixes with urine and eventually leaves the body as a waste product. The problem isn't harmful unless the couple is ""'trying to conceive''. Retrograde ejaculation can occur either partially or completely. In either instance the cause is frequently linked to prior prostate or urethral surgery, ''diabetes'', and the use of certain drugs including ''medications for high blood pressure''. Controlling blood ''sugar'' can help improve the problem, as can some epinephrine-like drugs. Sometimes switching blood pressure medications also works.' "
Is having an erection for an extended period of time dangerous?,"'A lot depends on your definition of ""extended."" The condition itself is known as ''priapism'"" and it's defined, in clinical terms, as an erection that lasts four hours or more without sexual stimulation. Normally, stimulation causes blood to flow into the penis, which in turn results in an erection. After ejaculation -- or if stimulation is discontinued -- the blood drains and the erection recedes. When priapism occurs, blood that is sent to fill the penis becomes trapped, causing the erection to remain without relief. Not only can this be extremely painful, if not treated early on it can result in scarring inside the penis, and sometimes, permanent ""'erectile dysfunction''. Priapism can occur in any male, even newborns, but most commonly develops between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and 20 and 50 years old. Treatment can be as simple as applying ice packs, or may involve injecting the penis with medications, or removing blood from the penis to reduce pain and swelling. Occasionally surgery is necessary to restore proper blood flow and drainage.' "
Which medications commonly cause sex problems for men or women?,"'The most well-known medications are antidepressant drugs such as ''Prozac'', or tranquilizers, such as ''Valium'', both of which can impact sex drive in both men and women. For women, certain ''birth control pills'' can put a damper on desire, as can some formulations of ''HRT'' used to treat ''menopause symptoms''. Drugs known to increase the risk of impotency in men include certain ''high blood pressure'' drugs, antihistamines used for colds or ''allergies'', somenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') (like ''ibuprofen''), ''heartburn'' drugs such as ''Tagamet'', ''Zantac'', and''Pepcid'', some ''lipid''-lowering drugs for ''cholesterol'', and certain medications used to treat '""Parkinson's""' disease or ''cancer''.' "
Is it true that sex can actually give some people a headache?,"""Yes, it's true. Medically, the condition is known as coital cephalalgia, and surprisingly, it affects men more often than women -- surprising because in general women get more ""'headaches'"" than men. While no one is certain what's behind the problem, some say it may be related to the sudden change in blood flow and subsequent drop in blood pressure following orgasm. Others contend it may be the result of a release of adrenaline that floods the body during periods of intense sexual activity. While some folks can have sex ""'headaches'' for several weeks followed by permanent remission, for others the problem may come and go indefinitely, or sometimes be present with every sexual encounter. Although you might not suffer from ''migraine'' ''headaches'', sex ''headaches'"" are thought to be chemically related and frequently respond to similar treatments. One word of caution: Don't assume that a ""'headache'' you experience after sex is a sex ''headache'"". Experts say sometimes benign lesions in the brain or aneurysms (a blood vessel disorder) can also cause headaches after sex. To rule out such problems, don't diagnose yourself -- see your doctor.""'WebMD Medical Reference' "

Healthy eating (diet and nutrition),"'All humans have to eat food for growth and maintenance of a healthy body, but we humans have different ''nutrition'' requirements as infants, children (kids), teenagers, young adults, adults, and seniors. For example, infants may require feeding every 4 hours until they gradually age and begin to take in more solid foods. Eventually they develop into the more normal pattern of eating three times per day as young kids. However, as most parents know, kids, teenagers, and young adults often snack between meals. Snacking is often not limited to these age groups because adults and seniors often do the same.''Tips:''Tips for special situations:'   Eat three healthy meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner); it is important to remember that dinner does not have to be the largest meal. The bulk of food consumption should consist of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products. Incorporate lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts (with emphasis on beans and nuts) into a healthy diet. Choose foods that are low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars; look at the labels because the first listed items on the labels comprise the highest concentrations of ingredients. Control portion sizes; eat the smallest portion that can satisfy hunger and then stop eating. Healthy snacks are OK in moderation and should consist of items like fruit, whole grains, or nuts to satisfy hunger and not cause excessive weight gain. Avoid sodas and sugar-enhanced drinks because of the excessive calories in the sodas and sugar drinks; diet drinks may not be a good choice as they make some people hungrier and increase food consumption. Avoid eating a large meal before sleeping to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and weight gain. If a person is angry or depressed, eating will not solve these situations and may make the underlying problems worse. Avoid rewarding children with sugary snacks; such a pattern may become a lifelong habit for people. Avoid heavy meals in the summer months, especially during hot days. A vegetarian lifestyle has been promoted for a healthy lifestyle and weight loss; vegetarians should check with their physicians to be sure they are getting enough vitamins, minerals, and iron in their diet. Cooking foods (above 165 F) destroys most harmful bacteria and other pathogens; if you choose to eat uncooked foods like fruits or vegetables, they should be thoroughly washed with running treated (safe to drink) tap water right before eating. Avoid eating raw or undercooked meats of any type. People with diabetes should use the above tips and monitor their glucose levels as directed; try to keep the daily blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. People with unusual work schedules (night shifts, college students, military) should try to adhere to a breakfast, lunch, and dinner routine with minimal snacking. People who prepare food should avoid using grease or frying foods in grease. People trying to lose weight (body fat) should avoid all fatty and sugary foods and eat mainly vegetables, fruits, and nuts and markedly reduce his/her intake of meat and dairy products. Seek medical advice early if you cannot control your weight, food intake, or if you have diabetes and cannot control your blood glucose levels."
Physical activity and exercise,"'Physical activity and ''exercise'' is a major contributor to a healthy lifestyle; people are made to use their bodies, and disuse leads to unhealthy living. Unhealthy living may manifest itself in ''obesity'', ''weakness'', lack of endurance, and overall poor health that may foster disease development.''Tips:''Most individuals can begin moderate exercise, such as walking, without a medical examination. The following people, however, should consult a doctor before beginning more vigorous exercise:''Consequences of physical inactivity and lack of exercise:''Healthy living involves more than physical health, it also includes emotional or mental health. The following are some ways people can support their mental health and well-being.''Tips:''Avoidance behavior is another key to wellness. Below are described some of the major items to avoid if a person is seeking a healthy lifestyle.'  Regular exercise can prevent and reverse age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength, improve balance, flexibility, and endurance, and decrease the risk of falls in the elderly. Regular exercise can help prevent coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Regular, weight-bearing exercise can also help prevent osteoporosis by building bone strength. Regular fitness can help chronic arthritis sufferers improve their capacity to perform daily activities such as driving, climbing stairs, and opening jars. Regular exercise can help increase self-esteem and self-confidence, decrease stress and anxiety, enhance mood, and improve general mental health. Regular exercise can help control body weight and in some people cause loss of fat. Thirty minutes of modest exercise (walking is OK) at least 3 to 5 days a week is recommended, but the greatest health benefits come from exercising most days of the week. Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions. Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury or excessive soreness or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance with exercise. Almost any type of exercise (resistance, water aerobics, walking, swimming, weights, yoga, and many others) is helpful for everybody. Children need exercise; play outside of the home is a good beginning. Sports for children may provide excellent opportunities for exercise, but care must be taken not to overdo certain exercises (for example, throwing too many pitches in baseball may harm a joint like the elbow or shoulder). Exertion during strenuous exercise may make a person tired and sore, but if pain occurs, stop the exercise until the pain source is discovered; the person may need to seek medical help and advice about continuation of such exercise. Men over age 40 or women over age 50 Individuals with heart or lung disease, asthma, arthritis, or osteoporosis Individuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion, or who develop fatigue or shortness of breath easily Individuals with conditions that increase their risks of developing coronary heart disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol, or having family members who had early onset heart attacks and coronary heart disease Individuals who are morbidly obese Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with heart disease and some cancers. Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with type II diabetes mellitus (also known as maturity or adult-onset, non-insulin-dependent diabetes). Physical inactivity and lack of exercise contribute to weight gain. Get enough sleep daily; the CDC recommends the following by age group (naps inclusive); 12-18 hours from birth to 2 months, 14-15 hours from 3-11 months of age, 12-18 hours for 1-3 years of age, 11-13 hours for 3-5 years of age, 10-11 hours for 5-10 years of age, 8.5-9.5 hours for 10-17 years of age and those 18 and above need 7-9 hours of sleep. Elderly people need about 7-9 hours but do not sleep as deeply and may awaken at night or wake early, so naps (like kids need) allow them to accumulate the total of 7-9 hours of sleep. Take a walk and reflect on what you see and hear at least several times per week. Try something new and often (eat a new food, try a different route to work, go to a new museum display). Do some mind exercises (read, do a puzzle occasionally during the week). Try to focus on a process intensely and complete a segment of it over 1 to several hours, then take a break and do something relaxing (walk, exercise, short nap). Plan to spend some time talking with other people about different subjects. Try to make some leisure time to do some things that interest you every week (hobby, sport). Learn ways to say ""no"" when something occurs that you do not want to do or be involved with. Have fun (go on a trip with someone you love, go shopping, go fishing; do not let vacation time slip away). Let yourself be pleased with your achievements, both big and small (develop contentment). Have a network of friends; those with strong social support systems lead healthier lives. Seek help and advice early if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts, or consider harming yourself or others. People taking medicine for mental health problems should not stop taking these medications, no matter how ""well"" they feel, until they have discussed their situation with their prescribing doctor(s)."
Avoid tobacco use,"'Tobacco use is the most important preventable illness and cause of death in the U.S., according to the National ''Cancer'' Institute (NCI). Tobacco use was estimated to be the cause of 443,000 deaths in 2010 in the U.S.''Tip:' Stop smoking tobacco; start to stop today (it takes about 15 years of nonsmoking behavior to achieve a ""normal"" risk level for heart disease for those that smoke). Stop using chewing tobacco to avoid oral cancers. Tobacco use causes or contributes to a large number of cancers in the U.S. In men, 90% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to smoking; 80% in women. Tobacco use causes cancers of the lung, mouth, lip, tongue, esophagus, kidney, and bladder. It also further increases the risk of bladder cancer in subjects occupationally exposed to certain organic chemicals found in the textile, leather, rubber, dye, paint, and other organic chemical industries, and further increases the risk of lung cancer among subjects exposed to asbestos. Tobacco use causes atherosclerotic arterial disease (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) that can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and lack of blood flow to the lower extremities. Tobacco use causes an estimated 20%-30% of coronary heart disease in the U.S. It also further increases the risk of heart attacks among subjects with elevated cholesterol, uncontrolled hypertension, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Tobacco use causes an estimated 20% of chronic lung diseases in the U.S., such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and causes pneumonia in those with chronic lung disease. The CDC, in 2011, estimated that 90% of deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) were due to smoking. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to deliver babies with low birth weight. Secondhand smoke can cause middle-ear infections (otitis media), coughing, wheezing, bronchitis, and pneumonia in babies, and aggravate asthma in children. Secondhand smoke (sometimes referred to as passive smoking) can also cause lung cancer. Quitting smoking is difficult to accomplish; tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive. Some smokers can quit ""cold turkey,"" but for most, quitting smoking requires a serious life-long commitment and an average of six quitting attempts before success. Quitting smoking efforts may include behavior modification, counseling, use of nicotine chewing gum (Nicorette Gum), nicotine skin patches (Transderm Nicotine), or oral medications such as bupropion (Zyban)."
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption,"'There are many treatments for ''alcoholism''. But the crucial first step to recovery is for the individual to admit there is a problem and make a commitment to address the alcoholism issue. The 12-step-style self-help programs, pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous, can be one effective treatment. Psychologists and related professionals have developed programs to help individuals better handle emotional stresses and avoid behaviors that can lead to excess drinking. Support and understanding from family members are often critical for sustained recovery. Medication can be useful for the ''prevention'' of relapses and for withdrawal symptoms following acute or prolonged intoxication.'   Chronic, excess alcohol consumption is the major cause of liver cirrhosis in the U.S. Liver cirrhosis can cause internal hemorrhage, fluid accumulation in the abdomen, easy bleeding and bruising, muscle wasting, mental confusion, infections, and in advanced cases, coma, and kidney failure. Liver cirrhosis can lead to liver cancer. Alcohol accounts for 40%-50% of deaths from automobile accidents in the U.S. Alcohol use is a significant cause of injury and death from home accidents, drowning, and burns."
Avoid high-risk sexual behaviors,"'High-risk sexual behavior can lead to the acquisition of sexually transmitted illnesses such as ''gonorrhea'', ''syphilis'', ''herpes'', or ''HIV'' infection. High-risk sexual behavior is also known to spread ''human papillomavirus'' infection, which can lead to ''cervical cancer'' in women and other anogenital cancers in both men and women. High-risk sexual behaviors include the following:' Multiple sex partners Sex partners with a history of the following:Intravenous drug useVenereal disease (sexually transmitted diseases or STDs) Intravenous drug use Venereal disease (sexually transmitted diseases or STDs) Transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, genital herpes) Transmission of hepatitis B (50% of hepatitis B infections are due to sexual transmission) and, in rare instances, hepatitis C Transmission of human papilloma virus (HPV), which can cause genital warts and anogenital carcinomas, most commonly cancer of the uterine cervix Unplanned pregnancy Avoid unprotected sex (sex without barriers such as a condom) outside an established, committed, monogamous relationship. If you plan to have sex and are unsure of your partner's health status, use a condom."
Avoid other high-risk behaviors,"'Sunscreens have undergone changes, and the U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) published new requirements that sunscreens needed to meet starting in 2012. Currently, the FDA suggests an effective sunscreen is rated as ''SPF'' 30 or higher and has both UVA and UVB protection (protection against ultraviolet waves of types A and B). In most instances, sunscreen needs to be applied every 2 hours and each time after a person has gone swimming.'  Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs Driving while sleep-deprived Reckless driving and speeding, ""road rage"" Driving while using cell phones, texting, or performing other tasks Motorcycle (and bicycle) riding without helmets Possession of firearms and guns without proper training and storage Smoking in bed Motor vehicle accidents account for 40%-50% of accidental deaths. Motorcycle accidents are a major cause of serious head injuries. Firearms and guns account for a significant proportion of deaths among adolescents due to male suicide and homicide. Smoking in bed can lead to burn injury and death. When driving, use seat restraints on all passengers, both front and rear seats. Do not drink and drive. Do not drive if sleep deprived. Avoid unnecessary distractions and focus on the road and traffic while driving (avoid texting, talking on cell phones, eating, applying makeup, or other distractions). Use helmets while riding bicycles and motorcycles. Helmet use reduces deaths from motorcycle accidents by 30% and serious head injuries by 75%. Obtain proper training in the use and storage of guns and ammunition. Use smoke detectors; avoid smoking in bed. Melanoma and other skin cancers Avoid sunburns and sun exposure by using adequate skin protection; use brimmed hats, protective clothing, and sunscreen."
Additional tips for healthy living,"'Although there are many other risky behaviors that may impede an otherwise healthy lifestyle (for example, working with toxic or radioactive materials, ''drug addiction'', travel to areas with unusual endemic diseases), these are too numerous to cover in this general article. However, the reader is advised to visit such topic sites on MedicineNet.com, eMedicineHealth.com or WebMD.com because most of the specific articles will provide tips to avoid health-related problems.'

What is a newborn infant hearing screening program?,"'Newborn'' infant ''hearing'' screening programs are designed to identify ''hearing loss'' in infants shortly after birth. All states have implemented these screening protocols within hospitals and birthing clinics. Most hearing screening tests are done prior to discharge from the hospital or birthing clinics.''Typically, nurses or medical assistants are trained extensively on how to operate automated equipment for testing infants. Prior to discharge, each newborn has his/her hearing tested. If, for some reason, the newborn does not pass the screen, a rescreen is usually done. If the infant does not pass the second hearing test, he/she is referred to a specialist for further testing.'""Specialists who are experts at testing hearing are called audiologists. Audiologists have had training that emphasizes diagnostic hearing testing techniques as well as hearing rehabilitation of children and adults. Their postgraduate academic training requires a minimum of a master's degree."" "
Why is it important to screen for hearing loss in all newborn infants?,"'Significant ''hearing loss'' is the most common disorder at birth.  Approximately 1%-2% of newborns are affected.''Several national committees, including the National Institutes of Health, the American Academy of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', have recommended that hearing loss in infants be identified, and when possible treated, prior to 6 months of age. This recommendation is based on studies that have shown that children identified with hearing loss prior to 6 months of age have a better chance of developing skills equivalent to their peers by the time they enter kindergarten. Children not identified until later (for example, it is very common to first identify hearing impaired children at age 2 to 3 years) may ultimately suffer from irreversible and permanent impairments in speech, language, and cognitive abilities when compared to their peers.''Prior to the implementation of hearing screen programs, it was customary to only test those newborns who had known significant risk factors for hearing loss. This group included infants whose mothers suffered from illness during ''pregnancy'', those who had a family history of hearing loss, or those who were exposed to ''drugs'' known to affect hearing. In addition, infants with the following conditions were included for hearing screening:''However, despite the testing of all infants who fell into this ""high-risk registry,"" over half of all newborns with hearing loss were missed!'""In order to identify this large group of hearing-impaired infants not identified with current testing protocols, it is now recommended that all newborns have a hearing test prior to discharge from the hospital. The goal of this program is to identify all hearing-impaired infants at an early age, thereby increasing these children's chance at healthy and more productive lives.""   low birth weight and/or prematurity, or oxygen deprivation or breathing difficulties at birth; high bilirubin levels (yellow color); syndromes associated with hearing loss; abnormal head or face structures; infections such as cytomegalovirus, syphilis, herpes, or toxoplasmosis; or low Apgar scores (which assess several health factors at one and again at five minutes after birth)."
How common is hearing loss in infants?,"'Most permanent hearing loss is due to damage/malfunction of the nerve that transmits sound from the inner ear to the brain (auditory nerve).  For those infants in whom a cause is determined, approximately half have a genetic condition and the remaining half have an acquired condition to explain their hearing loss.' "
What are some of the causes of hearing loss in the newborn?,"'Hearing loss in a newborn can be caused by a number of conditions. Some of the known risk factors include high bilirubin levels (''jaundice''), drugs that are toxic to the ears (for example, medicines that are given to the newborn to battle a serious infection may damage hearing as a side effect), prolonged mechanical ventilation, low Apgar scores, meningitis, prematurity, and/or low birth weight. Malformed structures in the middle or ''outer ear'' can also lead to hearing loss. Viral illness during the pregnancy, such as ''rubella'' (''German measles'') or ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), can be passed to the newborn and result in hearing loss. Hearing loss can sometimes be ''inherited'' in abnormal genes passed from the parents to the newborn or be the result of a gene mutation that occurred during ''fetal development''. ''Genetic counseling'' is often recommended for parents to determine if heredity is the cause of the hearing loss. In approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, the cause is never determined.' "
How is hearing in infants tested?,"""Hearing in infants can be tested using two different methods: the auditory brainstem response (ABR) evaluations or the otoacoustic emission (OAE) measures. Both tests are accurate, noninvasive, automated, and do not require any observable response from the infant. Which test is used depends on the screening program's choice of instrumentation and training. For a screening tool, both methods are extremely effective. There are, however, some distinct differences in how the hearing is measured using an ABR versus an OAE."" "
What is an ABR test?,"'In order to process sounds, electrical impulses are transmitted through nerves from our ears to the brainstem at the base of the brain. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a physiological measure of the brainstem\'s response to sound. It tests the integrity of the hearing system from the ear to the brainstem. The test is performed by placing four to five electrodes on the infant\'s head, after which a variety of sounds is presented to the infant through small earphones. As the hearing nerve fires, the sound stimulus travels up to the brain. This electrical activity generated by the nerve can be recorded by the electrodes and is represented as waveforms on a computer screen. The audiologist can then present different loudness levels of each sound and determine the softest levels at which the infant can hear. For infant-screening purposes, only one sound is used to test the hearing, commonly referred to as a ""click."" The click is a grouping of several sounds to test a wider area of the hearing organ at one time. The click is typically presented at a loud level and a soft one. If a healthy response is recorded, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen. Testing usually takes five to 15 minutes to complete.' "
What is an OAE evaluation?,"'An otoacoustic emission test (OAE) measures an acoustic response that is produced by the inner ear (cochlea), which in essence bounces back out of the ear in response to a sound stimulus. The test is performed by placing a small probe that contains a microphone and speaker into the infant\'s ear. As the infant rests quietly, sounds are generated in the probe. Once the cochlea processes the sound, an electrical stimulus is sent to the brainstem. In addition, there is a second and separate sound that does not travel up the nerve but comes back out into the infant\'s ear canal. This ""byproduct"" is the otoacoustic emission. The emission is then recorded with the microphone probe and represented pictorially on a computer screen. The audiologist can determine which sounds yielded a response/emission and the strength of those responses. If there is an emission present for those sounds that are critical to speech comprehension, then the infant has ""passed"" the hearing screen.  Testing generally takes about five to eight minutes.' "
"OAEs and ABRs, is one test better than the other?","""Both tests have advantages and disadvantages when used for screening, and depending on the program and experience of the audiologist, either one can be utilized successfully. The OAE is easy and cost-effective. However, the false-positive rate (for example, an infant fails a hearing test but actually has normal hearing) may be higher for an OAE than for an ABR. The false-positive rate for ABR testing is approximately 4% when testing is done during the first three days of life.  The false positive rate for OAE testing is 5%-21% for testing done during the first three days of life.  This large variation between ABR and OAE testing is commonly felt to reflect the OAE testing device's increased sensitivity to residual ""'amniotic fluid'"" and vernix that is commonly found in the neonate's ear canal.""'The two tests, however, rely on different mechanisms of hearing for the screening. For in-depth testing and a complete hearing evaluation of infants, these tests work best together as a complement to each other.' "
What does it mean when an infant does not pass the hearing screen?,"'A newborn who fails an initial hearing screen may not necessarily have a permanent hearing loss or a hearing loss at all. There are many possible reasons why an infant may fail a hearing screening test. One common reason is that fluid from the birth may still be present in the ear canal. This fluid blocks the sound stimulus, preventing it from reaching the inner ear, and therefore causes the newborn to fail. Similarly, fluid in the middle-ear space behind the eardrum (a common site for infection in children) can also block the sound stimulus and lead to a false failed test. After these problems resolve, the infant usually passes the rescreen. Therefore, it is important to have at least one week between the initial hearing screen and the rescreen to allow the newborn a chance to ""dry out.""''Another possible reason for a false failure is excessive noise or movement from the infant during the test. The responses that are recorded with an ABR or OAE are very, very small. Any movement or crying from the infant can prevent the equipment from detecting the response. Therefore, it is important that the newborn is quiet or sleeping for the hearing screen. Feeding the infant just prior to the screening is often very helpful. Although neither test is painful, they are novel experiences for the newborn and can be momentarily upsetting.''If it becomes evident that an infant has a hearing loss, then a full diagnostic exam is necessary to determine the type and amount of hearing loss.' "
What is the difference between a hearing screen and a diagnostic hearing test?,"'The basic difference between a diagnostic test and a hearing screen is the amount of information gathered during the session. For example, if an infant fails the hearing screen, it is unknown if there truly is a hearing loss, how much hearing loss is present, or whether or not the hearing loss is permanent or correctable. A diagnostic test can usually answer these questions. The diagnostic test session is understandably longer and requires more interaction with the infant. Typically, a more extensive ABR is conducted, using a variety of test stimuli. OAEs are also performed to cross-check the results of the ABR. To complete a thorough test, the infant needs to ''sleep'' in the office for upward of 45 minutes. The more information that can be collected, the more complete the results will be.' "
"If an infant does not pass a hearing screen in the hospital, what happens next?","'Most hospital screening programs will refer infants who failed the initial screening test to a secondary center that specializes in more complete testing for diagnosis. Sometimes, simple problems, such as too much  residual amniotic fluid and vernix in the ear canal, will resolve prior to the rescreen and the infant will pass the second test. The rescreen is an important step in determining whether the infant is able to hear, so it should not be taken lightly.''If an infant does not pass the rescreen, then a full diagnostic test will be necessary. This test may be completed at the rescreen site or at another facility, depending on several factors.' "
"If an infant has a hearing loss, what is the next step?","'The ability of an infant to compensate for the hearing loss will depend on both the type and the degree of hearing loss.''The type of hearing loss refers to where in the ear the hearing loss is located and what is causing it. There are two basic types of hearing loss, conductive and sensorineural. A conductive loss is caused by problems in the outer or middle ear. This is the type of loss that results when a child has a middle-''ear infection'', trapped fluid from birth, impacted wax in the outer ear or malformation of the ear and associated structures. It is usually correctable with medical treatment or surgery. Occasionally, a conductive loss cannot be corrected with surgery. However, these children typically do extremely well with hearing aids. A sensorineural loss is indicative of a problem in the inner ear or somewhere along the nerve to the ear (auditory nerve). This type of loss is typically permanent and cannot be corrected with surgery. A hearing aid or a cochlear implant may be utilized in this situation.''The degree of hearing loss refers to the severity of the hearing loss, which can range from mild to profound. Although the term ""mild"" sounds relatively benign, a mild hearing loss in a child who is trying to develop speech and language can have a huge impact on his/her success.'""If the hearing loss, whether it is conductive, sensorineural, or a combination of both, is determined to be uncorrectable by a physician, then the next step is to fit the infant with hearing aids. This is accomplished by a pediatric audiologist who can adjust the hearing aids according to the baby's hearing loss and monitor the infant's progress through regular visits. The infant should also be enrolled in an early childhood intervention program that is often provided through the school system.""""In addition to the early medical or surgical treatment of the hearing loss, parental involvement is essential. Parents need to monitor the child's progress and facilitate and encourage the use of the hearing aids and other therapeutic exercises that are designed to help the child become a careful listener and talker. Research has found that the one common denominator among successful hearing-impaired children is the parent's willingness to help the child throughout his/her lifetime.""'Summary & Recommendations (from the American Academy of Pediatrics Preventative Series Task Force -- July 2008)''Importance: Children with hearing loss have increased difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication skills, increased behavioral problems, decreased psychosocial well-being, and lower educational attainment compared with children with normal hearing.''Detection: Because half of the children with hearing loss have no identifiable risk factors, universal screening (instead of targeted screening) has been proposed to detect children with permanent congenital hearing loss.  There is good evidence that newborn hearing screening testing is highly accurate and leads to earlier identification and treatment of infants with hearing loss.''Benefits of detection and early treatment: Good quality evidence shows that early detection improves lingual outcomes.' "
What is a heart attack?,"'A heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction or MI) is the damage and death of heart muscle from the sudden blockage of a coronary artery by a blood clot. Coronary arteries are blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen. Blockage of a coronary artery deprives the heart muscle of blood and oxygen, causing injury to the heart muscle. Injury to the heart muscle causes chest ''pain'' and chest pressure sensation. If blood flow is not restored to the heart muscle within 20 to 40 minutes, irreversible death of the heart muscle will begin to occur. Muscle continues to die for six to eight hours at which time the heart attack usually is ""complete."" The dead heart muscle is eventually replaced by ''scar tissue''.' "
What causes a heart attack?,"'Atherosclerosis is a gradual process by which plaques (collections) of cholesterol are deposited in the walls of arteries. Cholesterol plaques cause the hardening of the arterial walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. Arteries that are narrowed by atherosclerosis cannot deliver enough blood to maintain the normal function of the parts of the body they supply. For example, atherosclerosis of the arteries in the legs causes reduced blood flow to the legs. Reduced blood flow to the legs can lead to ''pain'' in the legs while ''walking'' or exercising leg ulcers, or a delay in the healing of wounds to the legs. Atherosclerosis of the arteries that furnish blood to the brain can lead to ''vascular dementia'' (mental deterioration due to gradual death of brain tissue over many years) or ''stroke'' (sudden damage and death of brain tissue).''In many people, atherosclerosis can remain silent (causing no symptoms or health problems) for years or decades. Atherosclerosis can begin as early as the teenage years, but symptoms or health problems usually do not arise until later in adulthood when the arterial narrowing becomes severe. ''Smoking'' cigarettes, ''high blood pressure'', elevated cholesterol, and ''diabetes mellitus'' can accelerate atherosclerosis and lead to the earlier onset of symptoms and complications, particularly in those people who have a family history of early atherosclerosis.''Coronary atherosclerosis'' (or ''coronary artery disease'') refers to the atherosclerosis that causes hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries. Diseases caused by the reduced blood supply to the heart muscle from coronary atherosclerosis are called coronary heart diseases (CHD). Coronary heart diseases include heart attacks, sudden unexpected death, chest pain (''angina''), ''abnormal heart rhythms'', and heart failure due to weakening of the heart muscle.''Angina pectoris'' (also referred to as angina) is chest pain or pressure that occurs when the blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle cannot keep up with the needs of the muscle. When coronary arteries are narrowed by more than 50 to 70 percent, the arteries may not be able to increase the supply of blood to the heart muscle during ''exercise'' or other periods of high demand for oxygen. An insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle causes angina. Angina that occurs with exercise or exertion is called ''exertional angina.'' In some patients, especially in people with ''diabetes'', the progressive decrease in blood flow to the heart may occur without any pain or with just shortness of breath or unusually early ''fatigue''.''Exertional angina usually feels like a pressure, heaviness, squeezing, or aching across the chest. This pain may travel to the neck, jaw, arms, back, or even the ''teeth'', and may be accompanied by shortness of breath, ''nausea'', or a ''cold'' sweat. Exertional angina typically lasts from one to 15 minutes and usually is relieved by rest or by placing a tablet of ''nitroglycerin'"" under the tongue. Both resting and nitroglycerin decrease the heart muscle's demand for oxygen, thus relieving angina. Exertional angina may be the first warning sign of advanced ""'coronary artery disease''. Chest pains that just last a few seconds rarely are due to coronary artery disease.'""Angina also can occur at rest. Angina at rest more commonly indicates that a coronary artery has narrowed to such a critical degree that the heart is not receiving enough oxygen even at rest. Angina at rest infrequently may be due to the spasm of a coronary artery (a condition called Prinzmetal's or variant angina). Unlike a heart attack, there is no permanent muscle damage with either exertional or rest angina although the angina is a warning sign that there is an increased chance of a heart attack in the future.""'Occasionally the surface of a cholesterol plaque in a coronary artery may rupture, and a blood clot forms on the surface of the plaque. The clot blocks the flow of blood through the artery and results in a heart attack (see picture below). The cause of rupture that leads to the formation of a clot is largely unknown, but contributing factors may include ''cigarette smoking'' or other ''nicotine'' exposure, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, elevated levels of blood catecholamines (adrenaline), ''high blood pressure'', and other mechanical and biochemical stimuli.''Unlike exertional or rest angina, heart muscle dies during a heart attack and loss of the muscle is permanent, unless blood flow can be promptly restored, usually within one to six hours.''While heart attacks can occur at any time, more heart attacks occur between 4 A.M. and 10 A.M. because of the higher blood levels of adrenaline released from the adrenal glands during the morning hours. Increased adrenaline, as previously discussed, may contribute to the rupture of cholesterol plaques.''Only half of the patients who develop heart attacks have warning signs such as exertional angina or rest angina prior to their heart attacks, but these signs may be mild and ignored as unimportant.' "
What are the symptoms of a heart attack?,"'Although chest pain or pressure is the most common symptom of a heart attack, heart attack victims may experience a variety of conditions including:''Even though the symptoms of a heart attack at times can be vague and mild, it is important to remember that heart attacks producing no symptoms or only mild symptoms can be just as serious and life-threatening as heart attacks that cause severe chest pain. Too often patients attribute heart attack symptoms to ""''indigestion'',"" ""''fatigue'',"" or ""''stress'',"" and consequently delay seeking prompt medical attention. ''One cannot overemphasize the importance of seeking prompt medical attention in the presence of new symptoms that suggest a heart attack. Early diagnosis and treatment saves lives, and delays in reaching medical assistance can be fatal.'' A delay in treatment can lead to permanently reduced function of the heart due to more extensive damage to the heart muscle. Death also may occur as a result of the sudden onset of arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation.'

Silent heart attacks are especially common among patients with diabetes mellitus.)"
What are the complications of a heart attack?,"'When a large amount of heart muscle dies, the ability of the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body is diminished, and this can result in heart failure. The body retains fluid, and organs, for example, the kidneys, begin to fail.''Injury to heart muscle also can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the normal, regular, electrical activation of heart muscle contraction is replaced by chaotic electrical activity that causes the heart to stop beating and pumping blood to the brain and other parts of the body. Permanent ''brain damage'' and death can occur unless the flow of blood to the brain is restored within five minutes.''Most of the deaths from heart attacks are caused by ventricular fibrillation of the heart that occurs before the victim of the heart attack can reach an emergency room. Those who reach the emergency room have an excellent prognosis; survival from a heart attack with modern treatment should exceed 90%. The 1% to 10% of heart attack victims who later die frequently had suffered major damage to the heart muscle initially or additional damage at a later time.''Deaths from ventricular fibrillation can be avoided by ''cardiopulmonary resuscitation'' (CPR) started within five minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation. CPR requires ''breathing'' for the victim and applying external compression to the chest to squeeze the heart and force it to pump blood. In 2008, the American Heart Association modified the mouth-to-mouth instruction of CPR, and recommends that chest compressions alone are effective if a bystander is reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth. When paramedics arrive, medications and/or an electrical ''shock'' (''cardioversion'') can be administered to convert ventricular fibrillation back to a normal heart rhythm and allow the heart to pump blood normally. Therefore, prompt CPR and a rapid response by paramedics can improve the chances of survival from a heart attack. In addition, many public venues now have automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) that provide the electrical shock needed to restore a normal heart rhythm even before the paramedics arrive. This greatly improves the chances of survival.' "
What are the risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attack?,"'Factors that increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart attacks include increased blood cholesterol, ''high blood pressure'', use of tobacco, diabetes mellitus, male gender (although women may still be very much at risk -- see section at end of article), and a family history of coronary ''heart disease''. While family history and male gender are genetically determined, the other risk factors can be modified through changes in lifestyle and medications.''The cholesterol that is combined with low-density lipoproteins (''LDL cholesterol'') is the ""bad"" cholesterol that deposits cholesterol in arterial plaques. Thus, elevated levels of ''LDL cholesterol'' are associated with an increased risk of heart attack.''The cholesterol that is combined with HDL (''HDL cholesterol'') is the ""good"" cholesterol that removes cholesterol from arterial plaques. Thus, low levels of ''HDL cholesterol'' are associated with an increased risk of heart attacks.''Measures that lower LDL cholesterol and/or increase HDL cholesterol (losing excess weight, diets low in saturated ''fats'', regular exercise, and medications) have been shown to lower the risk of heart attack. One important class of medications for treating elevated cholesterol levels (the ''statins'') have actions in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol which also protect against heart attack. Most patients at ""high risk"" for a heart attack should be on a statin no matter what the levels of their cholesterol.' High Blood Cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia). A high level of cholesterol in the blood is associated with an increased heart attack risk because cholesterol is the major component of the plaques deposited in arterial walls. Cholesterol, like oil, cannot dissolve in the blood unless it is combined with special proteins called lipoproteins. (Without combining with lipoproteins, cholesterol in the blood would turn into a solid substance.) The cholesterol in blood is either combined with lipoproteins as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or high-density lipoproteins (HDL). High Blood Pressure (Hypertension). High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing atherosclerosis and heart attack. Both high systolic pressure (the blood pressure as the heart contracts) and high diastolic pressure (the blood pressure as the heart relaxes) increase the risk of heart attack. It has been shown that controlling hypertension with medications can reduce the risk of heart attack. Tobacco Use (Smoking). Tobacco and tobacco smoke contain chemicals that cause damage to blood vessel walls, accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, and increase the risk of heart attack. Diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus). Both insulin dependent and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2, respectively) are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis throughout the body. Therefore, patients with diabetes mellitus are at higher risk for reduced blood flow to the legs, coronary heart disease, erectile dysfunction, and strokes at an earlier age than nondiabetic subjects. Patients with diabetes can lower their risk through rigorous control of their blood sugar levels, regular exercise, weight control, and proper diets. Male Gender. Men are more likely to suffer heart attacks than women if they are less than 75 years old. Above age 75, women are as likely as men to have heart attacks. Family History of Heart Disease. Individuals with a family history of coronary heart diseases have an increased risk of heart attack. Specifically, the risk is higher if there is a family history of early coronary heart disease, including a heart attack or sudden death before age 55 in the father or other first-degree male relative, or before age 65 in the mother or other female first-degree female relative."
How to diagnose a heart attack,"'When there is severe chest pain, suspicion that a heart attack is occurring usually is high, and tests can be performed quickly that will confirm the heart attack. A problem arises, however, when the symptoms of a heart attack do not include chest pain. A heart attack may not be suspected, and the appropriate tests may not be performed. Therefore, the initial step in diagnosing a heart attack is to be suspicious that one has occurred so that the appropriate tests can be done.''Electrocardiogram''.'' An electrocardiogram (''ECG'"") is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart. Abnormalities in the electrical activity usually occur with heart attacks and can identify the areas of heart muscle that are deprived of oxygen and/or areas of muscle that have died. In a patient with typical symptoms of heart attack (such as crushing chest pain) and characteristic changes of heart attack on the ECG, a secure diagnosis of heart attack can be made quickly in the emergency room and treatment can be started immediately. If a patient's symptoms are vague or atypical and if there are pre-existing ECG abnormalities, for example, from old heart attacks or abnormal electrical patterns that make interpretation of the ECG difficult, the diagnosis of a heart attack may be less secure. In these patients, the diagnosis can be made only hours later through blood tests.""'Blood tests.'' Cardiac enzymes are proteins that are released into the blood by dying heart muscles. These cardiac enzymes are creatine phosphokinase (CPK), special sub-fractions of CPK (specifically, the MB fraction of CPK), and troponin, and their levels can be measured in blood. These cardiac enzymes typically are elevated in the blood several hours after the onset of a heart attack. Currently, troponin levels are considered the preferred lab tests to use to help diagnose a heart attack, as they are indicators of ''cardiac muscle'' injury or death. A series of blood tests for the enzymes performed over a 24-hour period are useful not only in confirming the diagnosis of heart attack, but the changes in their levels over time also correlates with the amount of heart muscle that has died.''The most important factor in diagnosing and treating a heart attack is prompt medical attention.'' Rapid evaluation allows early treatment of potentially life-threatening abnormal rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation and allows early reperfusion (return of blood flow to the heart muscle) by procedures that unclog the blocked coronary arteries. The more rapidly blood flow is reestablished, the more heart muscle that is saved. At this time, mechanical reperfusion with ''angioplasty'' and/or stenting to increase the flow of blood to the heart is the preferred way to preserve heart muscle if it can be performed within 90 minutes of arrival to the hospital; if there will be a delay, thrombolytic agents (clot busters) are preferred.''Large and active medical centers often have a ""chest pain unit"" where patients suspected of having heart attacks are rapidly evaluated. If a heart attack is diagnosed, prompt therapy is initiated. If the diagnosis of heart attack is initially unclear, the patient is placed under continuous monitoring until the results of further testing are available.'  "
What is the treatment for heart attack?,"'The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) task force recommends a treatment guideline that they consider as a preferred strategy to treat heart attacks; PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) or stenting is emphasized. For details about PCI, please see reference 2.''The 2013 ACCF/AHA guidelines for treatment of a heart attack are summarized as follows:'   Ideally, transport patient to a PCI capable hospital; if not PCI capable, transfer patient as soon as possible and less than 120 min; if anticipated transfer is more than 120 min, give fibrinolytic agent within 30 min of arrival Send to cath lab Diagnostic angiogram PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) also termed stenting or stent placement If reocclusion occurs or perfusion fails in a patient given a fibrinolytic, arrange transfer to a PCI capable facility; for other patients treated with a fibrinolytic, transfer to a PCI facility within about 3-24hrs If step 5 occurs, step 3 should follow at a PCI capable facility were either medical therapy, a PCI or a CABG should be done Patients who are not candidates for PCI therapy usually undergo medical or surgical (CABG) therapy. For a more detailed presentation of the medical treatments and CABG, read the heart attack treatment article."
What are the risk factors for heart attack in women?,"'Coronary artery disease (''CAD'') and heart attacks are erroneously believed to occur primarily in men. Although it is true that the prevalence of CAD among women is lower before ''menopause'', the risk of CAD rises in women after ''menopause'"". At age 75, a woman's risk for CAD is equal to that of a man's. CAD is the leading cause of death and disability in women after ""'menopause''. In fact, a 50-year-old woman faces a 46% risk of developing CAD and a 31% risk of dying from coronary artery disease. In contrast, her probability of contracting and dying from ''breast cancer'' is 12% and 3%, respectively.''The risk factors for developing CAD in women are the same as in men and include:''Even ""light"" smoking raises the risk of CAD. In one study, middle-aged women who smoked one to 14 cigarettes per day had a twofold increase in strokes (caused by atherosclerosis of the arteries to the brain) whereas those who smoked more than 25 cigarettes per day had a risk of ''stroke'' 3.7 fold higher than that of nonsmoking women. Furthermore, the combination of smoking and the use of ''birth control pills'' increase the risk of heart attacks even further, especially in women over 35.''Quitting smoking immediately begins to reduce the risk of heart attacks. The risk gradually returns to the same risk of nonsmoking women after several years of not smoking.''Current NCEP (National Cholesterol Education Program) treatment guidelines for undesirable cholesterol levels are the same for women as for men.' increased blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking cigarettes, diabetes mellitus, and a family history of coronary heart disease at a young age."
What are the symptoms of heart attack in women and how is heart attack diagnosed?,"'Women are more likely to encounter delays in establishing the diagnosis of heart attack than men. This is in part because women tend to seek medical care later than men, and in part because diagnosing ''heart attacks in women'' can sometimes be more difficult than diagnosing heart attacks in men. The reasons include:''Because of the atypical nature of symptoms and the occasional difficulties in diagnosing heart attacks in women, women are less likely to receive aggressive thrombolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty, and are more likely to receive it later than men. Women also are less likely to be admitted to a coronary care unit.' Women are more likely than men to have atypical heart attack symptoms such as:neck and shoulder pain,abdominal pain,nausea,vomiting,fatigue, andshortness of breath. neck and shoulder pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Silent heart attacks (heart attacks with little or no symptoms) are more common among women than among men. Women have a higher occurrence than men of chest pain that is not caused by heart disease, for example chest pain from spasm of the esophagus. Women are less likely than men to have the typical findings on the ECG that are necessary to diagnose a heart attack quickly. Women are more likely than men to have angina (chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart muscle) that is caused by spasm of the coronary arteries or caused by disease of the smallest blood vessels (microvasculature disease). Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiograms (X-ray studies of the coronary arteries that are considered the most reliable tests for CAD) will reveal normal coronary arteries and therefore cannot be used to diagnose either of these two conditions. Women are more likely to have misleading, or ""false positive"" noninvasive tests for CAD then men that don't disclose the arterial disease that is present."
How is heart attack in women treated?,"'Thrombolytic (fibrinolytic or clot dissolving) therapy has been shown to reduce death from heart attacks similarly in men and women; however, the complication of strokes from the thrombolytic therapy may be slightly higher in women than in men.'""Emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary stenting for acute heart attack is as effective in women as in men; however women may have a slightly higher rate of procedure-related complications in their blood vessels (such as bleeding or clotting at the point of insertion of the PTCA catheter in the groin) and death. This higher rate of complications has been attributed to women's older age, smaller artery size, and greater severity of angina. The long-term outcome of angioplasty or stenting however, is similar in men and women, and should not be withheld due to gender. This is still the preferred mode of therapy if it can be performed in a timely fashion.""'The immediate mortality from ''coronary artery bypass graft'"" surgery (CABG) in women is higher than that for men. The higher immediate mortality rate has been attributed to women's older age, smaller artery size, and greater severity of angina (the same as for PTCA). Long-term survival, rate of recurrent heart attack and/or need for reoperation, however, are similar in men and women after CABG."" "
What about hormone therapy and heart attack in women?,"'After menopause, the production of estrogen by the ovaries gradually diminishes over several years. Along with this reduction, there is an increase in LDL (""bad"" cholesterol) and a small decrease in HDL (""good"" cholesterol). These changes in ''lipid'' levels are believed to be one of the reasons for the increased risks of developing CAD after menopause. Women who have had their ovaries surgically removed (''oophorectomy'') or experience an early menopause, also have an accelerated risk of CAD.''Since treatment with estrogen hormone results in higher HDL and lower LDL cholesterol levels, doctors thought for many years that estrogen would protect women against CAD (as well protect against ''dementia'' and ''stroke''). Many studies have found that ''postmenopausal'' women who take estrogen have lower CAD rates than women who do not. Unfortunately many of the studies were observational studies (studies in which women are followed over time but decide on their own whether or not they wish to take estrogen). Observational studies have serious shortcomings because they are subject to selection bias; for example, women who choose to take estrogen hormones may be healthier and have a lower risk of heart attacks than those who do not. In other words, something else in the daily habits of women who take estrogen (such as exercise or healthier ''diet'') may make them less likely to develop heart attacks. Therefore, only a randomized trial (a study in which women agree to be assigned to estrogen or a placebo or ''sugar'' pill at random but are not told which pills they took until the end of the study) can establish whether ''hormone therapy'' after menopause can prevent CAD.''The Heart and ''Estrogen/progestin'' Replacement Study (HERS), was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effect of the daily use of ''estrogens'' plus ''medroxyprogesterone'' (progestin) on the rate of heart attacks in postmenopausal women who already had CAD. The HERS trial did not find a reduction in heart attacks in women who took hormone therapy. This lack of benefit in preventing heart attacks occurred despite an 11% lower LDL and a 10% higher HDL cholesterol level in the women treated with hormones. The study also found that more women in the hormone-treated group experienced ''blood clots'' in the veins and ''gallbladder disease'' than women in the placebo-treated group. (Blood clots in the veins are dangerous because these clots can travel to the ''lungs'' and cause ''pulmonary embolism'', a condition with chest pain, shortness of breath, and even shock and death.) However, the increase in gallbladder disease and blood clots among healthy users of estrogen who do not have heart disease is very small.''Based on the results of this study, researchers concluded that estrogen is not effective in preventing coronary artery disease and heart attacks in postmenopausal women who already have CAD. It should be noted, however, that the results of the HERS trial only apply to women who have known CAD prior to starting hormone therapy and not to women without known coronary artery disease.''The '""Women's Health""' Initiative (WHI) was the first randomized controlled trial designed to determine the long-term benefits and risks of treatment with estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) in healthy menopausal women (women without CAD). The results were reported in a series of articles in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The estrogen + progestin portion of the WHI study had to be stopped earlier than planned, after just 5.2 years, because the increase in coronary heart disease, ''stroke'', and ''pulmonary embolism'' among women who use estrogen + ''progesterone'' outweighed the benefits of reduced bone ''fractures'' and ''colon cancer''. The estrogen-alone portion of the WHI was stopped because women who took estrogen alone had no reduction in heart attack risk, yet there was a significant increase in stroke risk.''An increase in ''breast cancer'' became apparent after three to five years, but the increase in heart disease and pulmonary emboli occurred early on, in the first year.''MedicineNet Medical Editors believe that:' Decisions regarding use of hormone therapy have to be individualized, and all women should discuss with their physicians what is best for them. Estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) is still the best therapy for hot flashes. Despite the WHI study, many women remain good candidates for estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) therapy (or estrogen alone if they have had hysterectomy). This is especially true if hormone therapy is limited to the shortest duration, optimally less than five years. Estrogens with or without medroxyprogesterone (progestin) should not be used to prevent or treat either Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, or stroke. While estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) are effective in preventing osteoporosis and related bone fractures, women concerned about the risk of hormone therapy should discuss their concerns with their doctors, the use of other nonhormonal alternatives to prevent and treat osteoporosis."
What is new in heart attack?,"'Greater public awareness about heart attacks and changes in lifestyle have contributed to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of heart attacks during the last four decades. The role of the ""super aspirins"" (abciximab [''Reopro''] and eptifibatide [''Integrilin'']) has been established to be of benefit in selected patients.''More effective versions of clot-busting drugs have been developed. Increasingly, paramedics can do ECGs in the field, diagnose a heart attack, and take patients directly to hospitals that have the ability to do PTCA and stenting. This can save time and reduce damage to the heart. At present, the accepted best treatment for a heart attack is identification promptly of the diagnosis, and transport to a hospital that can perform prompt catheterization and PTCA or stenting within the first 90 minutes of the cardiac event (see 2013 guidelines above).''Recent data has shown that lowering blood LDL levels even further than previously suggested may further decrease the risk of heart attacks.''Research also has shown that inflammation may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis, and this is an active area of current investigation. There also is early evidence that with genetic engineering it may be possible to develop a drug that can be administered to clear plaques from arteries (a ""scavenger molecule"").' "
What is a heart attack?,"'A heart attack happens when the flow of blood that brings oxygen to the heart muscle is significantly reduced or cut off completely. This is often a result of ''atherosclerosis'', a process whereby the arteries narrow due to a buildup of plaque (fat, ''cholesterol'', and other substances). Sometimes these plaques can break off, and ''blood clots'' can form around them. The clots in the coronary arteries then block blood flow to the heart, starving it of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia), causing damage or death to heart muscle. This damage to the heart muscle is a heart attack. Heart attack is medically termed myocardial infarction (MI).' "

What is heart disease?,"'Heart disease in women'' includes a number of problems affecting the ''heart'' and the blood vessels in the heart. Types of ''heart disease'' include:''Coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'')'' is the most common type and is the leading cause of ''heart attacks''. When you have ''CAD'', your arteries become hard and narrow. Blood has a hard time getting to the heart, so the heart does not get all the blood it needs. CAD can lead to:'' '' ''Heart failure'' occurs when the heart is not able to pump blood through the body as well as it should. This means that other organs, which normally get blood from the heart, do not get enough blood. It does not mean that the heart stops. Signs of ''heart failure'' include:'""Heart arrhythmias (uh-RITH-mee-uhz) are changes in the beat of the heart. Most people have felt dizzy, faint, out of breath or had chest pains at one time. These changes in heartbeat are harmless for most people. As you get older, you are more likely to have arrhythmias. Don't panic if you have a few flutters or if your heart races once in a while. If you have flutters and other symptoms such as ""'dizziness'' or ''shortness of breath'', call 911 right away.' Angina (an-JEYE-nuh). Angina is chest pain or discomfort that happens when the heart does not get enough blood. It may feel like a pressing or squeezing pain, often in the chest, but sometimes the pain is in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It can also feel like indigestion (upset stomach). Angina is not a heart attack, but having angina means you are more likely to have a heart attack. Heart attack.

What does high blood pressure have to do with heart disease?,"'Blood pressure is the force your blood makes against the walls of your arteries. The pressure is highest when your heart pumps blood into your arteries – when it beats. It is lowest between heart beats, when your heart relaxes. A doctor or nurse will write down your blood pressure as the higher number over the lower number. For instance, you could have a blood pressure of 110/70 (read as ""110 over 70""). A blood pressure reading below 120/80 is usually considered normal. Very ''low blood pressure'' (lower than 90/60) can sometimes be a cause of concern and should be checked out by a doctor.''High blood pressure'', or ''hypertension'', is a blood pressure reading of 140/90 or higher. Years of ''high blood pressure'' can damage artery walls, causing them to become stiff and narrow. This includes the arteries carrying blood to the heart.

This can cause a heart attack.''There are two types of cholesterol:''All women age 20 and older should have their blood cholesterol and ''triglyceride levels'' checked at least once every 5 years.' Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is often called the ""bad"" type of cholesterol because it can clog the arteries that carry blood to your heart. For LDL, lower numbers are better. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as ""good"" cholesterol because it takes the bad cholesterol out of your blood and keeps it from building up in your arteries. For HDL, higher numbers are better."

What is a Heart Attack?,"'A  ''heart attack'"" is a layperson's term for a sudden blockage of a coronary artery. This blockage, which doctors call a coronary artery occlusion, may be fatal, but most patients survive it. Death can occur when the occlusion leads to an abnormal heartbeat (severe ""'arrhythmia'') or death of ''heart'' muscle (extensive ''myocardial infarction''). In both of these situations, the heart can no longer pump blood adequately to supply the brain and other organs of the body. Almost all ''heart attacks'' occur in people who have  ''coronary artery disease'' (coronary ''atherosclerosis''). So, this photo essay will review the structure (anatomy) of the normal coronary artery, the structural abnormalities (pathology) of the coronary artery in atherosclerosis, and the effect of these abnormalities on the heart.'  "
What are the structures and functions of a normal coronary artery?,"'The coronary arteries carry blood to the heart to supply oxygen and necessary nutrients. As seen in ''Figure 1,'' the wall of a coronary artery has 3 distinct layers: the inner (intima), middle (media), and outer (adventitia) layers. The wall of the artery surrounds the lumen of the artery, which is the channel through which blood flows.''Figure 1: Normal Coronary Artery; Cross-sectional Microscopic View''In ''Figure 1,'' smooth muscle is red, and connective (supporting) tissue is black (elastic) or blue (collagen).''The ''intima''  is best seen in the ''close-up view in Figure 1.'' It is composed of a layer of so-called endothelial cells that covers the artery\'s inner (lumenal) surface, connective (supporting) tissue (collagen and elastin), and a layer of compact elastic tissue called the internal elastic lamina (IEL). In the past, the intima was thought to be simply a passive layer whose major purpose was to serve as a barrier. Now, however, we know that the endothelial cells actually keep track of the pressure, flow, and ""health"" of the artery. Moreover, endothelial cells secrete chemicals that can adjust the function of the artery (e.g., vasodilator chemicals to widen and vasoconstrictors to narrow it) and growth of the artery wall (e.g., growth factors).''The ''media'' (M) is a layer made up primarily of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The muscle can contract and relax to control the ''blood pressure'' and flow in the artery. Elastic tissue and collagen in the media, along with elastic tissue in the IEL, increase the elasticity and strength of the wall of the artery, as the artery contracts and relaxes. The adventitia is a layer of connective tissue and cells (e.g., SMCs) that produce this connective tissue. The ''adventitia'' contains potent factors, including one called tissue thromboplastin, that promote blood clotting. The clots are useful when the artery becomes injured because they can limit excessive bleeding from the injured artery.' "
What happens to the coronary artery in atherosclerosis?,"'In ''coronary artery disease'' (coronary atherosclerosis), injury to the intima of the artery leads to the formation of plaques, which are regions of thickening on the inner lining of the artery. How then do the plaques form? In response to the injury, the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from the media and perhaps from the adventitia move (migrate) into the intima. In the intima, these SMCs reproduce themselves (divide) and make (synthesize) connective tissue. These processes of migration, division, and synthesis, which collectively are referred to as intimal proliferation (buildup), cause thickening of the intima. When ''cholesterol'', other ''fats'', and inflammatory cells, such as white blood cells, enter the proliferating, thickened intima, the result is an ''atherosclerotic'' plaque. Then, as these plaques grow, they accumulate ''scar'' (fibrous) tissue and abundant calcium. (Calcium is the hard material in our ''teeth'' and bones.) Hence, the plaques are often hard, which is why atherosclerosis is sometimes referred to as ""hardening of the arteries.""' "
Who gets coronary artery plaques and what happens to the plaques?,"'Most adults in industrialized nations have some plaques (atherosclerosis) on the inner (lumenal) surface of their coronary arteries. ''Autopsy'' studies of young soldiers who died in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War showed that even young adults in their 20s usually have coronary arteries that exhibit localized (focal) thickening of the intima. This thickening is the beginning of intimal proliferation and plaque formation. The distribution, severity (amount of plaque), and rate of growth of the plaques in the coronary arteries vary greatly from person to person. ''Figure 2'' shows a coronary artery with an uneven (asymmetric), stable atherosclerotic plaque. A stable plaque may grow slowly, but has an intact inner (lumenal) surface with no clot (thrombus) on this surface.''Figure 2: Coronary Artery with Stable Atherosclerotic Plaque; Cross-sectional Microscopic View''Rupture of a stable plaque in a coronary artery is the initial pathological event leading to a heart attack. When the rupture occurs, a clot suddenly forms in the lumen (channel) of the artery at the site of the rupture. Bleeding into the plaque often accompanies the rupture. The clot then blocks (occludes) the artery and thereby decreases the blood flow to the heart. This sequence of events in the coronary arteries is the basic problem in over 75% of people who suffer a heart attack. In some patients, more often women, there is just an erosion or ulceration of the plaque surface, rather than a full rupture that leads to clot formation in the coronary artery. ''Figure 3'' shows an atherosclerotic plaque rupture and a clot in a coronary artery.''Figure 3: Rupture of Atherosclerotic Plaque in Coronary Artery; Cross-sectional Microscopic View' "
What happens to the heart muscle after a person survives a Heart Attack?,"'According to medical studies, 50% to 75% of people survive their first heart attack Others die during the heart attack because the decreased coronary blood flow causes a severe abnormal heart rhythm or extensive death of heart muscle. ''Figure 4'' shows the heart of a patient who died 5 days after a heart attack. The photos show his myocardial infarction as it appears on the surface of the ''left ventricle'' and when the heart is sliced to view the muscle wall. About 90% of myocardial infarctions involve only the left ventricle (LV), which pumps oxygen-rich blood that comes from the ''lungs'' to the entire body. The other 10% also involve the ''right ventricle'' (RV), which pumps the blood to the lungs.''Figure 4: Myocardial Infarction Caused by Heart Attack; Views of Heart Surface and Slice Across Heart''If a person survives a heart attack, the heart muscle may return to normal or become a region of dead heart muscle (the myocardial infarction). The amount and health of the remaining heart muscle is the major determinant of the future quality of life and longevity for a patient after a heart attack. A heart attack can interrupt the normal electrical wiring of the heart, leading to ''abnormal heart rhythms''. The heart attack can also weaken the pumping action of the heart causing ''shortness of breath'' due to ''heart failure''. Each of these complications of a heart attack can occur at any time during the recovery period as a result of dead, dying, or scarring heart muscle.' "
Can a person have more than one heart attack?,"'Yes. Not uncommonly, people with coronary artery disease have more than one heart attack over the years. In fact, by looking at the heart tissue at autopsy, pathologists can tell when myocardial infarctions occurred. Thus, very recent (acute, hours old) infarctions may appear as a pale brown region, infarctions days old (subacute) appear yellow, and healed (weeks to years old) infarctions appear as white ''scars'' in the heart muscle.

Heart health and heart attack prevention overview,"  Coronary atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Coronary atherosclerosis is the major cause of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Heart attacks are the major cause of sudden unexpected death among otherwise healthy adults in the prime of their lives. Heart attacks are also a significant cause of heart failure (due to weakened heart muscle) in the U.S. Heart failure considerably decreases a person's longevity and quality of life. In dollar terms, coronary heart disease is costly. The total cost of coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty and stenting, medications, and hospitalizations exceeds 50 billion dollars annually. Coronary atherosclerosis, and hence heart attacks, are preventable. A 
	person can significantly lower his or her risk of heart attack by:Lowering high blood pressureControlling diabetesQuitting cigarette smokingLosing excess weightExercising regularlyLowering the levels of bad ""LDL"" cholesterol and increasing the level of the good ""HDL"" cholesterol in the blood. Lowering high blood pressure Controlling diabetes Quitting cigarette smoking Losing excess weight Exercising regularly Lowering the levels of bad ""LDL"" cholesterol and increasing the level of the good ""HDL"" cholesterol in the blood. In recent years, other risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis have been identified. These include 
	patients with a high serum homocysteine level and certain subtypes of LDL cholesterol. Cardiovascular disease can be diagnosed and treated by doctors. The following is an 
	article review of the signs, symptoms, risks, and causes of atherosclerosis and heart attacks, and the means for their prevention."
"What is atherosclerosis 
heart disease, and how does cause a heart attack?"," Atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. Cholesterol plaques cause hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. Arteries carry blood enriched with oxygen and nutrients to the vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver. Arteries also transport blood to other tissues such as the fingers, toes, nerves, bones, skin, and muscles. Healthy arteries can deliver an ample supply of blood to the organs and tissues. In contrast, arteries narrowed by atherosclerosis have difficulty delivering blood to the parts of the body they supply. For example, atherosclerosis of the arteries in the legs causes poor circulation in the lower extremities. Poor circulation in the lower extremities can lead to 
	symptoms of pain while walking or exercising, 
	slow wound healing, and leg ulcers. Atherosclerosis also can cause the complete blockage of an artery from a blood clot. This complete blockage interrupts oxygen supply and results in tissue injury or death. Thus, the blockage of an artery that furnishes blood to the brain can lead to a stroke (death of brain tissue). Likewise, the blockage of the arteries to the heart can result in a heart attack (death of heart muscle), also called myocardial infarction (MI)."
"How early in life does the coronary atherosclerosis 
heart disease process begin?"," Although the coronary arteries are wide open at birth, the atherosclerosis process begins early in life. Between the ages of 10 and 20, ""fatty streaks"" are already being deposited on the inner lining of the coronary arteries. Over the years, some of these fatty streaks grow into larger cholesterol plaques that can protrude into the artery interior space (lumen) and harden the artery walls. Many men and women between the ages of 20 and 30 typically are unaware their coronary arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. By ages 40 to 50, many people have developed enough 
	damage to put them at risk for
	coronary heart disease."
"When should you start making 
changes to prevent a heart attack?","'Atherosclerosis prevention'' should start early, preferably during childhood and adolescence. Most scientists believe preventing atherosclerosis is more effective than trying to reverse established blockages or getting rid of plaques in the arteries. Children and adolescents should be taught heart healthy lifetime habits of regular ''exercise'', ''quitting smoking'', and good ''nutrition''. Many men and women do not take adequate steps to prevent atherosclerosis. Reasons for this failure include:' Lack of awareness that they already have coronary atherosclerosis 
	heart disease, and ignorance that coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks are preventable Lack of awareness of their blood cholesterol levels and profiles Unwillingness or inability to quit cigarette smoking High blood pressure or type 2 diabetes that are either undiagnosed or inadequately controlled Lack of exercise, an excess of fat and cholesterol in their diet, and an inability or unwillingness to lose excess weight Failure to take full advantage of medications that improve cholesterol levels, often out of fear of potential side effects."
What are the types of coronary heart disease (CHD)?,"'Atherosclerosis is a condition that refers to the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries supply the blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. When coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis, they cannot deliver an adequate amount of blood to the heart muscle. Disease caused by the lack of blood supply to heart muscle is called coronary ''heart disease'' (CHD). Coronary heart diseases include:' Heart attack (myocardial infarction) Sudden unexpected death Chest pain (angina) Abnormal heart rhythms Heart failure due to weakening of the heart muscle. Angina pectoris is chest pain or pressure that occurs when the oxygen supply to the heart muscle cannot keep up with oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. (Oxygen consumption by the heart muscle increases with physical exertion or excitement and decreases with rest and relaxation.) Most commonly, the inadequate supply of oxygen is due to narrowing of the coronary arteries by atherosclerosis 
heart disease. When coronary arteries are narrowed by more than 50% to 70%, the arteries cannot increase the supply of blood to the heart muscle during exertion or other periods of high oxygen demand. An insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle cause chest pain 
as a symptom. Chest pain is a symptom that occurs with exercise or exertion is called exertional angina. 
Patients with angina and its symptoms and signs require medical treatment by a 
doctor. A heart attack (myocardial infarction) is the death of heart muscle due to the sudden and complete blockage of a coronary artery by a blood clot. A coronary artery blockage usually occurs in arteries that contain cholesterol plaques. A plaque can rupture and initiate the formation of a blood clot next to it. A blood clot can completely block blood flow through a coronary artery and deprive the heart muscle of needed nutrients and oxygen. Sections of the heart muscle then die, which produces a heart attack. 
	If a person suffering from heart attack and its  symptoms and signs 
	require medical treatment by a doctor. A heart attack can trigger the sudden onset of 
ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic electrical rhythm of the heart that causes cardiac arrest (the heart stands still and ceases to pump blood). Ventricular fibrillation causes permanent brain damage and death unless a normal heartbeat can be restored within five minutes of its onset. Of the one million Americans who suffer heart attacks annually, an estimated 326,000 Americans experience sudden cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, each year before the victims can reach any medical assistance. For 90% of these people, the first sign of coronary heart disease is sudden, unexpected death. 
Patients with ventricular fibrillation and its symptoms and signs require 
medical treatment  by a doctor. Unlike angina, a heart attack results in permanent damage of the heart muscle. After a heart attack, the damaged portion of the heart is left with a scar. If the amount of heart muscle damage and the area of scarring are small, the performance of the heart as a pump will not be significantly impaired. However, repeated heart attacks or a heart attack with extensive heart muscle damage can weaken the heart and cause heart failure. People with heart failure experience 
	signs and symptoms of shortness of breath, poor exercise tolerance, and lack of energy because their weakened heart muscle cannot pump enough blood to keep their bodies healthy and active. 
	Patients with heart failure and its signs and symptoms require medical 
	treatment  by a doctor."
What is cerebral vascular disease?,"'''Cerebral vascular disease'' is caused by the reduced supply of blood to the brain. Examples of cerebral vascular disease include conditions such as ischemic ''strokes'', hemorrhagic strokes, and transient ischemic attacks and are provided.' An ischemic stroke is the sudden and permanent death of brain cells that occurs when the flow of blood to a part of the brain is blocked and oxygen cannot be delivered to the brain. Depending on the part of the brain that is affected, strokes can result in 
	signs and symptoms of
	weakness or paralysis of the arms, legs, and/or facial muscles, loss of vision or speech, and difficulty walking. Ischemic strokes most commonly occur when clots form in small arteries within the brain (known as thrombosis of the artery) that have been previously narrowed by atherosclerosis. The resulting strokes are called lacunar strokes because they look like small lakes. In some cases, blood clots can obstruct a larger artery going to the brain, such as the carotid artery in the neck, causing more extensive brain damage than lacunar strokes. A second less common type of ischemic stroke occurs when a piece of a clot breaks loose, for example, from the carotid artery or heart, travels through the arteries, and lodges in an artery within the brain. This type of stroke is referred to as an embolic stroke and occurs commonly as a result of an irregular heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation, that causes blood clots to form within the heart. 
	Patients with ischemic stroke and its signs and symptoms require medical 
	treatment  by a doctor. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, and blood leaks into the surrounding brain tissue. A hemorrhagic stroke, like an ischemic stroke, causes the death of tissue by depriving the brain of blood and oxygen. The accumulation of blood from the hemorrhage also can put pressure on adjacent parts of the brain and damage them as well. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rupture of a blood vessel that is located between the outer surface of the brain and the inside of the skull. The blood vessel at the point of rupture often has been weakened by the development of an aneurysm (an abnormal ballooning of the wall of the blood vessel). Subarachnoid hemorrhages usually cause a sudden, severe headache and often are complicated by additional neurological problems, such as paralysis, coma, and even death. 
If a person is having a hemorrhagic stroke and its signs and symptoms require 
medical treatment  by a doctor. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) often is referred to as a mini-stroke. TIAs are caused by the temporary reduction in flow of blood (ischemia) to the brain and is most often caused by a clot that spontaneously forms in a carotid artery. Patients with TIA's often have narrowed (or, less often, ulcerated) carotid arteries due to atherosclerosis. TIAs typically last 2 to 30 minutes, although 
signs and symptoms sometimes can last 24 hours and can produce problems with vision, dizziness, weakness of the arms or legs, and trouble speaking. A TIA is different 
condition from a stroke in that it does not cause permanent death of brain tissue. Without treatment, however, patients with TIAs are at high risk for having a stroke with permanent damage to the brain. 
If a person is having a transient ischemic attacks and its signs and symptoms it 
require medical treatment by a doctor."
What are the risk factors for heart attack?,"'Well-known risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks include:''Less recognized but just as important risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis are:' Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) in the blood Family history of early coronary heart disease, including a heart attack or sudden death before age 55 in the father or other male first-degree relative, or before age 65 in the mother or other female first-degree relative Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitus High blood pressure Low levels of HDL (the ""good"" cholesterol) in the blood Sedentary lifestyle A large number of small LDL cholesterol particles in the blood. LDL cholesterol particles come in different sizes. The size of a person's LDL cholesterol particles is predominantly genetically inherited. The smaller LDL cholesterol particles are far more dangerous in causing atherosclerosis than the larger particles. The smaller LDL particles can penetrate the walls of the arteries more easily than the larger LDL particles. A person with an abundance of small LDL cholesterol particles in the blood has a significantly higher risk of heart attack and coronary atherosclerosis than someone with larger LDL cholesterol particles in their blood. Abnormally elevated blood levels of 
lipoprotein A, (Lp[a]). Lp(a) is an LDL cholesterol particle that is linked chemically to a protein called apo(a). The level of Lp(a) in the blood is als genetically inherited.

Heart health and heart attack prevention overview,"  Coronary atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Coronary atherosclerosis is the major cause of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Heart attacks are the major cause of sudden unexpected death among otherwise healthy adults in the prime of their lives. Heart attacks are also a significant cause of heart failure (due to weakened heart muscle) in the U.S. Heart failure considerably decreases a person's longevity and quality of life. In dollar terms, coronary heart disease is costly. The total cost of coronary artery bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty and stenting, medications, and hospitalizations exceeds 50 billion dollars annually. Coronary atherosclerosis, and hence heart attacks, are preventable. A 
	person can significantly lower his or her risk of heart attack by:Lowering high blood pressureControlling diabetesQuitting cigarette smokingLosing excess weightExercising regularlyLowering the levels of bad ""LDL"" cholesterol and increasing the level of the good ""HDL"" cholesterol in the blood. Lowering high blood pressure Controlling diabetes Quitting cigarette smoking Losing excess weight Exercising regularly Lowering the levels of bad ""LDL"" cholesterol and increasing the level of the good ""HDL"" cholesterol in the blood. In recent years, other risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis have been identified. These include 
	patients with a high serum homocysteine level and certain subtypes of LDL cholesterol. Cardiovascular disease can be diagnosed and treated by doctors. The following is an 
	article review of the signs, symptoms, risks, and causes of atherosclerosis and heart attacks, and the means for their prevention."
"What is atherosclerosis 
heart disease, and how does cause a heart attack?"," Atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. Cholesterol plaques cause hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. Arteries carry blood enriched with oxygen and nutrients to the vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver. Arteries also transport blood to other tissues such as the fingers, toes, nerves, bones, skin, and muscles. Healthy arteries can deliver an ample supply of blood to the organs and tissues. In contrast, arteries narrowed by atherosclerosis have difficulty delivering blood to the parts of the body they supply. For example, atherosclerosis of the arteries in the legs causes poor circulation in the lower extremities. Poor circulation in the lower extremities can lead to 
	symptoms of pain while walking or exercising, 
	slow wound healing, and leg ulcers. Atherosclerosis also can cause the complete blockage of an artery from a blood clot. This complete blockage interrupts oxygen supply and results in tissue injury or death. Thus, the blockage of an artery that furnishes blood to the brain can lead to a stroke (death of brain tissue). Likewise, the blockage of the arteries to the heart can result in a heart attack (death of heart muscle), also called myocardial infarction (MI)."
"How early in life does the coronary atherosclerosis 
heart disease process begin?"," Although the coronary arteries are wide open at birth, the atherosclerosis process begins early in life. Between the ages of 10 and 20, ""fatty streaks"" are already being deposited on the inner lining of the coronary arteries. Over the years, some of these fatty streaks grow into larger cholesterol plaques that can protrude into the artery interior space (lumen) and harden the artery walls. Many men and women between the ages of 20 and 30 typically are unaware their coronary arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. By ages 40 to 50, many people have developed enough 
	damage to put them at risk for
	coronary heart disease."
"When should you start making 
changes to prevent a heart attack?","'Atherosclerosis prevention'' should start early, preferably during childhood and adolescence. Most scientists believe preventing atherosclerosis is more effective than trying to reverse established blockages or getting rid of plaques in the arteries. Children and adolescents should be taught heart healthy lifetime habits of regular ''exercise'', ''quitting smoking'', and good ''nutrition''. Many men and women do not take adequate steps to prevent atherosclerosis. Reasons for this failure include:' Lack of awareness that they already have coronary atherosclerosis 
	heart disease, and ignorance that coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks are preventable Lack of awareness of their blood cholesterol levels and profiles Unwillingness or inability to quit cigarette smoking High blood pressure or type 2 diabetes that are either undiagnosed or inadequately controlled Lack of exercise, an excess of fat and cholesterol in their diet, and an inability or unwillingness to lose excess weight Failure to take full advantage of medications that improve cholesterol levels, often out of fear of potential side effects."
What are the types of coronary heart disease (CHD)?,"'Atherosclerosis is a condition that refers to the hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries supply the blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. When coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis, they cannot deliver an adequate amount of blood to the heart muscle. Disease caused by the lack of blood supply to heart muscle is called coronary ''heart disease'' (CHD). Coronary heart diseases include:' Heart attack (myocardial infarction) Sudden unexpected death Chest pain (angina) Abnormal heart rhythms Heart failure due to weakening of the heart muscle. Angina pectoris is chest pain or pressure that occurs when the oxygen supply to the heart muscle cannot keep up with oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. (Oxygen consumption by the heart muscle increases with physical exertion or excitement and decreases with rest and relaxation.) Most commonly, the inadequate supply of oxygen is due to narrowing of the coronary arteries by atherosclerosis 
heart disease. When coronary arteries are narrowed by more than 50% to 70%, the arteries cannot increase the supply of blood to the heart muscle during exertion or other periods of high oxygen demand. An insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle cause chest pain 
as a symptom. Chest pain is a symptom that occurs with exercise or exertion is called exertional angina. 
Patients with angina and its symptoms and signs require medical treatment by a 
doctor. A heart attack (myocardial infarction) is the death of heart muscle due to the sudden and complete blockage of a coronary artery by a blood clot. A coronary artery blockage usually occurs in arteries that contain cholesterol plaques. A plaque can rupture and initiate the formation of a blood clot next to it. A blood clot can completely block blood flow through a coronary artery and deprive the heart muscle of needed nutrients and oxygen. Sections of the heart muscle then die, which produces a heart attack. 
	If a person suffering from heart attack and its  symptoms and signs 
	require medical treatment by a doctor. A heart attack can trigger the sudden onset of 
ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic electrical rhythm of the heart that causes cardiac arrest (the heart stands still and ceases to pump blood). Ventricular fibrillation causes permanent brain damage and death unless a normal heartbeat can be restored within five minutes of its onset. Of the one million Americans who suffer heart attacks annually, an estimated 326,000 Americans experience sudden cardiac arrest, including ventricular fibrillation, each year before the victims can reach any medical assistance. For 90% of these people, the first sign of coronary heart disease is sudden, unexpected death. 
Patients with ventricular fibrillation and its symptoms and signs require 
medical treatment  by a doctor. Unlike angina, a heart attack results in permanent damage of the heart muscle. After a heart attack, the damaged portion of the heart is left with a scar. If the amount of heart muscle damage and the area of scarring are small, the performance of the heart as a pump will not be significantly impaired. However, repeated heart attacks or a heart attack with extensive heart muscle damage can weaken the heart and cause heart failure. People with heart failure experience 
	signs and symptoms of shortness of breath, poor exercise tolerance, and lack of energy because their weakened heart muscle cannot pump enough blood to keep their bodies healthy and active. 
	Patients with heart failure and its signs and symptoms require medical 
	treatment  by a doctor."
What is cerebral vascular disease?,"'''Cerebral vascular disease'' is caused by the reduced supply of blood to the brain. Examples of cerebral vascular disease include conditions such as ischemic ''strokes'', hemorrhagic strokes, and transient ischemic attacks and are provided.' An ischemic stroke is the sudden and permanent death of brain cells that occurs when the flow of blood to a part of the brain is blocked and oxygen cannot be delivered to the brain. Depending on the part of the brain that is affected, strokes can result in 
	signs and symptoms of
	weakness or paralysis of the arms, legs, and/or facial muscles, loss of vision or speech, and difficulty walking. Ischemic strokes most commonly occur when clots form in small arteries within the brain (known as thrombosis of the artery) that have been previously narrowed by atherosclerosis. The resulting strokes are called lacunar strokes because they look like small lakes. In some cases, blood clots can obstruct a larger artery going to the brain, such as the carotid artery in the neck, causing more extensive brain damage than lacunar strokes. A second less common type of ischemic stroke occurs when a piece of a clot breaks loose, for example, from the carotid artery or heart, travels through the arteries, and lodges in an artery within the brain. This type of stroke is referred to as an embolic stroke and occurs commonly as a result of an irregular heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation, that causes blood clots to form within the heart. 
	Patients with ischemic stroke and its signs and symptoms require medical 
	treatment  by a doctor. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, and blood leaks into the surrounding brain tissue. A hemorrhagic stroke, like an ischemic stroke, causes the death of tissue by depriving the brain of blood and oxygen. The accumulation of blood from the hemorrhage also can put pressure on adjacent parts of the brain and damage them as well. A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a rupture of a blood vessel that is located between the outer surface of the brain and the inside of the skull. The blood vessel at the point of rupture often has been weakened by the development of an aneurysm (an abnormal ballooning of the wall of the blood vessel). Subarachnoid hemorrhages usually cause a sudden, severe headache and often are complicated by additional neurological problems, such as paralysis, coma, and even death. 
If a person is having a hemorrhagic stroke and its signs and symptoms require 
medical treatment  by a doctor. A transient ischemic attack (TIA) often is referred to as a mini-stroke. TIAs are caused by the temporary reduction in flow of blood (ischemia) to the brain and is most often caused by a clot that spontaneously forms in a carotid artery. Patients with TIA's often have narrowed (or, less often, ulcerated) carotid arteries due to atherosclerosis. TIAs typically last 2 to 30 minutes, although 
signs and symptoms sometimes can last 24 hours and can produce problems with vision, dizziness, weakness of the arms or legs, and trouble speaking. A TIA is different 
condition from a stroke in that it does not cause permanent death of brain tissue. Without treatment, however, patients with TIAs are at high risk for having a stroke with permanent damage to the brain. 
If a person is having a transient ischemic attacks and its signs and symptoms it 
require medical treatment by a doctor."
What are the risk factors for heart attack?,"'Well-known risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks include:''Less recognized but just as important risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis are:' Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) in the blood Family history of early coronary heart disease, including a heart attack or sudden death before age 55 in the father or other male first-degree relative, or before age 65 in the mother or other female first-degree relative Cigarette smoking Diabetes mellitus High blood pressure Low levels of HDL (the ""good"" cholesterol) in the blood Sedentary lifestyle A large number of small LDL cholesterol particles in the blood. LDL cholesterol particles come in different sizes. The size of a person's LDL cholesterol particles is predominantly genetically inherited. The smaller LDL cholesterol particles are far more dangerous in causing atherosclerosis than the larger particles. The smaller LDL particles can penetrate the walls of the arteries more easily than the larger LDL particles. A person with an abundance of small LDL cholesterol particles in the blood has a significantly higher risk of heart attack and coronary atherosclerosis than someone with larger LDL cholesterol particles in their blood. Abnormally elevated blood levels of 
lipoprotein A, (Lp[a]). Lp(a) is an LDL cholesterol particle that is linked chemically to a protein called apo(a). The level of Lp(a) in the blood is als genetically inherited. Men and women with elevated blood levels of Lp(a) have significantly higher rates of coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks. Elevated homocysteine levels in the blood. Homocysteine is a metabolic by-product of animal protein. Tests are now available to measure 
homocysteine levels in the blood, which helps in diagnosing heart health 
problems. Higher homocysteine levels in the blood are associated with atherosclerosis in coronary arteries and carotid arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain)."

Cardiac arrest vs. heart attack,"'Sometimes there is ''confusion'' between the terms ""''cardiac arrest''"" and ""heart attack."" A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, is damage to the heart muscle that occurs due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, depriving the heart muscle of the oxygen it needs to function properly.

What is a heart attack?,"'\tA ''heart attack'' (also known as a ''myocardial infarction'' or MI) is the death of ''heart'' muscle from the sudden blockage by a ''blood clot'' in a coronary artery that supplies blood to the heart. Blockage of a coronary artery deprives the heart muscle of blood and oxygen, causing injury to the heart muscle. Injury to the heart muscle causes ''chest pain'' and pressure. If blood flow is not restored within 20 to 40 minutes, irreversible death of the heart muscle will begin to occur. Muscle continues to die for 6 to 8 hours at which time the heart attack usually is ""complete."" The dead heart muscle is replaced by ''scar tissue''.''\tClick here to view interactive photos of hearts that have suffered a heart attack.'  "
How is a heart attack treated?,"'Treatment of ''heart attacks'' includes:''The primary goal of treatment is to quickly open the blocked artery and restore blood flow to the heart muscle, a process called reperfusion. Once the artery is open, damage to heart muscle ceases, and ''pain'' improves. By minimizing the extent of heart muscle damage, early reperfusion preserves the pumping function of the heart. Optimal benefit is obtained if reperfusion can be established within the first 4 to 6 hours of a heart attack. Delay in establishing reperfusion can result in more widespread damage to heart muscle and a greater reduction in the ability of the heart to pump blood. Patients with hearts that are unable to pump sufficient blood develop ''heart failure'', decreased ability to ''exercise'', and abnormal heart rhythms. Thus, the amount of healthy heart muscle remaining after a heart attack is the most important determinant of the future quality of life and longevity.'  Antiplatelet medications to prevent formation of blood clots in the arteries Anticoagulant medications to prevent growth of blood clots in the arteries Coronary angiography with either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with or without stenting to open blocked coronary arteries Clot-dissolving medications to open blocked arteries Supplemental oxygen to increase the supply of oxygen to the heart's muscle Medications to decrease the need for oxygen by the heart's muscle Medications to prevent abnormal heart rhythms Cardiac surgery"
Antiplatelet agents,"'Antiplatelet agents are medications that prevent blood clots from formingby inhibiting the aggregation of platelets. Platelets are fragments of cellsthat circulate in the blood. Platelets begin the formation of blood clots byclumping together (a process called aggregation). Platelet clumps are then strengthened and expanded by the action of clotting factors (coagulants) thatresult in the deposition of protein (fibrin) among the platelets. Aggregation ofplatelets occurs at the site of any injury or laceration, but it also occurs atthe site of rupture of ''cholesterol'' plaques in the walls of coronary arteries.Formation of clots at the site of an injury or laceration is desirable becauseit prevents excessive loss of blood, but formation of clots inside coronaryarteries blocks the arteries and causes ''heart attacks''.''There are three types of antiplatelet agents -- ''aspirin'', thienopyridines, andthe glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. These agents differ in their mode ofaction, antiplatelet potency, speed of onset of action, and cost. For more, please read the Aspirin and Antiplatelet Medications article.' "
Aspirin,"'Aspirin inhibits the activity of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase inside platelets.Cyclo-oxygenase is an enzyme whose activity is necessary for the formation of achemical, thromboxane A2, that causes platelets to aggregate. Aspirin, byinhibiting the formation of thromboxane A2, prevents platelets from aggregatingand thereby prevents the formation of blood clots.''Aspirin alone has its greatest impact on improving survival among patientswith ''heart attacks''. Numerous studies have shown that aspirin reduces mortality(by 25%) when given to patients with heart attacks. Aspirin is easy to use, safeat the low doses used for antiplatelet action, fast acting (with an onset ofaction within 30 minutes), and cheap. Aspirin is given at a dose of 160 mg to325 mg immediately to almost all patients as soon as a heart attack is recognized. Italso is continued on a daily basis indefinitely after the heart attack. The onlyreason for not using aspirin is a history of intolerance or ''allergy'' to aspirin.''Aspirin is taken daily following a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heartattack. (Preventing further heart attacks is called secondary ''prevention'"", while preventingthe first heart attack is called primary prevention). The ideal daily doseof aspirin for secondary prevention has not been established. Some doctors recommend160 mg; others recommend 81 mg. The reason for this difference has todo with aspirin's occasional long-term side effect of bleeding (for example fromstomach ulcers). Even though the risk of major bleeding with long-term, moderatedose aspirin (325 mg/day) is low (less than 1%), this risk can belowered slightly by using an even lower dose (160 or 81 mg/day).""'Aspirin also benefits patients with forms of coronary ''heart disease'' otherthan heart attacks. Aspirin has been shown to reduce heart attacks andimprove survival in the following patients:'  Aspirin improves survival among patients with unstable 
  angina. Patients with unstable angina experience chest pains at rest or with 
  minimal exertion. These patients have critically narrowed coronary arteries 
  and are at imminent risk of having a heart attack. Aspirin improves survival among patients with stable 
  exertional angina. (These are patients who experience chest pain only with 
  exertion.) Aspirin prevents formation of blood clots at the site 
  of the PTCA (see below). Aspirin prevents the formation of blood clots that can 
  occlude surgical bypass grafts. (Occlusion of bypass grafts can lead to heart 
  attacks.) Aspirin in low doses (81 mg/day) has been shown to prevent first heart
attacks (primary prevention)."
Thienopyridines,"'Thienopyridines such as ''ticlopidine'' (Ticlid), clopidogrel (''Plavix''), and prasugrel (Effient), inhibit the ADP receptor on the surface of platelets. Inhibiting the ADP receptors on the platelets prevent the platelets from aggregating and causing blood clots to form. The theinopyridines are more potent antiplatelet agents than aspirin. Clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Effient) are used far more commonly than ticlopidine (Ticlid) because ticlopidine can, in rare instances, cause low platelet and/or white blood cell counts. These agents play an important role in the treatment of heart attacks and are used in the following situations:''Patients who receive the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin are more likely than patients who receive aspirin alone to develop complications of major bleeding following ''coronary artery bypass'' surgery. Therefore, ideally, clopidogrel should be stopped 3 to 7 days before surgery.' Clopidogrel or prasugrel is used instead of aspirin in patients who have an allergy to aspirin. Clopidogrel or prasugrel are often given together with aspirin in treating heart attacks. Studies have shown that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than aspirin alone in improving survival and limiting damage to heart muscle among patients with heart attacks. Clopidogrel or prasugrel is given together with aspirin to patients undergoing PTCA with or without coronary stenting (see later discussion). Studies have shown that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than aspirin alone in preventing formation of blood clots that can re-occlude the coronary artery unblocked by PTCA and in preventing blood clots within recently placed stents. After a heart attack or after PTCA, aspirin is given indefinitely. The optimal duration of clopidogrel has not been established, and duration of use by physicians varies from weeks to months."
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors,"'The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors such as abciximab (''Reopro'') andeptifibatide (''Integrilin'') prevent aggregation of platelets by inhibiting theglycoprotein receptors on the platelets. They are the most potent antiplateletagents, approximately 9 times more potent than aspirin, and 3 times morepotent than the thienopyridines. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are alsothe most expensive antiplatelet agents. The currently FDA-approved glycoproteinIIb/IIIa inhibitors have to be given intravenously. They usually are given alongwith aspirin and ''heparin''. They are quick acting; their maximal antiplateleteffects are achieved within minutes of infusion. These inhibitors have becomeimportant in the treatment of patients with heart attacks, patients withunstable angina, and patients undergoing PTCA with or without stenting. Numerousstudies have shown that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors:''The major risk of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is bleeding. Therefore,patients on heparin, aspirin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have to bemonitored closely for bleeding. Recent studies have demonstrated equal efficacyof abciximab and eptifibatide. Eptifibatide is shorter acting than abciximab. Inthe event of major bleeding, the antiplatelet effect of eptifibatide can bereversed within hours of stopping the intravenous infusion, while theantiplatelet effect of abciximab will last much longer. Sometimes, transfusionsof platelets are necessary to treat major bleeding due to abciximab.'' An uncommon side effect of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors isthe development of low platelet counts (''thrombocytopenia''). Thrombocytopeniacan increase the risk for bleeding and, in rare instances, may actually cause blood toclot. Thus, patients receiving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors should havetheir platelet counts monitored closely.' Decrease the size of the blood clot blocking the 
  coronary arteries, thus improving blood flow, limiting damage to heart muscle, 
  and improving survival among patients with heart attacks Decrease the incidence of heart attacks and improve 
  survival among patients with unstable angina Prevent the formation of blood clots inside coronary stents and in
coronary arteries unblocked by PTCA, thus decreasing the incidence of heart
attacks and improving survival, specifically, when given intravenously at the time of PTCA and
stenting and followed by oral aspirin and clopidogrel"
Anticoagulants,"'Coagulants (clotting factors) are proteins produced by the ''liver''. Clottingfactors are responsible for ""cementing"" clumps of platelets together to forma stronger and larger clot. ''Anticoagulants'' such as intravenous or subcutaneousheparin, subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, and oral ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), prevent the formation of blood clots either by inhibiting theproduction of clotting factors or by interfering with the action of the clottingfactors.''Heparin'' prevents the formation and growth of blood clots by inhibiting the action of clotting factors thatcement the clumps of platelets together. Heparin is given either intravenouslyor as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.''Heparin commonly is given intravenously, usually with aspirin, antiplateletagents, or fibrinolytic (clot-dissolving) medications for treating heart attacks. Intravenous heparinis given (usually with aspirin or an antiplatelet agent) to patients with heartattacks who are undergoing PTCA with or without stenting. Heparin also is givento patients who are at risk of developing blood clots within the chambers (atriaand ventricles) of the heart. (For example, patients with ''atrial fibrillation'"" can develop blood clots in the atria.  Patients with large heart attacks and majordamage to the heart muscle also can develop blood clots in the ventricles.)Heparin's anticoagulant effect is fast acting (beginning shortly after thestart of the infusion) and dose-related (greater with higher doses). Theduration of heparin treatment for heart attacks is approximately 48 hours.""""Heparin's major side effect is bleeding, and themost serious bleeding complication is intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain).The risk of bleeding is higher with higher doses. Thus, patientsreceiving heparin will undergo frequent blood testing to measure APPT levels. The APPTlevel is a measure of the degree of anticoagulation. The goal is tokeep the patient's APPT level in a safe range and to avoid abnormally highAPPT levels that signify excessive anticoagulation and a greater risk ofbleeding. If there is bleeding, heparin has the advantage of having a short durationof action and its anticoagulant effects disappear rapidlyafter stopping the intravenous infusion.""'Low molecular weight heparins'' such as ''enoxaparin''      (''Lovenox'') and dalteparin (''Fragmin''),are sub-fractions of heparin with longer-lasting effects than heparin.  They can be given every12 to 24 hours as subcutaneous injections (like ''insulin''). Studies have shownenoxaparin and dalteparin to be equivalent to intravenous heparin in patients withmany conditions such as heart attacks, unstable angina, and blood clots in theveins or arteries of the ''lungs''. The effects of low molecular weight heparinsgenerally wear off after 6 to 12 hours. They are not used in place of intravenous heparin inpatients undergoing PTCA or stenting.''Warfarin '""(Coumadin) prevents the formation of blood clots by inhibiting the production of clotting factors by theliver. Warfarin must be taken orally and is slow acting; it cantake days to achieve an adequate anticoagulant effect. Warfarin's anticoagulant effect is dose-related, thatis, its effect is greater with larger doses.""'Because of its slow onset of action, Coumadin is not commonly used immediately for the treatmentof heart attacks. Instead, it is used orally on a long-term basis in selectedpatients after heart attacks to prevent blood clots. For example, patients with''atrial fibrillation'' or patients with major damage to ventricular muscle willtake warfarin daily on a long-term basis to prevent blood clots inthe atria and ventricles, respectively. Warfarin also is commonly used to prevent bloodclots in veins of the legs in patients who are likely to develop them.''The risk with warfarin is abnormal bleeding, and the risk of bleeding is higher with higher doses.Thus, patients on warfarin should have their blood tested frequently (oftenweekly) to measure their prothrombin time and INR. Like APPT, the prothrombintime and INR measure the degree of anticoagulation. The goal of treatmentis to keep the prothrombin time and INR in a safe range, avoiding excessivelyhigh prothrombin time and INR levels that indicate too much anticoagulation anda greater risk of bleeding. The effects of warfarin may be increased ordecreased greatly by many other medications or foods, and it is crucial to reviewthese medications and foods with the doctor.''Warfarin has a long duration of action, and its anticoagulation effect can last several days after it isstopped. Therefore, transfusions of clotting factors and/or ''vitamin K'' (to stimulate theliver to produce the clotting factors depleted by treatment with warfarin) must begiven to reverse the anticoagulation in the event of serious bleeding.''Direct ''thrombin inhibitors'' are newer oral anticoagulants that have recently been introduced, such as ''rivaroxaban'' (''Xarelto'"") and dabigatran (Pradaxa), which don't require the monitoring and dietary restrictions of warfarin, and their role is under investigation."" "
Clot-dissolving drugs,"'While antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants prevent the formation of bloodclots, they cannot dissolve existing blood clots and hence cannot be relied uponto open blocked arteries rapidly. Clot-dissolving ''drugs'' (also calledfibrinolytic or thrombolytic medications) actually dissolve blood clots and canrapidly open blocked arteries. Intravenous administration of clot-dissolvingdrugs such as tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) or TNK can open up to 80% ofacutely blocked coronary arteries. The earlier these drugs are administered, thegreater the success at opening the artery and the more effective thepreservation of heart muscle. If clot-dissolving drugs are given too late (morethan 6 hours after the onset of the heart attack), most of the muscle damagealready may have occurred.''If a hospital does not have a catheterization laboratory with the ability toperform PTCA, or if there are logistic reasons why PTCA will be delayed,clot-dissolving drugs can be promptly administered to achieve reperfusion. PTCAthen may be performed in patients who fail to respond to the clot-dissolvingdrugs. (If prompt PTCA and stenting are available, it has been demonstrated thatthey are preferable to clot-dissolving drugs to open arteries.)''Clot-dissolving drugs increase the risk of bleeding enough so that some patients cannot betreated with them, for example, patients with recent surgery or major ''trauma'',recent ''stroke'', bleeding ulcer, or other conditions that increases the risk ofbleeding.' "
Coronary angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA),"'\tCoronary ''angiography'' and percutaneous transluminal coronary ''angioplasty'' (PTCA) is the most direct method of opening a blocked coronary artery. The procedures are performed in the catheterization laboratory in a hospital. Under X-ray guidance, a tiny ''plastic'' catheter with a balloon on its end is advanced over a guide wire from a vein in the groin or the arm and into the blocked coronary artery. Once the balloon reaches the blockage, it is inflated, pushing the clot and plaque out of the way to open the artery. PTCA can be effective in opening up to 95% of arteries. In addition, the ''angiogram'' (X-ray pictures taken of the coronary arteries) allows evaluation of the status of the other coronary arteries so that long-term treatment plans may be formulated.'""\tFor optimal benefits, coronary angiography and PTCA should be performed as soon as possible. Most cardiologists recommend that the time interval between the patient's arrival at the hospital and the deployment of the angioplasty balloon to open the artery should be less than 60 to 90 minutes.""'\tFor best results, the ''coronary angiogram'' and PTCA should be performed by an experienced cardiologist in a well-equipped ''cardiac catheterization'' laboratory. The cardiologist is considered experienced if he or she performs more than 75 such procedures a year. The catheterization laboratory personnel are considered experienced if the facility performs more than 200 such procedures a year.''\tIt also is important that there be a surgical team to perform immediate open-heart surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting) in the event that PTCA is unsuccessful in opening the blocked artery or if there is a serious complication of PTCA. For example, in a small number of patients, PTCA cannot be performed because of technical difficulties in passing the guide wire or the balloon across the narrowed arterial segment. Open-heart surgery also will be necessary if there is a serious complication such as coronary artery injury during PTCA or an abrupt closure of the coronary artery shortly after PTCA. These complications may occur in a small percentage of patients.''\tThe most serious complication of PTCA is an abrupt closure of the coronary artery within the first few hours after PTCA. Abrupt coronary artery closure (that can lead to further heart damage) occurs in some patients after simple ''balloon angioplasty'' (without stenting). Abrupt closure is due to a combination of tearing (dissection) of the inner lining of the artery, blood clotting at the site of the balloon, and constriction (spasm) or elastic recoil of the artery at the site where the balloon is inflated. Individuals at an increased risk for abrupt closure include women, patients with unstable angina, and patients having heart attacks.''\tThe risk of abrupt closure of the coronary arteries can be reduced if:'   
		Aspirin is given during or after PTCA to prevent blood clotting. In fact, virtually all patients are maintained on aspirin indefinitely after PTCA to prevent arterial clots. 
		Anticoagulants such as intravenous heparin or bivalirudin are given during PTCA to further prevent blood clotting. 
		Combinations of nitrates and calcium channel blockers are used to minimize coronary artery spasm (see discussion that follows). 
		Coronary artery stents are deployed to minimize coronary artery closure. 
		The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are given."
Coronary artery stents,"'\tCoronary artery stents are small hollow cylinders that can be deployed over the angioplasty balloons and left within the coronary arteries to keep the arteries open. Stents help prevent abrupt closure of arteries shortly after PTCA. They also prevent restenosis (recurrent narrowing of the arteries) several months after PTCA.''\tCoronary stents decrease the risks of arterial dissections, elastic recoil, and artery spasm that can occur after PTCA and cause re-occlusion of the artery. Studies have shown that the incidence of abrupt coronary artery closure after PTCA has declined dramatically with the introduction of coronary stents.''\tCoronary stents also help to keep the coronary arteries open in the longer-term. After a successful PTCA, a significant percentage of patients will develop recurrent narrowing (restenosis) at the site of inflation of the balloon, usually within 6 months following PTCA. Restenosis may or may not be accompanied by symptoms such as angina. Thus, restenosis often is detected by  ''exercise'' ''stress'' tests performed 4 to 6 months after PTCA. The widespread use of coronary stents has reduced this incidence of restenosis. The introduction of coated stents (stents that are coated with chemicals to further reduce restenosis) has reduced the incidence of restenosis to well under 10% and has been a major improvement in treatment.''\tPatients with coronary artery stents usually are maintained on full doses of daily aspirin. For the first 4 to 12 weeks after the placement of stents, patients are given an additional antiplatelet drug such as clopidogrel or prasugrel because the metal surface of the stents may promote the formation of blood clots in the first several weeks after the ''stent'' is inserted. With medicated stents, aspirin and clopidogrel or prasugrel are continued for a year or longer.' "
Nitrates,"'Nitroglycerin'' is the most common nitrate used in the treatment of heart attacks. Itcan be given sublingually (under the tongue), as a spray, as a paste appliedover skin, and intravenously. Intravenous nitroglycerine has a rapid onsetof action and is commonly used in the initial (first 48 hours) treatment ofheart attacks. Nitroglycerine is a vasodilator (blood vessel expander), that opensarteries by relaxing the muscular wall of the artery. Nitroglycerine dilatescoronary arteries as well as other blood vessels throughout the body. By dilatingblood vessels, nitroglycerine lowers ''blood pressure'', decreases the workthat the heart must do to pump blood, lowers the demand by the heart for oxygen, preventscoronary artery spasm, improves blood flow to the heart muscle, and potentiallyminimizes the size of the heart attack. Nitroglycerine is especially helpful inpatients with heart attacks who also have heart failure or ''high blood pressure''.''The common side effects of nitrates are ''headaches'' and ''low blood pressure''. Lowblood pressure can cause ''weakness'', ''dizziness'', and, sometimes, even ''fainting''.Nitrates should not be given in patients who have taken medicines for erectiledysfunction such as ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra'') and ''vardenafil''   (''Levitra'') in thepreceding 24 hours, since severe ''low blood pressure'' may result. Nitrates shouldnot be given in patients who have taken ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis'') in  the preceding 36 to 48 hoursbecause the effects of Cialis last longer than either ''sildenafil'' or vardenafil.' "
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,"'Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, another class of blood vessel dilators,often are given orally after a large heart attack to improve the healing ofheart muscle. Examples of ''ACE inhibitors'' include ''captopril'' (''Capoten''), ''enalapril'' (''Vasotec''), ''lisinopril'' (''Zestril'' and ''Prinivil''), and ''ramipril'' (''Altace''). Thesemedications lower the blood pressure and reduce the workload of the heart,thereby helping the damaged heart muscle to recover. They are especially helpfulin patients who have recovered from heart attacks but have ''high blood pressure'',heart failure, major damage to the ''left ventricle'', and ''diabetes mellitus''. For additional information, please see the ACE Inhibitors article.' "
Beta blockers,"'Beta blockers'' such as ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ''metoprolol'' (''Lopressor'', ToprolXL), and ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin'') usually are given early during a heart attack and are continuedlong-term. Beta blockers antagonize the action of adrenaline and relieve ''stress''on the muscles of the heart. Beta blockers decrease the workload ofthe heart by slowing the heart rate and decreasing the force of contraction ofheart muscle. Decreasing the workload decreases the demand for oxygen bythe heart and limits the amount of damage to the heart muscle. Long-term administration ofbeta blockers following a heart attack has been shown to improvesurvival and reduce the risk of future heart attacks. Beta blockers also improve survivalamong patients with heart attacks by decreasing the incidence oflife-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, for example, ventricular ''fibrillation''.Beta blockers can be given intravenously in the hospital and then can be takenorally for long-term treatment.''The side effects of beta blockers are ''wheezing'' (worsening of ''breathing'' in patients with  ''asthma''), abnormally slow heart rate,and exacerbation of heart failure (especially in patients with significantdamage to their heart muscle); however, in patients with chronic heart failure,beta blockers have recently been demonstrated to be helpful in decreasingsymptoms and prolonging life. For more, please read theBeta Blockers article.' "
Oxygen,'Oxygen also is commonly administered during the acute phase of a heartattack as are narcotics such as morphine; these agents aid in the reduction ofdiscomfort and actually help minimize the amount of heart damage.' 
Coronary artery bypass,"'In some patients, PTCA can be technically difficult or dangerous to perform.In others, PTCA and clot-dissolving medications may fail to achieve reperfusionor maintain open arteries. These patients may be considered for coronary arterybypass grafting surgery. For more information, please see the  Coronary ArteryBypass Graft article.' "
What can a patient expect during recovery from a heart attack?,"'Heart attack patients are monitored in the hospital for 3 or more daysprior to discharge home. Rhythm disturbances, ''shortness of breath'' due to heartfailure, or recurrent chest ''pain'' are reasons for further therapy such as balloonangioplasty or coronary stenting, additional medications, or bypass surgery.''Patients gradually increase their activity under observation. Beforedischarge, a low-level ''exercise stress test'' may be performed to detect importantresidual narrowing in the coronary arteries, exercise-induced cardiac rhythmabnormalities, and heart muscle failure, and to help guide the doctor inprescribing an activity regimen after hospitalization. An abnormal stress testprior to hospital discharge following a heart attack predicts a high risk forsubsequent cardiac events; if the patient has not yet had a coronary angiogram,an abnormal pre-discharge stress test is a strong reason for doing angiography.Since most patients usually receive angiography early, the use of pre-dischargestress testing has declined.''Before resuming full activity or work, several weeks may be needed for the heart muscle to heal. ''After a small heart attack'' (little damage to heart muscle), patients usually can resume normal activities after 2 weeks. These activities include returning to work as well as normal sexual activity. ''A moderate heart attack'' (moderate damage to heart muscle) requires limited, gradually increasing activity for up to 4 weeks, ''while a large heart attack ''(much damage to heart muscle) may result in a recovery period of 6 weeks orlonger. These time frames are necessary in order for the dead heart muscle tosubstantially complete the scarring process. During this healing period,patients should avoid vigorous exertion and heavy lifting (over 20 pounds) orany strenuous activity that causes shortness of breath or undue ''fatigue''.''Cardiac rehabilitation typically begins during hospitalization and continuesduring the months following a heart attack. Cardiac rehabilitation programsprovide a helpful transition to a safe and full return to a normal lifestyle. Inaddition, cardiac rehabilitation allows the prescription of a long-term exerciseprogram tailored to each patient and helps patients and their families adjust tolifestyle changes and the difficult and conflicting emotions that often follow aheart attack.' "
How can a second heart attack be prevented?,"  
		Take aspirin and beta blockers (propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol) that have been shown to reduce the chances of a second heart attack and improve survival. 
		Stop smoking cigarettes. 
		Reduce excess weight and exercise regularly. 
		Control blood pressure and diabetes. 
		Follow a diet that is low in cholesterol (less than 200 mg daily) and saturated fat (less than 7% of total calories). For more, please see the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) Daily Food Guide, Eating Heart Healthy. 
		Reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol and increase HDL (good) cholesterol. Reduction of LDL cholesterol to a value below 80 mg/dl, particularly with the statin group of medications, has been demonstrated to prevent further heart attacks. Patients with low HDL (less than 35 mg/dl) are encouraged to exercise regularly and to take medications to increase HDL. For more in-depth information about cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, please see the  Cholesterol article. 
		Take ACE inhibitors that aid the healing process and improve long-term survival in selected patients, particularly those with major damage to heart muscle. 
		Eat a diet rich in omega-3-fatty acids by eating more fish or take fish oil supplements. (See the fish oil article). High intake of omega-3-fatty acids decreases the risk of sudden death from heart attacks. 
		Undergo further testing. In the months following a heart attack, further cardiac stress testing, with or without nuclear or echocardiographic imaging, may be prescribed to determine if additional therapy will be necessary to prevent future heart attacks. In addition, special testing may be required to evaluate the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias. All such testing should be discussed with the doctor."
Facts you should know about heart attacks and heartburn,"'This comparison of differences between ''heartburn'' and ''heart attack'' are not 100% specific, and only serve to help you differentiate the two conditions to some extent. ''If there is any ''confusion'' or doubt about if you or someone you are with is having ''heartburn'' or a ''heart attack'', you call 911 or go to an emergency department immediately.'  Heartburn is a symptom of another condition, for example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and usually is caused by stomach acid that causes irritation of the esophagus. Heart attack usually is caused by coronary artery blockage or heart disease. Heartburn symptoms often occur after eating a heavy meal, or at night. Heart attack can occur at any time. Heartburn pain may begin at the breastbone and travel up toward the throat. You may feel food coming back into the mouth, and have an acidic or bitter taste in your throat along with increased severity pain if you bend over. Warning signs of a heart attack often is pain in the chest that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms. The person can develop a cold sweat, dizziness, shortness of breath, and possibly nausea and vomiting. These symptoms infrequently or rarely occur with heartburn. Heartburn pain usually responds quickly to antacids and/or belching, whereas heart attack pain usually does not respond to oral antacids. Heart attacks require other medications and/or treatments. Most people that suffer from heartburn pain have discomfort, but the problem is seldom life threatening. In stark contrast, heart attacks always are considered medical emergencies and need immediate attention, as many heart attacks are life threatening."
What is heartburn? What is a heart attack?,"'Heartburn (''acid reflux'') is a symptom, and usually feels like a burning sensation in the chest, under the sternum, and in the ''esophagus'' that can extend to the neck, throat, and/or face. Heartburn often is caused by a malfunction in the esophageal sphincter muscle (a muscular valve located between the stomach and the esophagus), which causes regurgitation (reverse flow) of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.''Heartburn is a misnomer because it does not involve the heart. Other names for heartburn include ''indigestion'', ''dyspepsia'', ''acid reflux'', ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''), pyrolysis, and even ""cardialgia.""''A heart attack often is a sudden and sometimes fatal occurrence of coronary thrombosis (coronary artery blockage) that frequently produces ''chest pain'' and/or additional pain that may radiate to the neck, jaw, and/or arms. ''Heart attacks'' involve the heart and not the esophagus or acid regurgitation.''Because the esophagus and heart are located near each other, many people consider pain in that region as a sign of either heartburn or a heart attack. However, individuals may often not know how to tell heartburn from a heart attack.' "
Are there similarities among the signs and symptoms of heart attack and heartburn?,"'A person can have these symptoms with either heartburn or a heart attack. Since the symptoms are so similar, it often makes it difficult for some people to tell if they are having heartburn or a heart attack.' Chest pain (may or may not rise toward the throat and/or spread to the shoulders, neck, jaw and/or arms). The pain may linger or subside. Nausea Upset stomach"
What are the differences between the signs and symptoms of heart attack and heartburn?,"'Although most of the early signs and symptoms can be the same for heartburn and heart attack, a few are different. A heart attack most often causes signs and symptoms that include:''Although heartburn may produce some less severe symptoms, heartburn is rarely life threatening. In contrast, ''heart attacks'' are frequently life threatening. I''f there is any doubt in your mind as to whether you or someone you are with has symptoms indicating heartburn or heart attack, you should call 911 immediately to be transported to an emergency department for medical treatment.'   Shortness of breath (may be severe) Diaphoretic (sweating or a “cold sweat” – produced by fear, anxiety or illness) Increasing chest pain or sudden, severe and unrelenting chest pain Evolving EKG changes Nausea and vomiting Unusual weakness or fatigue Persistent and/or increasing severity of symptoms over minutes"
How do doctors diagnose a heart attack and heartburn?,"'Most people with heartburn are diagnosed by their symptoms that they describe to their primary care doctor. However, definitive diagnosis of heartburn may be made by ''endoscopy'' and pH probe data, which is frequently done by gastroenterologists. However, it is common practice for doctors to rule out heart attack or any other pending cardiac problem to make sure the individual is not suffering from a potentially life-threatening problem.''The two main tests to diagnose heart attack are an ''EKG'' (''electrocardiogram'') and a test to determine the level of certain enzymes in the blood (troponins). Additional tests for a heart attack (or evidence for a potential heart attack) can be done by ''echocardiogram'', chest ''X-rays'', coronary catheterization (''angiogram''), and ''exercise'' ''stress'' tests.' "
How do heart attack and heartburn treatment options differ?,"'The treatment for heartburn is varies with the severity of the disease that causes heartburn. Some people can treat heartburn with ''diet'' modifications, for example, avoiding acid causing foods such as ''chocolate'', ''caffeine'', spicy foods, carbonated ''drinks'' and citrus.''People with mild heartburn may only need only antacids ''over-the-counter'' occasionally, for example, ''Tums'' or Rolaids to relieve heartburn symptoms.''Moderate to more severe heartburn disease may require histamine receptor antagonists (H2 blockers like ''Pepcid'' or ''Zantac''), protein pump inhibitors (''PPIs'') that reduce stomach acid production, for example, ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium'') or ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), or even surgery (''fundoplication'').''The treatment for a heart attack may vary somewhat from patient to patient, depending upon the extent or severity of the attack. In general, however, a heart attack is treated in either the emergency department and/or the hospital intensive care unit, ''cardiac catheterization'' unit, or a telemetry unit. Since a heart attack may be due to complete or partial coronary artery blockage, the treatments may vary, and may overlap depending on your cardiologist’s decision.' "
Is it possible to prevent a heart attack or heartburn?,"'There is a good possibility that both heartburn or a heart attack can be reduced or prevented. A balanced ''diet'' along with ''exercise'' is key to preventing for both heartburn and or heart attack. In addition to treating the underlying cause of heartburn, there are life style changes and natural home remedies that may help prevent it.''The chances of reducing or stopping recurrent or initial ''heart attacks'' may be prevented by lifestyle changes, for example:' Eat small, more frequent meals. Do not eat about three hours before bedtime. Elevate the head of your bed by about 6 inches. Do not eat or drink foods that are acidic or trigger acid development in the stomach. If you are obese, lose weight. Stop smoking and/or drinking alcohol. Try to take your heartburn medication at the same time each day. Stop smoking. Eat a balanced diet and exercise. Reduce stress by doing yoga, meditation and/or increase relaxation. Keep your blood pressure in the normal range. Take appropriate medication to treat other medical problems such as diabetes. If you are obese, lose weight. Keep your cholesterol levels within the normal ranges."
What is the prognosis for a heart attack and heartburn?,"'The prognosis for the majority of people with heartburn is good to excellent if they try to prevent any future problems. Severe heartburn has a reduced prognosis as it can lead to esophageal damage, Barrett’s esophagus, and/or inability to swallow due to stricture formation.''The prognosis of a heart attack may be good to fair if treated immediately; however, the prognosis decreases if a large amount of heart muscle is damaged or destroyed during a heart attack. Complications of heart attacks include irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias), heart valve damage, ''heart failure'', additional heart attacks, and/or sudden death.''Complications occur more frequently after a person survives a heart attack. Complications occur less frequently after heartburn.' "
What is a heart attack? What is a stroke? Are they the same?,"'Heart attack occurs when sudden damage and/or death occurs to a portion of the heart muscle. The damage to the heart muscle usually is caused by a blocked coronary artery, which then prevents oxygen from getting to the muscle tissue of the heart. Heart attack is the most common cause of death in the US''Arrhythmias (an abnormal heart beat) also can cause a heart attack. Examples of life-threatening arrhythmias include ventricular ''fibrillation'' and ''sudden cardiac arrest'', in which the person will die within a few minutes.''Heart attacks'' can result in permanent heart muscle damage. If the extent of the heart muscle damage is large, the person may die.\xa0''A ''stroke'' occurs when brain tissue becomes deprived of oxygen, leading to damage or death of the brain tissue in the region affected by the ''stroke''. The most frequent cause of a stroke is clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain (ischemic stroke).''Hemorrhagic stroke (leakage or rupture of a blood vessel within the brain) is a less common cause of stroke.''Strokes'' can result in permanent brain tissue damage and/or death. If the extent of brain tissue damage is large, the person may die. It is the fifth most common cause of death in the US.''Heart attack and stroke are medical emergencies.''A ''transient ischemic attack'' (''TIA'', ''mini-stroke'') occurs when there is a temporary blockage of a blood vessel in the brain, producing symptoms similar to a stroke. However, during a transient ischemic attack, the ''stroke symptoms'' resolve completely within a short period of time after the clot blocking the vessel breaks apart, and thus does not produce any permanent damage or lasting effects. Transient ischemic attacks often are a warning sign of an imminent full-blown stroke, and thus require immediate medical treatment.' "
"Heart attack vs. stroke, which is worse?","'You do not want to have a heart attack or stroke because both can lead to disability or death. In terms of mortality statistics, ''heart attacks'' are more common since they are the leading cause of death in the US, while strokes are the fifth leading cause of death.''However, individuals may have more difficulty afterwards if they survive a stroke than if they survive a heart attack, though this will depend on how much brain tissue is damaged after the stroke. For example, a stroke can cause profound life-altering disabilities, such as losing the ability to communicate verbally or to use certain parts of your body (for example, your right arm and right leg). If you fear permanent disability worse than death, you may think that a stroke is worse than a heart attack.' "
How can you tell if a person is having a heart attack or stroke (differences)?,"'The warning signs of heart attack and stroke are not the same.''The classic warning symptoms and signs of a heart attack in men and women may include:''Recognition of ''stroke symptoms'' is vital for emergency treatment.''The acronym ''“''FAST''”'' stands for recognition of:''If you or someone you are with experiences the symptoms (FAST) call contact 911 immediately.''Other classic warning symptoms and/or signs of a stroke may include:'  Chest pain or chest discomfort (pressure, squeezing, fullness) that may come and go Pain or discomfort that may radiate to the shoulders, arms, back, abdomen, jaw, or teeth Shortness of breath Sweating Lightheadedness or fainting Nausea and vomiting Facial drooping Arm weakness Speech difficulty Time for action Numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, usually affecting only one side of the body Difficulty speaking or understanding speech Confusion or loss of consciousness Difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes Sudden severe headache"
What signs and symptoms heart attack and stroke are the same?,"'Heart attacks'' and strokes are similar in that they both:''Neurologists that treat people who have had a stroke consider a stroke just as important as a heart attack because of the similarities between these two life-threatening conditions. Many neurologists refer to a stroke as a ""brain attack.""' Usually have a sudden onset Are caused by disruptions in the flow of oxygen-rich blood Produce signs and symptoms suddenly Can cause debilitating symptoms and health problems that may or may not improve over time Can be disabling Should be treated immediately in an emergency department Can cause death if enough of the person's brain or heart tissue is damaged"
Are the signs and symptoms of heart attack or stroke different in women?,"'In addition to the classic symptoms of heart attack symptoms, women may have somewhat different signs and symptoms that may include:''In addition to the classic signs and symptoms of a stroke, women may also experience other symptoms such as:''Some women may have a mixture of the classic and less common signs and ''symptoms of stroke'' or heart attack.'  Abdominal pain (discomfort or pain feels like heartburn or indigestion) Dizziness Moderate to severe fatigue Clammy skin Shortness of breath Disorientation General weakness Agitation Nausea/vomiting Behavioral changes and/or hallucinations Seizures Hiccups"
What are the risk factors of heart attack vs. stroke?,"'Heart attacks and strokes (ischemic strokes) are caused by ''blood clots'' (thrombosis). These two conditions share essentially the same risk factors, which include:' Family history Smoking High cholesterol levels Hypertension (high blood pressure) Obesity Diabetes Stress Physical inactivity"
What is the treatment for heart attack vs. stroke?,"'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation'' (CPR) is the initial emergency treatment for heart attacks if the patient person has no pulse and/or if an available ''defibrillator'' is ineffective in restoring a pulse. Clot busting medications that can help open blocked arteries or ''angioplasty'' and ''stent'' placement to open a blocked artery are potential initial treatments available for a heart attack.''If a person with heart attack symptoms is able to swallow, many doctors will recommend initial treatment of four chewable 81 mg “baby ''aspirin''” (do not use aspirin that are coated or labeled as extended release). Some patients may require emergency ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting (surgery that removes segments of blocked heart arteries and replaces them with open vessels taken from other areas of the body).''There are two major types of stroke, with the majority due to a blocked artery in the neck or brain. About 15% of strokes are due to either leakage or rupture of a ''brain aneurysm'', which leads to bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). Unfortunately, both types of stroke can have the same initial symptoms. Emergency medical treatment depends on which type of stroke you or another person is having.''Time to diagnose the type of stroke is critical to treatment since each type of stroke requires different treatment and is time-dependent. It is critical for 911 personnel and the emergency department medical personnel to know the time that the symptoms of stroke first developed or were noticed, as this can determine the treatment options. In contrast to heart attacks, do not give aspirin to a person having a stroke, as aspirin could make the stroke worse if it is hemorrhagic.''Upon arrival to the hospital, a ''CT scan'' of the head will be immediately ordered to image the brain and determine the cause of the stroke symptoms. If the CT scan indicates an ischemic stroke, and if the patient’s stroke symptoms started within 4.5 hours of when they are evaluated, then the treatment can be similar to that of heart attacks (a clot dissolving medication may be administered) if there are no contraindications.''In certain cases, individuals with certain types of ischemic strokes may be candidates for procedures to open up the blocked artery, even if they are outside this time-window. Ultimately, the treatment decisions generally are made with the input from various specialists (neurologist, emergency physician, interventional radiologist) and the treatment options may vary depending on many different factors.''Hemorrhagic strokes can be difficult to treat. Medical treatment includes tightly controlling ''blood pressure'', stopping medications that may increase the bleeding, and monitoring/controlling the pressure inside the brain with surgical placement of a drain to remove blood. A decompressive craniotomy (opening up the skull to relieve the pressure and/or remove blood from around the brain) is an emergency surgery procedure that also may be considered by a neurosurgeon. Other surgical procedures may be undertaken to clamp or seal up a ruptured/leaking ''aneurysm'' or damaged vessel.''Patients with severe heart attacks or severe strokes may require assisted ventilation (life-support).' "
What is the prognosis for heart attack vs. stroke?,"'If you survive the initial event, the prognosis for heart attacks and strokes is highly variable. Some individuals may recover fully and lead normal lives, whereas other individuals may suffer severe permanent disability and require lifelong care. The prognosis depends on the severity of the person’s initial stroke or heart attack, whether they are able to seek medical treatment in a timely manner, their underlying health and medical problems, and the effectiveness of the treatment options available to the them when they are evaluated. The elderly individuals with chronic medical illnesses (such as ''COPD'', ''diabetes'' or ''cancer'', for example) often have worse outcomes.''The prognosis for heart attacks is somewhat worse than strokes, as heart attacks are the leading cause of death in the US.' "
How can heart attack and stroke be prevented?,"'Because heart attacks and strokes have many of the same risk factors, the measures to reduce the risk of these two diseases are the same.''Various lifestyle modifications can decrease the risk of developing a heart attack or stroke. No matter what your age, you can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by engaging in a regular ''exercise'' program and by eating a well-balanced healthy ''diet''. A low-fat ''diet'' with plenty of vegetables and fruit, in addition to moderate ''exercise'' several days a week is recommended.''Other things you can do to prevent a heart attack or stroke include:''For certain individuals, taking the above measures can also help decrease their risk of developing ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'' and ''high cholesterol'', which are all risk factors for having a heart attack or stroke. However, if you are diagnosed with ''high blood pressure'', diabetes, or ''high cholesterol'', and you are prescribed medications to help manage these conditions, it is very important to take these medications as instructed to better control these chronic illnesses. Regular check-ups with your doctor or other healthcare professional also are important to monitor and manage these conditions.' Stop smoking Limit your alcohol intake Reduce stress"
What is coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery?,"'According to the American Heart Association, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries are among the most commonly performed major operations.'   CABG surgery is advised for selected groups of patients with significant narrowings and blockages of the heart arteries (coronary artery disease). CABG surgery creates new routes around narrowed and blocked arteries, allowing sufficient blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle."
What causes a coronary artery disease?,"'Coronary artery disease (''CAD'') occurs when ''atherosclerotic'' plaque (hardening of the arteries) builds up in the wall of the arteries that supply the heart.''The atherosclerotic process causes significant narrowing in one or more coronary arteries. When coronary arteries narrow more than 50 to 70%, the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand during ''exercise''. The heart muscle in the territory of these arteries becomes starved of oxygen (ischemic).''When a ''blood clot'' (thrombus) forms on top of this plaque, the artery becomes completely blocked causing a heart attack.'""When arteries are narrowed in excess of 90 to 99%, patients often have accelerated angina or angina at rest (unstable angina). Unstable angina can also occur due to intermittent blockage of an artery by a thrombus that eventually is dissolved by the body's own protective clot-dissolving system.""   This plaque is primarily made of cholesterol. Plaque accumulation can be accelerated by smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, and diabetes. Patients are also at higher risk for plaque development if they are older (greater than 45 years for men and 55 years for women), or if they have a positive family history for early heart artery disease. Patients often experience chest pain (angina) when the blood oxygen supply cannot keep up with demand. Up to 25% of patients experience no chest pain at all despite documented lack of adequate blood and oxygen supply. These patients have ""silent"" angina, and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina."
How is coronary artery disease diagnosed?,"'The resting ''electrocardiogram'' (EKG) is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, and can demonstrate signs of oxygen starvation of the heart (ischemia) or heart attack.''If the stress tests do not reveal the diagnosis, greater accuracy can be achieved by adding a nuclear agent (''thallium'' or Cardiolite) intravenously during stress tests. Addition of the nuclear imaging agent allows imaging of the blood flow to different regions of the heart, using an external camera. An area of the heart with reduced blood flow during exercise, but normal blood flow at rest, signifies significant artery narrowing in that region.''Combining echocardiography (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart muscle) with exercise stress testing (stress echocardiography) is also a very accurate technique to detect CAD. When a significant blockage exists, the heart muscle supplied by this artery does not contract as well as the rest of the heart muscle. Stress echocardiography and nuclear stress tests are both at least 80% to 85% accurate in detecting significant coronary artery disease.''When a patient cannot undergo ''exercise stress test'' because of nervous system or joint problems, medications can be injected intravenously to simulate the stress on the heart due to exercise and imaging can be performed with a nuclear camera or ultrasound.''Cardiac catheterization'' with ''angiography'' (coronary arteriography) is the most accurate test to detect coronary artery narrowing. Small hollow ''plastic'' tubes (catheters) are advanced under X-ray guidance to the openings of the two main heart arteries (left and right). ''Iodine'' contrast, ""dye,"" is then injected into the arteries while an X-ray video is recorded.''A newer modality, high speed CT scanning angiography has recently become available. This procedure uses powerful X-ray methods to visualize the arteries to the heart. Its role in the evaluation of CAD is currently being evaluated. For more, please read the CT Scanning Angiography article.' Often, the resting EKG is normal in patients with coronary artery disease and angina. Exercise treadmill tests are useful screening tests for patients with a moderate likelihood of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and a normal resting EKG. These stress tests are about 60 to 70% accurate in diagnosing significant CAD."
How is coronary artery disease (CAD) treated?,"'Medicines used to treat angina reduce the heart muscle demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply. Three commonly used classes of ''drugs'' are the ''nitrates'', ''beta blockers'' and calcium blockers.''Unstable angina is also treated with ''aspirin'' and the intravenous blood thinner ''heparin''. Aspirin prevents clumping of platelets, while heparin prevents blood clotting on the surface of plaques in a critically narrowed artery. When patients continue to have angina despite maximum medications, or when significant ischemia still occurs with exercise testing, coronary arteriography is usually indicated. Data collected during coronary arteriography help doctors decide whether the patient should be considered for ''percutaneous coronary intervention'', or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), whereby a small ''stent'' is used to open up the blockage.''Angioplasty'' can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients. Under X-ray guidance, a wire is advanced from the groin to the coronary artery. A small catheter with a balloon at the end is threaded over the wire to reach the narrowed segment. The balloon is then inflated to push the artery open, and a stent is inserted.' Nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid) is an example of a nitrate. Examples of beta blockers include propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol (Tenormin). Examples of calcium blockers include amlodopine and felodopine. CABG surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients who have failed medical therapy and are not good candidates for angioplasty (PCI). CABG surgery is ideal for patients with multiple narrowings in multiple coronary artery branches, such as is often seen in patients with diabetes. CABG surgery has been shown to improve long-term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery, and in patients with significant narrowing of multiple arteries, especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function."
How is CABG surgery done?,"'The CABG procedure\xa0steps are:''The most commonly used vessel for the bypass is the saphenous vein from the leg. Bypass grafting involves sewing the graft vessels to the coronary arteries beyond the narrowing or blockage. The other end of this vein is attached to the aorta. Chest wall arteries, particularly the left internal mammary artery, are now commonly used as bypass grafts. This artery is separated from the chest wall and usually connected to the left anterior descending artery and/or one of its major branches beyond the blockage.''The major advantage of using internal mammary arteries is that they tend to remain open longer than venous grafts. Ten years after CABG surgery, only 66% of vein grafts are open compared to 90% of internal mammary arteries. However, artery grafts are of limited length, and can only be used to bypass diseases located near the beginning (proximal) of the coronary arteries. Using internal mammary arteries may prolong CABG surgery because of the extra time needed to separate them from the chest wall. Therefore, internal mammary arteries may not be used for emergency CABG surgery when time is critical to restore coronary artery blood flow.''CABG surgery takes about four hours to complete.''The average length of stay in the hospital for CABG surgery has been reduced from as long as a week to only three to four days in most patients.''A new advance for many patients is the ability to do CABG without going on cardiopulmonary bypass (""off pump""), with the heart still beating. This may significantly minimize the occasional memory defects and other complications that may be seen after CABG, and is a significant advance.' The cardiac surgeon makes an incision down the middle of the chest and then saws through the breastbone (sternum). This procedure is called a median (middle) sternotomy (cutting of the sternum). The heart is cooled with iced salt water, while a preservative solution is injected into the heart arteries. This process minimizes damage caused by reduced blood flow during surgery and is referred to as ""cardioplegia."" Before bypass surgery can take place, a cardiopulmonary bypass must be established. Plastic tubes are placed in the right atrium to channel venous blood out of the body for passage through a plastic sheeting (membrane oxygenator) in the heart lung machine. The oxygenated blood is then returned to the body. The main aorta is clamped off (cross clamped) during CABG surgery to maintain a bloodless field and to allow bypasses to be connected to the aorta. The aorta is clamped off for about 60 minutes and the body is supported by cardiopulmonary bypass for about 90 minutes. The use of 3 (triple), 4 (quadruple), or 5 (quintuple) bypasses are now routine. At the end of surgery, the sternum is wired together with stainless steel and the chest incision is sewn closed. Plastic tubes (chest tubes) are left in place to allow drainage of any remaining blood from the space around the heart (mediastinum). About 5% of patients require exploration within the first 24 hours because of continued bleeding after surgery. Chest tubes are usually removed the day after surgery. The breathing tube is usually removed shortly after surgery. Patients usually get out of bed and are transferred out of intensive care the day after surgery. Up to 25% of patients develop heart rhythm disturbances within the first three or four days after CABG surgery. These rhythm disturbances are usually temporary atrial fibrillation, and are felt to be related to surgical trauma to the heart. Most of these arrhythmias respond to standard medical therapy that can be weaned one month after surgery. Many young patients can even be discharged home after two days."
How do patients recover after CABG surgery?,"'Sutures'' are removed from the chest prior to discharge and from the leg (if the saphenous vein is used) after 7 to 10 days. Even though smaller leg veins will take over the role of the saphenous vein, a certain degree of swelling (''edema'') in the affected ankle is common.''Exercise stress testing is routinely done four to six weeks after CABG surgery and signals the beginning of a cardiac rehabilitation program.'   Patients are advised to wear elastic support stockings during the day for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to keep their leg elevated when sitting. This swelling usually resolves after about six to eight weeks. Healing of the breastbone takes about six weeks and is the primary limitation in recovering from CABG surgery. Patients are advised not to lift anything more than 10 pounds or perform heavy exertion during this healing period. They are also advised not to drive for the first four weeks to avoid any injury to the chest. Patients can return to normal sexual activity as long as they minimize positions that put significant weight on the chest or upper arms. Return to work usually occurs after the six week recovery, but may be much sooner for non-strenuous employment. Rehabilitation consists of a 12 week program of gradually increasing monitored exercise lasting one hour three times a week. Patients are also counseled about the importance of lifestyle changes to lower their chance of developing further CAD. These includestopping smoking,reducing weight and dietary fat,controlling blood pressure and diabetes, andlowering blood cholesterol levels. stopping smoking, reducing weight and dietary fat, controlling blood pressure and diabetes, and lowering blood cholesterol levels."
What are the risks and complications of CABG surgery?,"'Overall mortality related to CABG is 3-4%. During and shortly after CABG surgery, ''heart attacks'' occur in 5 to 10% of patients and are the main cause of death. About 5% of patients require exploration because of bleeding. This second surgery increases the risk of chest infection and lung complications. ''Stroke'' occurs in 1-2%, primarily in elderly patients. Mortality and complications increase with:''Mortality may be higher in women, primarily due to their advanced age at the time of CABG surgery and smaller coronary arteries. Women develop coronary artery disease about 10 years later than men because of hormonal ""protection"" while they still regularly menstruate (although in women with risk factors for coronary artery disease, especially ''smoking'', elevated ''lipids'', and diabetes, the possibility for the development of coronary artery disease at a young age is very real). Women are generally of smaller stature than men, with smaller coronary arteries. These small arteries make CABG surgery technically more difficult and prolonged. The smaller vessels also decrease both short and long-term graft function.' age (older than 70 years),  poor heart muscle function,  disease obstructing the left main coronary artery,  diabetes,  chronic lung disease, and  chronic kidney failure. "
What are the long-term results after CABG surgery?,"'A very small percentage of vein grafts may become blocked within the first two weeks after CABG surgery due to blood clotting.''It has been shown that in CABG patients with elevated ''LDL cholesterol'' (bad cholesterol) levels, use of cholesterol-lowering medications (particularly the statin family of drugs) to lower LDL levels to below 80 will significantly improve long-term graft patency as well as improve survival benefit and heart attack risk.''Patients are also advised about the importance of lifestyle changes to lower their chance of developing further atherosclerosis in their coronary arteries. These include''Frequent monitoring of CABG patients with physiologic testing can identify early problems in grafts. PTCA (angioplasty) with stenting, in addition to aggressive risk factor modification, may significantly limit the need for repeat CABG years later. Repeat CABG surgery is occasionally necessary, but may have a higher risk of complication.' Blood clots form in the grafts usually because of small arteries beyond the insertion site of the graft causing sluggish blood run off. Another 10% of vein grafts close off between two weeks and one year after CABG surgery. Use of aspirin to thin the blood has been shown to reduce these later closings by 50%. Grafts become narrowed after the first five years as cells stick to the inner lining and multiply, causing formation of scar tissue (intimal fibrosis) and actual atherosclerosis. After 10 years, only 2/3 of vein grafts are open and 1/2 of these have at least moderate narrowings. Internal mammary grafts have a much higher (90%) 10 year rate of remaining open. This difference in longevity has caused a shift in surgical practices toward greater use of internal mammary and other arteries as opposed to veins for bypasses. stopping smoking, exercise, reducing weight and dietary fat, as well as controlling blood pressure and diabetes."
How do CABG surgery and angioplasty (PTCA) compare?,"'References: American Heart Association, ""Open-Heart Surgery Statistics""' Ongoing studies are comparing the treatment results of angioplasty (PTCA) versus bypass (CABG surgery) in patients who are candidates for either procedure. Both procedures are very effective in reducing angina symptoms, preventing heart attacks, and reducing death. Many studies have either shown similar benefits or slight advantage to CABG (primarily in severe diabetics). The best choice for an individual patient is best made by their cardiologist, surgeon, and primary doctor."
Peripheral Artery Disease,"'Like the blood vessels of the heart (coronary arteries), your peripheral arteries (blood vessels outside your heart) also may develop ''atherosclerosis'', the build-up of fat and ''cholesterol'' deposits, called plaque, on the inside walls. Over time, the build-up narrows the artery. Eventually the narrowed artery causes less blood to flow and a condition called ""ischemia"" can occur. Ischemia is inadequate blood flow to the body\'s tissue.' A blockage in the coronary arteries can cause symptoms of 
chest pain (angina) or a heart attack. A blockage in the carotid arteries (the arteries supplying the brain) can lead to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. A blockage in the legs can lead to leg pain or cramps with activity (a condition called claudication), changes in skin color, sores or ulcers, and feeling tired in the legs. Total loss of circulation can lead to gangrene and loss of a limb. A blockage in the renal arteries (arteries supplying the kidneys) can cause renal artery disease (stenosis). The symptoms include uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), heart failure, and abnormal kidney function."
Aneurysm,"'An ''aneurysm'' is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. They can form in any blood vessel, but they occur most commonly in the ''aorta'' (''aortic aneurysm'') which is the main blood vessel leaving the heart. The two types of aortic ''aneurysm'' are:''Small aneurysms generally pose no threat. However, one is at increased risk for:' Thoracic aortic aneurysm (part of aorta in the chest) Abdominal aortic aneurysm Atherosclerotic plaque (fat and calcium deposits) formation at the site of the aneurysm. A clot (thrombus) may form at the site and dislodge. Increase in the aneurysm size, causing it to press on other organs, causing pain. Aneurysm rupture -- because the artery wall thins at this spot, it is fragile and may burst under stress. A sudden rupture of an aortic aneurysm may be life threatening."
Renal (Kidney) Artery Disease,"'Renal artery disease is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis of the renal arteries (see above). It occurs in people with generalized vascular disease. Less often, renal artery disease can be caused by a congenital (present at birth) abnormal development of the tissue that makes up the renal arteries. This type of renal artery disease occurs in younger age groups.' "
Raynaud's Phenomenon (Also Called Raynaud's Disease or Raynaud's Syndrome),"""Raynaud's phenomenon consists of spasms of the small arteries of the fingers and sometimes the toes, brought on by exposure to ""'cold'"" or excitement. Certain occupational exposures bring on Raynaud's. The episodes produce temporary lack of blood supply to the area, causing the skin to appear white or bluish and cold or numb. In some cases, the symptoms of Raynaud's may be related to underlying diseases (ie, ""'lupus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''scleroderma'').' "
Buerger's Disease,"""Buerger's disease most commonly affects the small and medium sized arteries, veins, and nerves. Although the cause is unknown, there is a strong association with tobacco use or exposure. The arteries of the arms and legs become narrowed or blocked, causing lack of blood supply (ischemia) to the fingers, hands, toes, and ""'feet''. ''Pain'' occurs in the arms, hands and, more frequently, the legs and feet, even when at rest. With severe blockages, the tissue may die (gangrene), requiring amputation of the fingers and toes.''Superficial ''vein inflammation'"" and symptoms of Raynaud's occur commonly in patients with Buerger's disease."" "
Peripheral Venous Disease,"'Veins are flexible, hollow tubes with flaps inside called valves. When your muscles contract, the valves open and blood moves through the veins. When your muscles relax, the valves close, keeping blood flowing in one direction through the veins.''If the valves inside your veins become damaged, the valves may not close completely. This allows blood to flow in both directions. When your muscles relax, the valves inside the damaged vein(s) will not be able to hold the blood. This can cause pooling of blood or swelling in the veins. The veins bulge and appear as ropes under the skin. The blood begins to move more slowly through the veins, it may stick to the sides of the vessel walls and ''blood clots'' can form.' "
Varicose Veins,"'Varicose veins'' are bulging, swollen, purple, ropy veins, seen just under your skin, caused by damaged valves within the veins. They are more common in women than men and often run in families. They can also be caused by ''pregnancy'', being severely ''overweight'', or by standing for long periods of time. The symptoms of ''varicose veins'' include:' Bulging, swollen, purple, ropy, veins seen under the skin. Spider veins -- small red or purple bursts on your knees, calves, or thighs, caused by swollen capillaries (small blood vessels). Aching, stinging, or swelling of the legs at the end of the day."
Blood Clots In the Veins,"'Blood clots in the veins are usually caused by:''There are many types of blood clots that can occur in the veins:' Long bed rest and/or immobility. Damage to veins from injury or infection. Damage to the valves in the vein, causing pooling near the valve flaps. Pregnancy and hormones (such as estrogen or 
birth control pills). Genetic disorders. Conditions causing slowed blood flow or thicker blood, such as congestive heart failure (CHF), or certain tumors. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot occurring in a deep vein. Pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that breaks loose from a vein and travels to the lungs. Chronic venous insufficiency isn't a blood clot, but a condition that occurs when damaged vein valves or a DVT causes long-term pooling of blood and swelling in the legs. If uncontrolled, fluid will leak into the surrounding tissues in the ankles and feet, and may eventually cause skin breakdown and ulceration."
Blood Clotting Disorders,"'Blood clotting disorders are conditions that make the blood more likely to form blood clots in the arteries and veins. These conditions may be ''inherited'' (congenital, occurring at birth) or acquired during life and include:' Elevated levels of factors in the blood which cause blood to clot (fibrinogen, factor 8, prothrombin). Deficiency of natural anticoagulant (blood-thinning) proteins (antithrombin, protein C, protein S). Elevated blood counts. Abnormal fibrinolysis (the breakdown of fibrin). Abnormal changes in the lining of the blood vessels (endothelium)."
Lymphedema,"'The lymphatic system is a circulatory system that includes an extensive network of lymph vessels and ''lymph nodes'"". The lymphatic system helps coordinate the immune system's function to protect the body from foreign substances.""'Lymphedema'' is an abnormal build-up of fluid that causes swelling, most often in the arms or legs. ''Lymphedema'' develops when lymph vessels or lymph nodes are missing, impaired, damaged, or removed.''Primary lymphedema is rare and is caused by the absence of certain lymph vessels at birth, or it may be caused by abnormalities in the lymphatic vessels.''Secondary lymphedema occurs as a result of a blockage or interruption that alters the lymphatic system. Secondary lymphedema can develop from an infection, ''malignancy'', surgery, ''scar tissue'' formation, ''trauma'', ''deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT''), ''radiation'', or other ''cancer'' treatment.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is heart (cardiovascular) disease?,"'The heart is like any other muscle in body. It needs an adequate blood supply to provide oxygen so that the muscle can contract and pump blood to the rest of the body. Not only does the heart pump blood to the rest of the body, it also pumps blood to itself via the coronary arteries. These arteries originate from the base of the ''aorta'' (the major blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the heart) and then branch out along the surface of the heart.''When one or more coronary arteries narrow, it may make it difficult for adequate blood to reach the heart, especially during ''exercise''. This can cause the heart muscle to ache like any other muscle in the body. Should the arteries continue to narrow, it may take less activity to ''stress'' the heart and provoke symptoms. The classic symptoms of chest ''pain'' or pressure and shortness of breath that often spreads to the shoulders, arms, and/or neck due to atherosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) or coronary artery disease (''CAD'') are called angina.''Should one of the coronary arteries become completely blocked -- usually due to a plaque that ruptures and causes a ''blood clot'' to form -- blood supply to part of the heart may be lost. This causes a piece of heart muscle to die. This is called a heart attack or ''myocardial infarction'' (myo=muscle + cardia=heart + infarction= tissue death).''Cardiovascular disease'', for this article, will be limited to describing the spectrum of ''atherosclerosis'' or ''hardening of the arteries'' that ranges from minimal blockage that may produce no symptoms to complete obstruction that presents as a myocardial infarction. Other topics, such as ''myocarditis'', heart valve problems, and ''congenital heart defects'' will not be covered.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heart (cardiovascular) disease?,"'Not all pain from heart disease have the same signs and symptoms. The more we learn about heart disease, the more we realize that symptoms can be markedly different in different groups of people. Women, people who have ''diabetes'', and the elderly may have different pain perceptions and may complain of overwhelming ''fatigue'' and ''weakness'' or a change in their ability to perform routine daily activities like ''walking'', climbing steps, or doing household chores. Some patients may have no discomfort at all.''Most often, the symptoms of cardiovascular disease become worse over time, as the narrowing of the affected coronary artery progresses over time and blood flow to that part of the heart decreases. It may take less activity to cause symptoms to occur and it may take longer for those symptoms to get better with rest. This change in exercise tolerance is helpful in making the diagnosis.''Often the first signs and ''symptoms of heart disease'' may be a heart attack. This can lead to crushing chest pressure, shortness of breath, sweating, and perhaps ''sudden cardiac death''.' The classic symptoms of angina, or pain from the heart, are described as a crushing pain or heaviness in the center of the chest with radiation of the pain to the arm (usually the left) or jaw. There can be associated shortness of breath sweating and nausea. The symptoms tend to be brought on by activity and get better with rest. Some people may have indigestion and nausea while others may have upper abdominal, shoulder, or back pain. Unstable angina is the term used to describe symptoms that occur at rest, waken the patient from sleep, and do not respond quickly to nitroglycerin or rest."
Who is at risk for heart (cardiovascular) disease?,"'There are risk factors that increase the potential to develop plaque within coronary arteries and cause them to narrow. Atherosclerosis (athero=fatty plaque + sclerosis=hardening) is the term that describes this condition. Factors that put people at increased risk for heart disease are:''Since cardiovascular disease, ''peripheral artery disease'', and ''stroke'' share the same risk factors, a patient who is diagnosed with one of the three has increased risk of having or developing the others.' Smoking High blood pressure (hypertension) High cholesterol Diabetes Family history of heart problems, especially heart attacks and strokes Obesity"
What causes heart (cardiovascular) disease?,"'Heart or cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and often can be attributed to the lifestyle factors that increase the risk of atherosclerosis or narrowing of arteries. ''Smoking'', along with poorly controlled ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure''), and diabetes, causes inflammation and irritation of the inner lining of the coronary arteries. Over time, cholesterol in the bloodstream can collect in the inflamed areas and begin the formation of a plaque. This plaque can grow and as it does, the diameter of the artery narrows. If the artery narrows by 40% to 50%, blood flow is decreased enough to potentially cause the symptoms of angina.''In some circumstances, the plaque can rupture or break open, leading to the formation of a ''blood clot'' in the coronary artery. This clot can completely occlude or block the artery. This prevents oxygen-rich blood from being delivered to the heart muscle beyond that blockage and that part of the heart muscle begins to die. This is a myocardial infarction or heart attack. If the situation is not recognized and treated quickly, the affected part of the muscle cannot be revived. It dies and is replaced by ''scar tissue''. Long term, this ''scar'"" tissue decreases the heart's ability to pump effectively and efficiently and may lead to ischemic ""'cardiomyopathy'' (ischemic=decreased blood supply + cardio=heart + myo=muscle + pathy=disease).''Heart muscle that lacks adequate blood supply also becomes irritable and may not conduct electrical impulses normally. This can lead to abnormal electrical heart rhythms including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular ''fibrillation''. These are the heart arrhythmias associated with sudden cardiac death.' "
How is heart (cardiovascular) disease diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of cardiovascular disease begins by taking the patient's history. The health-care professional needs to understand the patient's symptoms and this may be difficult. Often, health-care professionals ask about chest pain, but the patient may deny having pain because they perceive their symptoms as pressure or heaviness. Words also may have different meanings for different people. The patient may describe their discomfort as sharp, meaning intense, while the health-care professional may understand that term to mean stabbing. For that reason, it is important for the patient to be allowed to take the time to describe the symptoms in their own words and have the health-care professional try to clarify the terms being used.""'The health-care professional may ask questions about the quality and quantity of pain, where it is located, and where it might travel or radiate. It is important to know about the associated symptoms including shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, ''vomiting'', and indigestion, as well as malaise or ''fatigue''.''The circumstances surrounding the symptoms are also important.''These are questions that may help decide wither the angina is stable, progressing, or becoming unstable.''Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be assessed including the presence of ''high blood pressure'', diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking history, and family history of cardiovascular disease. A past history of ''stroke'' or peripheral artery disease are also important risk factors to be assessed.'""Physical examination may not necessarily help make the diagnosis of heart disease, but it can help decide whether other underlying medical problems may be the cause of the patient's symptoms.""'There are some clues on physical exam that suggest the presence of narrowed arteries to the heart and coronary artery disease, for example, they the doctor may:''Check for high ''blood pressure''.''Palpate. (feel) for the pulses in the wrists and ''feet'' to see if they are present, and if they are normal in their amplitude and force. Lack of pulses may signal a narrowed or blocked artery in the arm or leg. If one artery is narrowed, perhaps others, like the coronary arteries in the heart, also may be narrowed''Auscultating or listening to the neck, abdomen and groin for bruits. A bruit is the sound produced within a narrowed artery due to turbulence caused when decreased blood flow occurs across the narrowed area. Bruits can be heard easily with a stethoscope in the he carotid artery in the neck, the abdominal aorta, and the femoral artery .Check sensation in the feet for numbness, decreased sensation, and ''peripheral neuropathy''.''Moreover, many other important conditions may need to be considered as the cause of symptoms. Examples include those arising from the lung (pulmonary embolus), the aorta (''aortic dissection''), the ''esophagus'' (''GERD''), and the abdomen (''peptic ulcer'' disease, ''gallbladder disease'').''After the history and physical examination are complete, the health-care professional may require more testing if heart disease is considered a potential diagnosis. There are different ways to evaluate the heart anatomy and function; the type and timing of a test needs to be individualized to each patient and their situation.''Most often, the health-care professional, perhaps in consultation with a cardiologist, will order the least invasive test possible to determine whether coronary artery disease is present. Although heart catheterization is the gold standard to define the anatomy of the heart and to confirm heart disease diagnosis (either with partial or complete blockage or no blockage), this is an invasive test and not necessarily indicated for many patients.''Electrocardiogram'' (EKG, ''ECG'')''The heart is an electrical pump and electrodes on the skin can capture and record the impulses generated as electricity travels throughout the heart muscle. Heart muscle that has decreased blood supply conducts electricity differently than normal muscle and these changes can be seen on the EKG.''A normal EKG does not exclude cardiovascular disease and coronary artery blockage; there may be narrowing of the coronary arteries that has yet to cause heart muscle damage. An abnormal EKG may be a ""normal"" variant for that patient and the result has to be interpreted based upon the patient\'s circumstances.''If possible, an EKG should be compared to previous tracings looking for changes in the electrical conduction patterns.''Stress'' tests''It would make sense that during exercise, the heart is asked to work harder and if the heart could be monitored and evaluated during that exercise, a test might uncover abnormalities in heart function. That exercise may occur by asking the patient to walk on a treadmill or ride a bicycle while at the same time, an electrocardiogram is being performed. Medications (adenosine, ''persantine'', dobutamine) can be used to stimulate the heart if the patient is unable to exercise because of poor conditioning, injury, or because of an underlying medical condition.''Echocardiography''Ultrasound'' examination of the heart to evaluate the anatomy of the heart valves, the muscle, and its function may be performed by a cardiologist. This test may be ordered alone or it may be combined with a stress test to look at heart function during exercise.''Nuclear imaging''A radioactive tracer that is injected into a vein can be used to indirectly assess blood flow to the heart. Technetium or ''thallium'' can be injected while a radioactive counter is used to map out how heart muscle cells absorb the radioactive chemical and how it is distributed in heart muscle cells may help determine indirectly whether a blockage exists. An area of the heart with no uptake would suggest that the area is not getting enough blood supply. This test may also be combined with an exercise test.''Cardiac ''computerized tomography'' (CT) and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'')'""Using these scans, the anatomy of the coronary arteries can be evaluated, including how much calcium is present in the artery walls and whether blockage or artery narrowing are present. Each test has its benefits and limitations and the risks and benefits of considering a CT or MRI depends upon a patient's situation.""'Cardiac catheterization''Cardiac catheterization is the gold standard for coronary artery testing. A cardiologist threads a thin tube through an artery in the groin, elbow, or wrist into the coronary arteries. Dye is injected to assess the anatomy and whether blockages are present. This is called a ''coronary angiogram''.''If a blockage exists, it is possible that ''angioplasty'' may be performed. Using the same technique as the ''angiogram'', a balloon is positioned at the site of the obstructing plaque. When the balloon is inflated, the plaque is squashed into the wall of the artery to re-establish blood flow. A ''stent'' may then be placed across the previously narrowed segment of artery to prevent it from narrowing again.' Are the symptoms brought on by activity? Do they get better with rest? Since symptoms began, does less activity provoke onset of the symptoms? Do the symptoms wake the patient? With stable angina, the activity that is required to initiate the symptoms does not fluctuate. For example, a patient may state that their symptoms are brought on by climbing up two flights of stairs or walking one mile. Progressive angina would find the patient stating that the symptoms are brought on by less activity than previously. In the case of unstable angina, symptoms may arise at rest or wake the patient from sleep."
What is the treatment for heart (cardiovascular) disease?,"""The goal of treating cardiovascular disease is to maximize the patient's quantity and quality of life. ""'Prevention'' is the key to avoid cardiovascular disease and optimize treatment. Once plaque formation has begun, it is possible to limit its progression by maintaining a healthy lifestyle with routine exercise, ''diet'', and by aiming for lifetime control of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.' "
What lifestyle changes can a person make to prevent further heart disease or heart attack?,"""The goal of treating cardiovascular disease is to maximize the person's quantity and quality of life. Prevention is the key to avoid cardiovascular disease and optimize treatment. Once plaque formation has begun, it is possible to limit its progression by making these lifestyle changes:"" Maintain a healthy lifestyle with routine exercise Quit smoking Eat a heart healthy diet such as the Mediterranean Diet. Aim for lifetime control of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes."
What is the medical treatment for heart (cardiovascular) disease?," An aspirin may be used for its antiplatelet activity, making platelets (one type of blood cells that help blood clot) less sticky and decreasing the risk of heart attack. The decision to use aspirin routinely depends upon whether other risk factors for heart disease are present. Medications may be prescribed in patients with heart disease to maximize blood flow to the heart and increase efficiency of the pumping function of the heart. Beta blocker medications help block the action of adrenaline on the heart, slowing the heart rate. These medications also help the heart beat more efficiently and decrease the oxygen requirements of the heart muscle during work. Calcium channel blockers also help the heart muscle contract and pump more efficiently. Nitrates help dilate arteries and increase blood flow to the heart muscle. They may be short-acting (Nitrostat) to treat acute angina symptoms or long-acting preparations (Imdur) may be prescribed for prevention. Should there be significant stenosis or narrowing of the coronary arteries, angioplasty and/or stenting (described above) may be considered to open the blocked areas. These procedures are performed in conjunction with cardiac catheterization. Depending upon the patient's anatomy and the extent of the blockage present, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) may be required. If a stent is placed, other antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Palvix) may be prescribed."
Can cardiovascular disease be prevented?,"'It may take 10 to15 years from the beginning of a plaque formation in a coronary artery to narrow that artery to constrict blood flow.''The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have developed guidelines so that health-care professionals may counsel and treat their patients to decrease the risk of developing heart disease. New attention is being paid to the role of weight reduction, diet, exercise, and the use of cholesterol-lowering medications called ''statins''.''In the past, the goal for statin ''drugs'' like ''atorvastatin'', was to lower the blood cholesterol level to a specific number and statins were prescribed for patients with high ''cholesterol levels'' or those who had had ''heart attacks''. The new guidelines recommend that more patients may benefit from these statin drugs. Rather than having specific cholesterol numbers as a goal, the new goal is to lower the blood cholesterol level by 50% in high-risk patients and by 30% to 50% in those who are at lower risk to develop heart disease. You and your doctor should discuss which goals are best for your condition.''Patients with a history of heart attack, ''transient ischemic attack'' (''TIA''), or ''stroke'', statins may be appropriate for patients with high ''LDL cholesterol'' levels (the “bad” cholesterol), for example, those who have ''type 2 diabetes'"", and those who have a 10-year risk of heart attack greater than 7.5%. You and your health-care professional may estimate risk by using the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology's ASCVD (Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease) Risk Calculator.""'Preventing cardiovascular disease is a lifelong commitment to control blood pressure, high cholesterol, ''quit smoking'', and diabetes. Now, new opportunities exist to decrease risk even further with these new guidelines. These are also the steps to take to decrease the risk of ''stroke'' and peripheral artery disease.''Cardiologists are specialists who treat cardiovascular heart disease. In addition to confirming the diagnosis using a heart catheterization, they often are able to perform angioplasty to dilate or open a narrowed or blocked artery and restore blood supply to heart muscle. As well, cardiologists help manage patients with chest pain to minimize the risk of future heart muscle damage.''Cardiothoracic surgeons operate on the heart and perform ''coronary artery bypass'' surgery, if the coronary arteries are severely blocked and the patient is not a candidate to have angioplasty. These surgeons also repair or replace heart valves and perform other surgeries that involve the structure of the heart.'""Primary care practitioners, including those in family medicine, internal medicine specialists and women's health, often help make the initial diagnosis of heart disease and are able to manage stable patients who do not need invasive procedures or interventions. These providers are also work to help minimize potential risk factors for heart disease, so that it does not develop, or if it is already present, to minimize progression of the artery blockages.""'Emergency physicians often make the diagnosis of angina when a patient presents with symptoms of heart disease. As well, when patients present to the ER with symptoms of a heart attack, they work as a team with the cardiologists to treat the patient quickly to restore blood supply to dying heart muscle.' "
"How many people have heart (cardiovascular) disease, and what is the 
prognosis?"," An estimated 15.5 million people in the United States have coronary artery disease. Each year, 1.5 million patients suffer an acute myocardial infarction and more than 600,000 people die. With better understanding of the different signs and symptoms of heart disease, especially the ""atypical"" symptoms experienced by women and the elderly, the diagnosis of heart disease has improved. The prognosis for the patient is better when diagnosis and treatment are initiated early. Educating the public about early access to emergency services when a patient develops acute chest pain can help save lives. The goal for the treatment of heart disease is to maximize longevity and quality of life."
What is cardiovascular disease (CVD)?,"'Cardiovascular'' disease includes a large number of unique conditions that can affect not only the heart but also the blood vessels throughout the body including those in the brain (''stroke'') and extremities (''peripheral artery disease''). Within the heart, disease can affect the physical structure including the valves (for example, congenital ''mitral valve prolapse'' or rheumatic ''heart disease'' caused by ''strep infections'') or the muscle wall (for example, ''cardiomyopathy'' or ''congestive heart failure''). ''Cardiovascular disease'' also includes conditions of vascular function (for example, endothelial dysfunction, ''angina'', or ''hypertension''), inflammation (for example, endo- or ''myocarditis''), or the electrical regulation of the heartbeat (for example, ''arrhythmia'' or ''atrial fibrillation'').' "
What is atherosclerosis?,"'One type of cardiovascular disease includes physical blockages that can stop blood flow in the coronary vessels and cause ischemia of the ''heart muscle''. When this is severe and sudden, this is what is commonly referred to as ''myocardial infarction'' or a ""''heart attack''."" However, years of ''coronary artery disease'' typically precede the attack with gradual narrowing and blocking of the blood vessels. The blockages are formed by ''lipid'' or ''cholesterol'' deposits that cause inflammation and form plaques. These plaques calcify, block the vessels, and limit blood flow to the heart muscle. This process is called ''atherosclerosis''. The plaques can also rupture, releasing a thrombus or clot that can block blood flow downstream and cause ischemia (decreased oxygen delivery to tissues) elsewhere in the heart or brain.''Because the body was not designed to have high levels of ''cholesterol'' (specifically LDL) in the blood, immune cells called macrophages move it into the blood vessel walls to get it out of the circulation. In this process, it becomes oxidized, and this is what triggers the inflammatory process. The macrophages become overwhelmed with the oxidized LDL, try to engulf it, becoming ""foam cells."" These foam cells trigger the need for further ""clean up,"" and the body tries to sequester the unhealthy foam cells and forms a hard plaque around it. These plaques cause further inflammation within the tissue of the artery wall; this is how ''atherosclerosis'' progresses.''There are differences between how atherosclerosis develops in men and women. In general, women are more likely to have plaque formation in a single coronary vessel and in smaller blood vessels. Overall, atherosclerosis or obstructive cardiovascular disease is a less common form of heart disease among women, although when plaques do form, the plaques are comprised of ''lipid''-filled foam cells, which are both more easily treated and reversed. However, the plaques in women are more likely to rupture than ''atherosclerotic'' plaques in men.' "
What are the statistics for heart disease in women?,"'One in 4 women die of cardiovascular disease, compared to 1 in 38 women who die of ''breast cancer''. While the actual numbers of deaths from heart disease have declined among both men and women, more women die of cardiovascular disease each year than men. In fact, rates of heart disease among younger women (aged 35 to 54) are actually increasing, a trend thought to be attributable to ''obesity''. Rates of heart disease are higher among black women and Hispanic women compared to non-Hispanic Caucasian and Asian women.'""Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women. On average, women develop cardiovascular disease, on average, about 10 years later than men. It is thought that this difference is at least partially due to protective hormonal effects because women's risk increases after ""'menopause''. Women who undergo early ''menopause'', either due to surgical removal of their ovaries or ''premature ovarian failure'', have similar rates of cardiovascular disease as age-matched men. Most women have one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease.' "
What are the gender differences?,"""There are notable differences in the types of heart disease that affect men and women. Differences exist in the underlying mechanisms of their heart disease, the symptoms that they present, and the types of complications they experience. There are also differences in the comprehensiveness of the medical care men and women receive and the general awareness of the magnitude of women's cardiovascular risk compared to that of men.""'Researchers who study the gender differences in cardiovascular disease often focus on the protective role of ''estrogen''. Estrogen has numerous effects on vascular tissue. It relaxes blood vessels, ''lowering blood pressure'' (pre-menopausally). Estrogen blunts the effects of ''stress'' hormones (catecholamines) which are vasoactive and cause blood vessel constriction, especially in times of ''stress''. Estrogen is also a natural ''antioxidant'"". However, estrogen also promotes blood coagulation, which isn't helpful. This is why women who use ""'oral contraceptives'' are at an increased risk of thrombotic events (''blood clots''). The use of ''hormone replacement therapy'' containing conjugated equine ''estrogens'', once thought to protect women against cardiovascular disease, is now known to increase CVD.''Several types of heart disease are more common in women than in men: ''stroke'', ''hypertension'', endothelial dysfunction, and congestive ''heart failure''. Because the presentation of these diseases is often less symptomatic, both women and their doctors benefit from efforts to increase awareness and practice ''prevention'' to reduce cardiovascular disease.''While men and women have similar rates of hospitalization due to heart disease, women tend to have longer hospital stays, receive less of the recommended assessment and treatment, and experience greater long-term disability. Women are less likely to return to work following a CVD-related hospital admission and have lower health-related quality of life following an event. These are important reasons for women to be well educated about what they can do to prevent heart disease and the types of treatment that should be recommended if they do have heart disease. With this knowledge, women can advocate for their own best health care.' "
What are heart disease risk factors for women?,"'Many of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are lifestyle behaviors. ''Diet'', ''exercise'', ''tobacco'' use, ''alcohol'' consumption, ''overweight'', psychosocial ''stress'', and ''depression'' are all significant risk factors. The good news is that these factors are largely modifiable.''Medical conditions such as ''obesity'', ''diabetes'', ''hypertension'', and ''high cholesterol'"" also increase women's risk of heart disease. Women are more likely than men to have multiple risk factors. Women also have higher risks of mortality (death) when they have multiple conditions; for example, women with ""'diabetes'' have an increased risk of dying of cardiovascular disease compared to men with ''diabetes''. Additional risk factors specific to women include oral ''contraceptive'' use, ''hormone replacement therapy'', and history of ''preeclampsia'' or ''gestational diabetes'' during ''pregnancy''.''Risk factors are very common in women and, in fact, women are also less likely to experience a heart attack or present with symptoms without at least one traditional risk factor. This suggests that if women and their doctors pay attention and treat early risk factors, ''heart attacks'' could be avoided.''Many risk factors can be easily identified through routine testing and review of lifestyle habits. Unfortunately, women are less likely to receive a comprehensive evaluation, even when they present to their doctor or hospital with symptoms. While simply improving the rates of basic assessment to equal the frequency of evaluation in men will improve CVD detection and prevention for women, in order to most accurately assess risk in women, different factors should be considered in addition to the traditional markers of risk. This is because of the differences in the underlying types of CVD that affect women, and thus testing and screening should seek to identify those types of cardiovascular disease that a woman is most likely to have.' "
Lifestyle,"'Dietary risk factors specifically include overconsumption of unhealthy ''fats'' (saturated fat and trans fatty acids) and underconsumption of good ''fats'' (monounsaturated fats, ''omega-3 fatty acids'') and fruits and vegetables (see below for information on what to eat to prevent and reverse CVD). Alcohol intake, greater than 1 drink per day for women, is also a risk factor.''Exercise'' is also a significant factor; women who are at less than 85% of their age-predicted ''exercise'' capacity have twice the risk of mortality compared to women who achieve an appropriate ''exercise'' capacity. For example, a 60-year-old woman should be able to achieve 85% of her target heart rate (136 bpm) during a vigorous exercise session and should be able to recover her heart rate down to at least 124 bpm within 1 minute. If she cannot, she is below her predicted exercise capacity and at increased risk. (See below for information on how much activity is necessary to prevent and reverse CVD).''Smoking'' is a substantial risk factor. Among women who experience a myocardial ''infarction'' under the age of 50, 40% are attributable to ''smoking''. Additionally, exposure to ''secondhand smoke'' and environmental particulate (such as pollution) are known risk factors. Women who smoke should seek help to quit.''Psychosocial risk factors were first measured and quantified by the INTERHEART study, a large international study of CVD risk factors among men and women. ''Stress'' is a known risk factor and can stem from work, home, emotional distress, ''pain'', lack of control, ''social isolation'', or lack of support. While epidemiologists classically described marriage as a heart-protective factor, this benefit is only seen for men; no differences in heart disease have been observed among married and non-married women. ''Depression'' is more prevalent in women and is a significant risk factor for both genders. ''Depression'"" appears to directly increase CVD risk and also impacts women's success in adopting and sticking with healthy lifestyle behaviors. (See below for information on how to reduce stress-related CVD risk factors).""'Personality traits can also contribute to CVD risk. Research has shown that ''Type A personality'' characteristics, such as competitive ambition, time urgency, and hostility all increase rates of CVD. A high locus of control or sense of being able to handle things is protective. Other factors, such as negative emotional states, having a fighting spirit, stoic acceptance or fatalism, or active coping mechanisms demonstrate a more complicated relationship with heart disease, likely modified by the other risk factors discussed previously.''Being ''overweight'' or ''obese'' is also a CVD risk factor. Women with a ''BMI'' greater than 25 are at increased risk both for CVD specifically and for other conditions such as ''high blood pressure'' and ''diabetes'' that indirectly increase heart disease risk. The good news is that as women adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors and lose even 5% of their excess weight, they measurably reduce their disease risk.' "
Clinical measures and biomarkers of risk,"'Cholesterol, ''hypertension'', high-sensitivity ''C-reactive protein'' (hs-CRP) and other lab tests have classically been termed risk factors but they are more accurately described as signs of preclinical or asymptomatic disease.''Lipids'' are important traditional risk factors for men and women, yet there are gender differences. While total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cannot be ignored, among women low high-density lipoprotein (''HDL'') or ""good"" cholesterol and high ''triglycerides'' (TG) are more significant than LDL and TC alone. Elevated ''triglycerides'' can reflect fatty acid ''metabolism'' secondary to high dietary carbohydrate and low dietary ''omega-3'' intake and thus are modifiable with ''diet'' or supplemental ''omega-3 fatty acids''. Family history and genetics also play a role in cholesterol biomarkers.''Hypertension'' is an independent risk factor for CVD and increases risk for ''stroke'' dramatically. ''High blood pressure'' is defined as a systolic ''blood pressure'' greater than 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg. ''High blood pressure'' puts stress on the vasculature, increasing the risk of rupture (hemorrhagic ''stroke'') or ischemia. Stress, obesity, family history, and sodium intake all affect ''blood pressure''. For every 20 mm increase in systolic or 10 mm in diastolic blood pressure, CVD risk doubles (for women aged 40 to 89). ''Preeclampsia'', a condition of ''high blood pressure in pregnancy'', doubles the risk for cardiovascular events over the 5 to 15 years after ''pregnancy''. ''Inflammation is at the root of atherosclerosis and most forms of cardiovascular disease. There are many biomarkers of inflammation that can help doctors differentiate the origin of the inflammation (such as whether it is coming from the inner lining of the arteries or from immune cell activity). American Heart Association guidelines recommend testing biomarkers of inflammation when the level of risk is uncertain. Because of the differences in the origins of heart disease in women, understanding inflammation and the resulting oxidative stress is important. ''Inflammation can be measured with high-sensitivity ''C-reactive protein'"" (hs-CRP). Several studies have demonstrated that hs-CRP is an independent risk factor for heart disease. That is, it adds information about someone's risk in addition to the information provided by cholesterol measurement, blood pressure, or any of the other risk factors that have been discussed. Increased hs-CRP may indicate a doubling of risk that can be identified only if this biomarker is measured. Other biomarkers of inflammation exist and can add precision to the doctor's assessment of where the source of inflammation is located; these are discussed in the laboratory testing section of this article."" "
How is heart disease risk calculated?,"'Risk classification has historically been calculated using the Framingham Risk Score. Based on the presence of risk factors, the likelihood of having a cardiovascular event within the next 10 years can be calculated and thus doctors can compute ""how worried"" they should be about someone at risk for a cardiovascular event. However, the Framingham score underestimates risk among women and is limited in estimating only the likelihood of ''coronary artery disease'', not all forms of cardiovascular disease. Because of this, an alternative tool, the Reynolds risk score, may be more appropriate for women. Risk can be calculated at ''www.ReynoldsRiskScore.org'' (see table for risk factors included in the calculation). The table shows the factors considered in determining the risk score with each method.' "
What causes heart disease in women?,"'Much of heart disease is asymptomatic, meaning it does not cause symptoms. Thus it is particularly important for health care professionals to recognize risk factors, for women to be screened, and for everyone to follow lifestyle patterns known to prevent disease.''Heart disease results when the risk factors discussed previously cause maladaptive changes in the heart and blood vessels. For example, chronic ''high blood pressure'' increases the stress on the blood vessels and increases the turbulence of blood flow which leads to vascular inflammation and plaque deposits. A clot or narrowed artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching the muscle downstream, leading to ischemia or damage to the heart muscle. Weak or damaged heart muscle cannot pump efficiently which leads to an enlarged, inefficient heart or ''congestive heart failure'"". Electrical signals don't pass through damaged tissue very well either, leading to arrhythmias. When any of these conditions occur due to the presence of risk factors, disease is likely to progress, although the specific patterns differ among men and women.""'Women are less likely than men to have obstructive or ischemic causes of heart disease. In women, when they do experience ischemic heart disease, it is more likely to affect small vessels. CVD in women is more likely to involve microvascular disease, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and congestive ''heart failure''. In these conditions, small blood vessels and the linings of the vessels are affected. This is often asymptomatic, but over time it can lead to ''angina'', vasospasm (spasm of the ''coronary arteries''), ''stroke'', and many of the other forms of heart disease that have been discussed. Women also have more coagulative disorders, possibly due to the role of estrogen. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heart disease in women?,"'Signs include ''hypertension'', ''angina'', ''edema'' (fluid accumulation in tissues), ''palpitations'', and vague symptoms that are often confused with ''indigestion'' or ''musculoskeletal pain''. Overall symptoms get worse with exertion and improve with rest. Women are more likely than men to experience unstable angina (''chest pain'' or sensations that occur irregularly and unpredictably).''Some women experience classic angina symptoms such as ''chest pain'' or pressure but more commonly, women experience:''While the ''pain'' is often described as coming from behind the chest bone, women are more likely than men to experience discomfort in the arms, neck, jaw, throat or back.''Women often have a hard time determining where the ''pain'' is exactly coming from.''It may be accompanied by:''Symptoms of ''coronary artery disease'' or angina typically occur at times of exertion such as during exercise, like rushing for a plane. However, for women, it is also often triggered by high stress, including mental or emotional stress, during activities of daily living, or even at times of rest.''Unfortunately, women are less likely to seek help if symptomatic. When they do seek help, they are less likely to get stress tests. When abnormal stress tests are reported, they are less likely to get ''angiography''. Any ''chest pain'"" that doesn't resolve with a few minutes of rest, or ""'chest pain'' that recurs, needs to be evaluated.''Congestive heart failure is also a more common type of heart disease among women compared to men. Heart failure is when the heart muscle is not strong enough to pump efficiently. Symptoms and signs of heart failure can include:''Heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admission globally, and the proportion of admissions that are women continues to increase. If women notice these symptoms, they should seek evaluation.'   chest tightness squeezing burning sense of discomfort nausea or indigestion sweating lightheadedness fatigue swelling in the legs or abdomen (edema) fatigue high blood pressure shortness of breath"
What are the signs and symptoms of a heart attack in women?,"'Highly concerning is a recent national survey by the American Heart Association that reported that only 53% of women said the first thing they would do if they thought they were having a heart attack was to call 9-1-1! On average, women have a 4-hour delay in seeking treatment when they are having a heart attack. A time delay of 4 hours can mean the difference between getting life-saving treatment or not.''Heart attack symptoms can be similar to the symptoms women experience with angina, but they do not resolve with rest. Chest ''pain'' and pain radiating into the left arm are classic, but lesser known symptoms can include:'""Don't ignore these symptoms in yourself or in a woman you love!  "" chest pressure suffocating feeling shortness of breath shoulder blade discomfort sense of dread unusual back pain jaw, head, or neck pain nausea an intuitive feeling that something just isn't right"
What are the signs and symptoms of stroke?,"'Strokes'' are sometimes called brain attacks because the causes are very similar to the causes of heart attack -- a clot in or rupture of a blood vessel and damage to the tissue downstream from the site of injury. In the case of a ''stroke'', the symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected; thus strokes can affect speech, ''hearing'', vision, movement, sensations, or other functions. Common ''stroke symptoms'' begin quite suddenly and can include:''Women also report unique symptoms:''The American ''Stroke'' Association has initiated the F-A-S-T campaign to help people identify possible stroke and call 9-1-1 quickly. F-A-S-T stands for:' numbness or weakness in one limb, part of the face, or other region, especially if it is one-sided seeing double or blurring vision difficulty speaking, finding words, or understanding language loss of balance, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty walking sudden, severe headache sudden hiccups sudden general weakness sudden sweating sudden anxiety and fear Face: Ask the person to smile and look for drooping on one side. Arms: Ask the person to raise their arms and look for weakness or drifting on one side. Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence and listen for slurring or inappropriate answers. Time: If any of these symptoms are present call 9-1-1 immediately as rapid administration of medicine can make a difference for some types of stroke."
How do medical professionals diagnose heart disease in women?,"'Women are less likely to get thorough cardiac assessment or treatment when they present to their doctors or hospital for care, so it is especially important for women to understand what may be involved in evaluation so they can be advocates for themselves. As discussed previously, women can evaluate their own risk factors using the Reynolds Risk Score. This tool is more sensitive in catching heart disease in women. Women can complete their own scores and bring their results to their doctor.''Evaluation of CVD may include the following tests:' EKG or ECG (electrocardiogram): This test measures the electrical activity of the heart. From the patterns of conductivity, different conditions can be diagnosed. For women, it is important to know that while there are some gender-specific differences in reading ECG results, the differences are small. It is important to be tested if you have risk factors, even if you are asymptomatic. Stress-ECG or exercise-ECG: This is perhaps the most important test for women at risk of CVD. During this test, the woman is connected to the ECG lead wires as she would be for a regular ECG but she is asked to walk and/or run on a treadmill per a timed protocol. Heart rate and blood pressure are also measured. It is noteworthy that, in the past, stress tests were thought to be less accurate in women because many women had difficulty achieving the exercise thresholds and thus had ""invalid"" tests. However, there is significant diagnostic information in measuring the level to which a woman can exert herself on the treadmill. If she is unable to reach 85% of her age-predicted exercise capacity, it is known that she is already at a 2-fold increased risk of heart attack regardless of additional ECG findings. AHA/ACC guidelines state that ECG AND stress testing should be performed as initial screening in asymptomatic women. Endothelial testing (EndoPat): This non-invasive test helps diagnose early heart disease in the lining of the blood vessels -- the endothelium. Normal endothelial function protects the blood vessels from developing atherosclerosis. In this test, detectors are placed on the finger tips and a blood pressure cuff occludes blood flow to the arm for a few minutes. When the cuff is released, it measures how the blood vessels respond to the reperfusion. This test is highly useful in detecting early coronary artery disease (CAD) and is especially relevant to women because women have higher rates of endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease. Ankle-brachial Index (ABI): This is a test performed with a blood pressure cuff around the ankle and around the arm. The differences in blood pressure at the two sites are compared both before and after mild exercise. Results diagnose peripheral artery disease."
Imaging studies,"'Imaging studies provide information on blood flow in addition to the size and function of the heart muscle. Image-assisted stress tests such as a stress ''echocardiogram'' or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide more diagnostic detail than static tests. Because women tend to have coronary artery disease that affects only one vessel, it may be harder to detect cardiovascular disease in women with imaging tests.' Echocardiograms: These tests provide images of the structure and function of the heart. The echocardiogram (often called a stress echo test) is an ultrasound examination and does not involve radiation. Stress echo is the most sensitive test for women, but there are a few limitations; breast tissue can make visualization of the coronary vessels difficult, decreasing sensitivity. Like any stress test, obese or de-conditioned women may have difficulty reaching the exercise thresholds for diagnostic specificity. From an echocardiogram we can learn: The size of the heart's chambers The strength of the heart muscle called ejection fraction or EF The function of the heart valves (Heart valves can be too tight, called stenotic; or leaky, called regurgitation.) Has the heart muscle been damaged from a heart attack? What are the pressures inside the heart? Nuclear imaging: Myocardial Perfusion Imaging tests use radioactive tracers in the bloodstream and X-rays to see with a high degree of detail the flow of blood through the arteries and thus identification of plaques that prevent normal blood flow. This can be done during exercise or at rest using a medication to simulate exercise. It can also be done during symptoms of a heart attack or acute coronary syndrome to determine if the woman is having a heart attack, or during asymptomatic times to determine the degree of narrowing of the vessels. Because women tend to be more asymptomatic at rest and develop symptoms under stress, it is thought that myocardial perfusion imaging is particularly of value in diagnosing women with coronary artery disease (CAD). Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging can both be used in cardiac perfusion studies with a variety of tracers. They include technetium, thallium, and more recently rubidium. Rubidium is the most sensitive and specific for determining blood flow to the heart muscle. The rubidium test is performed in a PET scanner. Electron beam CT (EBCT) test: Coronary calcium scores (CAC) can be calculated from an EBCT test. This more detailed study measures the amount of calcified plaque in the vessels. CAC has been shown to be an independent predictor of CAD beyond other risk factors. It has also been shown that CAC adds to the sensitivity of SPECT results alone. CAC testing is useful in identifying early atherosclerosis, at a stage when patients can make lifestyle changes to prevent a heart attack."
Invasive testing,"'Cardiac catheterization''/''coronary angiogram'' is the most accurate way CAD can be evaluated; however, it is an invasive test with some risk. In this test, a small tube is threaded through the arteries to the heart where a small amount of dye is released and viewed with X-ray. The person is sedated and local anesthetic is used. From this test, doctors can determine how well blood is flowing through the arteries in the heart wall. One of the advantages of a coronary ''angiogram'' is that therapeutic procedures (an ''angioplasty'') can be immediately performed when a blockage is found (more on this below).' "
Laboratory testing,"'When a woman is suspected of having a heart attack, additional tests are run in the hospital to determine if her heart tissue has been damaged. These tests include:''Cardiac biomarkers like BNP and CRP are better predictors of ischemic events in women as opposed to the routinely checked CKMB and troponins, which do not rise to such high levels in women as in men. Some cardiovascular specialty labs are also ''running'' highly sensitive tests that measure very small amounts of these same substances, and some doctors are using these in hope of detecting very mild ischemia and heart muscle damage that precedes a full heart attack.' Cholesterol tests are still the most useful tool to identify risk; if you only do one thing to measure your risk of cardiovascular disease, have your lipids tested. A lipid panel includes total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). Research shows that low HDL and high TG may be more significant in women than LDL and TC. The total cholesterol:HDL ratio is an important summary of risk and it should be less than 3.5. HDL particles represent healthy processing of lipid. LDL particles tell doctors about lipids that will ultimately need to be stored in tissues, such as blood vessel walls. However, cholesterol isn't simply high density or low density, it is every size and concentration in between (see below). Advanced lipid tests look at these subfractions of lipids in more detail. These tests measure additional properties of lipoproteins such as their size, density, particle number, or concentration. Lipid sub-fraction testing is useful when standard lipid tests do not clearly show if a person is at moderate risk or well protected. They are also useful to guide treatment, such as providing feedback on how successful diet and exercise changes have been. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been found to be a better predictor of CVD in women, independent of other biomarkers. It is a marker of inflammation, although it is not specific to cardiac tissue. Many experts suggest that hs-CRP be added to routine lab testing for women at risk for and with CVD. Other biomarkers of inflammation range from the non-specific (fibrinogen, white blood cell count) to the specific. For example, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 or Lp-PLA2, is a measure of inflammation within the plaques in the wall of the artery. Myeloperoxidase is a measure of the inflammatory response in the lumen of the artery and tells doctors about the immune response to ""clean up"" unstable plaques; however, it can also be elevated in other inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disease. The biomarker called F2-isoprostane is not only a marker of inflammation (oxidative stress specifically), it is a chemical signal that triggers vasoconstriction which can cause further cardiovascular problems. Chemical signals called cytokines can also be measured. A few specific cytokines have been shown to independently add information about the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Those called tumor necrosis factor receptor-II (TNF-II), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) add precision to the doctor's assessment of risk of dying in men and women with cardiovascular disease. creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) levels cardiac troponin levels myoglobin levels B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)"
What is cardiovascular disease (CVD)?,"'Cardiovascular'' disease includes a large number of unique conditions that can affect not only the heart but also the blood vessels throughout the body including those in the brain (''stroke'') and extremities (''peripheral artery disease''). Within the heart, disease can affect the physical structure including the valves (for example, congenital ''mitral valve prolapse'' or rheumatic ''heart disease'' caused by ''strep infections'') or the muscle wall (for example, ''cardiomyopathy'' or ''congestive heart failure''). ''Cardiovascular disease'' also includes conditions of vascular function (for example, endothelial dysfunction, ''angina'', or ''hypertension''), inflammation (for example, endo- or ''myocarditis''), or the electrical regulation of the heartbeat (for example, ''arrhythmia'' or ''atrial fibrillation'').' "
What is atherosclerosis?,"'One type of cardiovascular disease includes physical blockages that can stop blood flow in the coronary vessels and cause ischemia of the ''heart muscle''. When this is severe and sudden, this is what is commonly referred to as ''myocardial infarction'' or a ""''heart attack''."" However, years of ''coronary artery disease'' typically precede the attack with gradual narrowing and blocking of the blood vessels. The blockages are formed by ''lipid'' or ''cholesterol'' deposits that cause inflammation and form plaques. These plaques calcify, block the vessels, and limit blood flow to the heart muscle. This process is called ''atherosclerosis''. The plaques can also rupture, releasing a thrombus or clot that can block blood flow downstream and cause ischemia (decreased oxygen delivery to tissues) elsewhere in the heart or brain.''Because the body was not designed to have high levels of ''cholesterol'' (specifically LDL) in the blood, immune cells called macrophages move it into the blood vessel walls to get it out of the circulation. In this process, it becomes oxidized, and this is what triggers the inflammatory process. The macrophages become overwhelmed with the oxidized LDL, try to engulf it, becoming ""foam cells."" These foam cells trigger the need for further ""clean up,"" and the body tries to sequester the unhealthy foam cells and forms a hard plaque around it. These plaques cause further inflammation within the tissue of the artery wall; this is how ''atherosclerosis'' progresses.''There are differences between how atherosclerosis develops in men and women. In general, women are more likely to have plaque formation in a single coronary vessel and in smaller blood vessels. Overall, atherosclerosis or obstructive cardiovascular disease is a less common form of heart disease among women, although when plaques do form, the plaques are comprised of ''lipid''-filled foam cells, which are both more easily treated and reversed. However, the plaques in women are more likely to rupture than ''atherosclerotic'' plaques in men.' "
What are the statistics for heart disease in women?,"'One in 4 women die of cardiovascular disease, compared to 1 in 38 women who die of ''breast cancer''. While the actual numbers of deaths from heart disease have declined among both men and women, more women die of cardiovascular disease each year than men. In fact, rates of heart disease among younger women (aged 35 to 54) are actually increasing, a trend thought to be attributable to ''obesity''. Rates of heart disease are higher among black women and Hispanic women compared to non-Hispanic Caucasian and Asian women.'""Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women. On average, women develop cardiovascular disease, on average, about 10 years later than men. It is thought that this difference is at least partially due to protective hormonal effects because women's risk increases after ""'menopause''. Women who undergo early ''menopause'', either due to surgical removal of their ovaries or ''premature ovarian failure'', have similar rates of cardiovascular disease as age-matched men. Most women have one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease.' "
What are the gender differences?,"""There are notable differences in the types of heart disease that affect men and women. Differences exist in the underlying mechanisms of their heart disease, the symptoms that they present, and the types of complications they experience. There are also differences in the comprehensiveness of the medical care men and women receive and the general awareness of the magnitude of women's cardiovascular risk compared to that of men.""'Researchers who study the gender differences in cardiovascular disease often focus on the protective role of ''estrogen''. Estrogen has numerous effects on vascular tissue. It relaxes blood vessels, ''lowering blood pressure'' (pre-menopausally). Estrogen blunts the effects of ''stress'' hormones (catecholamines) which are vasoactive and cause blood vessel constriction, especially in times of ''stress''. Estrogen is also a natural ''antioxidant'"". However, estrogen also promotes blood coagulation, which isn't helpful. This is why women who use ""'oral contraceptives'' are at an increased risk of thrombotic events (''blood clots''). The use of ''hormone replacement therapy'' containing conjugated equine ''estrogens'', once thought to protect women against cardiovascular disease, is now known to increase CVD.''Several types of heart disease are more common in women than in men: ''stroke'', ''hypertension'', endothelial dysfunction, and congestive ''heart failure''. Because the presentation of these diseases is often less symptomatic, both women and their doctors benefit from efforts to increase awareness and practice ''prevention'' to reduce cardiovascular disease.''While men and women have similar rates of hospitalization due to heart disease, women tend to have longer hospital stays, receive less of the recommended assessment and treatment, and experience greater long-term disability. Women are less likely to return to work following a CVD-related hospital admission and have lower health-related quality of life following an event. These are important reasons for women to be well educated about what they can do to prevent heart disease and the types of treatment that should be recommended if they do have heart disease. With this knowledge, women can advocate for their own best health care.' "
What are heart disease risk factors for women?,"'Many of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are lifestyle behaviors. ''Diet'', ''exercise'', ''tobacco'' use, ''alcohol'' consumption, ''overweight'', psychosocial ''stress'', and ''depression'' are all significant risk factors. The good news is that these factors are largely modifiable.''Medical conditions such as ''obesity'', ''diabetes'', ''hypertension'', and ''high cholesterol'"" also increase women's risk of heart disease. Women are more likely than men to have multiple risk factors. Women also have higher risks of mortality (death) when they have multiple conditions; for example, women with ""'diabetes'' have an increased risk of dying of cardiovascular disease compared to men with ''diabetes''. Additional risk factors specific to women include oral ''contraceptive'' use, ''hormone replacement therapy'', and history of ''preeclampsia'' or ''gestational diabetes'' during ''pregnancy''.''Risk factors are very common in women and, in fact, women are also less likely to experience a heart attack or present with symptoms without at least one traditional risk factor. This suggests that if women and their doctors pay attention and treat early risk factors, ''heart attacks'' could be avoided.''Many risk factors can be easily identified through routine testing and review of lifestyle habits. Unfortunately, women are less likely to receive a comprehensive evaluation, even when they present to their doctor or hospital with symptoms. While simply improving the rates of basic assessment to equal the frequency of evaluation in men will improve CVD detection and prevention for women, in order to most accurately assess risk in women, different factors should be considered in addition to the traditional markers of risk. This is because of the differences in the underlying types of CVD that affect women, and thus testing and screening should seek to identify those types of cardiovascular disease that a woman is most likely to have.' "
Lifestyle,"'Dietary risk factors specifically include overconsumption of unhealthy ''fats'' (saturated fat and trans fatty acids) and underconsumption of good ''fats'' (monounsaturated fats, ''omega-3 fatty acids'') and fruits and vegetables (see below for information on what to eat to prevent and reverse CVD). Alcohol intake, greater than 1 drink per day for women, is also a risk factor.''Exercise'' is also a significant factor; women who are at less than 85% of their age-predicted ''exercise'' capacity have twice the risk of mortality compared to women who achieve an appropriate ''exercise'' capacity. For example, a 60-year-old woman should be able to achieve 85% of her target heart rate (136 bpm) during a vigorous exercise session and should be able to recover her heart rate down to at least 124 bpm within 1 minute. If she cannot, she is below her predicted exercise capacity and at increased risk. (See below for information on how much activity is necessary to prevent and reverse CVD).''Smoking'' is a substantial risk factor. Among women who experience a myocardial ''infarction'' under the age of 50, 40% are attributable to ''smoking''. Additionally, exposure to ''secondhand smoke'' and environmental particulate (such as pollution) are known risk factors. Women who smoke should seek help to quit.''Psychosocial risk factors were first measured and quantified by the INTERHEART study, a large international study of CVD risk factors among men and women. ''Stress'' is a known risk factor and can stem from work, home, emotional distress, ''pain'', lack of control, ''social isolation'', or lack of support. While epidemiologists classically described marriage as a heart-protective factor, this benefit is only seen for men; no differences in heart disease have been observed among married and non-married women. ''Depression'' is more prevalent in women and is a significant risk factor for both genders. ''Depression'"" appears to directly increase CVD risk and also impacts women's success in adopting and sticking with healthy lifestyle behaviors. (See below for information on how to reduce stress-related CVD risk factors).""'Personality traits can also contribute to CVD risk. Research has shown that ''Type A personality'' characteristics, such as competitive ambition, time urgency, and hostility all increase rates of CVD. A high locus of control or sense of being able to handle things is protective. Other factors, such as negative emotional states, having a fighting spirit, stoic acceptance or fatalism, or active coping mechanisms demonstrate a more complicated relationship with heart disease, likely modified by the other risk factors discussed previously.''Being ''overweight'' or ''obese'' is also a CVD risk factor. Women with a ''BMI'' greater than 25 are at increased risk both for CVD specifically and for other conditions such as ''high blood pressure'' and ''diabetes'' that indirectly increase heart disease risk. The good news is that as women adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors and lose even 5% of their excess weight, they measurably reduce their disease risk.' "
Clinical measures and biomarkers of risk,"'Cholesterol, ''hypertension'', high-sensitivity ''C-reactive protein'' (hs-CRP) and other lab tests have classically been termed risk factors but they are more accurately described as signs of preclinical or asymptomatic disease.''Lipids'' are important traditional risk factors for men and women, yet there are gender differences. While total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cannot be ignored, among women low high-density lipoprotein (''HDL'') or ""good"" cholesterol and high ''triglycerides'' (TG) are more significant than LDL and TC alone. Elevated ''triglycerides'' can reflect fatty acid ''metabolism'' secondary to high dietary carbohydrate and low dietary ''omega-3'' intake and thus are modifiable with ''diet'' or supplemental ''omega-3 fatty acids''. Family history and genetics also play a role in cholesterol biomarkers.''Hypertension'' is an independent risk factor for CVD and increases risk for ''stroke'' dramatically. ''High blood pressure'' is defined as a systolic ''blood pressure'' greater than 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mmHg. ''High blood pressure'' puts stress on the vasculature, increasing the risk of rupture (hemorrhagic ''stroke'') or ischemia. Stress, obesity, family history, and sodium intake all affect ''blood pressure''. For every 20 mm increase in systolic or 10 mm in diastolic blood pressure, CVD risk doubles (for women aged 40 to 89). ''Preeclampsia'', a condition of ''high blood pressure in pregnancy'', doubles the risk for cardiovascular events over the 5 to 15 years after ''pregnancy''. ''Inflammation is at the root of atherosclerosis and most forms of cardiovascular disease. There are many biomarkers of inflammation that can help doctors differentiate the origin of the inflammation (such as whether it is coming from the inner lining of the arteries or from immune cell activity). American Heart Association guidelines recommend testing biomarkers of inflammation when the level of risk is uncertain. Because of the differences in the origins of heart disease in women, understanding inflammation and the resulting oxidative stress is important. ''Inflammation can be measured with high-sensitivity ''C-reactive protein'"" (hs-CRP). Several studies have demonstrated that hs-CRP is an independent risk factor for heart disease. That is, it adds information about someone's risk in addition to the information provided by cholesterol measurement, blood pressure, or any of the other risk factors that have been discussed. Increased hs-CRP may indicate a doubling of risk that can be identified only if this biomarker is measured. Other biomarkers of inflammation exist and can add precision to the doctor's assessment of where the source of inflammation is located; these are discussed in the laboratory testing section of this article."" "
How is heart disease risk calculated?,"'Risk classification has historically been calculated using the Framingham Risk Score. Based on the presence of risk factors, the likelihood of having a cardiovascular event within the next 10 years can be calculated and thus doctors can compute ""how worried"" they should be about someone at risk for a cardiovascular event. However, the Framingham score underestimates risk among women and is limited in estimating only the likelihood of ''coronary artery disease'', not all forms of cardiovascular disease. Because of this, an alternative tool, the Reynolds risk score, may be more appropriate for women. Risk can be calculated at ''www.ReynoldsRiskScore.org'' (see table for risk factors included in the calculation). The table shows the factors considered in determining the risk score with each method.' "
What causes heart disease in women?,"'Much of heart disease is asymptomatic, meaning it does not cause symptoms. Thus it is particularly important for health care professionals to recognize risk factors, for women to be screened, and for everyone to follow lifestyle patterns known to prevent disease.''Heart disease results when the risk factors discussed previously cause maladaptive changes in the heart and blood vessels. For example, chronic ''high blood pressure'' increases the stress on the blood vessels and increases the turbulence of blood flow which leads to vascular inflammation and plaque deposits. A clot or narrowed artery prevents oxygen-rich blood from reaching the muscle downstream, leading to ischemia or damage to the heart muscle. Weak or damaged heart muscle cannot pump efficiently which leads to an enlarged, inefficient heart or ''congestive heart failure'"". Electrical signals don't pass through damaged tissue very well either, leading to arrhythmias. When any of these conditions occur due to the presence of risk factors, disease is likely to progress, although the specific patterns differ among men and women.""'Women are less likely than men to have obstructive or ischemic causes of heart disease. In women, when they do experience ischemic heart disease, it is more likely to affect small vessels. CVD in women is more likely to involve microvascular disease, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and congestive ''heart failure''. In these conditions, small blood vessels and the linings of the vessels are affected. This is often asymptomatic, but over time it can lead to ''angina'', vasospasm (spasm of the ''coronary arteries''), ''stroke'', and many of the other forms of heart disease that have been discussed. Women also have more coagulative disorders, possibly due to the role of estrogen. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heart disease in women?,"'Signs include ''hypertension'', ''angina'', ''edema'' (fluid accumulation in tissues), ''palpitations'', and vague symptoms that are often confused with ''indigestion'' or ''musculoskeletal pain''. Overall symptoms get worse with exertion and improve with rest. Women are more likely than men to experience unstable angina (''chest pain'' or sensations that occur irregularly and unpredictably).''Some women experience classic angina symptoms such as ''chest pain'' or pressure but more commonly, women experience:''While the ''pain'' is often described as coming from behind the chest bone, women are more likely than men to experience discomfort in the arms, neck, jaw, throat or back.''Women often have a hard time determining where the ''pain'' is exactly coming from.''It may be accompanied by:''Symptoms of ''coronary artery disease'' or angina typically occur at times of exertion such as during exercise, like rushing for a plane. However, for women, it is also often triggered by high stress, including mental or emotional stress, during activities of daily living, or even at times of rest.''Unfortunately, women are less likely to seek help if symptomatic. When they do seek help, they are less likely to get stress tests. When abnormal stress tests are reported, they are less likely to get ''angiography''. Any ''chest pain'"" that doesn't resolve with a few minutes of rest, or ""'chest pain'' that recurs, needs to be evaluated.''Congestive heart failure is also a more common type of heart disease among women compared to men. Heart failure is when the heart muscle is not strong enough to pump efficiently. Symptoms and signs of heart failure can include:''Heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admission globally, and the proportion of admissions that are women continues to increase. If women notice these symptoms, they should seek evaluation.'   chest tightness squeezing burning sense of discomfort nausea or indigestion sweating lightheadedness fatigue swelling in the legs or abdomen (edema) fatigue high blood pressure shortness of breath"
What are the signs and symptoms of a heart attack in women?,"'Highly concerning is a recent national survey by the American Heart Association that reported that only 53% of women said the first thing they would do if they thought they were having a heart attack was to call 9-1-1! On average, women have a 4-hour delay in seeking treatment when they are having a heart attack. A time delay of 4 hours can mean the difference between getting life-saving treatment or not.''Heart attack symptoms can be similar to the symptoms women experience with angina, but they do not resolve with rest. Chest ''pain'' and pain radiating into the left arm are classic, but lesser known symptoms can include:'""Don't ignore these symptoms in yourself or in a woman you love!  "" chest pressure suffocating feeling shortness of breath shoulder blade discomfort sense of dread unusual back pain jaw, head, or neck pain nausea an intuitive feeling that something just isn't right"
What are the signs and symptoms of stroke?,"'Strokes'' are sometimes called brain attacks because the causes are very similar to the causes of heart attack -- a clot in or rupture of a blood vessel and damage to the tissue downstream from the site of injury. In the case of a ''stroke'', the symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected; thus strokes can affect speech, ''hearing'', vision, movement, sensations, or other functions. Common ''stroke symptoms'' begin quite suddenly and can include:''Women also report unique symptoms:''The American ''Stroke'' Association has initiated the F-A-S-T campaign to help people identify possible stroke and call 9-1-1 quickly. F-A-S-T stands for:' numbness or weakness in one limb, part of the face, or other region, especially if it is one-sided seeing double or blurring vision difficulty speaking, finding words, or understanding language loss of balance, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty walking sudden, severe headache sudden hiccups sudden general weakness sudden sweating sudden anxiety and fear Face: Ask the person to smile and look for drooping on one side. Arms: Ask the person to raise their arms and look for weakness or drifting on one side. Speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence and listen for slurring or inappropriate answers. Time: If any of these symptoms are present call 9-1-1 immediately as rapid administration of medicine can make a difference for some types of stroke."
How do medical professionals diagnose heart disease in women?,"'Women are less likely to get thorough cardiac assessment or treatment when they present to their doctors or hospital for care, so it is especially important for women to understand what may be involved in evaluation so they can be advocates for themselves. As discussed previously, women can evaluate their own risk factors using the Reynolds Risk Score. This tool is more sensitive in catching heart disease in women. Women can complete their own scores and bring their results to their doctor.''Evaluation of CVD may include the following tests:' EKG or ECG (electrocardiogram): This test measures the electrical activity of the heart. From the patterns of conductivity, different conditions can be diagnosed. For women, it is important to know that while there are some gender-specific differences in reading ECG results, the differences are small. It is important to be tested if you have risk factors, even if you are asymptomatic. Stress-ECG or exercise-ECG: This is perhaps the most important test for women at risk of CVD. During this test, the woman is connected to the ECG lead wires as she would be for a regular ECG but she is asked to walk and/or run on a treadmill per a timed protocol. Heart rate and blood pressure are also measured. It is noteworthy that, in the past, stress tests were thought to be less accurate in women because many women had difficulty achieving the exercise thresholds and thus had ""invalid"" tests. However, there is significant diagnostic information in measuring the level to which a woman can exert herself on the treadmill. If she is unable to reach 85% of her age-predicted exercise capacity, it is known that she is already at a 2-fold increased risk of heart attack regardless of additional ECG findings. AHA/ACC guidelines state that ECG AND stress testing should be performed as initial screening in asymptomatic women. Endothelial testing (EndoPat): This non-invasive test helps diagnose early heart disease in the lining of the blood vessels -- the endothelium. Normal endothelial function protects the blood vessels from developing atherosclerosis. In this test, detectors are placed on the finger tips and a blood pressure cuff occludes blood flow to the arm for a few minutes. When the cuff is released, it measures how the blood vessels respond to the reperfusion. This test is highly useful in detecting early coronary artery disease (CAD) and is especially relevant to women because women have higher rates of endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease. Ankle-brachial Index (ABI): This is a test performed with a blood pressure cuff around the ankle and around the arm. The differences in blood pressure at the two sites are compared both before and after mild exercise. Results diagnose peripheral artery disease."
Imaging studies,"'Imaging studies provide information on blood flow in addition to the size and function of the heart muscle. Image-assisted stress tests such as a stress ''echocardiogram'' or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide more diagnostic detail than static tests. Because women tend to have coronary artery disease that affects only one vessel, it may be harder to detect cardiovascular disease in women with imaging tests.' Echocardiograms: These tests provide images of the structure and function of the heart. The echocardiogram (often called a stress echo test) is an ultrasound examination and does not involve radiation. Stress echo is the most sensitive test for women, but there are a few limitations; breast tissue can make visualization of the coronary vessels difficult, decreasing sensitivity. Like any stress test, obese or de-conditioned women may have difficulty reaching the exercise thresholds for diagnostic specificity. From an echocardiogram we can learn: The size of the heart's chambers The strength of the heart muscle called ejection fraction or EF The function of the heart valves (Heart valves can be too tight, called stenotic; or leaky, called regurgitation.) Has the heart muscle been damaged from a heart attack? What are the pressures inside the heart? Nuclear imaging: Myocardial Perfusion Imaging tests use radioactive tracers in the bloodstream and X-rays to see with a high degree of detail the flow of blood through the arteries and thus identification of plaques that prevent normal blood flow. This can be done during exercise or at rest using a medication to simulate exercise. It can also be done during symptoms of a heart attack or acute coronary syndrome to determine if the woman is having a heart attack, or during asymptomatic times to determine the degree of narrowing of the vessels. Because women tend to be more asymptomatic at rest and develop symptoms under stress, it is thought that myocardial perfusion imaging is particularly of value in diagnosing women with coronary artery disease (CAD). Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging can both be used in cardiac perfusion studies with a variety of tracers. They include technetium, thallium, and more recently rubidium. Rubidium is the most sensitive and specific for determining blood flow to the heart muscle. The rubidium test is performed in a PET scanner. Electron beam CT (EBCT) test: Coronary calcium scores (CAC) can be calculated from an EBCT test. This more detailed study measures the amount of calcified plaque in the vessels. CAC has been shown to be an independent predictor of CAD beyond other risk factors. It has also been shown that CAC adds to the sensitivity of SPECT results alone. CAC testing is useful in identifying early atherosclerosis, at a stage when patients can make lifestyle changes to prevent a heart attack."
Invasive testing,"'Cardiac catheterization''/''coronary angiogram'' is the most accurate way CAD can be evaluated; however, it is an invasive test with some risk. In this test, a small tube is threaded through the arteries to the heart where a small amount of dye is released and viewed with X-ray. The person is sedated and local anesthetic is used. From this test, doctors can determine how well blood is flowing through the arteries in the heart wall. One of the advantages of a coronary ''angiogram'' is that therapeutic procedures (an ''angioplasty'') can be immediately performed when a blockage is found (more on this below).' "
Laboratory testing,"'When a woman is suspected of having a heart attack, additional tests are run in the hospital to determine if her heart tissue has been damaged. These tests include:''Cardiac biomarkers like BNP and CRP are better predictors of ischemic events in women as opposed to the routinely checked CKMB and troponins, which do not rise to such high levels in women as in men. Some cardiovascular specialty labs are also ''running'' highly sensitive tests that measure very small amounts of these same substances, and some doctors are using these in hope of detecting very mild ischemia and heart muscle damage that precedes a full heart attack.' Cholesterol tests are still the most useful tool to identify risk; if you only do one thing to measure your risk of cardiovascular disease, have your lipids tested. A lipid panel includes total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). Research shows that low HDL and high TG may be more significant in women than LDL and TC. The total cholesterol:HDL ratio is an important summary of risk and it should be less than 3.5. HDL particles represent healthy processing of lipid. LDL particles tell doctors about lipids that will ultimately need to be stored in tissues, such as blood vessel walls. However, cholesterol isn't simply high density or low density, it is every size and concentration in between (see below). Advanced lipid tests look at these subfractions of lipids in more detail. These tests measure additional properties of lipoproteins such as their size, density, particle number, or concentration. Lipid sub-fraction testing is useful when standard lipid tests do not clearly show if a person is at moderate risk or well protected. They are also useful to guide treatment, such as providing feedback on how successful diet and exercise changes have been. High-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been found to be a better predictor of CVD in women, independent of other biomarkers. It is a marker of inflammation, although it is not specific to cardiac tissue. Many experts suggest that hs-CRP be added to routine lab testing for women at risk for and with CVD. Other biomarkers of inflammation range from the non-specific (fibrinogen, white blood cell count) to the specific. For example, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 or Lp-PLA2, is a measure of inflammation within the plaques in the wall of the artery. Myeloperoxidase is a measure of the inflammatory response in the lumen of the artery and tells doctors about the immune response to ""clean up"" unstable plaques; however, it can also be elevated in other inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disease. The biomarker called F2-isoprostane is not only a marker of inflammation (oxidative stress specifically), it is a chemical signal that triggers vasoconstriction which can cause further cardiovascular problems. Chemical signals called cytokines can also be measured. A few specific cytokines have been shown to independently add information about the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. Those called tumor necrosis factor receptor-II (TNF-II), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) add precision to the doctor's assessment of risk of dying in men and women with cardiovascular disease. creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) levels cardiac troponin levels myoglobin levels B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)"
What is heart disease in women?,'Heart disease'' is the most common cause of death among women. The vast majority of women have at least one risk factor for ''heart disease''.' 
What is the treatment for heart disease in women?,"'In 2004, for the first time, female-specific guidelines were developed by the American Heart Association (AHA) in recognition of the gender differences in both the mechanisms and presentation of ''cardiovascular disease''. In 2011, the guidelines were updated and, also for the first time, the AHA discussed the characteristics of ""ideal ''cardiovascular'' health."" Ideal cardiovascular health includes:''Successful treatments for cardiovascular disease address all of these aspects using lifestyle changes as well as medications and surgical interventions (like ''angioplasty''), if necessary.'  absence of clinical CVD  ideal levels of total cholesterol (<200 mg/dL) ideal blood pressure (<120/80 mm Hg) ideal fasting blood glucose (<100 mg/dL) lean body mass index (<25 kg/m2) abstinence from smoking regular physical activity at recommended levels consumption of a healthy eating pattern such as a plant-based Mediterranean diet"
Diet,"'The classical heart healthy ''diet'' is low fat (<10% saturated fat and <300 mg cholesterol); however, low-fat diets tend to raise ''triglycerides'' (TG) and decrease ''HDL'' (known risk factors for women). New National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) guidelines recognize that the type of fat matters as much, if not more, than the quantity. It is important to differentiate the good quality ''fats'' and eat sufficient quantities while limiting saturated fat, trans fats, and animal fat in general. Heart healthy fats should be consumed to make up 20% to 25% of the ''diet''. Good fats are ''mono''- and poly-unsaturated fats such as olive oil and plant fats (avocado, nuts, seeds, and coconut oil). Unhealthy fats come from animal sources (especially red meat) and processed foods (such as cookies and pastries, especially ones packaged for long shelf life). Several dietary patterns are consistent with this information and are known to protect against and help reverse cardiovascular disease. These include the Dietary Approaches to Stop ''Hypertension'' (DASH) diet, the ''Mediterranean diet'', and the Ornish ''vegetarian'' diet.''The ''DASH diet'' is characterized by being low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. It is focused on fruits, vegetables, and fat-free or low-fat dairy products. It is rich in whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, seeds, and nuts, and contains fewer sweets, added sugars, sugary ''beverages'', and red meats than the typical American diet. The DASH diet has been studied extensively by researchers, and it consistently helps people lower blood pressure, ''lose weight'', and improve ''cholesterol levels''.''Another well-studied protective pattern is the Mediterranean diet. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern has been associated with lower all-cause mortality, less cardiovascular disease, as well as lower rates of ''dementia'', ''diabetes'', and ''cancer''. Additionally, following a Mediterranean diet leads to improvement in overall health. A Mediterranean dietary pattern consists of high amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy fats such as olive oil and low-fat yogurt, plant and marine-based proteins, and moderate wine. Meats and sweets are only rarely consumed. Recently, the large PREDIMED trial compared a low-fat diet to two versions of a Mediterranean diet, enhanced with either olive oil or extra nuts. While all the diets reduced blood pressure, the Mediterranean diets reduced rates of ''myocardial infarction'', ''stroke'', and the number of deaths from cardiovascular causes over a period of about 5 years. The Mediterranean diet also reduced ''blood sugar'' and inflammation, as measured by high-sensitivity ''C-reactive protein'' (hs-CRP).''The Ornish vegetarian diet has also been well-studied and has been shown to not only treat but also reverse ''heart disease''. The Ornish diet is very low in fat and includes more carbohydrate than the Mediterranean or DASH diet; however, the carbohydrates are from whole grains such as oatmeal, quinoa, and brown rice and legumes such as beans and lentils. The research on the Ornish diet emphasizes that the diet is not the only answer; to reverse heart disease, people must make overall lifestyle changes including being physically active, addressing their emotional heart with group support, and practicing meditation or ''yoga''.''What the DASH, Mediterranean, and Ornish diets have in common is that they are all based on unrefined fresh foods, primarily from plants. Importantly for women with cardiovascular disease, the DASH and Mediterranean dietary patterns are low in refined carbohydrates, which means they will help lower ''triglycerides'' and increase HDL -- two major contributors to cardiovascular disease for women.' "
Exercise,"'Almost all women can benefit from increasing the amount of physical activity they get. It is also important to increase the frequency and intensity of ''exercise''. One tool women can use to plan more physical activity is to use the FITT tool, which helps women create an achievable definition for the Frequency, Intensity, Timing, and Type of activity for them. Once activities are selected, women should strive to accumulate at least 150 minutes per week in moderate-intensity ''exercise''.''For each unit of increased exercise capacity a woman achieves, she experiences at 17% reduction in CVD mortality. To determine if you have an age-appropriate exercise capacity, first calculate your maximum heart rate. To do this, subtract your age from 220 (for example, the calculation for a 65-year-old woman would be: 220-65=155). You should be able to reach 85% of your predicted maximum heart rate (be sure to warm up first) and recover your breath within 1 minute of stopping. To calculate 85% of your maximum heart rate, multiply your maximum heart rate by 0.85 (for example, 155 x 0.85=132).' "
Weight management,"'Weight management'' is especially important because 2 out of 3 women in the United States are ''overweight'' or ''obese''. Excess body weight directly increases CVD risk and also leads to a number of conditions that indirectly increase the risk of a ''heart attack'' such as ''diabetes'' and ''hypertension''. When women adopt healthier lifestyle practices and reduce weight, they immediately reduce the risk of developing more significant heart disease.  A recent study showed that women who lost just 10 percent of their body weight and kept it off for 2 years reduced their cholesterol, triglycerides, ''insulin'', ''glucose'', and inflammation markers. Women who had the highest levels of risk at the start of the study benefitted the most from modest ''weight loss''.' "
Smoking cessation,"'Quitting ''smoking'' both reduces risk for future coronary events and improves health status in the presence of existing cardiovascular disease. Even small amounts of ''smoking'"" (1 to 14 cigarettes per day) have a significant negative impact. According to research in the Nurses' Health Study, the benefits of quitting are experienced very quickly. Within 2 years of quitting, cardiovascular risk decreases by one-third. Women continue to benefit for each year they abstain; women who haven't smoked for 20 years are at almost equivalent risk as never-smokers. However, quitting smoking is more difficult for women than for men, according to research, because women report using ""'tobacco'' to self-treat ''depression'', ''anxiety'', weight, and more. In order for women to be successful, they should seek support to address the risk of ''weight gain'' and underlying mood issues.' "
Stress reduction and depression,"'Stress'' is a significant and measurable contributor to heart disease. ''Stress'' not only raises blood pressure, it impacts our ability to stick with the healthy lifestyle behaviors that are needed to manage and prevent heart disease. There are clear benefits to engaging in stress reducing activities. For example, a recent study suggests that transcendental meditation may help in secondary ''prevention'"" of coronary heart disease (preventing a secondary heart attack) and may reduce all cardiovascular events by 48% over a 5-year period. Recommendations for meditation, yoga, and similar approaches have even made it into the American Heart Association's recommendations for blood pressure treatment.""'For many women, the idea of reducing stress is hard to imagine when the day is already over-full with work, errands, cooking, and taking care of others. While it may seem overwhelming to fit in a separate stress-reducing activity, practices such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are techniques for bring a new perspective and enhanced calmness into day-to-day activities. Studies have demonstrated improvement in ''stroke'' recovery with MBSR as well as blood pressure reductions. Mindfulness programs are readily available in many communities.''Screening for and treating ''depression'' is also an important part of treating ''heart disease in women''. Women suffer from ''depression'' more often than men. Questionnaires like the PHQ-8 can help women and their doctors identify ''depression'' quickly. A similar ''screener'' is available at ''Mental Health'' America. Treatment options such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness training are as effective as ''antidepressant'' medication and may have beneficial effects in stress reduction, too.' "
Medications for heart disease in women,"'Aspirin'' therapy is a simple and beneficial strategy for both men and women with or at risk for heart disease.  Aspirin is especially beneficial for women with ''angina'', ''hypertension'', or previous myocardial ''infarction''. Other medications, available by prescription, have only recently been studied in women. Research now shows show that, in some cases, women respond differently than men to prescription medications and thus doctors may need to personalize prescribing for women. For example, women respond less well to the common anticoagulant, ''warfarin''; they have more adverse bleeding events. Women taking warfarin for ''atrial fibrillation'' are at a higher risk for having a ''stroke'' compared to men. There are other medications, for example:''Historically, it was thought that ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'') was a therapeutic option to prevent and treat heart disease in women, but the results of several large studies (including the '""Women's Health""' Initiative) have proven that HRT with conjugated equine ''estrogens'' and progestins increase the risk of CVD for women despite improving ''lipid'' levels. Other evidence-based options are available to address the lipid patterns most common in women (high triglycerides and low HDL) such as ''omega-3 fatty acids'' from ''fish oil'' and ''niacin''.' Beta blockers: These medications appear to be more helpful for women who have had a heart attack. Statins: These medications reduce cholesterol and possibly inflammation and are likely of equal benefit for women and men; however, women have more adverse effects such as myopathy (muscle damage). ACE inhibitors: This is a class of medications that cause blood vessels to relax and may confer less benefit for women. Common side effects such as cough and angioedema are more likely in women. However, they may still be appropriate for many women; women should discuss their options with their doctors."
Angioplasty and stents,"'Angioplasty involves threading a balloon-tipped catheter into an area of ''atherosclerosis'' and inflating it to push the atheroma or fatty deposits against the wall of the artery and reopen the vessel. This is also called a percutaneous intervention (PCI) procedure. Usually, a mesh ''stent'' is also put in place, providing a scaffold to hold the blood vessel open. Increasingly, ''stents'' include medications that slowly release to keep the blood vessel open. Research shows that PCIs may be better option for women (as compared to ''coronary artery bypass'' grafts). However, women have smaller vessels that require more skilled placement of stents. Women are at higher risk of restenosis (a recurrent narrowing of the artery following stent placement), but this may be decreasing with use of drug-eluding stents. Women also have higher rates of complications and bleeding during angioplasty.' "
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),"'Coronary artery bypass grafting is a major surgical procedure in which a blocked vessel is circumvented by sewing in a new vessel next to it, usually taken from the saphenous vein of the leg. This procedure is less commonly done in women (more women get PCIs), and when done, women have more complications. It is thought that this increase in risk is due to the smaller vessels, older age, and increased rates of bleeding issues seen among women. Women undergoing these procedures can reduce their risk of complications with proper surgical preparation and enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation programs afterward.' "
Can heart disease in women be prevented?,"'Heart disease is not inevitable for women! Practicing a healthy lifestyle, identifying and treating risk factors and early signs of preclinical disease, and learning to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack or stroke all make a difference and have been proven to prevent heart disease.''Healthy lifestyle changes should be comprehensive. Eating well, such as following a Mediterranean dietary pattern, not only reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, it reduces risk of other major chronic diseases like ''cancer''. And it is delicious too! A true Mediterranean diet includes unlimited amounts of fruits and vegetables, beans, legumes, and fish. It does not include large amounts of pasta or bread or meat, although these things can be enjoyed occasionally. Most women need intentional exercise beyond their activities of daily living. Women should be able to reach 85% of their age-predicted exercise capacity; women who do have this level of ''fitness'' have half the risk of a coronary event compared to women who cannot exercise at 85% of age-predicted capacity. Women need to attend to the stress in their lives, developing healthy stress coping strategies, engaging in stress reduction activities, and evaluating areas of their lives in which they can remove stressful situations.' "
What is the prognosis for heart disease in women?,"'Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women. The statistics are that while 1 in 31 American women dies from ''breast cancer'' each year, 1 in 3 dies of heart disease. An estimated 90% of women have at least one CVD risk factor. Heart attack symptoms can be different for women and women may not recognize symptoms and call for help in a timely manner. ''Stroke symptoms'' can also go unrecognized. Getting treatment immediately -- within 90 minutes for heart attacks or within 4 hours for strokes -- can make the difference between survival, life-long disability, and death.'""Women who have already experienced a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke (cerebrovascular event) have a lot that they can do to ensure a successful prognosis. Participation in cardiac and stroke rehabilitation programs is very important. Women should become enrolled in a rehabilitation program before they are released from the hospital so they can start as soon as their doctors allow. It is less common for women to be referred to these programs, so women and their families should advocate for themselves to ensure rapid enrollment. Cardiac rehabilitation programs, such as Dean Ornish's Lifestyle Heart Program, include ""'nutrition'' advice, supervised exercise training, careful management of medications, psychosocial support, and more.  Nearly 2 decades of research has shown that ''coronary artery disease'' can not only be managed with comprehensive lifestyle changes, but it can actually be reversed.' "
What research is being done on heart disease in women?,"'Historically, research has lacked equal representation of women in studies. In 1985, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) -- the task force that reviews evidence and makes public health recommendations for health professionals -- launched a campaign to change this. It has made a difference; more women are enrolled in studies and we now know a lot about the differences and similarities in ''vascular disease'' among men and women. Additionally, in 2011, the American Heart Association issued a new set of recommendations about CVD among women. This document recommends a new system of risk classification for women that more accurately helps women and their doctors identify and quantify risk, thereby helping more women get appropriate testing, recommendations, and treatment. Using the new criteria, women fall into three categories.'""When these criteria were applied to over 160,000 women aged 50 to 79 enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, 11% were found to be at high risk, 72% were at risk, and only 4% were at optimal risk (13% were unclassifiable). Among high-risk, at-risk, optimal risk, and unclassified women, the rates of myocardial infarction, death due to cardiovascular causes, or stroke were 19.0%, 5.5%, 2.2%, and 2.6% per 10 years, respectively.""'This is a big difference. Women who engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors and optimally control risk factors have a much lower risk of a serious event, compared to high-risk women who have a much higher risk of a serious event. This underscores the importance of prevention and healthy lifestyle for all women.' High-risk: This risk category is defined by the presence of current disease such as CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or a 10-year Framingham risk >20%. At-risk: The definition of at-risk includes the presence of one or more risk factors including metabolic syndrome, evidence of subclinical vascular disease (for example, coronary calcification), or poor exercise tolerance on treadmill testing. Optimal risk: This defines women who have successfully minimized their risk factors and is defined as a Framingham Risk score <10% and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors."

What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''.

coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
What is heart failure?,"""The term heart failure can be frightening, but in reality, it just means that the heart is not pumping as well as it could be. When the heart muscle is weak, blood cannot be pumped efficiently enough to get oxygen to all of the cells. Sometimes the heart becomes dilated and weak. Other times it may be stiff and thickened. Over time, the heart cannot keep up with its workload. When this happens, there isn't enough oxygenated blood reaching the brain and muscles, and fluid begins to backup in the""'lungs'' and other tissues. The lack of oxygen causes the main symptoms of heart failure such as ''fatigue'', shortness of breath, and difficulty completing tasks that require exertion. ' "
What are the different types of heart failure?,"'The heart has four chambers through which blood pumps. Newly oxygenated blood is pumped from the lungs to the ''left atrium'' and ''left ventricle'' and out through the ''aorta'' to circulate through the rest of the body. After the oxygen has been used, the blood returns through the veins to the ''right atrium'' and ''right ventricle'' into the lungs to be re-oxygenated.'   Systolic heart failure (left-sided heart failure): When the heart loses strength on the left side (left ventricle) and cannot pump the blood into circulation, it is called systolic heart failure or left-sided heart failure. When this occurs, the heart becomes dilated and weak. The strength of the heart muscle can be measured with an echocardiogram that measures the ejection fraction. An ejection fraction of 70% is normal. The term congestive heart failure, or CHF, refers to the accumulation of fluid in the tissues. Fluid can accumulate in the legs causing swelling (edema), into the lungs causing pulmonary edema, or into the abdomen where it is called ascites. A type of heart failure termed acute decompensated heart failure is an emergency. Diastolic heart failure (right-sided heart failure): The second type of heart failure is diastolic heart failure, characterized by the bottom chambers of the heart becoming thicker and stiffer. When this happens, the left ventricle cannot fill with sufficient blood, and not enough blood is pumped into circulation, even if the pumping action is still strong. This is why diastolic heart failure is sometimes referred to as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (PEF), or right-sided heart failure. If the signs and symptoms of heart failure are present and the ejection fractions is greater than 50%, diastolic heart failure may be considered, especially if an echocardiogram shows the heart muscle is thickening."
What are heart failure symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of heart failure include:''Symptoms are usually worse at night when lying flat. Symptoms are very similar for systolic and diastolic heart failure. Your doctor may need further testing to see which type you have.'   Shortness of breath 
Fatigue Lightheadedness 
Exercise intolerance Loss of appetite 
Nausea Coughing (or chronic 
	cough) Wheezing Pounding or racing heart Excessive tiredness Confusion Problems thinking Swelling in the ankles Swelling in the abdomen 
Chest pain"
What are the risk factors for heart failure?,"'The most common risk factors for heart failure include:''Less well recognized risk factors of heart failure include:''All of these also contribute to coronary artery disease, which is a major risk factor for heart failure.' 
	Coronary 
	artery disease Previous heart attack Heart valve problems 
Cardiomyopathy Other major risk factors include:  
High blood pressure Genetics (congenital heart defects) Infections (especially viral 
infections) Obesity Sleep apnea  Nutrient deficiencies An unhealthy diet (low in antioxidant vegetables and high in animal 
	fats) Stress Lack of exercise"
What causes heart failure?,"'The cause of heart failure is a weakened or thickened cardiac muscle. For example, in chronic ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), the heart must pump extra forcefully against the additional ''blood pressure''. First it becomes enlarged and thickened. But over time, the heart weakens, scarring (fibrosis) develops, and it becomes less efficient at pumping. It can become larger (dilated) and weak or thickened and stiff. When the risk factors for heart failure are present, there usually is inflammatory stress, which further damages the cardiac muscle depleting cells of energy and antioxidants. ' "
What are heart failure stages or classifications?,"'While doctors define heart failure in stages or classifications, it represents a progression of heart muscle ''weakness'"". Sometimes people refer to this process as chronic heart failure but technically that term isn't correct.""'The New York Heart Association (NYHA) puts the stages of heart failure into four classifications:''The American Heart Association along with the American College of Cardiology grades heart failure in four stages, and takes into account that heart failure can be present even before symptoms appear:' Class I: no limitations in activity. 
Normal activities can be performed. Class II: mild limitations and mild 
symptoms with activity; no symptoms at rest Class III: noticeable limitations in 
activity; only comfortable at rest Class IV: symptoms occur at any level 
of activity and uncomfortable even resting Stage A: No heart failure, but at high 
risk due to another medical condition that can lead to heart failure, such as 
high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, or coronary artery disease. Stage B: The heart has been damaged by 
	the patient's other medical condition(s) or other factors, but no symptoms 
	are present yet. Stage C: The heart is damaged and the patient is experiencing heart failure symptoms. Stage D: The patient has severe heart failure 
that requires specialized care, despite receiving treatment (end-stage)."
How is heart failure diagnosed?," Heart failure can be diagnosed by physical exam, reported symptoms, or chest 
X-ray.  An echocardiogram test can identify a low ejection fraction or a 
thickened, stiff heart muscle.  Echocardiograms may be used to distinguish 
between systolic and diastolic types of heart failure.  Blood tests such as BNP 
(beta naturetic peptide) suggest heart failure.  Algorithms and guidelines exist 
to score and weigh signs and symptoms to help make the diagnosis. "
What is the treatment for heart failure?,"'Heart failure treatment options include making healthier decisions about lifestyle and diet, taking medications, and sometimes implanting devices. Heart transplant is sometimes considered for certain individuals.''In acute or decompensated heart failure, the person may need hospitalization or even intravenous medications to help recover.'  "
What diet and lifestyle management techniques help heart failure?,"'Many lifestyle and diet factors can improve, or even reverse, congestive heart failure. Cardiac rehabilitation programs can teach people how to make lifestyle changes, as can integrative cardiology clinics. Some of the lifestyle factors that make a difference include:''Talk to your doctor before taking any herbs or ''supplements''.' Manage stress by doing mind-body practices such as Tai Chi, yoga, Qi Gong, and meditation Quit smoking or using tobacco Eliminate alcohol Eat a healthy Mediterranean, vegetarian, or vegan diet Be physically active and become stronger Get enough restful sleep Manage and treat sleep apnea Take dietary supplements including CoQ10, L-carnitine, Crataegus (hawthorne), magnesium, and fish oil Avoiding salt and excess fluids"
What medications treat heart failure?,"'Medications help reduce the symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) and can actually improve heart muscle function. There are several main classes of medications that are used for treating a weak heart muscle. Your physician will choose medications based on your symptoms and whether your heart needs to be strengthened or relaxed. The types of medications commonly prescribed for heart failure include: ' Beta-blockers: carvedilol (Coreg), 
bisoprolol (Zebeta), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol), nebivolol (Bystolic), 
acebutolol (Sectral), atenolol (Tenormin), betaxolol (Kerlone), carteolol 
(Cartrol), esmolol (Brevibloc), penbutolol (Levatol), nadolol (Corgard),

What procedures or surgery treats heart failure?,"'In severe heart failure, devices can help the heart pump better. Left Ventricular Assist Devices (''LVAD'') are implanted mechanical pumps that are most commonly used when people are waiting for heart transplants. '""When medications and lifestyle haven't stopped the progression of heart failure, surgical transplantation of a donor heart can be lifesaving. ""'Other surgical procedures can sometimes be performed earlier to address the risk factors and causes of ''heart disease'' such as ''coronary artery bypass'', percutaneous coronary intervention, or ''angioplasty'' to open the blockages of ''coronary atherosclerosis''. ' "
Which specialties of doctors treat heart failure?,"'You may initially see your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or internist, and in a sudden or severe situation you may be seen by an ''emergency medicine'"" specialist in a hospital's emergency department. ""'You will be referred to a cardiologist, a specialist in disorders of the heart. You also may see some sub-specialties of cardiology, including a cardiac electrophysiologist, who specializes in electrical and heart rhythm problems, or a cardiothoracic surgeon if surgery is needed. ' "
What are the potential complications of heart failure?,"'The complications of heart failure include severe fatigue and weakness, inability to complete activities of daily living, kidney damage, and progressive heart failure that could ultimately require heart transplant. ' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with heart failure?,"'The course of heart failure is highly variable. People who address their risk factors and make lifestyle changes may never progress. However, if changes are not made, if medications are not taken, or if the underlying causes are not correctable, heart failure can become a progressive and eventually fatal condition. This means that the heart muscle will continue to get weaker and have more difficulty keeping up with the workload. Fortunately, many treatment options exist for heart failure.' "
Can heart failure be prevented?," The best way to prevent heart failure is to never have a heart attack, but if you do, there still are treatments. The Lyon Heart study demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet can prevent heart failure among people who have had a heart attack. Following other healthy lifestyle recommendations such as not smoking, not abusing alcohol, eating a plant-based diet, eating a diet that is antioxidant rich, eating an anti-inflammatory diet such as a Mediterranean diet, and being physically active every day may also help prevent heart failure. Treating early signs of heart failure and risk factors such as high blood pressure, being overweight or obese, and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) are also strategies to prevent congestive heart failure.  Stress raises blood pressure, worsens diabetes, and causes coronary artery disease. Learning stress resiliency techniques such as Transcendental Meditation, Yoga, or meditation can reduce the risk of many types of cardiovascular disease."
What is congestive heart failure?,"'Heart failure describes the inability or failure of the heart to meet the needs of organs and tissues for oxygen and nutrients. This decrease in cardiac output, the amount of blood that the heart pumps, is not adequate to circulate the blood returning to the heart from the body and ''lungs'', causing fluid (mainly water) to leak from capillary blood vessels. This leads to the symptoms that may include shortness of breath, ''weakness'', and swelling.''The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs while the left side pumps blood to the rest of the body. Blood from the body enters the ''right atrium'' though the vena cava. It then flows into the ''right ventricle'' where it is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, which carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs. In the lungs, oxygen is loaded onto ''red blood cells'' and returns to the ''left atrium'' of the heart via the pulmonary veins. Blood then flows into the ''left ventricle'' where it is pumped to the organs and tissues of the body. Oxygen is downloaded from red blood cells into the various organs while carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is added to be removed in the lungs. Blood then returns to the right ''atrium'' to start the cycle again. The pulmonary veins are unusual in that they carry oxygenated blood, while the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood. This is a reversal of duties versus the roles of veins and arteries in the rest of the body.''Left heart'' failure occurs when the left ventricle cannot pump blood to the body and fluid backs up and leaks into the lungs causing shortness of breath. Right heart failure occurs when the right ventricle cannot adequately pump blood to the lungs. Blood and fluid may back up in the veins that deliver blood to the heart. This can cause fluid to leak into tissues and organs.''It is important to know that both sides of the heart may fail to function adequately at the same time and this is called biventricular heart failure. This often occurs since the most common cause of right heart failure is left heart failure.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure?,"'The hallmark and most common symptom of left heart failure is ''shortness of breath'' and may occur.'

Chest pain or angina may be associated, especially if the underlying cause of the failure is coronary heart disease. People with right heart failure leak fluid into the tissue and organs that deliver blood to the right heart through the vena cava. Back pressure in capillary blood vessels cause them to leak water into the space between cells and commonly the fluid can be found in the lowest parts of the body. Gravity causes fluid to accumulate in the feet and ankles but as more fluid accumulates, it may creep up to involve all of the lower legs. Fluid can also accumulate within the liver causing it to swell (hepatomegaly) and within the abdominal cavity (ascites). Ascites and hepatomegaly may make the patient feel bloated, nauseated, and have abdominal pain with the feeling of distension. Depending upon their underlying illness and the clinical situation, patients may have symptoms of right heart failure, left heart failure, or both."
What causes congestive heart failure?,"'Many disease processes can impair the pumping efficiency of the heart to cause congestive heart failure. In the United States,. The most common causes of congestive heart failure are:''Less common causes of congestive heart failure include:''In people with congestive heart failure with underlying ''heart disease'', taking certain medications could lead to the development or worsening of the lung disease. Moreover, ''drugs'' that can cause sodium retention or affect the power of the heart muscle. Examples of such medications are the commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs''), which include ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'' and others) and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'' and others) as well as certain steroids, some medication for ''type 2 diabetes'', for example, ''rosiglitazone'' (''Avandia'') or ''pioglitazone'' (''Actos''), and some ''calcium channel blockers'' (''CCBs'').'

What are the stages of congestive heart failure?,"'The New York Heart Association has developed a scale that commonly is used to determine the functional capabilities of heart failure.''New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification of Heart Failure' Class I: Patients without limitation of physical activity. Class II: Patients with slight limitation of physical capacity, in which marked increase in physical activity leads to fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea, or angina pain; they are comfortable at rest. Class III: Patients with marked limitation of physical activity in which minimal ordinary activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or angina pain; they are comfortable at rest. Class IV: Patients who are not only unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort but who also have symptoms of heart failure or the angina syndrome even at rest; the patient's discomfort increases if any physical activity is undertaken."
What are the risk factors for congestive heart failure?,"'Congestive heart failure is often a consequence of ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease'' and therefore the risk factors are the same,\xa0''Heart valve disease'' becomes a risk factor as the patient ages.''Other causes of heart failure have their own set of risk factors and predispositions and it becomes a complication of those diseases. Such causes may include''Many patients have stable congestive heart failure but can decompensate when a change occurs to their body. For example, a patient with congestive heart failure may be doing well but then develops ''pneumonia'', an infection of the lungs, or suffers a ''heart attack''.'""The patient's heart may not be able to react to the body's changing environment and does not have the capability or reserve to meet the body's energy needs.""'Acute decompensation may occur if the patient ''drinks'' excess fluid, has a large intake of salt that can retain water in the body, or forgets to take their routine medication.' poorly controlled high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and family history. obstructive sleep apnea, alcohol and drug abuse, infections, and connective tissue disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis."
What procedures and tests diagnose congestive heart failure?,"'Congestive heart failure can be a medical emergency, especially if it acutely decompensates and the patient can present extremely ill with the inability to breathe adequately. In this situation, the ABCs of resuscitation (''Airway'', ''Breathing'', and Circulation) need to be addressed while at the same time, the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is made.''Common tests that are done to help with the diagnosis of congestive heart failure include the following:''Other tests may be considered to evaluate and monitor a patient with suspected congestive heart failure, depending upon the clinical situation.' Electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) to help assess heart rate, rhythm, and indirectly, the size of the ventricles and blood flow to the heart muscle. Chest X-ray to look at heart size and the presence or absence of fluid in the lungs. Blood tests may include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, glucose, BUN, and creatinine (to assess kidney function). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) may be helpful in deciding if a patient has shortness of breath from congestive heart failure or from a different cause. It is a chemical that is located in the heart ventricles and may be released when these muscles are overloaded. Echocardiography or ultrasound testing of the heart is often recommended to assess the anatomy and the function of the heart. In addition to being able to evaluate the heart valves and muscle, the test can look at blood flow within the heart, watch the chambers of the heart contract, and measure the ejection fraction (percentage of blood ejected with each beat - normal = 50% to 75%)."
What is the treatment for congestive heart failure?,"'The goal of treatment for congestive heart failure is to have the heart beat more efficiently so that it can meet the energy needs of the body. Specific treatment depends upon the underlying cause of heart failure, and include:''Treatment may try to decrease fluid within the body so that the heart does not have to work as hard to circulate blood through the blood vessels in the body. Fluid restriction and a decrease in salt intake may be very helpful.''Common diuretic medications (water pills) include:''Cardiac risk factor modification is the cornerstone of ''prevention'' of congestive heart failure, Moreover, it may benefit patients with congestive heart failure.''Management of congestive heart failure include:''People with end stage congestive heart failure (NYHA stage IV) may require aggressive treatments including left ventricular assist devices (''LVAD'""), an implanted pump that helps increase the heart's ability to squeeze, or even heart transplantation.""'People with congestive heart failure are not transplant candidates, LVAD may be a permanent treatment.'

What lifestyle changes help treat and manage congestive heart failure?,"   After congestive heart failure is diagnosed, treatment should be started immediately. Lifestyle modification is one of the most important aspects a patient can incorporate to treat congestive heart failure. Some of these lifestyle changes includediet, exercise,fluid regulation, andweight maintenance. diet, exercise, fluid regulation, and weight maintenance."
Diet and exercise,"""Sodium causes an increase in fluid accumulation in the body's tissues. Because the body is often congested with excess fluid, patients become very sensitive to the levels of intake of sodium and water. ""'Restricting salt and fluid intake'' is often recommended because of the tendency of fluid to accumulate in the lungs and surrounding tissues.''Aerobic exercise'"", once discouraged for congestive heart failure patients, has been shown to be beneficial in maintaining overall functional capacity, quality of life, and perhaps even improving survival. Each person's body has its own unique ability to compensate for the failing heart. Given the same degree of heart muscle weakness, individuals may display widely varying degrees of limitation of function. Regular exercise, when tailored to the person's tolerance level, appears to provide significant benefits and should be used only when the individual is compensated and stable."" A ""no added salt"" diet can still contain 4 to 6 grams (4000 to 6000 milligrams) of sodium per day. In individuals with congestive heart failure, an intake of no more than 2 grams (2000 milligrams) of sodium per day is generally advised. Reading food labels and paying close attention to total sodium intake is very important. Severe restriction of alcohol consumption."
Fluid regulation,"'The total amount of fluid a patient consumes must be regulated. Although many people with congestive heart failure take prescription diuretics to aid in the elimination of excess fluid, the action of these medications can be overwhelmed by an excess intake of water and other fluids. The maxim that ""drinking eight glasses of water a day is healthy"" certainly does not apply to patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with more advanced cases of congestive heart failure are often advised to limit their total daily fluid intake from all sources to 2 quarts.''The above guidelines for sodium and fluid intake may vary depending on the severity of congestive heart failure in any given individual and should be discussed with their doctor.' "
Maintaining weight," An important tool for monitoring an appropriate fluid balance is the frequent tracking of the patient's body weight. An early sign of fluid accumulation is an increase in body weight. This may occur even before shortness of breath or swelling in the legs and other body tissues (edema) is detected. A weight gain of 2 to 3 pounds over 2 to 3 days should prompt a call to a doctor, who may order an increase in the dose of diuretics or other methods designed to stop the early stages of fluid accumulation before it becomes more severe."
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for congestive heart failure? ,"'Congestive heart failure is generally a progressive disease with periods of stability punctuated by episodic clinical exacerbations. The course of the disease in any given individual, however, is extremely variable. Factors involved in determining the long-term outlook (prognosis) for congestive heart failure include:''With the availability of newer drugs to potentially favorably affect the progression of disease, the prognosis in congestive heart failure is generally more favorable than that observed just 10 years ago. In some cases, especially when the heart muscle dysfunction has recently developed, a significant spontaneous improvement is not uncommonly observed, even to the point where ''heart function'' becomes normal.'""Heart failure is often graded on a scale of I to IV based on the patient's ability to function.""'The prognosis of heart failure patients is very closely associated with the functional class.''An important issue in congestive heart failure is the risk of heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). Of those deaths that occur in individuals with congestive heart failure, approximately 50% are related to progressive heart failure. Importantly, the other half are thought to be related to serious arrhythmias.''A major advance has been the finding that nonsurgical placement of automatic implantable ''cardioverter''/defibrillators (AICD) in individuals with severe congestive heart failure (defined by an ejection fraction below 30% to 35%) can significantly improve survival, and has become the standard of care in most such individuals.'""In some people with severe heart failure and certain ECG abnormalities, the left and right side of the heart don't beat in rhythm, and inserting a device called a biventricular pacer can significantly reduce symptoms.""   The nature of the underlying heart disease Response to medications The degree to which other organ systems are involved and the severity of other accompanying conditions The person's symptoms and degree of impairment Other factors that remain poorly understood Class I includes patients with a weakened heart but without limitation or symptoms. Class II describes patients whose only limitation is heavier workloads. Class III includes patients who experience limitation with everyday activity. Class IV describes patients with severe symptoms at rest or with any degree of effort."
Can you prevent congestive heart failure?,"'Diastolic dysfunction:'' This is a form of CHF in which the heart muscle may be stiff, most often from ''hypertension'' or normal ''aging''. The ejection fraction is normal and the prognosis is excellent. The problem is that a stiff heart muscle fills with blood at a higher pressure, which is transmitted to the lungs resulting in shortness of breath. It must be emphasized that the long-term outlook for patients with this condition is excellent.' Congestive heart failure is the result of an underlying illness, whitch is often atherosclerotic heart disease. Controlling those risk factors may help with congestive heart failure prevention. These include lifelong control of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes and smoking cessation. High blood pressure and diabetes are independent risks for congestive heart failure. Alcohol and drug abuse may be a cause of heart failure."
How can you cope living with congestive heart failure?,'Resources available for patients trying to cope with the long-term challenges of congestive heart failure include:' Local support groups; Cardiac rehab programs designed for congestive heart failure (covered by many types of insurance); and Self-monitoring of weight and fluid intake.
What does the heart look like and how does it work?,"'This article is designed to help individuals learn the heart anatomy and circulatory system, and provide some insight about heart health. It is not designed to present the many problems that can occur with the heart.' The heart is an amazing organ. It starts beating about 22 days after conception and continuously pumps oxygenated red blood cells and nutrient-rich blood and other compounds like platelets throughout your body to sustain the life of your organs. Its pumping power also pushes blood through organs like the lungs to remove waste products like CO2. This fist-sized powerhouse beats (expands and contracts) about 100,000 times per day, pumping five or six quarts of blood each minute, or about 2,000 gallons per day. In general, if the heart stops beating, in about 4-6 minutes of no blood flow, brain cells begin to die and after 10 minutes of no blood flow, the brain cells will cease to function and effectively be dead. There are few exceptions to the above. The heart works by a regulated series of events that cause this muscular organ to contract (squeeze to push blood) and then relax (refill with blood). The normal heart has 4 chambers that undergo the squeeze and relax cycle at specific time intervals that are regulated by a normal sequence of electrical signals that arise from specialized tissue. In addition, the normal sequence of electrical signals can be sped up or slowed down depending on the needs of the individual, for example, the heart will automatically speed up electrical signals to respond to a person running and will automatically slow down when a person takes a nap."
"Heart diagram parts, location, and size","'Normal heart anatomy and physiology need the atria and ventricles to work sequentially, contracting and relaxing to pump blood out of the heart and then to let the chambers refill. When blood leaves each chamber of the heart, it passes through a valve that is designed to prevent backflow of blood. There are four heart valves within the heart:' The heart is located under the rib cage -- 2/3 of it is to the left of your breastbone (sternum) -- and between your lungs and above the diaphragm. The heart is about the size of a closed fist, weighs about 10.5 ounces and is somewhat cone-shaped. It is covered by a sack termed the pericardium or pericardial sack. The normal heart anatomy consists of a four-chambered, hollow organ. It is divided into the left and right side by a muscular wall called the septum. The right and left sides of the heart are further divided into two top chambers called the atria (also termed the right and left atrium), which receive blood and then pump it into the two bottom chambers called ventricles, which pump blood to the lungs and to the body. The coronary arteries are on the heart surface (left main, right coronary). The coronary arteries and veins comprise the heart’s own mini-circulatory system. Two major coronary arteries branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta and the left ventricle meet: Right coronary artery supplies the right atrium and right ventricle with blood. It branches into the posterior descending artery, which supplies the bottom portion of the left ventricle and back of the septum with blood. Left main coronary artery branches into the circumflex artery and the left anterior descending artery. The circumflex artery supplies blood to the left atrium, side and back of the left ventricle, and the left anterior descending artery supplies the front and bottom of the left ventricle and the front of the septum with blood. These arteries and their branches supply all parts of the heart muscle with blood. Mitral valve between the left atrium and left ventricle Tricuspid valve between the right atrium and right ventricle Aortic valve between the left ventricle and aorta Pulmonic valve (also called pulmonary valve) between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery The heart valves work the same way as one-way valves in the plumbing of your home. They prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction. Each valve has a set of flaps, called leaflets or cusps. The mitral valve has two leaflets; the others have three. The leaflets are attached to and supported by a ring of tough, fibrous tissue called the annulus. The annulus helps to maintain the proper shape of the valve. The leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves are also supported by tough, fibrous strings called chordae tendineae. These are similar to the strings supporting a parachute. They extend from the valve leaflets to small muscles, called papillary muscles, which are part of the inside walls of the ventricles. The endocardium is the membrane composed of epithelial cells that line the heart chambers and valves. It provides a slick surface so that red blood cells, platelets and other substances in blood will not stick to the heart’s inner surface. It also contains Purkinje fibers (specialized muscle cells that can transmit electrical impulses that can cause heart muscle contraction) and collagen fibers to make the endocardium elastic. In addition, a cluster of cells that are located in the upper right atrium is termed the SA (sinoatrial node or pacemaker), which generates electrical impulses. These impulses move down cells toward the AV node (atrioventricular node), another cluster of cells located near the center of the heart between the bottom of the right atria and the top of the ventricles. The AV node pauses the electrical impulse long enough to have the atria fully contract (squeeze blood out into the ventricles); then it allows the impulse to go into cells termed the bundle of His to the ventricles that split into the right and left bundle branches in the ventricles. The electrical impulse finally reaches Perkinje fibers and then cause the ventricles to contract to push blood into the lungs and aorta. The heart rate (pulse) and blood pressure are generated by ventricular contractions; the SA node impulse rate is influenced by the body’s autonomic nervous system. At rest, a normal heart beats around 50 to 99 times a minute. Exercise, emotions, fever, and some medications can cause your heart to beat faster, sometimes to well over 100 beats per minute."
How does blood flow through the right and left side of the heart?,"'The right and left sides of the heart work together. The pattern described below is repeated over and over (heart rhythm), causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body cells and to deliver waste products to organs that remove them from your body. In general, veins return blood carrying CO2 while arteries usually contain O2 enriched red blood cells. However, the blood flow through the heart is a little different. For example:' Blood enters the heart through two large veins, the inferior and superior vena cava, emptying oxygen-poor blood from the body into the right atrium of the heart. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your right atrium into your right ventricle through the open tricuspid valve. When the ventricle is full, the tricuspid valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atria while the ventricle contracts. • As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery and to the lungs where it is oxygenated. Note that oxygen-poor or CO2 containing blood goes through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where CO2 is exchanged for O2. The pulmonary vein empties oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left atrium of the heart. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your left atrium into your left ventricle through the open mitral valve. When the ventricle is full, the mitral valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atrium while the ventricle contracts. As the ventricle contracts, oxygen-enriched blood leaves the heart through the aortic valve, into the aorta and to the arteries and eventually into veins to complete the blood circulation in your body."
How does blood flow through the heart to the lungs?," Once blood travels through the pulmonic valve, it enters your lungs. This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, passes from the blood into the air sacs. Carbon dioxide leaves the body when you exhale. Once the blood is purified and oxygenated, it travels back to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins."
How can you prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'According to the American Heart Association, no matter what age you are, your heart can benefit from a healthy ''diet'' and adequate physical activity.\xa0Tthere are numerous specific suggestions about how you can decrease your risk for ''heart disease''. For example:' Lower cholesterol (During and after menopause, cholesterol levels remain high so talk with your doctor about treatmenet and management.). Lower tryglicerides. Treat and manage high blood pressure. Treat and manage diabetes. Weight management. Heart healthy diet. Exercise. Reduce stress. Quit smoking cigarettes. Family history of heart disease at a young age"
When Is a Lead Extraction Needed?,"'This procedure is needed when your leads are not working properly. This can be caused by:' Damage to the inside (called a fracture) or outside of the lead. Large amounts of scar tissue form at the tip of the lead, causing it to need more energy to function than your pacemaker or ICD can deliver. This condition is known as ""exit block."" Infection at the site of the device and lead implant."
How Do I Prepare For a Lead Extraction,"'To prepare for the procedure, you should:' Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain drugs one to five days before your test. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how you should adjust your medications. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before your test. If you must take medications, drink only with a sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry or valuables at home. You will need to stay in the hospital overnight. Bring items with you (such as robe, slippers, and toothbrush) that may make your stay more comfortable. When you are able to return home, arrange for a companion to drive you home."
What to Expect During a Lead Extraction:,"'A lead extraction procedure takes about two to six hours to perform.' You will be given a hospital gown to wear. You will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous (IV) line in your arm so that medications and fluids can be given during the procedure. Your chest and groin area will both be shaved and cleansed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes are used to cover you from your neck to your feet to prevent infection. It is important that you keep your arms and hands down at your sides and not disturb the drapes. A soft strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in to contact with the sterile field. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. You may feel nervous. You will be given a drug through your IV that will make you sleep throughout most of the procedure. Your doctor and nurse will be with you and if you are uncomfortable or need anything during the procedure, let your nurse know. The lead extraction can be performed through one of two sites: Subclavian vein (in the upper chest) -- most frequently used. An incision is made in the upper chest over the subclavian vein. Femoral vein (in the groin) -- used when the subclavian approach cannot be performed. A small puncture (instead of an incision) is made in the groin over the femoral vein. The doctor will numb the site. A sheath (plastic, hollow tube) is placed in the vein and guided to the tip of the lead (where the lead attaches to the heart). The sheath helps to hold the heart muscle in place while removing the lead. A laser or special electrosurgical sheath is used to deliver energy to remove scar tissue from the lead. You will be in a light sleep during this part of the procedure. You may feel the pulling as the leads are removed, but you should not feel pain. New leads may be implanted (placed in your heart) during this procedure or at a later date. This will depend on the reason your current leads are being removed. Discuss this with your doctor."
After the Lead Extraction,"'WebMD Medical Reference' The doctor will remove the sheath. You will be admitted to the hospital overnight. You will be placed on a special monitor called telemetry that allows your heart rhythm to be displayed on monitors in the nursing unit. If you had new leads and a pacemaker implanted, you will also have a Holter monitor to record your heart rhythm for several hours. This is another way to check proper pacemaker function. If the femoral approach was used, you will need to lay flat in bed for several hours after the procedure. The morning after your lead extraction you will have a chest X-ray to check your lungs and the position of any new leads that may have been implanted. Before you leave the hospital, your doctor and nurse will talk to you about activity, medications or any follow-up appointments"
What is a heart murmur?,"'A heart murmur is a continuous sound that is audible with a common stethoscope, produced when blood passes through particular areas of the heart. The heart has four chambers, two atria (singular = ''atrium'') and two ventricles separated by a ""skeleton"" of cartilage that separates each chamber. This skeleton is made up of the atrial septum, the ventricular septum, and four valves (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid) that direct blood flow in a specific route within the heart allowing the most efficient use of each heartbeat to pump blood to the rest of the body.''The sound of a murmur is generated when blood flow within the heart is not smooth and turbulence occurs. Using a stethoscope, a health care practitioner may be able to hear a heart murmur during the physical examination. Not all heart murmurs are abnormal or dangerous and may be innocent, but if one is present it may potentially signal a structural abnormality of the heart.'   Each heartbeat has two phases, systole when the heart pumps and diastole when the heart chambers fill with blood. Blood enters the right atrium from the body via the vena cava. It travels through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. A systolic heartbeat sends the blood through the pulmonary valve, which separates the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, to the lung. In the lung, oxygen is delivered to red blood cells and carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is removed. The oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium where it travels through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The systolic heartbeat also causes the left side of the heart to contract and send the blood through the aortic valve that separates the left ventricle and the aorta. Blood passes through the aorta to the body delivering oxygen to the body's tissues."
"What are the signs and symptoms of heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","""A heart murmur itself does not causes symptoms. Generally, it doesn't cause symptoms, and can't be heard by the person with the murmur. The underlying structural issue of the heart may cause problems; however, any heart murmurs are innocent and of no consequence.""'Newborns with congenital ''heart disease'' may have symptoms and signs of a heart murmur who have difficulty ''breathing'' and who are cyanotic. The heart cannot circulate blood and oxygen from the ''lungs'' to the body. Some infants with heart issues may have:'   Difficulty feeding Difficulty developing, and gaining weight appropriately. Most heart murmurs in well-developed children are harmless. In adults, heart abnormalities may cause chest pain, and heart failure with symptoms of shortness of breath and swelling of the extremities. Palpitations or a sensation of an irregular heartbeat are occasionally seen in people with with heart valve abnormalities."
"What causes heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'Many heart murmurs are harmless and referred to as innocent or functional. They are caused when blood rushes through the heart quickly during normal function while no ''heart disease'' may exist. There may be an underlying medical condition that can lead to an innocent murmur. These may include situations where the heart beats more quickly such as ''fever'', ''anemia'', ''hyperthyroidism'', and ''pregnancy''.''Congenital heart murmurs are heard in the ''newborn''. They may be due to abnormalities in the valves, septae, or arteries, and veins that carry blood to and from the heart. In some complicated ''heart disease'' conditions there may be a combination of all three. Many congenital heart murmurs resolve spontaneously without medical intervention while others require surgical operations for repair.''Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may cause a heart murmur in a ''newborn'"". Prior to birth, the aorta and pulmonary artery are connected by a small artery, the ductus arteriosus, to complete fetal blood circulation since oxygen is supplied to the fetus by the placenta. Shortly after birth, this artery is supposed to close. If other congenital heart abnormalities exist, the ductus may remain open to help maintain some blood circulation. Sometimes, when no congenital abnormalities exist, the ductus doesn't completely close and a murmur may exist. Many times the patent ductus arteriosus closes by itself over time. Occasionally, medications or surgery may be required to close off a patent ductus arteriosus.""'Abnormalities of the valves of the heart may cause a heart murmur. Any of the heart valves may be affected and clinical symptoms depend upon the severity of the valve damage and whether the blood flow pattern within the heart is maintained. Each valve problem often leads to a specific character and timing of heart murmur.''Holes in the walls of the heart (the septum that divides the heart chambers) can be the source of a heart murmur. Atrial septal defect (''ASD'') describes a hole in the wall that separates the collecting chamber of the heart while a ''ventricular septal defect'' (VSD) affects the wall dividing the pumping chamber.'   Valve stenosis is narrowing of a heart valve. This often occurs over time as the valve scars due to injury and scarring from infection such as in rheumatic fever or from a congenital birth defect. Calcification of a valve may also result in stenosis. This causes the heart muscle to work harder to push blood through the narrowed opening. Like any muscle that has to work harder, heart muscle will hypertrophy and thicken. Heart failure, where fluid builds up in the lungs and extremeties, may be a complication. Valve regurgitation (or insufficiency) is a valve that leaks causing blood to pass backward against the normal blood flow pattern in the heart. A valve may have both stenosis and regurgitation. Valve sclerosis is the mild narrowing and stiffening of the valve (most often seen in the aortic valve) due to aging. It is associated with atherosclerotic heart disease. Valve prolapse is a bowing of a valve that causes some leaking and most often involves the mitral valve. Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart that may involve and destroy a heart valve. The source of the infection is usually elsewhere in the body and it travels via the bloodstream to infect the heart. There may be a previous underlying heart condition."
"What are the risk factors for heart murmur in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is a physical finding of an underlying heart condition and in many instances may be of no consequence. The risk factor for developing a particular murmur is the risk factor for the underlying condition.' Congenital heart disease tends to have a familial basis, meaning that there may be a genetic predisposition for a baby to develop a structurally abnormal heart. Some valvular diseases are present at birth, but take a lifetime to develop symptoms. For example, the aortic valve is supposed to have three leaflets that come together; some people are born with a valve that has only two leaflets (bicuspid). Over time, a two-leafed valve may be more prone to calcification and narrowing. Symptoms may only be seen later in life. Some valve diseases are due to infection (endocarditis). Historically, rheumatic fever described heart valve inflammation as a consequence of a bacterial streptococcus infection. With present day screening for strep infections and the appropriate use of antibiotics, this rheumatic heart disease is rare. Endocarditis may be seen as a complication of intravenous drug abuse. Other risk factors for heart valve abnormalities include atherosclerotic heart disease, heart attack, aortic aneurysm, and connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Marfan syndrome. Each condition affects the valves in a different way causing them to malfunction and develop the physical finding of a heart murmur."
"What exams, tests, and imaging studies diagnose heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is usually diagnosed during a physical examination by the health care practitioner while he or she listens to heart sounds with a stethoscope.''Evaluation of the heart begins with questions relating to ''heart function''. In an adult, some questions may include asking about chest ''pain'' or pressure, ''shortness of breath'' with exertion or at rest, and swelling of the legs. In an infant, the symptoms may include poor sucking or eating, poor ''weight gain'' and growth, or episodes of ''cyanosis'' (''turning blue'').''Physical examination includes assessing skin color, feeling and assessing pulses, evaluating the legs looking for swelling and ''edema'', and listening to the lungs for signs of fluid buildup.''Heart evaluation includes assessing the rate and rhythm of the heart. Is it too fast, too slow, regular, or irregular? The front of the chest can be palpated; a hand is placed on the area overlying the heart trying to feel for a vibration (thrill) that can occur with an especially significant heart murmur.''Listening to the heart with the stethoscope begins with assessing basic first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2, which sound like ""lub-dub."" Potential extra heart sounds are referred to as S3 and S4. Should a heart murmur be heard, the health care practitioner will try to determine whether the sound is coming from an abnormal valve or a defect in the atrial or ventricular septum. The murmur is described whether it is heard in systole (when the heart is pumping) or diastole (when the heart is filling). The location on the chest and where the sound radiates is important in determining where the murmur originates. The intensity of the murmur is usually graded on a 6 point scale are:''Murmurs graded 4, 5, and 6 have an associated vibration (thrill) felt when the chest wall is palpated:''Many murmurs are diagnosed as normal (physiologic) based upon physical examination and require no further evaluation.''Initial testing may include an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') which can help evaluate the heart rate and rhythm, electrical conduction within the heart, and whether hypertrophy or excess heart muscle has developed. A ''chest X-ray'' may help evaluate heart size and shape and may find excess ''fluid in the lungs'' due to abnormal heart function.''If further testing is required, often an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound'') examination of the heart is helpful in visualizing the structures and functions of the heart. The ''echocardiogram'' can help to determine the specific diagnosis when a heart murmur is present. A ''cardiac catheterization'' is an invasive test whereby dye is injected directly into the blood passing through the heart structures to help evaluate their status.'   1/6 faintly heard 2/6 easily heard but soft 3/6 easily heard but loud 4/6 loud murmur 5/6 loud murmur that can be heard with only part of the stethoscope touching the chest 6/6 loud murmur that can be heard with the stethoscope off the chest"
"What is the treatment for heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'The treatment for heart murmur depends upon the particular cause and the underlying medical status of the patient. Many murmurs need no further evaluation, can be monitored, or are a normal variant. Some murmurs are associated with serious infected valves and require antibiotics. Some valves are structurally damaged and require surgical repair. Atrial septal and ventricular septal defects may require surgery for repair, depending upon the situation.''Newborns, infants, and children who have congenital heart disease may need the help of a cardiologist to determine the need for medications, surgery, or observation.' "
"What are the complications of a heart murmur in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is the physical finding of an underlying structural issue within the heart. A heart murmur itself has no complications. The ramifications of a heart murmur are based on the particular underlying abnormality causing the murmur, and the effect it has on cardiac physiology.'  "
"What is the prognosis and life expectancy for infants, children, and adults with a heart murmur?","'Many people have physiologic heart murmurs and need no intervention or care. Those whose heart murmurs signal that there is a structural issue with the heart may be monitored for symptoms that gradually develop over time.''In infants and children, heart murmurs due to atrial or ventricular septal defects may need surgery to repair the abnormality and they can expect to have a normal heart after repair.''In adults, medications and lifestyle changes may help minimize the need for surgery to repair or replace a damaged heart valve. The goal is to return the blood flow patterns in the heart to normal, and allow the person to return to an active and normal lifestyle.' "
"When should in infants, child, and adults seek medical care for a heart murmur?"," Generally, a heart murmur does not cause symptoms. It is the underlying heart function issues that often cause people to seek medical help. Chest pain and shortness of breath should always be taken seriously and not ignored. Medical help should be accessed immediately if a person has heart or lung concerns."
"Can heart murmurs be prevented in infants, children, and adults?","'It is important to remember that a heart murmur is a physical finding and is not a disease or structural heart problem. Rather it is the sound that is made because of a potential blood flow problem within the heart. Maintaining a life-long heart-healthy lifestyle may help prevent some heart valve issues. These lifestyle opportunities include keeping ''blood pressure'', ''cholesterol'', and ''diabetes'' under control. It is a positive choice not to smoke. Regular ''exercise'' and ''weight management'' also contribute to a healthy heart.''Historically, ''rheumatic fever'' was a complication of ''strep throat'' (streptococcal ''pharyngitis''). This could cause heart valve damage and the development of a heart murmur. With the advent of good screening tests for ''strep'' infections and the appropriate use of antibiotics, ''rheumatic fever'' is a rarely diagnosed condition.' "
What Is Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,"'Restrictive ''cardiomyopathy'', the rarest form of ''cardiomyopathy'', is a condition in which the walls of the lower chambers of the ''heart'' (the ventricles) are abnormally rigid and lack the flexibility to expand as the ventricles fill with blood.''The pumping or systolic function of the ventricle may be normal but the diastolic function (the ability of the heart to fill with blood) is abnormal. Therefore, it is harder for the ventricles to fill with blood, and with time, the heart loses the ability to pump blood properly, leading to ''heart failure''.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,"'Many people with restrictive ''cardiomyopathy'' have no symptoms or only minor symptoms, and live a normal life. Other people develop symptoms, which progress and worsen as ''heart function'' worsens.''Symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy can occur at any age and may include:''Less common symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy:'  Shortness of breath (at first with exercise; but over time it occurs at rest) Fatigue (feeling overly tired) Inability to exercise Swelling of the legs and feet Weight gain Nausea, bloating, and poor appetite (related to fluid retention) Palpitations (fluttering in the chest due to abnormal heart rhythms) Fainting (usually caused by irregular heart rhythms or abnormal responses of the blood vessels during exercise) Chest pain or pressure (occurs usually with exercise or physical activity but can also occur with rest or after meals)"
What Causes Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,'Restrictive cardiomyopathy is not usually ''inherited'' and its cause is often unknown. Known causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy may include:' Buildup of scar tissue (often for no known reason) Buildup of abnormal proteins (amyloidosis) in the heart muscle Chemotherapy or chest exposure to radiation Excess iron (hemochromatosis) in the heart Other systemic diseases (e.g. (sarcoidosis)
How is Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Diagnosed?,"'The size of the heart may remain normal with restrictive cardiomyopathy. In some cases, restrictive cardiomyopathy may be confused with ''constrictive pericarditis'', a condition in which the layers of the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) become thickened, calcified, and stiff.''Restrictive cardiomyopathy is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), physical exam, and tests: such as blood tests, ''electrocardiogram'', ''chest X-ray'', ''echocardiogram'', ''exercise stress test'', ''cardiac catheterization'', ''CT scan'', and ''MRI''.''A ''myocardial biopsy'', or biopsy of the heart muscle, occasionally is done to determine the cause of cardiomyopathy. During a myocardial biopsy, a small tissue sample is taken from the heart and examined under a microscope to examine the cause of the symptoms.' "
What Is the Treatment for Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,'Treatment of restrictive cardiomyopathy is difficult. Treatment is usually focused on treating the cause of this condition. Doctors recommend lifestyle changes and medications to treat heart failure.' 
What Lifestyle Changes Are Recommended for Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,"'Lifestyle changes can help restrictive cardiomyopathy. They might include:''Diet''.'' Once you have symptoms such as shortness of breath or ''fatigue'', you should restrict your intake of salt (sodium) to 2,000 milligrams to 3,000 milligrams per day. Follow this ''diet'' even when your symptoms abate.''Exercise.'' Your doctor will tell you if you may exercise or not. While exercise is generally good for the heart, people with this form of cardiomyopathy may experience ''fatigue'' and shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion. Therefore, experts recommend that you take frequent breaks, exercise at a time of day where you have the most energy and start slow, gradually building up strength and endurance. Heavy ''weight lifting'' is not recommended.' "
What Medications Are Used for Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,"'Often, medications are used to treat symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy and prevent further complications. To manage heart failure, some people may improve by taking a ''beta-blocker'' and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. If symptoms occur, ''digoxin'', diuretics, and aldosterone inhibitors may be added. If you have an ''arrhythmia'', your doctor may prescribe a medication to control your heart rate or lessen the occurrence of arrhythmia. Therapy may also be given to treat certain conditions, such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and ''hemochromatosis''. Your doctor will discuss what medications are best for you.' "
Can Surgery Treat Restrictive Cardiomyopathy?,"'In some cases, if the condition is severe, ''heart transplant'' surgery may be considered for restrictive cardiomyopathy.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What Is Dilated Cardiomyopathy?,"'Dilated ''cardiomyopathy'' (DCM) is a condition in which the ''heart'""'s ability to pump blood is decreased because the heart's main pumping chamber, the ""'left ventricle'', is enlarged and weakened. In some cases, it prevents the heart from relaxing and filling with blood as it should. Over time, it can affect the other heart chambers.' "
What Are the Symptoms of DCM?,"'Many people with dilated ''cardiomyopathy'' have no symptoms or only minor symptoms, and live a normal life. Other people develop symptoms, which may progress and worsen as ''heart function'' worsens.''Symptoms of DCM can occur at any age and may include:'   Heart failure symptoms (shortness of breath and fatigue). Swelling of the lower extremities. Fatigue (feeling overly tired). Weight gain. Fainting (caused by conditions such as irregular heart rhythms, abnormal responses of the blood vessels during exercise, or no cause may be found). Palpitations (fluttering in the chest due to abnormal heart rhythms). Dizziness or lightheadedness. Blood clots can form in the dilated left ventricle as a result of pooling of the blood. If a blood clot breaks off, it can lodge in an artery and disrupt blood flow to the brain, causing stroke. A clot can also block blood flow to the organs in the abdomen or legs. Chest pain or pressure. Sudden death."
What Causes DCM?,"'DCM can be ''inherited'', but it is primarily caused by a variety of other factors, including:''It can also occur in women after ''childbirth'' (postpartum ''cardiomyopathy'').'   Severe coronary artery disease Alcoholism Thyroid disease Diabetes Viral infections of the heart Heart valve abnormalities Drugs that are toxic (or cause damage) to the heart"
How Is DCM Diagnosed?,"'DCM is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), physical exam, blood tests, ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'' or ''EKG''), ''chest X-ray'', ''echocardiogram'', ''exercise stress test'', ''cardiac catheterization'', ''CT scan'', and ''MRI''.''Another test rarely done to determine the cause of a cardiomyopathy is a ''myocardial biopsy'', or heart biopsy, where a tissue sample is taken from the heart and examined under a microsope to determine the cause of the symptoms.''If you have a relative with dilated cardiomyopathy, ask your doctor if you should be screened for the condition. Genetic testing may also be available to identify abnormal genes.' "
What Is the Treatment for DCM?,"'Treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy is aimed at decreasing the heart size and the substances in the bloodstream that enlarge the heart and ultimately lead to worsened symptoms:''Medications:'' To manage heart failure, most people improve by taking drugs, such as a ''beta-blocker'', ACE inhibitor an ARB, and/or diuretics. If you have an ''arrhythmia'' (irregular heart beat), your doctor may give you a medication to control your heart rate or lessen the occurrence of arrhythmias. Blood thinners may be used to prevent blood clots from occurring.''Lifestyle changes:'' If you have heart failure, sodium should be restricted to 2,000-3,000 mg per day -- for the rest of your life. Your doctor may recommend ''aerobic exercise'"", but don't do heavy ""'weight lifting''.' "
What Surgeries Are Used to Treat DCM?,"'People with severe DCM may need one of the following surgeries:''WebMD Medical Reference' Cardiac resynchronization by biventricular pacemaker. For some people with DCM, stimulating both the right and left ventricles with this pacemaker improves the heart's ability to contract with more force, thereby improving symptoms and increasing the length of time you can exercise. This pacemaker also will help people with heart block or some bradycardias (slow heart rates). Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). ICDs are suggested for people at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. The ICD constantly monitors the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it ''shocks'' the heart muscle into returning to a normal rhythm. Surgery. Conventional surgeries for coronary artery disease or valvular disease may be recommended. Some people may be eligible for surgical repair of the left ventricle or placement of a cardiac assist device. Heart transplant"
What Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?,"'Hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' (HCM) is associated with thickening of the ''heart'' muscle, most commonly at the septum between the ventricles, below the ''aortic valve''. This leads to stiffening of the walls of the heart and abnormal aortic and mitral heart valve function, both of which may impede normal blood flow out of the heart.' "
What Are the Symptoms of HCM?,"'\tMany people with ?hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' (HCM) have no symptoms or only minor symptoms, and live a normal life. Other people develop symptoms, which progress and worsen as ''heart function'' worsens.''\tSymptoms of HCM can occur at any age and may include:'   
Chest pain or pressure (occurs usually with exercise or physical activity, but can also occur with rest or after meals). 
Shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially with exertion. 
Fatigue (feeling overly tired). 
Fainting (caused by irregular heart rhythms, abnormal responses of the blood vessels during exercise, or no cause may be found). 
Palpitations (fluttering in the chest) due to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. 
Sudden death occurs in a small number of patients with HCM."
What Causes HCM?,"'\tHypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' (HCM) can run in families, but the condition may also be acquired as a part of ''aging'' or ''high blood pressure''. In other instances, the cause is unknown.' "
How Is HCM Diagnosed?,"'HCM is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), a physical exam, and ''echocardiogram'' results. Additional tests may include blood tests, ''electrocardiogram'', ''chest X-ray'', ''exercise stress test'', ''cardiac catheterization'', ''CT scan'', and ''MRI''.' "
How Is HCM Treated?,"'Treatment of HCM depends on whether there is narrowing in the path that blood takes to leave the heart (called the outflow tract); how the heart is functioning; and if arrhythmias are present. Treatment is aimed at preventing symptoms and complications and includes risk identification and regular follow-up, lifestyle changes, medications, and procedures as needed.' "
What Lifestyle Changes Are Recommended to Treat HCM?," Diet. Drinking at least six to eight, 8-ounce glasses of water a day is important, unless fluids are restricted. In hot weather, you should increase your fluid intake. Fluid and salt restrictions may be necessary for some patients if heart failure symptoms are present. Ask your doctor about specific fluid and dietary guidelines, including information about alcoholic beverages and caffeinated products. Exercise. Your doctor will tell you if you may exercise or not. Most people with cardiomyopathy are able to do non-competitive aerobic exercise. However, your doctor may ask you not to exercise, based on your symptoms and the severity of your disease. Heavy weight lifting is not recommended. Regular follow-up visits. Patients with HCM should have an annual follow-up visit with their cardiologist to monitor their condition. Follow-up appointments may be more frequent when HCM is first diagnosed."
What Medications Are Used?,"'Often, ''drugs'' are used to treat symptoms and prevent further complications of HCM. Medications can help relax the heart and reduce the degree of obstruction so the heart can pump more efficiently. ''Beta-blockers'' and ''calcium channel blocker'' blockers are two classes of medications that may be prescribed. If you have an ''arrhythmia'', your doctor may prescribe medications to control your heart rate or decrease the occurrence of arrhythmias.''You may be told to avoid certain medications, such as ''nitrates'', because they lower ''blood pressure'', or ''digoxin'"", because it increases the force of the heart's contraction.""'Non-obstructive HCM symptoms may be treated with medications. If heart failure occurs, treatment is aimed at controlling it through heart failure medications and ''diet'' changes.''Your doctor will discuss which medications are best for you.' "
What Surgical Procedures Are Used to Treat HCM?,"'Surgical procedures used to treat HCM include:' Septal myectomy. During this surgical procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall of the heart to widen the outflow tract (the path the blood takes) from the left ventricle to the aorta. Ethanol ablation. First, a cardiologist (heart doctor) performs a cardiac catheterization to locate the small coronary artery that supplies blood flow to the septum. A balloon catheter is inserted into the artery and inflated. A contrast agent is injected to locate the swollen septal wall that narrows the passageway from the left ventricle to the aorta. When the bulge is located, a tiny amount of pure alcohol is injected through the catheter. The alcohol kills the cells on contact, causing a small ""controlled"" heart attack. The septum then shrinks back to a more normal size over the following months, widening the passage for blood flow. Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICD). ICDs are suggested for people at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. The ICD constantly monitors the heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, abnormal heart rhythm, it delivers energy to the heart muscle to cause the heart to beat in a normal rhythm again."
How Can I Prevent Endocarditis?,"'People with obstructive HCM may be at increased risk for infective ''endocarditis'', a potentially life-threatening condition. Ask your doctor if you need to take endocarditis precautions, which include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Tell all your doctors and dentist you have HCM. They should prescribe antibiotics to prevent an infection before performing any procedures on you that may cause bleeding (dental, respiratory, and gastrointestinal procedures). Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection. Take good care of your teeth and gums."
What are palpitations?,"'Palpations are sensations by a person that they are having hard, rapid, or irregular heartbeats or a combination of these sensations.''A brief description of the ''heart'""'s function that should help readers to better understand ""'palpitations'"". The heart is a two-stage electrical pump whose function is to circulate blood to the organs and tissues of the body. The heart's electrical system allows the heart muscle to beat in a coordinated fashion to maximize the pumping strength of the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart, and make certain that there is an adequate amount of blood to be pumped.""'The upper chambers of the heart, called the atria (single=''atrium'') collect blood from the body and ''lungs'"" and pump it into the ventricles. There needs to be a short delay to allow the ventricles to fill and then pump the blood back to the body and lungs to complete the cycle. The heart's electrical system allows this to happen, so that each chamber of the heart beats (contracts or squeezes) when it's supposed to.""'The sinoatrial node (SA node) is a collection of special cells embedded in the heart muscle of the ''right atrium''. They act as the ''pacemaker'' for the heart by generating an electrical impulse 60 to 80 times per minute. This signal is transmitted to all the atrial muscle cells so that they can fire at the same time and pump blood from the ''atrium'' to the ventricle, the first half of a heartbeat. At the same time, an electrical impulse is sent to the ''atrioventricular node'' (''AV node''), located in the junction between the ''atrium'' and ventricle. The ''AV node'' acts as an electrical junction box and delays the electrical signal for a fraction of a second so that the ventricle can fill with blood from the atrium. It then sends the signal to all the muscle cells of the ventricle so that they can fire together in a coordinated fashion and generate the second half of the heartbeat that pumps blood to the body.''Every heart muscle cell has the potential to generate an electrical signal that can spread outside the normal conduction pathways that may or may not generate a heartbeat. If the SA node fails to function, other cells in the atrium attempt to generate a heartbeat. If they too should fail, the ''AV node'' can act as a pacemaker but usually generates a signal at only 40 beats per minute. If the AV node should also fail, the ventricle itself can generate its own electrical signal as a final backup, but only at about 20 beats per minute.''A palpitation describes the sensation that occurs when a patient feels an abnormality in the normal beat of the heart. Abnormalities in the electrical conducting system may cause the heart to beat too quickly, too slowly, or irregularly. Sometimes a palpitation may be a normal variant but it may also be caused by a significant problem that could be life threatening. A palpitation may be an isolated extra heartbeat or it may describe a run of many extra beats that run together for a prolonged period. Sometimes a missed beat or a pause can be felt.'  "
What are the different types of palpitations?,"'There are different types of palpitations depending upon where in the heart the electrical signal is generated and whether that signal can generate a heartbeat. Many extra heartbeats are normal variants and most patients are unaware that their heart has had an extra beat or two; however, others may be dangerous causing short- and long-term complications. Palpitations that originate in the atrium tend not to be acutely life threatening as compared to those that originate in the ventricle.''Palpitations are often described based upon their source location (atrium, AV node, or ventricle), their frequency (isolated or clustered in runs of many beats together), whether the beats are regular in rhythm or irregular, and whether they are persistent or stop on their own (self-limited). However, some palpitations are symptoms of an ''arrhythmia''. Some investigators do not include certain arrhythmias when discussing palpitations, but others include them as possible symptoms patients notice during these arrhythmias. This article will include these arrhythmias.''PACs and ''PVCs''A premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs when the SA node generates a beat before the heart is quite ready and while a heartbeat is generated, it can feel as if there is a thump or flop in the chest. Because of its early timing, a PAC is often followed by a slight pause as the SA node resets itself. A PAC is a normal variant and may or may not be felt by a patient.''A ''premature ventricular contraction'' (''PVC'') is similarly caused by an early beat by the ventricle, usually caused by an extra electrical beat generated in a muscle cell located in the ventricle. Since it is early, the patient can feel a thump as the heartbeat is slightly misplaced in its normal cycle. As with PACs, PVCs may be asymptomatic and the patient may be unaware that they are occurring. Neither an occasional PAC nor PVC affects ''heart function''.''Supraventricular tachycardia''Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a general term that describes a rapid heartbeat that arises from electrical signals generated above the ventricle from within the atrium. It may occur due to outside forces acting upon the heart or because of ""a short circuit"" or abnormal wiring of the electrical conduction system.''SVT may be a normal physiologic response to a ''stress'' upon the body. When the body requires more oxygen, it releases adrenaline, which causes the heart to beat faster to increase blood circulation. This may occur as a response to ''exercise'', illness, or injury.''SVT may also occur because of electrical conducting system abnormalities within the atrium and the AV node and may occur without an apparent underlying cause. This is referred to as ''paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia'' or ''PSVT''. This rhythm may start and stop on its own, seemingly without reason or warning, and may last only a few seconds or may require emergency intervention for it to stop.''There can be inborn wiring errors of the heart that can cause special forms of PSVT. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is one example and palpitations may occur early in life or not be experienced until later in adulthood.''SVT may be caused by chemicals that appear similar to adrenaline to the heart. These include ''caffeine'', ''over-the-counter'' ''cold'' medications containing pseudoephedrine, ''alcohol'', and other stimulant ''drugs'' like amphetamine and ''cocaine''. Excess ''thyroid hormone'' or ''electrolyte'' abnormalities in the bloodstream may irritate the atria and precipitate SVT.''While ''anxiety'' may cause the patient to experience these types of palpitations, the health care professional may want to consider other potential causes before ascribing this diagnosis.''Atrial fibrillation'' and ''flutter''In some patients, the atrial muscle cells all act like pacemakers, generating an electrical impulse. This causes electrical chaos and the atria cannot beat in a coordinated fashion. Instead of generating an organized atrial contraction, the atria instead fibrillates, or jiggles like a bowl of jelly. The numerous electrical signals that are generated bombard the AV node and it tries to respond but passes on only some of the hundreds of signals that it receives each minute to the ventricle. This leads to the ventricle beating rapidly and irregularly which is termed ''atrial fibrillation'' (A Fib).''Atrial flutter'' (AFL) describes a situation where there is an electrical short circuit in the atrium and a loop of cells generates a rapid regular atrial rhythm of about 300 to 400 cycles per minute. The AV node receives these many signals and tries to protect the ventricle from the barrage and passes on only every second, third, or fourth impulse. Often a patient in atrial flutter will have an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute but a ventricular rate of only 150 beats per minute. This rate is still fast enough for the patient to experience palpitations.''Even though ''atrial fibrillation'' and atrial flutter are relatively safe rhythms, there are complications that may result. When the atrium jiggles and does not contract, there is a potential for blood in the crevices of the atrial walls to become stagnant and form small clots (thrombus). There is a potential that a clot may break away and travel (embolize) to small arteries in the body, blocking circulation and oxygen delivery. In this way, atrial ''fibrillation'' is one of the risk factors for ''stroke'"" and other vascular problems. Atrial fibrillation may also affect the heart's efficiency. Without the kick provided by a coordinated atrial beat, blood delivery to the ventricle is decreased and cardiac output -- the amount of blood circulated to the body with each heartbeat -- falls.""'Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation''As opposed to rapid atrial rhythms, it is potentially life-threatening situation when the ventricle beats too quickly. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs when the ventricular electrical system starts firing on its own without input from the SA or AV node. Depending upon the situation, ventricular tachycardia may or may not beat in an organized way and generate a heartbeat.''Ventricular fibrillation (V Fib) is not compatible with life since the chaotic electrical signals do not generate a coordinated heartbeat. The ventricle jiggles and blood is not pumped to the body. Ventricular fibrillation is the rhythm commonly associated with ''sudden cardiac death''.''Both ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are seen as complications of ischemic ''heart disease'', especially after a ''heart attack'', where the ventricular heart muscle is irritated because of lack of blood supply.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of palpitations?,"'Palpitations describe an irregularity of the heartbeat as felt by the patient. They may be felt as an isolated skipped beat or they may be frequent and recurrent. Palpitations may also be rapid and either regular or irregular. This may lead to the patient describing a fluttering in their chest.''Patients may also complain of fullness in their chest or throat. There may also be associated ''shortness of breath'', ''nausea'', and ''sweating'"". If the heart rate is very fast, the patient's ""'blood pressure'' may fall causing ''lightheadedness'' and the sensation that they might faint or pass-out. ''Syncope'', where the patient actually does faint or pass out, may occur depending upon the cause of palpitations.'  "
How do medical professionals diagnose palpitations?,"'Palpitations may be difficult to diagnose, since often the symptoms are intermittent and may not be present when the patient presents for care.''As with most medical conditions, the key to making the diagnosis lies in the history and physical examination. The health care professional may ask questions to understand the sensation felt by the patient:''Physical examination will often concentrate on the heart and lungs, but may also focus on other organ systems if it is appropriate.''Blood tests may be helpful to look for underlying medical conditions that may cause palpitations. These may include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') or hemogram looking for ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count''), ''electrolytes'', kidney, and thyroid function.''Often the patient does not present when the palpitations are present but an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') may still be helpful in looking for indirect evidence as to the potential cause. A heart monitor may be useful because some patients are unaware that they have PACs or PVCs and this may help make the diagnosis.''It may be frustrating for the patient to make an appointment with his or her doctor or go to an emergency department complaining of palpitations, only to find that they have stopped by the time they are evaluated. Unless there is concern about a life-threatening situation, most patients with palpitations are evaluated as outpatients. A variety of heart monitors can be worn for days or months at a time that can record and even notify the health-care professional if a significant heart rhythm abnormality is detected.''In certain circumstances, the heart rhythm might be evaluated by electrophysiological studies, where the electrical system of the heart is mapped out. The process is similar to a heart catheterization, but the catheter enters a vein instead of an artery. The long catheter and electrode is guided into the heart and used to evaluate the electrical pathways inside the heart muscle. In addition to being diagnostic, sometimes short circuits may be found and treated by ablation or destroying the abnormal circuit. ''Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'' is often treated in this way.' Are the palpitations an isolated extra or skipped beat or are there runs that can last for minutes or hours? What makes them come on? What makes them go away? What other symptoms might be present, including shortness of breath, chest pain, sweating, nausea and vomiting, lightheadedness, and syncope? Past medical history is important, including a history of heart or lung disease and prescribed medications. Knowing whether other medications or drugs are being used will be helpful. These include caffeine, over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, alcohol, and illegal drugs that may affect the heart (for example, cocaine, amphetamines, and others)."
What is the treatment for palpitations?,"'It is a medical emergency if palpitations are associated with ''chest pain'' (including ''jaw pain'', ''indigestion'' or extreme ''fatigue''), shortness of breath, or syncope (passing out). It is important to activate the emergency response system (call 9-1-1) and seek medical care immediately.'""Palpitations are treated depending upon the underlying cause of the abnormal heart rhythm, and is tailored to the specific patient's needs.""'Many causes of palpitations are self-limiting and lifestyle changes may help decrease their occurrence. These include deceasing or avoiding the use of caffeine, alcohol, and over-the-counter cold medications. As well, many herbal medications contain ''stimulants'"" that may affect the heart's electrical conducting system. ""'Smoking cessation'' is always appropriate.''Depending upon the underlying cause of palpitations, medications may be prescribed to control the heart rate and rhythm. Other treatments may involve ablation or surgical techniques to remove the underlying cause of certain palpitations.''Pacemakers and defibrillators may be indicated if life-threatening conditions are the cause of palpitations.'  "
What is the prognosis for palpitations?,"'Many palpitations are temporary only and are caused by situations that can be resolved by lifestyle modifications. For example, premature atrial contractions and ''premature ventricular contractions'' are variations of normal and do not affect life expectancy but may be prevented by decreasing the intake of stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. These palpitations usually have a good prognosis.'""Other causes of palpitations may require medications or surgery to control the heart rhythm disturbance. The goal is to return the patient to their previous level of health and activity, minimizing restrictions on their daily lives. These palpitations have a prognosis from good to fair and occasionally poor, depending on the individual's response to treatment."" "
Is it possible to prevent palpitations?,"'Some causes of palpitations, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter may be due to underlying ''heart disease'', especially ischemic ''heart disease''. Risk factors that can be controlled include lifelong control of ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', and ''diabetes'', plus ''smoking'' cessation.''Some patients with palpitations will benefit from avoiding caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold medications (especially those that contain pseudoephedrine), herbal medications, and other stimulants.' "
What is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)?,"'When the ''heart'""'s electrical system malfunctions, the normal rhythm of the heart can be affected. Depending upon the abnormality, the heart may begin to beat too fast, too slow, irregularly, or not at all. Heart rhythm disorders are often referred to as cardiac arrhythmias (cardiac = heart; a = lack of) but this is technically incorrect, since in most cases there is a heart rhythm, but it is abnormal. Cardiac dysrhythmia (dys = abnormal or faulty + rhythm) might be a better term.""'Dysrhythmias may occur because of problems directly associated with the electrical ""wiring,"" the SA node, the ''AV node'', or ventricular conducting system. The issue may also be due to influences on the conducting system from outside the heart. These can include ''electrolyte'' abnormalities in the bloodstream, abnormal hormone levels (for example thyroid function that is too high or too low), and medication or drug ingestions.''Any abnormality of the electrical cycle within the heart that generates an abnormal beat, whether it is too fast, too slow, skipped, or irregular is considered a dysrhythmia.''Dysrhythmias are usually classified as originating from above the ''AV node'' (supraventricular ) or below, from the ventricle. They are either fast, slow, or irregular and persistent or intermittent.' "
How does the heart work?,"'The heart is a two-stage electric pump whose job it is to circulate blood through the body. The initial electrical impulse that begins the process of a heartbeat is generated by a group of cells located in the upper chamber of the heart, the ''atrium''. These cells act as an automatic ''pacemaker'', starting the electric signal that spreads along the ""wiring"" within the heart muscle, allowing a coordinated squeeze so that the pump can function.''The heart has four chambers. The upper chambers are the right and left atria (singular = ''atrium'') while the lower chambers are the right and left ventricles. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the ''lungs'' while the left side pumps it to the rest of the body.''Blood from the body depleted of oxygen and containing carbon dioxide is collected in the ''right atrium'' and then pushed into the ''right ventricle'' with a small beat of the upper chamber of the heart. The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen and release the carbon dioxide. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the ''left atrium'' where the small atrial beat pushes it to the ''left ventricle''. The left ventricle is much thicker than the right because it needs to be strong enough to send blood to the entire body.''There are special cells in the right ''atrium'' called the sinoatrial node (SA node) that generate the first electrical impulse, allowing the heart to beat in a coordinated way. The SA node is considered the ""natural pacemaker"" of the heart. This pacemaker function begins the electrical impulse, which follows pathways in the atrial walls, almost like wiring, to a junction box between the atrium and ventricle called the ''atrioventricular node'' (''AV node''). This electric signal causes muscle cells in both atria to contract at once. At the AV node, the electric signal waits for a very short time, usually one- to two-tenths of a second, to allow blood pumped from the atria to fill up the ventricles. The signal then passes through electric bundles in the ventricle walls to allow these chambers to contract, again in a coordinated way, and pump blood to the lungs and body.''The SA node generates an electric beat about 60 to 80 times a minute, and each should result in a heartbeat. That beat can be felt as an external pulse. After a heartbeat, the muscle cells of the heart need a split second to get ready to beat again, and the electrical system allows a pause for this to happen.''The heart and its electrical activity work within a narrow range of normal. Fortunately, the body tends to protect the heart as best as it can. Rhythm disturbances may be normal physiologic responses, but some may be potentially life threatening.''Every cell in the heart can act as a pacemaker. A healthy SA node has an intrinsic heart beat generation rate of 60 to 80. If the atrium fails to generate a heartbeat, then a healthy AV node can do so at a rate of about 40, and if needed, the ventricles themselves can generate heartbeats at a rate of about 20 per minute. This may occur if the cells of the upper chamber fail to generate an electrical impulse or if the electrical signals to the ventricle are blocked. However, these lower rates may be associated with the inability of the heart to pump blood to the body to meet its needs and may result in ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', ''weakness'', or passing out.' "
What causes heart rhythm disorders?,"""Heart rhythm disturbances may occur because of problems within the heart itself or be the result of abnormalities in the body's environment that can affect the heart's ability to conduct electricity.""'Cardiac or heart muscle cells become irritated when they are depleted of oxygen. This can occur during a ''heart attack'', in which the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, are blocked. Lack of oxygen can occur when the lungs are unable to extract oxygen from the air. Significant ''anemia'', or ''low red blood cell count'', decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and may prevent adequate oxygen delivery. Rapid heart rates may be due to ""wiring"" problems with the electrical pathways in the heart. This can cause ""short circuits"" making the heart speed up and beat 150 beats a minute or more. The abnormality can be due to a physical extra electrical pathway such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, or it can be due to changes in the electrical physiology between a few cells, like in ''atrial flutter''.''Rapid heart rates can also occur because of environmental issues that affect the heart. These can be intrinsic to the body, like ''anemia'', abnormal electrolyte levels, or abnormal ''thyroid hormone'' levels. They may also be due to reactions to outside influences like ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', ''over-the-counter'' ''cold'' remedies, or ''stimulants'' such as ''amphetamines''. To the ''cardiac muscle'' cell, they all appear to be adrenaline-like substances that can cause cell irritation.''Slow dysrhythmias can also be problematic. If the heart beats too slowly, the body may not be able to maintain an adequate ''blood pressure'"" and supply the body's organs with enough oxygen-rich blood to function.""'Slow heart rates may be due to ''aging'' of the SA node and its inability to generate an electrical pacemaker signal. Often though, it is due to the side effects of medications used to control ''high blood pressure''. Side effects of beta blocker and certain ''calcium channel blocker'' ''drugs'' include a slowing of the heart rate.''Body environment is also important with slow heart rhythm abnormalities. ''Hypothermia'', or low body temperature, is a potential cause. ' "
What are the different types of heart rhythm disorders?,'Heart rhythm disorders are classified according to where they occur in the heart and how they affect the heartbeat.'  
What are the signs and symptoms of heart rhythm disorders?,"'Many people may have heart rhythm disturbances and never be aware of them. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and ''premature ventricular contractions'' (''PVCs'') are variations of normal and most often, people are unaware that an extra beat has occurred. However, some patients are keenly aware of any extra heartbeat, even if it is a normal variant and requires no treatment.''That said, the initial symptom of dysrhythmia is often ''palpitations'', a sensation that the heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, beating irregularly, or skipping a beat. The ''palpitations'' may be intermittent or may require medical intervention to resolve.'""Because of the heart rhythm abnormality, other symptoms may occur because of decreased cardiac output (the amount of blood that the heart pushes out to meet the body's demand for oxygen and energy). The patient may complain of ""'lightheadedness'', weakness, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''chest pain'', and shortness of breath.'""In critical situations, the patient may fall to the ground or lose consciousness. This may be due to life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It may be due to heart rates so fast that there isn't enough blood pressure generated to supply the brain with what it needs. The same result can also occur if the heart beats too slowly and insufficient blood pressure is generated.""  "
Atrial fibrillation (A-fib),"'Atrial fibrillation'' occurs when the atrium has lost the ability to beat in a coordinated fashion. Instead of the SA node generating a single electrical signal, numerous areas of the atrium become irritated and produce electrical impulses. This causes the atrium to jiggle, or fibrillate, instead of beating. The AV node sees all the electrical signals, but because there are so many, and because they are so erratic, only some of the hundreds of signals per minute are passed through to the ventricle. The ventricles then fire irregularly and often very quickly.''As in ''PSVT'', the symptoms may include palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. The cause of ''atrial fibrillation'', however, may be more significant, since it may be due to ''aging'' of the conducting system of the heart and there may be associated ''atherosclerotic'' ''heart disease''. Therefore, ''atrial fibrillation'' with rapid ventricular response associated with chest ''pain'' or shortness of breath may need emergent ''cardioversion'' (a procedure that uses electricity to ''shock'' the heart back into a normal rhythm) or intravenous medications to control the heart rate.''One significant complication of atrial fibrillation is the formation of ''blood clots'' along the inside of the heart wall. These clots may break off and travel to different organs in the body (embolize), blocking blood vessels and causing the affected organs to malfunction because of the loss of blood supply. A common complication is a clot traveling to the brain, resulting in a ''stroke''.''The treatment of atrial fibrillation depends upon many factors including how long it has been present, what symptoms it causes, and the underlying health of the individual. The patient and his or her doctor will decide whether or not to restore a normal sinus rhythm or to simply keep the heart rate under control.'""Atrial fibrillation can be a safe rhythm and not life threatening when the rate is controlled. Medications are used to slow the electrical impulses through the AV node, so that the ventricles do not try to capture each signal being produced. The reason to return people to a regular rhythm has to do with cardiac output. In atrial fibrillation, the atria do not beat and pump blood to the ventricles. Instead, blood flows into the ventricles by gravity alone. This lack of atrial kick can decrease the heart's efficiency and cardiac output by 10% to 15%.""'Blood thinning, or anticoagulation, may be recommended for those patients with atrial fibrillation and elevated risk for ''stroke''. Oral drugs that anticoagulate are ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), dabigatran (Pradaxa), ''rivaroxaban'' (''Xarelto''), and ''apixaban'' (''Eliquis''). There are other injectable drugs that are used in a hospital setting. If the patient is at low risk, the doctor may recommend ''aspirin'' alone for ''stroke prevention'"". If atrial fibrillation is poorly tolerated due to symptomatic palpitations or symptoms of reduced cardiac output, or if there are concerns with lifelong anticoagulation therapy, more definitive therapy may include specific medications, electrical cardioversion, or catheter based ablation (sometimes with a pacemaker inserted). Atrial fibrillation is a common condition, with many implications, and the best plan for each patient should be discussed at length with one's physician. "" "
Atrial flutter,"'Atrial ''flutter'' is similar to atrial fibrillation except that instead of having chaotic electrical firing from all points in the atrium, one point has become irritated and can fire 300 times per minute or more. Many issues that exist for atrial fibrillation apply to atrial flutter. Atrial flutter may degenerate into atrial fibrillation, and the two can often coexist.' "
Sinus bradycardia,"'The heart, its cells, and its electricity may come under the many outside influences causing it to beat more slowly. Sinus bradycardia (brady = slow + cardia = heart) by definition, is a heartbeat generated by the SA node at a rate slower than 60 beats per minute. This may be normal in people who are active and athletic or in patients taking medications designed to slow the heart such as ''beta blockers'' and some ''calcium channel blockers''.''Vasovagal'' ''syncope'' is an episode of profound sinus bradycardia associated with a noxious stimulus that causes the vagal system of the body to kick in and slow the heart rate. While the sympathetic system of the body is mediated by adrenaline, the parasympathetic system is mediated by the vagus nerve and the chemical acetylcholine, which promotes the exact opposite body reaction than adrenaline. In some people, exposure to ''pain'' or a difficult emotional situation can stimulate the vagus nerve, slow the heart, and dilate blood vessels (veins), causing cardiac output to decrease and making a person feel lightheaded or faint. The vagus nerve also can be stimulated to slow the heart when one bears down to urinate (micturition syncope) or have a bowel movement.' "
Tachycardia,"'Rapid heart rates can originate from either the atrium or the ventricle, but rhythms from the ventricle are more often life threatening. The initial approach to rapid heart rates is to quickly identify the rhythm, and if blood pressure is maintained and there is no evidence of a failing heart, then treatment is directed to rate control with the eventual return of the heart back to normal sinus rhythm. If, however, there is evidence that the heart is failing because of the rapid rate, then emergency measures, including using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm, may be necessary.' "
Sinus tachycardia,"'The heart, its cells, and its electricity may come under many outside influences that may cause it to beat more quickly. Sinus tachycardia (sinus = from the SA node + tachy = rapid + cardia = heart), or a rapid regular heartbeat, is a common rhythm issue. It occurs when the body signals the heart to pump more blood, or when the electrical system is stimulated by chemicals.''The body needs increased cardiac output in times of physiologic ''stress''. Cardiac output is the amount of blood the heart pumps in the course of 1 minute. It can be calculated by the amount of blood that the heart pumps with each beat (''stroke volume'') multiplied by the heart rate.''Cardiac output = (''stroke'' volume) x (heart rate)''The ''stroke'' volume tends to be relatively constant. When the body requires extra oxygen delivery, the heart rate needs to increase to meet that demand. Examples include:''The electrical system can be stimulated in a variety of ways to make the heart beat faster. In times of ''stress'', the body generates cortisol and adrenaline, causing an increased heart rate in addition to other changes in the body. Think of being frightened and feeling your heart race. Increased thyroid hormone levels in the body can also cause a tachycardia. Ingestion of a variety of drugs can also cause the heart to race, including ''caffeine'', alcohol, and over-the-counter cold medications that include chemicals such as phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine. These compounds are metabolized by the body and act like an adrenaline stimulus to the heart. Illegal drugs such as methamphetamine and ''cocaine'' can also cause a sinus tachycardia. ' exercise, in which the muscles have greater oxygen requirements and the heart rate speeds up to pump more blood to meet that need; dehydration, in which there is less fluid in the body and the heart rate has to speed up to compensate; or in cases of acute bleeding that may occur after trauma."
Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib),"""Ventricular fibrillation is technically not a rapid heart rhythm because the heart ceases to beat. In ventricular fibrillation, the ventricles do not have a coordinated electrical pattern and the ventricles, instead of beating, just jiggle, or fibrillate. Since the heart doesn't beat, blood is not circulated to the body or brain and all bodily functions stop. Without a coordinated impulse to signal the ventricle to beat, ""'sudden cardiac death'' occurs.''The treatment for V-fib is ''defibrillation'' with an electrical shock. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places have helped decrease the mortality from sudden cardiac death, but ''prevention'' remains the mainstay to survive this event. Some people, such as those with a very weak heart muscle or who have a prior history of ventricular fibrillation will require an implantable ''defibrillator'' to prevent future episodes of sudden death and treat this rhythm.'""This rhythm is often associated with a heart attack in which the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood supply (myocardial ischemia), becomes irritated, and causes secondary irritation of the electrical system. Aside from myocardial ischemia, other causes of ventricular fibrillation may include severe weakness of the heart muscle (""'cardiomyopathy''), electrolyte disturbances, drug overdose, and poisoning.' "
Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach),"'Ventricular tachycardia is another rapid heart rate that originates in the ventricle. The causes are the same as those for ventricular fibrillation, but because of the electrical conduction pattern in the heart pathways, an organized signal is provided to the ventricles, potentially allowing them to beat. This remains an emergency, since V-tach may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.' "
Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs),"'Every person experiences the occasional palpitation in which the atrium or the ventricle beats early. These premature atrial contractions (PACs) or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are normal variants and most people are unaware of their occurrence. However, some patients report a palpitation in the chest and neck, often described as a ""thump"" or ""thud."" PACs and PVCs in otherwise healthy individuals do not pose any health risks.' "
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT),"'Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia'' (PSVT) occurs when the pathways in the AV node or atrium allow an altered conduction of electricity, and the atrium begins firing in a fast but regular rate, sometimes more than 150 to 200 times per minute. The ventricles, sensing the electrical activity coming through the AV node, try to beat along with each electrical impulse and PSVT occurs.''This is rarely a life-threatening event, but people may feel uncomfortable when PSVT occurs. They may become lightheaded, weak, have shortness of breath, and describe a feeling of fullness in the throat. PSVT may also be tolerated and may stop on its own. ''If this is a first time event, activating EMS (emergency medical services) and calling 9-1-1 is important, since other tachycardias can be life threatening.'""The treatment for PSVT includes attempts to stimulate the vagus nerve to slow the heart (see vasovagal syncope above) by holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement. Intravenous medications are often used to interrupt the episode. Many patients have PSVT due to congenital abnormalities in the electrical conduction system of the heart. External causes can include ""'hyperthyroidism'', electrolyte imbalances, and the use of caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold medications containing stimulants, or illegal drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine.' "
Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome,"'Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'' is a specific type of PSVT, in which an inborn error of wiring has occurred near the AV node, and an accessory electrical pathway exists. The diagnosis is made by ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') or electrophysiologic testing, and the treatment may include medication or destruction of the accessory electrical pathway by invasive catheter ablation.' "
Bradycardia,"'Aside from medications that are meant to slow the heart for treatment of a variety of medical problems, bradycardia (brady = low + cardia = heart) is usually due to ''heart block'"" and the aging of the electrical wiring of the heart. This is no different than the aging of your home's electrical system; but instead of being able to rewire the heart, these conditions may need to be treated with an ""'implantable pacemaker''.' "
Heart blocks,"'Heart blocks involving the ventricle may be asymptomatic and of little consequence except to point to underlying heart or lung disease. They are diagnosed by EKG.''Heart blocks involving the atrium can be classified as first-, second-, and third-degree.''Heart blocks are symptomatic because the heart beats so slowly that cardiac output is decreased. The symptoms may include lightheadedness or passing out (syncope), weakness, shortness of breath, and chest pain.''Diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening heart block happen at the same time. Often, the patient with bradycardia may be taking medications that can slow the heart including beta blockers and certain calcium channel blockers. If the patient is stable, time can be taken to have the medications wear off while the patient is monitored. If the bradycardia remains, a pacemaker may be needed. In certain situations, a temporary pacemaker can be placed to stabilize the patient, while decisions are made as to a permanent solution. ' First-degree heart block is common and usually of little significance. There is a slight delay in getting the electrical signal from the SA node to the AV node, but the heart functions normally. There are two types of second-degree heart block (Mobitz I and Mobitz II, with Type II being more serious than Type I. Third-degree heart block describes the complete loss of connection between the electrical activity of the atria and the ventricles. Second- and third-degree heart blocks are diagnosed by analyzing heart rhythm strips and EKGs."
When to seek medical care,"'Unexplained palpitations are not normal, especially when associated with shortness of breath, ''sweating'', feelings of chest pressure, or passing out. The person should be made comfortable and laid flat, and EMS (emergency medical service) should be activated by calling 9-1-1 or the emergency number in your area.''If the person is unconscious or unresponsive, Basic life support (American Heart Association) should be initiated. Call 9-1-1, get an AED, and decide whether CPR should be initiated.''If the episode is short-lived and resolves spontaneously, the primary care professional should be contacted urgently to seek advice.''If the episode is a recurrent problem, the diagnosis is known, and the rhythm disturbance resolves itself, then a less urgent call to the primary care professional is warranted.''It is reasonable to seek emergent medical care any time that a heart rhythm disturbance occurs or if there is concern that a heart problem is present.' "
How are heart rhythm disorders diagnosed?,"'The mainstay of diagnosis remains the EKG and heart rhythm monitoring. These are often done immediately in the ambulance or upon arrival in the emergency department. In many patients, the palpitations or symptoms may have resolved, and no acute rhythm abnormalities can be found.''Depending on the associated symptoms and the history, observation and monitoring of the heart may occur in hospital or as an outpatient. In patients who have passed out, admission to the hospital often occurs. Those patients with chest pain and shortness of breath may also be admitted to evaluate their heart. In patients who are not admitted, a heart monitoring device may be placed to monitor the rhythm for a duration of time. Monitors may be worn for 24 hours or up to 1 month. In some instances, rhythm identification is elusive and may take months or years to capture and identify. Implantable cardiac monitors may be placed for periods greater than 1 year.''If the rhythm is known, then tests to identify potential causes may be done. These are dependent on the specific rhythm abnormality and can range from blood tests to lung evaluations and ''sleep'' studies to echocardiograms and electrophysiologic testing. '  "
What is the treatment for heart rhythm disorders?,"'There is no one treatment for a heart rhythm abnormality. When the patient is unstable, with no pulse or blood pressure, or when they are unconscious, American Heart Association guidelines are available to direct care to hopefully restore the heart rhythm to normal and return a pulse.''For V-fib and V-tach, electricity may be the most important drug, and the heart is shocked back into a heart rhythm, hopefully compatible with life. Other common medications used in crises situations depend upon the life-threatening rhythm and may include epinephrine (''adrenalin''), ''atropine'', and ''amiodarone''.'""For patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the goal is not only to slow down the heart rate but also to identify which rhythm is present. Vasovagal maneuvers, like holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement may resolve the situation, or it may slow the rate temporarily to make the diagnosis. Adenosine can be injected and may convert SVT to normal sinus rhythm by slowing the electrical impulse at the AV node. It can also be used as a diagnostic challenge to help identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.""'For atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the initial goal is to slow the rate and maintain normal blood pressure. Calcium channel clockers like ''diltiazem'' and beta blockers like ''metoprolol'' may be used intravenously to control rate. ''Digoxin'' is a second-line medication that may be helpful when first-line medications fail. In ''unstable'' patients, with chest pain, shortness of breath, or decreased consciousness, cardioversion with an electric shock may be required. The decision to ''electively'' convert ''A-fib'' to normal sinus rhythm depends upon the patient and situation and is often a decision left to the primary care professional. The question regarding anticoagulation also will need to be addressed. '  "
What is the prognosis for heart rhythm disorders?,"'While most heart dysrhythmias can be treated and controlled, ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia can be fatal. Their recognition and treatment are true emergencies, and there is no guarantee that sudden cardiac death can be reversed.''For all other rhythm abnormalities, there may be time to make the diagnosis and design a treatment plan. The goal is to minimize the effect that the dysrhythmia has on daily activity and quality of life.' "
Can heart rhythm disorders be prevented?,"'Minimizing risk factors for ''heart disease'' will be helpful, including controlling blood pressure, ''lowering cholesterol'', keeping ''diabetes'' under control, and not ''smoking''.''For those with rapid palpitations that are intermittent, avoiding stimulants like alcohol, caffeine, over-the-counter cold medications, and illicit drugs are important preventive measures. ' "
Introduction to heart transplant,"'The idea of replacing a bad organ with a good one has been documented in ancient mythology. The first real organ transplants were probably skin grafts that may have been done in India as early as the second century B.C. The first ''heart'' transplant in any animal is credited to Vladimer Demikhov. Working in Moscow in 1946, Demikhov switched the hearts between two ''dogs''. The dogs survived the surgery. The first heart transplant in human beings was done in South Africa in 1967 by Dr. Christiaan Barnard; the patient only lived 18 days. Most of the research that led to successful heart transplantation took place in the United States at Stanford University under the leadership of Dr. Norman Shumway. Once Stanford started reporting better results, other centers started doing heart transplants. However, successful transplantation of a human heart was not ready for widespread clinical application until medications were developed to prevent the recipient from ""rejecting"" the donor heart. This happened in 1983 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called ''cyclosporine'' (''Gengraf'', ''Neoral''). Before the advent of cyclosporine, overall results of heart transplant were not very good. ' "
What is a heart transplant?,"'Believe it or not, heart transplantation is a relatively simple operation for a cardiac surgeon. In fact, the procedure actually consists of three operations. ''The first operation'' is harvesting the heart from the donor. The donor is usually an unfortunate person who has suffered irreversible ''brain injury'', called ""brain death"". Very often these are patients who have had major ''trauma'' to the head, for example, in an automobile accident. The victim\'s organs, other than the brain, are working well with the help of medications and other ""life support"" that may include a respirator or other devices. A team of physicians, nurses, and technicians goes to the hospital of the donor to remove donated organs once brain death of the donor has been determined. The removed organs are transported on ice to keep them alive until they can be implanted. For the heart, this is optimally less than six hours. So, the organs are often flown by airplane or helicopter to the recipient\'s hospital. ''The second operation'"" is removing the recipient's damaged heart. Removing the damaged heart may be very easy or very difficult, depending on whether the recipient has had previous heart surgery (as is often the case). If there has been previous surgery, cutting through the ""'scar tissue'' may prolong and complicate removal of the heart. ''The third operation'' is probably the easiest; the implantation of the donor heart. Today, this operation basically involves the creation of only five lines of ''stitches'', or ""anastomoses"". These suture lines connect the large blood vessels entering and leaving the heart. Remarkably, if there are no complications, most patients who have had a heart transplant are home about one week after the surgery. The generosity of donors and their families makes organ transplant possible.' "
Who needs a heart transplant?,"'There are not enough donor hearts available for everyone who may need a hear transplant. Therefore, there is a careful selection process in place to assure that hearts are distributed fairly and to those who will benefit most from the donor heart. The heart is just a pump, although a complicated pump. Most patients require a transplant because their hearts can no longer pump well enough to supply blood with oxygen and nutrients to the organs of the body. A smaller number of patients have a good pump, but a bad ""electrical conduction system"" of the heart. This electrical system determines the rate, rhythm and sequence of contraction of the heart muscle. There are all kinds of problems that can occur with the conduction system, including complete interruption of cardiac function causing ''sudden cardiac death''.''While there are many people with ""end-stage"" ''heart disease'' with inadequate function of the heart, not all qualify for a heart transplant. All the other important organs in the body must be in pretty good shape. Transplants cannot be performed in patients with active infection, ''cancer'', or bad ''diabetes mellitus''; patients who smoke or abuse ''alcohol'"" are also not good candidates. It's not easy to be a transplant recipient. These patients need to change their lifestyle and take numerous medications (commonly more than 30 different medications). Hence, all potential transplants patients must undergo psychological testing to identify social and behavioral factors that could interfere with recovery, compliance with medications, and lifestyle changes required after transplantation.""""Moreover, needing a heart and being a suitable candidate are not enough. The potential donor heart must be compatible with the recipient's immune system to decrease the chance of problems with rejection. Finally, this precious resource, the donor organ, must be distributed fairly. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is in charge of a system that is in place to assure equitable allocation of organs to individuals who will benefit the most from transplantation. These are usually the sickest patients.""  "
What are the results of a heart transplant?,"'When all potential problems are considered, the results of transplantation are remarkably good. Keep in mind that ''heart failure'' is a very serious and life-threatening disease. In patients with severe forms of heart failure that require transplantation, the one year mortality rate (that is the percent of patients who die in within one year) is 80%. Overall, five year survival in patients with any form of heart failure is less than 50%. Compare these outcomes with cardiac transplant. After heart transplant, five year survival averages about 50%-60%. One year survival averages about 85%-90%.' "
What are the complications of a heart transplant?,"'One might ask, ""Why is survival no better than it is after a heart transplant?"" As part of our defense mechanism to fight off infection and even ''cancer'', our bodies have an ""immune system"" to recognize and eliminate foreign tissues such as ''viruses'' and bacteria. Unfortunately, our immune system also attacks transplanted organs. This is what happens when organs are rejected; they are recognized as foreign by the body. Rejection can be controlled with powerful ""immunosuppressive"" medications. If there is not enough immunosuppression the organ can reject acutely. Even when it seems that there is no active rejection, there may be more subtle chronic rejection that consists of a growth of tissue, something like ''scar'' tissue, which causes blockage of the blood vessels of the heart. The blockage of the vessels is the process that ultimately causes the transplanted heart to fail. It is this chronic rejection that is the major limiting factor for the long-term success of heart transplantation.''Unfortunately, immunosuppression is a double-edged sword.  While immunosuppression blocks rejection, because it suppresses the immune system, transplant patients are more susceptible to infection and ''cancers'' of various types.  Among older transplantation patients, as survival has improved, more patients are eventually dying from cancers. ' "
How does a heart transplant patient know if he or she is rejecting the donor organ or developing an infection?,"'This is not an easy question to answer because many of the symptoms and signs of rejection and infection are the same.  These include:''The more specific symptoms and signs of infection will vary greatly depending upon the site of infection within the body.  ''Transplant patients who experience any of these findings need to seek medical attention immediately.''  The transplant physician will then do tests to determine whether the transplanted heart is functioning normally or not.  If there is no evidence of rejection, a thorough search for infection will be performed so that the patient can be treated appropriately.' weakness, fatigue,  malaise (feeling lousy),  fever, and  ""flu-like symptoms"", such as chills, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting. 
"
How is rejection of the organ diagnosed and monitored?,"'Currently, the gold standard for monitoring rejection is the endomyocardial biopsy. This is a simple operation for the experienced cardiologist and can be done as an outpatient procedure. First, a catheter is put into the jugular vein in the neck. From there, the catheter is advanced into the right side of the heart (''right ventricle'') using an x-ray method calledfluoroscopy for guidance. The catheter has a bioptome at its end, a set of two small cups which can be closed to pinch off and remove small samples of heart muscle. The tissue is processed and placed on glass slides to be reviewed under the microscope by a pathologist. Based on the findings, the pathologist can determine whether or not there is rejection. ''Immunosuppressive therapy is then adjusted, for example, increased if rejection is present. Investigators have tried to develop less invasive methods to monitor for rejection. There is a new high-tech analysis that can be done in a sample of blood that is very promising and much easier for the patient than the endomyocardial biopsy. This test looks at the expression of specific genes in cells in the blood. The amount of expression of key genes indicates whether or not rejection is occurring. While this method has not replaced the endomyocardial biopsy as the gold standard, it has decreased the frequency of biopsies for many patients.' "
Why aren't more heart transplants done?,"""It's not easy to qualify for a heart transplant. One has to have a very bad heart but an otherwise healthy body. However, the major limiting factor is the availability of donor hearts. For many reasons, individuals and families refuse to donate organs that could be life-saving to others. Sometimes, even when an organ is available, there is no good match. Other times, there is no way to get the heart to a suitable recipient in time for the organ to still be viable. Cost is another reason, although less frequent, why more heart transplants aren't done. The cost is always at least a few hundred thousand dollard. Not all insurers will pay for heart transplant. The longer the recipient lives, the more expensive the transplant. Of course, if the heart lasts longer, the benefit is also greater to the patient and to society."" "
What is the future of heart transplant?,"'There are several ways to help patients with end-stage ''heart disease'"". One is to get more donors for heart transplant. This will require teaching people the benefits of transplantation in hope of changing society's attitudes. Better methods of preserving organs and preventing and treating rejection are constantly being developed. In the end, however, there will never be enough donor hearts. Indeed, artificial hearts already exist but have a limited life-span. Patients with artificial hearts are at high risk of developing infection and ""'blood clots'' related to the device. Better devices are being developed all the time. What about the use of animal organs, also called xenotransplantation? These organs are too ""foreign"" and thus the problems with rejection are currently insurmountable. ' "
What Is Valvular Heart Disease?,"'Heart valve disease'"" occurs when your heart's valves do not work the way they should."" "
How Do Heart Valves Work?,"'Your heart valves lie at the exit of each of your four heart chambers and maintain one-way blood flow through your heart. The four heart valves make sure that blood always flows freely in a forward direction and that there is no backward leakage.''Blood flows from your right and left atria into your ventricles through the open mitral and tricuspid valves.''When the ventricles are full, the mitral and tricuspid valves shut. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atria while the ventricles contract (squeeze).''As the ventricles begin to contract, the pulmonic and aortic valves are forced open and blood is pumped out of the ventricles through the open valves into the pulmonary artery toward the ''lungs'', the ''aorta'', and the body.''When the ventricles finish contracting and begin to relax, the aortic and pulmonic valves snap shut. These valves prevent blood from flowing back into the ventricles.''This pattern is repeated over and over, causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs and body.' "
What Are the Types of Valve Disease?,"'There are several types of valve disease:' Valvular stenosis. This occurs when a valve opening is smaller than normal due to stiff or fused leaflets. The narrowed opening may make the heart work very hard to pump blood through it. This can lead to heart failure and other symptoms (see below). All four valves can be stenotic (hardened, restricting blood flow); the conditions are called tricuspid stenosis, pulmonic stenosis, mitral stenosis or aortic stenosis. Valvular insufficiency. Also called regurgitation, incompetence or ""leaky valve"", this occurs when a valve does not close tightly. If the valves do not seal, some blood will leak backwards across the valve. As the leak worsens, the heart has to work harder to make up for the leaky valve, and less blood may flow to the rest of the body. Depending on which valve is affected, the conditioned is called tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary regurgitation, mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation."
What Causes Valvular Heart Disease?,"""Valve disease can develop before birth (congenital) or can be acquired sometime during one's lifetime. Sometimes the cause of valve disease is unknown.""'Congenital valve disease.'' Most often affects the aortic or pulmonic valve. Valves may be the wrong size, have malformed leaflets, or have leaflets that are not attached to the annulus correctly.''Bicuspid ''aortic valve'' disease'' is a congenital valve disease that affects the aortic valve. Instead of the normal three leaflets or cusps, the bicuspid aortic valve has only two. Without the third leaflet, the valve may be stiff (unable to open or close properly) or leaky (not able close tightly).''Acquired valve disease. ''This includes problems that develop with valves that were once normal. These may involve changes in the structure or your valve due to a variety of diseases or infections, including ''rheumatic fever'' or ''endocarditis''.''There are many changes that can occur to the valves of the heart. The chordae tendinea or papillary muscles can stretch or tear; the annulus of the valve can dilate (become wide); or the valve leaflets can become fibrotic (stiff) and calcified.''Mitral valve'' prolapse (''MVP'')'' is a very common condition, affecting 1 to 2 percent of the population. MVP causes the leaflets of the mitral valve to flop back into the ''left atrium'"" during the heart's contraction. MVP also causes the tissues of the valve to become abnormal and stretchy, causing the valve to leak. The condition rarely causes symptoms and usually doesn't require treatment.""'Other causes of valve disease include: ''coronary artery disease'', ''heart attack'', ''cardiomyopathy'' (heart muscle disease), ''syphilis'' (a ''sexually transmitted disease''), ''hypertension'', aortic aneurysms, and connective tissue diseases. Less common causes of valve disease include tumors, some types of ''drugs'' and ''radiation''.' Rheumatic fever is caused by an untreated bacterial infection (usually strep. throat). Luckily, the introduction of antibiotics to treat this infection has dramatically reduced the numbers of this infection. The initial infection usually occurs in children, but the heart problems associated with the infection may not be seen until 20-40 years later. At that time, the heart valves become inflamed, the leaflets stick together and become scarred, rigid, thickened and shortened. This leads to mitral regurgitation. Endocarditis occurs when germs, especially bacteria, enter the bloodstream and attack the heart valves, causing growths and holes in the valves and scarring. This can lead to leaky valves. The germs that cause endocarditis enter the blood during dental procedures, surgery, IV drug use, or with severe infections. People with valve disease (except mitral valve prolapse without thickening or regurgitation/leaking) are at increased risk for developing this life-threatening infection."
What Are the Symptoms of Valve Disease?,"'Symptoms do not always relate to the seriousness of your valve disease. You may have no symptoms at all and have severe valve disease, requiring prompt treatment. Or, as with mitral valve prolapse, you may have severe symptoms, yet tests may show your valve leak is not significant.' Shortness of breath and/or difficulty catching your breath. You may notice this most when you are active (doing your normal daily activities) or when you lie down flat in bed. You may need to sleep propped up on a few pillows to breathe easier. Weakness or dizziness. You may feel too weak to carry out your normal daily activities. Dizziness can also occur, and in some cases, passing out may be a symptom. Discomfort in your chest. You may feel a pressure or weight in your chest with activity or when going out in cold air. Palpitations. This may feel like a rapid heart rhythm, irregular heartbeat, skipped beats or a flip-flop feeling in your chest. Swelling of your ankles, feet or abdomen. This is called edema. Swelling may occur in your belly, which may cause you to feel bloated. Rapid weight gain. A weight gain of two or three pounds in one day is possible."
How Are Valve Diseases Diagnosed?,"'Your heart doctor can tell if you have valve disease by talking to you about your symptoms, performing a physical exam, and giving you other tests.''During a physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart to hear the sounds the heart makes as the valves open and close. A murmur is a swishing sound made by blood flowing through a stenotic or leaky valve. Your doctor can also tell if your heart is enlarged or if your heart rhythm is irregular.''The doctor will listen to your lungs to hear if you are retaining fluid in your lungs, which shows your heart is not able to pump as well as it should.''By examining your body, the doctor can find clues about your circulation and the functioning of your other organs.''After the physical exam, the doctor may order diagnostic tests. These may include:''By looking at the results, repeated over time, your doctor can also see the progress of your valve disease. This will help him or her make decisions about your treatment.' Echocardiography Transesophageal echocardiography Cardiac catheterization (also called an angiogram) Radionuclide scans Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"
How Is Heart Valve Disease Treated?,"'Treatment for heart valve disease depends on the type and severity of valve disease. There are three goals of treatment for heart valve disease: protecting your valve from further damage; lessening symptoms; and repairing or replacing valves.''Protecting your valve from further damage.''If you have valve disease, you are at risk for developing endocarditis, a serious condition. People who have mitral valve prolapse without thickening or regurgitation/leaking are not at risk of developing endocarditis.''You are still at risk for endocarditis, even if your valve is repaired or replaced through surgery. To protect yourself:''Medications.'' You may be prescribed medications to treat your symptoms and to lessen the chance of further valve damage. Some medications may be stopped after you have had valve surgery to correct your problem. Other medications may need to be taken all your life. Medications may include:'""Follow your doctor's orders when taking medications. Know the names of your medications, what they are for, and how often to take them.""'Surgery and Other Procedures''. The diagnostic tests your heart doctor orders help to identify the location, type, and extent of your valve disease. The results of these tests, the structure of your heart, your age, and your lifestyle will help your cardiologist (heart doctor), surgeon, and you decide what type of procedure will be best for you.''Surgical options include heart valve repair or replacement. Valves can be repaired or replaced with traditional heart valve surgery or a minimally invasive heart valve surgical procedure. Heart valves may also be repaired by other procedures such as percutaneous balloon valvotomy.' Tell your doctors and dentist you have valve disease. You may want to carry an identification card with this information. The American Heart Association website (www.americanheart.org) has a bacterial endocarditis wallet card that you may download; or call your local American Heart Association office or the national office at 1-800-AHA-USA1. Call your doctor if you have symptoms of an infection (sore throat, general body aches, fever). Take good care of your teeth and gums to prevent infections. See your dentist for regular visits. Take antibiotics before you undergo any procedure that may cause bleeding, such as any dental work (even a basic teeth cleaning), invasive tests (any test that may involve blood or bleeding), and most major or minor surgery. Your doctor can provide you with a card that provides specific antibiotic guidelines."

Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.'

What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What does the heart look like and how does it work?,"'This article is designed to help individuals learn the heart anatomy and circulatory system, and provide some insight about heart health. It is not designed to present the many problems that can occur with the heart.' The heart is an amazing organ. It starts beating about 22 days after conception and continuously pumps oxygenated red blood cells and nutrient-rich blood and other compounds like platelets throughout your body to sustain the life of your organs. Its pumping power also pushes blood through organs like the lungs to remove waste products like CO2. This fist-sized powerhouse beats (expands and contracts) about 100,000 times per day, pumping five or six quarts of blood each minute, or about 2,000 gallons per day. In general, if the heart stops beating, in about 4-6 minutes of no blood flow, brain cells begin to die and after 10 minutes of no blood flow, the brain cells will cease to function and effectively be dead. There are few exceptions to the above. The heart works by a regulated series of events that cause this muscular organ to contract (squeeze to push blood) and then relax (refill with blood). The normal heart has 4 chambers that undergo the squeeze and relax cycle at specific time intervals that are regulated by a normal sequence of electrical signals that arise from specialized tissue. In addition, the normal sequence of electrical signals can be sped up or slowed down depending on the needs of the individual, for example, the heart will automatically speed up electrical signals to respond to a person running and will automatically slow down when a person takes a nap."
"Heart diagram parts, location, and size","'Normal heart anatomy and physiology need the atria and ventricles to work sequentially, contracting and relaxing to pump blood out of the heart and then to let the chambers refill. When blood leaves each chamber of the heart, it passes through a valve that is designed to prevent backflow of blood. There are four heart valves within the heart:' The heart is located under the rib cage -- 2/3 of it is to the left of your breastbone (sternum) -- and between your lungs and above the diaphragm. The heart is about the size of a closed fist, weighs about 10.5 ounces and is somewhat cone-shaped. It is covered by a sack termed the pericardium or pericardial sack. The normal heart anatomy consists of a four-chambered, hollow organ. It is divided into the left and right side by a muscular wall called the septum. The right and left sides of the heart are further divided into two top chambers called the atria (also termed the right and left atrium), which receive blood and then pump it into the two bottom chambers called ventricles, which pump blood to the lungs and to the body. The coronary arteries are on the heart surface (left main, right coronary). The coronary arteries and veins comprise the heart’s own mini-circulatory system. Two major coronary arteries branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta and the left ventricle meet: Right coronary artery supplies the right atrium and right ventricle with blood. It branches into the posterior descending artery, which supplies the bottom portion of the left ventricle and back of the septum with blood. Left main coronary artery branches into the circumflex artery and the left anterior descending artery. The circumflex artery supplies blood to the left atrium, side and back of the left ventricle, and the left anterior descending artery supplies the front and bottom of the left ventricle and the front of the septum with blood. These arteries and their branches supply all parts of the heart muscle with blood. Mitral valve between the left atrium and left ventricle Tricuspid valve between the right atrium and right ventricle Aortic valve between the left ventricle and aorta Pulmonic valve (also called pulmonary valve) between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery The heart valves work the same way as one-way valves in the plumbing of your home. They prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction. Each valve has a set of flaps, called leaflets or cusps. The mitral valve has two leaflets; the others have three. The leaflets are attached to and supported by a ring of tough, fibrous tissue called the annulus. The annulus helps to maintain the proper shape of the valve. The leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves are also supported by tough, fibrous strings called chordae tendineae. These are similar to the strings supporting a parachute. They extend from the valve leaflets to small muscles, called papillary muscles, which are part of the inside walls of the ventricles. The endocardium is the membrane composed of epithelial cells that line the heart chambers and valves. It provides a slick surface so that red blood cells, platelets and other substances in blood will not stick to the heart’s inner surface. It also contains Purkinje fibers (specialized muscle cells that can transmit electrical impulses that can cause heart muscle contraction) and collagen fibers to make the endocardium elastic. In addition, a cluster of cells that are located in the upper right atrium is termed the SA (sinoatrial node or pacemaker), which generates electrical impulses. These impulses move down cells toward the AV node (atrioventricular node), another cluster of cells located near the center of the heart between the bottom of the right atria and the top of the ventricles. The AV node pauses the electrical impulse long enough to have the atria fully contract (squeeze blood out into the ventricles); then it allows the impulse to go into cells termed the bundle of His to the ventricles that split into the right and left bundle branches in the ventricles. The electrical impulse finally reaches Perkinje fibers and then cause the ventricles to contract to push blood into the lungs and aorta. The heart rate (pulse) and blood pressure are generated by ventricular contractions; the SA node impulse rate is influenced by the body’s autonomic nervous system. At rest, a normal heart beats around 50 to 99 times a minute. Exercise, emotions, fever, and some medications can cause your heart to beat faster, sometimes to well over 100 beats per minute."
How does blood flow through the right and left side of the heart?,"'The right and left sides of the heart work together. The pattern described below is repeated over and over (heart rhythm), causing blood to flow continuously to the heart, lungs, and body to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body cells and to deliver waste products to organs that remove them from your body. In general, veins return blood carrying CO2 while arteries usually contain O2 enriched red blood cells. However, the blood flow through the heart is a little different. For example:' Blood enters the heart through two large veins, the inferior and superior vena cava, emptying oxygen-poor blood from the body into the right atrium of the heart. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your right atrium into your right ventricle through the open tricuspid valve. When the ventricle is full, the tricuspid valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atria while the ventricle contracts. • As the ventricle contracts, blood leaves the heart through the pulmonic valve, into the pulmonary artery and to the lungs where it is oxygenated. Note that oxygen-poor or CO2 containing blood goes through the pulmonary artery to the lungs where CO2 is exchanged for O2. The pulmonary vein empties oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left atrium of the heart. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your left atrium into your left ventricle through the open mitral valve. When the ventricle is full, the mitral valve shuts. This prevents blood from flowing backward into the atrium while the ventricle contracts. As the ventricle contracts, oxygen-enriched blood leaves the heart through the aortic valve, into the aorta and to the arteries and eventually into veins to complete the blood circulation in your body."
How does blood flow through the heart to the lungs?," Once blood travels through the pulmonic valve, it enters your lungs. This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Here, oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs, through the walls of the capillaries, into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, passes from the blood into the air sacs. Carbon dioxide leaves the body when you exhale. Once the blood is purified and oxygenated, it travels back to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins."
How can you prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'According to the American Heart Association, no matter what age you are, your heart can benefit from a healthy ''diet'' and adequate physical activity.\xa0Tthere are numerous specific suggestions about how you can decrease your risk for ''heart disease''. For example:' Lower cholesterol (During and after menopause, cholesterol levels remain high so talk with your doctor about treatmenet and management.). Lower tryglicerides. Treat and manage high blood pressure. Treat and manage diabetes. Weight management. Heart healthy diet. Exercise. Reduce stress. Quit smoking cigarettes.

What causes heartburn during pregnancy?,"'The cause of heartburn (also called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) during pregnancy is more complicated than in the non-pregnant state. The basic cause of heartburn - reflux of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus''\xa0- is the same. The lower esophageal sphincter (the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus that normally prevents acid from refluxing) is weak in pregnancy. This probably is an effect of the high levels of ''estrogens'' and progesterones that are a normal part of pregnancy. This ''weakness'' resolves after delivery.''It is not known whether unexplained, transient relaxations of the sphincter, a common cause of reflux in women who are not pregnancy, it also occurs during pregnancy. It is not known if the contraction (motility) of the esophagus above the sphincter, a common contributor to GERD in women who are not pregnant is impaired in pregnancy, and is responsible for delaying the clearance of acid from the esophagus back into the stomach. What makes pregnancy different is the distortion of the organs in the abdomen and the increased abdominal pressure caused by the growing fetus. These changes clearly promote the reflux of acid.' "
Which diet and lifestyle changes relieve heartburn during pregnancy?,"'The management of heartburn (GERD) during pregnancy involves many of the same principles as management in the non-pregnant state. Lifestyle changes may include:' Raise the head of the bed on 6 to 8 inch blocks. Alternatively a 6 to 8 inch wedge-shaped foam rubber pad could be used to elevate the upper body. It is important the foam is firm enough to truly elevate the upper body. The wedge should also extend all the way to the waist so the entire chest is elevated. Lying on the left side at night may decrease acid reflux just as it does in non-pregnant women with GERD. In this position, it is physically more difficult for acid to reflux into the esophagus. Occasionally, it may be necessary to sleep in a recliner chair at a 45-degree or greater angle. Any specific foods that aggravate heartburn should be avoided (for example, coffee, cola, tea, alcohol, chocolate, fat, citrus juices, etc.) Frequent, small meals should be eaten rather than three large meals, and the last meal of the day should be early in the evening. After meals, pregnant women are prone to heartburn should not lie down. After the evening meal, no further liquids should be consumed. The emptier the stomach at bedtime, the less likely there will be reflux of acid. Smoking should be discontinued for numerous reasons during pregnancy, including that it aggravates reflux. Chewing gum also may be helpful. Chewing gum stimulates the production of saliva, which contains bicarbonate. The saliva and bicarbonate are swallowed, and the bicarbonate neutralizes the acid that has refluxed into the esophagus."
Which heartburn medications are used during pregnancy?,"'If lifestyle changes are not adequate, treatments with medications that are minimally absorbed into the body (and therefore not a potential threat to the fetus) could be started. Treatments include antacids (for example, ''Maalox'', ''Mylanta''), alginic acid/antacid combination (Gaviscon), and sucralfate (''Carafate''). The most reasonable first line of treatment is antacids alone, one hour after meals and at bedtime. It may be necessary to alternate magnesium and aluminum-containing antacids to avoid ''diarrhea'' or ''constipation''. If antacids alone are not effective, then they should be continued and alginic acid/antacid may be added. Antacids and alginic acid/antacid should be taken after meals and at bedtime, more frequently if necessary, as advised by your doctor.''Sucralfate acts by coating and protecting the lining of the esophagus and stomach and is more effective in an acidic environment. Thus, if sucralfate is being used, it should be taken one-half hour before or after doses of antacids or alginic acid/antacid for maximal effect. A small study in pregnant women showed sucralfate is successful in relieving heartburn and studies in animals have not shown adverse effects of sucralfate on the fetus.' "
Are heartburn drugs safe to take during pregnancy?,"  Some antacids, alginic acid/antacid, and sucralfate contain aluminum, and small amounts of aluminum are absorbed into the body. However, the extra aluminum does not accumulate in the body unless there is impairment in the function of the kidneys, which normally excrete the excess aluminum. Absorption of aluminum probably does not present a problem for the fetus unless the mother has kidney impairment. Magnesium-containing antacids could slow labor. (Intravenous magnesium has been used therapeutically to slow labor that is progressing too rapidly.) This potential problem only applies to magnesium-containing antacids taken just prior to labor and is not of concern earlier in pregnancy. Antacids may interfere with iron absorption, and iron is important for the growing fetus. Pregnant women usually receive supplemental iron and a slight decrease in iron absorption (considering the use of supplements) should not result in a deficiency of iron. Insufficient iron intake or absorption is easily detected in blood tests as iron deficiency anemia. If antacids, alginic acid/antacid, and sucralfate are not effective in controlling heartburn, probably the safest absorbed drugs that can be given are the H2 antagonists, such as cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac), and famotidine (Pepcid). Although there are no studies in pregnant women, animal studies have shown no effects on the fetuses of animals. Nizatidine (Axid) should not be used because it has been shown to have adverse effects on animal fetuses, although at much greater doses than those used in humans. Proton pump inhibitors are similar to the H2 antagonists with respect to safety. Lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), and esomeprazole (Nexium) have been shown to be safe when tested in pregnant animals, but because they are newer, experience with them is less than with the H2 antagonists. They should be used only when H2 antagonists in normal doses fail to control heartburn. Omeprazole (Cimetidine, Zegerid) probably should be avoided since although there are no studies in pregnant women showing problems, it has been shown to have effects on animal fetuses at very high doses in some studies. Concerns about the use of H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are greatest during the first trimester when small drug-induced alterations in fetal development can result in major birth defects. Concerns are less during the second trimester and even less during the third trimester when most critical development of the fetus already has taken place. Talk to your doctor before taking any medications to treat heartburn during pregnancy. Metoclopramide (Reglan) is used infrequently in treating GERD. Effects on the fetuses of animals have not been demonstrated and it can be used in pregnancy. Because of its neurologic side effects, it should be the drug of last resort."
What is heartburn? What is acid reflux? Are they the same thing?,"'Acid reflux'' occurs when stomach acid backs up into the ''esophagus'' irritating the tissue.''Heartburn'', or ''acid indigestion'', is a symptom of acid reflux, so named because the esophagus lies just behind the heart, and that is where the burning sensation is felt.' "
What is the difference between heartburn and acid reflux?,"'Heartburn is a symptom of acid reflux. Heartburn describes a feeling of burning, ''pain'', or discomfort in the chest that can be quite uncomfortable. You also may a sour or bitter taste in the throat and mouth, and it usually occurs after you eat a big meal or when you lay down.''Not everyone with ''GERD'' will experience heartburn. Other ''symptoms of acid reflux'' include regurgitation of acid into the throat or mouth, a bitter taste in the mouth, ''upset stomach'', ''belching'', ''nausea'' after eating, feeling full, stomach and upper abdomen ''bloating'', dry ''cough'', ''wheezing'', ''hoarseness'', feeling of tightness in the throat, and in some people, ''vomiting''.'

What causes heartburn vs. acid reflux?," Drinking alcohol Smoking Obesity Poor posture (slouching) Certain medications (calcium channel blockers, theophylline, nitrates, antihistamines) Certain foods (fatty and fried foods chocolate, garlic and onions, caffeinated drinks, acidic foods such as citrus fruits and tomatoes, spicy foods, mint) Eating large meals Eating too quickly Eating before bedtime Hiatal hernia Pregnancy Diabetes Increase in stomach acid (from stress, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, stomach tumors) Weight gain"
Foods that aggravate heartburn and acid reflux,'Foods that may cause or aggravate acid reflux and heartburn include:'  Fried and fatty foods Chocolate Garlic and onions Caffeinated beverages Acidic foods such as citrus fruits and tomatoes Spicy foods Mint
How can my doctor tell if I have heartburn or acid reflux?,"'A medical doctor can often diagnose GERD (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'') and heartburn by your description of the symptoms your experience.''You may see a gastroenterologist, a medical specialist in disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, who may order an ''upper GI series''. This is a series of ''X-rays'' of the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the intestine often used to rule out other health conditions. An upper GI ''endoscopy'', where a flexible probe with a tiny camera at the end is passed down your throat to see the esophagus. This helps diagnose how severe your acid reflux is, and can also rule out other health complications.''If your symptoms are not clearly from acid reflux, your doctor may perform other tests to rule out important conditions like heart attack, ulcers, lung problems, esophagus problems, and ''gastritis''.' "
How are heartburn and acid reflux treated?,"'If ''diet'' and lifestyle changes and OTC medications don’t make a difference in relieving your condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat your reflux and heartburn such as:'  Avoid eating close to bedtime. Don’t lie down soon after eating. Don’t eat large meals. Eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day may make a difference. Avoid trigger foods that can aggravate symptoms such as fatty or greasy foods, chocolate, caffeine, mint, spicy foods, citrus, and tomato-based foods. Avoid alcohol. Don’t smoke. Lose weight, if overweight. Maintain good posture. Talk to your doctor if you take any medications that may cause symptoms of acid reflux and heartburn to see if there are alternatives. Do not stop taking any prescribed medications without first consulting your doctor. Over-the-counter antacids (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums, and Gaviscon), or histamine-2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) [cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid)] may be used. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and pantoprazole (Protonix) Coating agents: sucralfate (Carafate) Promotility agents: metoclopramide (Reglan, Clopra, Maxolon) and bethanechol (Duvoid, Urabeth, Urecholine)"
Is there a cure for heartburn or acid reflux?,"'Most of the time, diet and lifestyle changes can help relieve or cure symptoms of acid reflux (GERD) and heartburn. In some cases over-the-counter or prescription ''drugs'' may be needed.''In rare cases, a last resort to cure acid reflux is a surgery called ''fundoplication''. During this surgery, a surgeon wraps part of the stomach around the esophagus like a collar, which works to increase pressure in the lower esophagus to keep acid from backing up.' "
Facts you should know about heart attacks and heartburn,"'This comparison of differences between ''heartburn'' and ''heart attack'' are not 100% specific, and only serve to help you differentiate the two conditions to some extent. ''If there is any ''confusion'' or doubt about if you or someone you are with is having ''heartburn'' or a ''heart attack'', you call 911 or go to an emergency department immediately.'  Heartburn is a symptom of another condition, for example, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and usually is caused by stomach acid that causes irritation of the esophagus. Heart attack usually is caused by coronary artery blockage or heart disease. Heartburn symptoms often occur after eating a heavy meal, or at night. Heart attack can occur at any time. Heartburn pain may begin at the breastbone and travel up toward the throat. You may feel food coming back into the mouth, and have an acidic or bitter taste in your throat along with increased severity pain if you bend over. Warning signs of a heart attack often is pain in the chest that spreads to the shoulders, neck, or arms. The person can develop a cold sweat, dizziness, shortness of breath, and possibly nausea and vomiting. These symptoms infrequently or rarely occur with heartburn. Heartburn pain usually responds quickly to antacids and/or belching, whereas heart attack pain usually does not respond to oral antacids. Heart attacks require other medications and/or treatments. Most people that suffer from heartburn pain have discomfort, but the problem is seldom life threatening. In stark contrast, heart attacks always are considered medical emergencies and need immediate attention, as many heart attacks are life threatening."
What is heartburn? What is a heart attack?,"'Heartburn (''acid reflux'') is a symptom, and usually feels like a burning sensation in the chest, under the sternum, and in the ''esophagus'' that can extend to the neck, throat, and/or face. Heartburn often is caused by a malfunction in the esophageal sphincter muscle (a muscular valve located between the stomach and the esophagus), which causes regurgitation (reverse flow) of acid from the stomach into the esophagus.''Heartburn is a misnomer because it does not involve the heart. Other names for heartburn include ''indigestion'', ''dyspepsia'', ''acid reflux'', ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''), pyrolysis, and even ""cardialgia.""''A heart attack often is a sudden and sometimes fatal occurrence of coronary thrombosis (coronary artery blockage) that frequently produces ''chest pain'' and/or additional pain that may radiate to the neck, jaw, and/or arms. ''Heart attacks'' involve the heart and not the esophagus or acid regurgitation.''Because the esophagus and heart are located near each other, many people consider pain in that region as a sign of either heartburn or a heart attack. However, individuals may often not know how to tell heartburn from a heart attack.' "
Are there similarities among the signs and symptoms of heart attack and heartburn?,"'A person can have these symptoms with either heartburn or a heart attack. Since the symptoms are so similar, it often makes it difficult for some people to tell if they are having heartburn or a heart attack.' Chest pain (may or may not rise toward the throat and/or spread to the shoulders, neck, jaw and/or arms). The pain may linger or subside. Nausea Upset stomach"
What are the differences between the signs and symptoms of heart attack and heartburn?,"'Although most of the early signs and symptoms can be the same for heartburn and heart attack, a few are different. A heart attack most often causes signs and symptoms that include:''Although heartburn may produce some less severe symptoms, heartburn is rarely life threatening. In contrast, ''heart attacks'' are frequently life threatening. I''f there is any doubt in your mind as to whether you or someone you are with has symptoms indicating heartburn or heart attack, you should call 911 immediately to be transported to an emergency department for medical treatment.'   Shortness of breath (may be severe) Diaphoretic (sweating or a “cold sweat” – produced by fear, anxiety or illness) Increasing chest pain or sudden, severe and unrelenting chest pain Evolving EKG changes Nausea and vomiting Unusual weakness or fatigue Persistent and/or increasing severity of symptoms over minutes"
How do doctors diagnose a heart attack and heartburn?,"'Most people with heartburn are diagnosed by their symptoms that they describe to their primary care doctor. However, definitive diagnosis of heartburn may be made by ''endoscopy'' and pH probe data, which is frequently done by gastroenterologists. However, it is common practice for doctors to rule out heart attack or any other pending cardiac problem to make sure the individual is not suffering from a potentially life-threatening problem.''The two main tests to diagnose heart attack are an ''EKG'' (''electrocardiogram'') and a test to determine the level of certain enzymes in the blood (troponins). Additional tests for a heart attack (or evidence for a potential heart attack) can be done by ''echocardiogram'', chest ''X-rays'', coronary catheterization (''angiogram''), and ''exercise'' ''stress'' tests.' "
How do heart attack and heartburn treatment options differ?,"'The treatment for heartburn is varies with the severity of the disease that causes heartburn. Some people can treat heartburn with ''diet'' modifications, for example, avoiding acid causing foods such as ''chocolate'', ''caffeine'', spicy foods, carbonated ''drinks'' and citrus.''People with mild heartburn may only need only antacids ''over-the-counter'' occasionally, for example, ''Tums'' or Rolaids to relieve heartburn symptoms.''Moderate to more severe heartburn disease may require histamine receptor antagonists (H2 blockers like ''Pepcid'' or ''Zantac''), protein pump inhibitors (''PPIs'') that reduce stomach acid production, for example, ''esomeprazole'' (''Nexium'') or ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec''), or even surgery (''fundoplication'').''The treatment for a heart attack may vary somewhat from patient to patient, depending upon the extent or severity of the attack. In general, however, a heart attack is treated in either the emergency department and/or the hospital intensive care unit, ''cardiac catheterization'' unit, or a telemetry unit. Since a heart attack may be due to complete or partial coronary artery blockage, the treatments may vary, and may overlap depending on your cardiologist’s decision.' "
Is it possible to prevent a heart attack or heartburn?,"'There is a good possibility that both heartburn or a heart attack can be reduced or prevented. A balanced ''diet'' along with ''exercise'' is key to preventing for both heartburn and or heart attack. In addition to treating the underlying cause of heartburn, there are life style changes and natural home remedies that may help prevent it.''The chances of reducing or stopping recurrent or initial ''heart attacks'' may be prevented by lifestyle changes, for example:' Eat small, more frequent meals. Do not eat about three hours before bedtime. Elevate the head of your bed by about 6 inches. Do not eat or drink foods that are acidic or trigger acid development in the stomach. If you are obese, lose weight. Stop smoking and/or drinking alcohol. Try to take your heartburn medication at the same time each day. Stop smoking. Eat a balanced diet and exercise. Reduce stress by doing yoga, meditation and/or increase relaxation. Keep your blood pressure in the normal range. Take appropriate medication to treat other medical problems such as diabetes. If you are obese, lose weight. Keep your cholesterol levels within the normal ranges."
What is the prognosis for a heart attack and heartburn?,"'The prognosis for the majority of people with heartburn is good to excellent if they try to prevent any future problems. Severe heartburn has a reduced prognosis as it can lead to esophageal damage, Barrett’s esophagus, and/or inability to swallow due to stricture formation.''The prognosis of a heart attack may be good to fair if treated immediately; however, the prognosis decreases if a large amount of heart muscle is damaged or destroyed during a heart attack. Complications of heart attacks include irregular heartbeat (arrhythmias), heart valve damage, ''heart failure'', additional heart attacks, and/or sudden death.''Complications occur more frequently after a person survives a heart attack. Complications occur less frequently after heartburn.' "
What is superficial heat and cold therapy?,"'Superficial heat and ''cold'' therapy are adjunctive therapy used for ''pain'' control and sports injury treatment. These therapies exert their effects at a depth of 1-2 cm. In general, these therapies limit tissue damage, control symptoms, and restore the function of the injured part.''Superficial heat therapy exhibits the following effects in the body:''Superficial cold therapy exhibits the following opposite effects as those exhibited by heat therapy:' Dilation of the blood vessels Increase in cell metabolism Muscle relaxation Pain reduction due to relaxed muscle Sedative effect Reduction in the viscosity of the synovial fluid (fluid surrounding the joints) to reduce joint stiffness Acceleration in inflammation Constriction of blood vessels Numbing effect The decrease in blood flow The slowdown in the cell metabolism Reduction of oxygen in the injured part Reduced swelling Reduced muscle efficiency Pain reduction"
What are the different types of heat transfer in superficial heat therapy?,"'The transfer of heat is generally classified into three types:' Conductive heating: The transfer of heat takes place as direct contact with the conducting medium. Examples of conductive heating are hot water baths, hot packs, electric heating pads, and warm compresses.Hot packs contain silica gel in a cotton bag. These packs are placed in a hot water tank, which is controlled at a temperature of 71.1-79.4°C. The silica gel soaks a large quantity of water and has high heat capacity.

The silica gel soaks a large quantity of water and has high heat capacity. Convective heating: The transfer of heat takes place with the help of the movement of heat (energy) through the conducting medium such as air or fluid. Examples of convective heating are fluid therapy, moist air baths, hydrotherapy, and hot-air baths.Fluidotherapy uses a bed of round, uniform, finely divided solids, such as glass beads, into which the temperature-controlled warm air is blown to generate a warm, semiliquid mixture. The patient’s hand, foot, or leg is immersed in the mixture for superficial heating.

The patient’s hand, foot, or leg is immersed in the mixture for superficial heating. Conversion heating: In this, one energy form (light, sound) is converted into another (heat).  An example of conversion heating is radiant heat. Radiant heat involves the penetration of high-energy photons into the tissues, where the energy is converted into heat."
When is superficial heat therapy utilized?,'Patients with the following conditions are indicated for the application of hot packs (conductive heating):''Patients with the following conditions are indicated for using convective heating:' Painful muscle spasm Abdominal muscle cramping Menstrual cramps Superficial thrombophlebitis (an inflammatory process that causes a blood clot to form) Arthritic conditions of small joints Infected draining wound Back muscle spasms Inflammation or pain in the joints
When is superficial cold therapy utilized?,'Cold therapy or ''cryotherapy'' has the primary effect of cooling the tissues. Local application of cold therapy is indicated in patients' To reduce swelling/edema. To treat burns. To reduce pain. To decrease the acute inflammatory reaction. To reduce muscle contraction. To treat muscle weakness. To treat restricted knee bending due to lower leg fractures.
When should be superficial heat and cold therapy avoided?,'Conductive heating in the form of paraffin baths should be avoided when treating open wounds.''Convective heating should be avoided in the following situations:''Radiant heat is avoided in patients with the following conditions:''Cryotherapy is avoided in patients with the following conditions:' Fluidotherapy is not recommended for treating open wounds in patients. Hydrotherapy should be avoided in patients immediately following surgery.

What are heat cramps?,"'Heat cramps are the intermittent, involuntary spasm of muscles that occur in an individual who is physically active (for example, working or exercising) in hot or humid weather. They are often associated with ''dehydration''. Heat cramps usually affect the major muscles that are being stressed in the hot environment. Usually these are the thigh and leg (''quadriceps'', hamstrings, and gastrocnemius), the core muscles (abdominal wall and back) and the arm muscles (biceps, triceps).''Heat cramps can also occur after the activity has been completed. For example, construction workers or roofers can develop cramps a few hours after their work shift is over.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heat cramps?,"'Heat cramps are the earliest symptoms of the spectrum of heat-related illness.''Do individuals with heat cramps tend only to have ''muscle cramps''?'' If an individual has other signs or symptoms such as ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', and ''headache'' he or she may be suffering from heat exhaustion. Affected individuals who have stopped sweating or who develop a ''fever'' and become confused may be developing heat ''stroke'', which is a true medical emergency.'   There is usually significant sweating with involuntary spasm of the large muscles in the body. The muscles that cramp are usually those that have been stressed. Runners and football players tend to get leg muscle cramps, but people who lift objects as part of their job can get cramps in the muscles of the arms or the core trunk muscles like the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominus). Heat cramps usually begin after significant activity has occurred, but they also can occur hours after the activity has been completed."
What causes heat cramps?,"'While it was thought that ''dehydration'' and ''electrolyte'' imbalance was the cause of muscle cramping, there are alternative theories as to why muscles cramp when the body is exposed to heat.''Some research suggests that as the muscles tire from excess activity or work, the ability for the muscle to regulate its own contraction is lost, and this is called altered neuromuscular control. Regardless of the cause, the diagnosis and treatment for heat cramps remain the same.'  "
Who is at risk for heat cramps?,"""While heat cramps tend to affect those who are active in a hot environment, it should be noted that heat cramps are one of the symptoms associated with heat exhaustion as part of the spectrum of heat-related illness. Those individuals who have impaired temperature control mechanisms are at higher risk for developing heat-related illness. The body's most effective way of cooling itself is through sweat, and then the sweat evaporates into the environment. Those at most risk for heat cramps include:"" Infants and young children because they depend upon others to avoid the heat, dress them appropriately (avoid swaddling an infant since it prevents air movement over the skin to promote sweat evaporation) and provide enough fluid to drink The elderly because they may have underlying medical conditions, including heart and lung disease, and they can easily become dehydrated People who live by themselves or who cannot afford air conditioning are at higher risk for heat related illness A variety of medications can impair the body's sweat and heat regulation. Examples of drugs include medication prescribed for psychiatric conditions, including antipsychotic medications and tranquilizers. Over-the-counter cold medications and antihistamines also impair the body's temperature control mechanism. Alcohol consumption"
When should an individual seek medical care for heat cramps?,"'Heat cramps can usually be treated when and where they occur. The affected individual should stop all activity and find a cool place to rest. The muscle cramps and spasms can be overcome by gently stretching the cramped muscle(s). Individuals can often replace their fluid loss by drinking a combination of water, sports ''drinks'', or other electrolyte replacement solutions.''If the cramps cannot be controlled, the affected individual should seek medical care. There is no specific condition that differentiates heat cramps from heat exhaustion. The symptoms of these conditions form a spectrum from mild to moderate heat-related illness and symptoms can overlap. Severe heat cramps may actually be heat exhaustion. This is especially true if the person has ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'' and cannot replace the fluid loss, if they have significant ''fatigue'' and weakness, or if they have profuse sweating that does not stop when placed in a cooler environment.''Heat ''stroke'' is a true medical emergency and can be deadly.'"" The body's ability to cool itself no longer functions, and as the temperature spikes, sometimes greater than 106 F (41 C), ""'confusion'' and ''coma'' can occur. Emergency medical services should be activated (call 911) immediately if an individual is thought to have heat ''stroke''. While waiting for help to arrive, the person should be moved to a cool place, clothes should be removed to help air circulate over the body, and cool water should be sprayed or sponged onto the body to attempt to cool it.''Prevention'' is the key to avoiding heat cramps, or other heat-related illness. A person who has had heat cramps is more prone to developing them again. Some professions are at higher risk for heat cramps, for example, construction workers and roofers are potentially exposed not only to the heat from the sun but also from the radiant heat from the hot ''shingles'' and liners on the roof. It may be helpful to acclimate to the hot environment over a period of days to allow the body and its muscles to adapt to its water and electrolyte needs.' "
How are heat cramps diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of heat cramps is usually made after taking the patient's history. It is important to know about the environment where the person affected by heat cramps was working, exercising, etc...""""Often the physical examination will be relatively normal. The cramped muscles may be sore to touch and if there hasn't been adequate fluid replacement, the muscle may cramp again when taken through its normal range of motion. The physical exam may find signs of dehydration such as a ""'dry mouth'' and tongue, lack of sweat in the armpits and groin, and decreased urine output. The vital signs can be a clue (for example, ''low blood pressure'"") and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). The affected person's ""'blood pressure'' may be much lower upon standing compared to lying down (''orthostatic hypotension'').' How hot was it? How humid was it? Was there adequate air circulation? What activity was being performed and for how long? When did the cramps start? What muscles were involved? Was there associated sweating? Had the affected individual been acclimated to the hot environment? Was the person drinking enough water? One sign of heat cramps or a heat-related illness may be the color of urine. When the body becomes dehydrated, the kidneys conserve water and the result is concentrated, strong smelling, darker, yellow urine. If there is adequate water in the body the urine tends to be clear."
What first aid treatments can help heat cramps?,"'Most ''first aid'' treatment for heat cramps can occur before seeking medical care:'""At the health care professional's office or a hospital, medical care focuses on symptom relief.""'It makes it difficult to replace body fluids if the patient has nausea or vomiting, so intravenous fluids may be administered. ''Anti-nausea'' medications like ''promethazine'' (Phenergan), ''prochlorperazine'' (''Compazine''), droperidol (''Inapsine''), or ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') may be used to control those symptoms.''Painful muscles may be treated with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'', ''Nuprin'', and others) or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'', ''Anaprox'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Naprelan''). Though it is a non-prescription medication, it is important to remember that there may side effects or interactions with prescription medications. When you are not certain which medication to consider, consult your health care professional or pharmacist as a helpful information resource.'  stop the activity being performed, get to a cooler place, drink plenty of fluids, and gently stretch the muscles that are cramping."
What are the complications of heat cramps?,"'There are few long-term consequences of heat cramps, however, once a person experiences heat cramps, they may be at risk for future episodes.' "
How can heat cramps be prevented?,"'Prevention is the best treatment for heat cramps. If possible, try to avoid working or exercising in the heat of the day, but if it is required, acclimating to the hot weather is important. Drink plenty of fluids and if the activity lasts a prolonged period, consider using sports or balanced electrolyte drinks. This is especially true if significant sweating occurs and ''electrolytes'' are lost through sweat. Try to rest in cool or shaded areas whenever possible.' "
What is the prognosis for heat cramps?,"'Heat cramps resolve with relatively simple treatments including rest, hydration and stretching. It is important to remember that heat cramps are the initial presentation of heat related illness and may progress to the more serious conditions of heat exhaustion or heat ''stroke''.' "
What is heat exhaustion?,"'The body cools itself most efficiently by sweating and having that sweat evaporate. Should sweating be unable to meet the cooling demands of the body, ''heat-related illness'' can occur. This is a spectrum of conditions with minor symptoms such as ''prickly heat'' or ''heat rash'', progressing to heat ''cramps'', then heat exhaustion, and finally to heat ''stroke'', a life-threatening medical condition.''The line between each diagnosis is not sharply drawn. Heat cramps describe involuntary spasm of the large muscles of the body, while heat exhaustion has more systemic complaints such as the signs and symptoms listed above.''The affected individual may be a low-grade ''fever'"". Heat stroke is a life-threatening situation where the body's cooling system fails. The body temperature spirals out of control usually greater than 106F (41 C), sweating stops, and there are ""'mental status changes'' like ''confusion'', ''seizure'', or ''coma''.'""Heat exhaustion occurs when a person exercises or works in a hot environment and sweating cannot dissipate the heat generated within the body. Often dehydration occurs because the person hasn't replaced the water lost by sweating. Heat exhaustion also may occur if a person lives in a hot environment without adequate air circulation and does not drink an adequate amount of water."" "
What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?,"'There is no set line that distinguishes heat exhaustion from heat stroke. If a person is suffering from a heat-related illness such as heat exhaustion, and changes in mental status occur, he or she should be considered to be suffering from heat stroke. This includes confusion, lethargy, seizure, or ''coma''. This is a medical emergency, and if treatment is delayed mortality can be greater than 50%. While victims of heat exhaustion sweat profusely, people suffering from heat stroke stop sweating and have ''dry skin''. This is a warning sign of impending heat stroke.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion?,"'Individuals with heat exhaustion tend to have symptoms such as''As dehydration increases from the loss of body water, lightheadedness may occur and ''fainting'' (''syncope'') may occur, especially if the affected individual stands up quickly (due to ''orthostatic hypotension'').The person also may have a low-grade ''fever''.'   profuse sweating, weakness, muscle cramps, headache, and nausea and vomiting."
What causes heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion occurs when a person exercises and works in a hot environment and the body cannot cool itself adequately. Dehydration occurs with water loss from ''excessive sweating'"", which causes muscle cramps, weakness, and nausea and vomiting. The nausea and vomiting makes it difficult to drink enough fluid to replenish the body's water supply, and the lack of body water impairs further sweating, evaporation and cooling.""'Relative humidity is an important factor in developing heat exhaustion. If the humidity is too high, sweat on the skin cannot evaporate into the surrounding air and body temperature cooling fails.''Living in a hot environment may predispose a person to heat exhaustion. During a heat wave, the elderly, the poor, and those who live an isolated life may not have access to air conditioning and are at risk of heat-related illnesses.'  "
Who is at risk for heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion usually affects people who are working or exercising in a hot environment, and those who do not have access to adequate water. Those at risk for heat exhaustion include:''The body has the ability to acclimate to hot weather but if heat waves come suddenly, or if a person travels from a cooler environment to a hot environment, the risk of heat exhaustion increases. It takes about 7 to 10 days for the body to adapt to hot weather. A non-acclimated person can produce a liter or almost a quart of sweat in an hour to assist in cooling the body. A person who is acclimated to the heat can produce 2 or 3 liters of sweat per hour, doubling or tripling the cooling potential for the body.''This water lost in sweat needs to be replaced for the sweating/cooling mechanism to work. A liter of sweat weighs 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds.' Infants and young children are at risk because their temperature regulation mechanisms are not fully developed. They also are dependent upon others for water and appropriate clothing. The elderly are similarly at risk because of underlying medical conditions that limit the ability to sweat including poor circulation, skin changes, and chronic medication usage. Socioeconomic issues increase the risk of heat exhaustion if access to air conditioning is limited. During heat waves, large cities often open cooling centers to help minimize the risk of large numbers of people succumbing to heat-related illness. Certain medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and tranquilizers may impair the ability of the body to sweat. Alcohol consumption The overweight or obese"
When should an individual seek medical care for heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion usually can be treated at home as long as the affected individual can replace the lost fluid, keep well hydrated, and find a cool place to rest. Water, ''electrolyte'' replacement solutions, or sport ''drinks'' are appropriate to consume. If nausea and vomiting prevent rehydration, the individual should seek medical attention, and may need IV fluids for rehydration.''Muscles cramps can be severe and if stretching and rehydration cannot relieve recurrent cramps, medical care may be necessary.''It is important to recognize that if the person stops sweating, becomes confused, or has a seizure, ''heat stroke'', a life-threatening condition, may be developing. Emergency medical services should be activated immediately (call 911 if available). The affected individual should be moved to a cooler place, have their clothing removed, and attempts should be made to cool the body with ''cold'' compresses, spraying or sponging the body with cool water and promoting air circulation with oscillating fans.' "
Which type of doctors treat heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion is often treated by emergency physicians and health care providers working in urgent care clinics.''Since heat exhaustion also routinely occurs during athletic activities including practices, certified athletic trainers and team physicians are able to care for these patients.' "
How is heat exhaustion diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis of heat exhaustion is made by circumstantial evidence:''Laboratory tests are not routinely performed unless the health care professional is concerned about electrolyte imbalance or significant dehydration and ''kidney failure''.''However, it is important for the health care professional to consider other diagnoses, since there are many infectious illnesses that accompany a fever, weakness, nausea and vomiting. This is especially the case in the elderly and very young. In these groups, heat exhaustion may be a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other more serious illnesses should be considered before settling on heat as the cause of the problem. History and physical examination may be all that is needed.' History (exercising or working in a hot environment, living in a hot apartment with no air-conditioning) Symptoms (excess sweating, headache, weakness, nausea and vomiting) Physical examination (signs of dehydration)"
What is the first aid treatment for heat exhaustion?,"   Cooling and rehydration are the cornerstones for treating heat exhaustion. The affected individual should stop their activity, and then move or be moved from the hot environment to a cooler environment. The person may be placed in the shade or taken to an air-conditioned environment (don't forget that cars have air conditioning). Clothes may be removed to help with air circulation across the body. Misting the skin with cool water also helps by stimulating evaporation and cooling the body. Rehydration is the next important step in treating heat exhaustion. This may be a challenge if the person begins to suffer from nausea and vomiting. Small sips of water, a mouthful at a time, might be tolerated even if some vomiting persists. Water, sports drink and other electrolyte replacement drinks are reasonable options. If oral rehydration fails or if symptoms persist, intravenous fluids may be required to replace the water loss because of the excessive sweating. Hydration continues until the patient begins to urinate, a signal that the kidneys have sensed that there is enough fluid in the body, and it no longer retains fluid. Muscles cramps and pain may be treated with over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, etc.) and acetaminophen (Tylenol and others)."
What are the complications of heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion is one part of the spectrum of heat-related illness, and symptoms should be reversible with treatment. However, some affected individuals do not recognize their symptoms and if they are not removed from the hot environment, cooled, and rehydrated, the heat-related illness can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition.''Individuals who have suffered from heat exhaustion are more prone to experience another episode and should be cautious when working or exercising in hot conditions.'  "
How can heat exhaustion be prevented?,"""Understanding one's environment is perhaps the most important step in preventing heat-related illness. If possible, strenuous activities should not be performed in excessively hot or humid environments. However, people often have to work in the heat of the day, or indoors in hot situations and need to make the effort to protect their bodies. These can include frequent breaks taken in a cooler areas, adequate fluid intake, and slowing the pace of work to decrease heat generated by the body.""'A person at risk for heat exhaustion should watch their urine output to monitor their hydration status .If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will hold onto water, and make concentrated, strong smelling urine. If enough water is present, the urine will turn clear.''Acclimating to conditions allows the body to perform in situations that would otherwise be difficult. The body will make physiologic changes allowing it to cool more efficiently, if it has gradual exposure to hot conditions. Moving from a cool to very hot environment quickly increases the risk of developing heat related-illness symptoms.'""It is important to look after family and loved ones during heat waves. When the temperature rises, the elderly or those less fortunate may not have air conditioning or the ability to cool their homes. Cities often set up cooling centers when the heat index rises, and there is an increased risk of heat-related illness. In 1995, Chicago experienced a record heat wave that killed hundreds of people. Most were elderly and the poor who had no air conditioning or could not afford to use it. Some wouldn't open their windows for fear of crime. In 2015, heat waves were responsible for more than 5,000 deaths in India and Pakistan."" "
What is the prognosis for heat exhaustion?,"'Most individuals recover well from heat exhaustion. The key to recovery is recognizing symptoms before they progress to heat stroke. The earlier the activity is stopped, the individual is cooled and hydration begins, the greater the likelihood that complications will not occur.' "
What is heat rash?,"""The skin's job is to protect the inside of the body from the outside world. It acts as a preventive barrier against intruders that cause infection, chemicals, or ultraviolet light from invading or damaging the body. It also plays an important role in the body's temperature control. One way that the body cools itself is by ""'sweating'', and allowing that sweat or ''perspiration'' to evaporate. Sweat is manufactured in sweat glands that line the entire body (except for a few small spots like fingernails, toenails, and the ear canal).''Sweat glands are located in the dermis or deep layer of the skin, and are regulated by the temperature control centers in the brain. Sweat from the gland gets to the surface of the skin by a duct.'""A heat rash occurs when sweat ducts become clogged and the sweat cannot get to the surface of the skin. Instead, it becomes trapped beneath the skin's surface causing a mild inflammation or rash.""'Heat rash is also called prickly heat or miliaria.'  "
What are the causes of heat rash?,"'It is uncertain why some people get heat ''rashes'"" and others don't.""'The sweat gland ducts can become blocked if ''excessive sweating'' occurs, and that sweat is not allowed to evaporate from a specific area. Some examples of how blockage may occur include the following:''Babies'"" have immature sweat glands that aren't able to efficiently remove the sweat they produce. They can develop heat rash if they are exposed to warm weather, are overdressed, excessively bundled, or have a ""'fever''.''Heat rash may occur as a side effect of some medications (for example ''clonidine'' [''Catapres'']).'   Creases in the skin like the neck, armpit, or groin have skin touching adjacent skin, which makes it difficult for air to circulate, and prevents sweat evaporation. Tight clothing that prevents sweat evaporation. Bundling up in heavy clothing or sheets. This may occur when a person tries to keep warm in wintertime or when chilled because of an illness with fever. Heavy creams or lotions can clog sweat ducts."
What are the symptoms of heat rash in children and adults?,"'The common symptoms of heat rash are red ''bumps'' on the skin, and an ''itchy'' or prickly feeling to the skin. These are due to inflammation of the superficial layers of the skin (the ''epidermis'') and the prickly sensation is similar to the feeling of mild ''sunburn''.''The symptoms of heat rash are the same in infants and adults; however, since an infant cannot complain about the rash sensation, he or she may be fussy.'  "
Who is at risk for heat rash?,"'Newborns, infants, the elderly, and ''obese'' individuals with large areas with skin-on-skin contact areas (for example, a large overlapping area of ''abdominal fat'') are at risk for developing heat rash. They all are especially at risk if they are immobile for long periods and parts of the skin aren\'t exposed to circulating air, which results in the inability of the sweat ducts to ""breathe"" (evaporative cooling).''Heat ''rashes'' are more common in places with hot, humid, climates because people sweat more.''Intense ''exercise'' associated with lots of ''sweating'' may cause a heat rash, especially if the clothing worn does not allow adequate air circulation.' "
What does heat rash look like?,"'The appearance of the heat rash depends upon where the excess sweat is deposited in the skin.''Tiny blisters that look like small beads of sweat are seen if the sweat is blocked at the most superficial layers of the skin where the sweat duct opens on the skin surface. Called ''miliaria crystallina'', it has no symptoms other than these ""sweat bubbles.""''Classic heat rash or ''miliaria rubra'"" occurs if the sweat causes inflammation in the deeper layers of the epidermis. Like any other inflammation, the area becomes red (and therefore the name rubra = red) and the blisters become slightly larger. Because the sweat ducts are blocked and don't deliver sweat to the skin's surface, the area involved is dry and can be irritated, itchy, and sore. This rash is also called ""'prickly heat''.''Less commonly, after repeated episodes of prickly heat, the heat rash may inflame the deeper layer of the skin called the dermis, and cause ''miliaria profunda''. This rash is made up of larger, harder bumps that are more skin colored. The rash begins almost immediately after ''exercise'', and again no sweat can be found on the affected areas. Rarely, this type of heat rash may be potentially dangerous if enough skin is involved, since the lack of sweating can lead to heat-related illnesses like ''heat cramps'', ''heat exhaustion'', or ''heat stroke''.' "
Heat rash pictures, 
How is heat rash diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of heat rash is made by physical examination. Knowing that the rash appears during sweating or heat, appreciating the location on the body (in skin creases or where clothes fit tightly) and seeing what the rash looks like is enough to make the diagnosis. As with many rashes, the health care professional may look at the involved skin and because of previous experience, immediately make the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for heat rash?,'Treatment for heat rash include home remedies such as ''over-the-counter'' creams and sprays. Medical treatment for heat rash may involve antibiotics if the sweat glands become infected.'  
Home remedies for heat rash,"'Heat rash often resolves on its own when the skin cools. If the prickly sensation persists, ''calamine lotion'' may be helpful. Some clinicians also recommend over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams or sprays.'  "
Medical treatment for heat rash,"'Heat rash resolves on its own once the skin cools, but on occasion, the sweat glands can become infected. The signs of infection include ''pain'', increased swelling, and redness that does not resolve. Pustules may form at the site of the rash. This infection occurs because bacteria have invaded the blocked sweat gland. Antibiotic treatment may be required. Chronic and recurrent heat rash may need to be treated by a health care professional or dermatologist (skin specialist).' "
How can heat rash be prevented?,"'Prevention'' is the most important treatment for heat rash. By allowing the skin to be exposed to circulating air, the potential for sweat ducts to become blocked and the glands to become inflamed decreases.''Other strategies to prevent heat rash include:' Avoid exercising in hot, humid weather Wear loose clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton Use air conditioning Keep the skin clean with frequent baths or showers to prevent sweat glands from becoming clogged Reduce the amount of overlapping skin-on-skin (fat or weight loss)"
How effective are electric fans in preventing heat rash?,"'Keeping the skin cool on hot days is an important preventive measure. Air circulation (with fans or by other methods) usually will help with skin cooling. It is important not to bundle newborns and infants too tightly so that air can get to the skin, but it also is important to keep them warm enough.''It is important to move individuals who are immobile (for example, some elderly, those with ''paralysis'', or are weak) so all parts of the body can be exposed to fresh air.' "
How can people protect their health when temperatures are extremely high?,"'The body can adapt very well in hot weather, but it takes time to acclimate. The actual temperature is just one factor when a person decides to work, play, or exercise in the heat. The ''heat index ''adds humidity to the equation since sweat cannot evaporate if the water content in the air (humidity) is high. If the air holds as much water as it can there is no place for sweat to go, and evaporation cannot cool the body.''To minimize the risk of heat-related illnesses, try to avoid working or exercising in extreme heat. Avoid ''dehydration'' and other complications by taking frequent breaks to get out of the heat, and drinking plenty of water or other fluids to replenish fluid lost through sweat.''Early signs of heat-related illnesses include ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', and ''nausea''. It is important to get out of the heat, cool off, and rehydrate immediately to avoid severe heat-related problems such as heat exhaustion and heat ''stroke''.'""To calculate the heat index in your area,\xa0 go to the U.S. Army's Heat Index Calculator online."" "
How much water should I drink in hot weather?,"'It is hard to gauge how much water is lost through sweat, and the ''thirst'' mechanism may not be sensitive enough to remind a person to drink enough. In general, the kidneys are a good guide to whether there is enough water in the body. If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will try to hold on to as much water as possible. Decreased urine production, urine concentrated in color, and a strong ''urine odor'"" are signs that the kidneys are trying to conserve the body's water supply. Urine is clear when there is enough fluid in the body.""'In a hot environment, a person should drink enough water to make the urine clear, and make sure the body is producing sweat. Sweat and urine loss also involves ''electrolyte'' loss. Although drinking water is good, other fluids such as sports ''drinks'' should also be consumed to replace lost ''electrolytes'' to avoid other problems like ''hypokalemia'' (''low potassium''). People that are taking medications for conditions such as ''diabetes'', kidney problems, and ''congestive heart failure'' (''CHF'') need to be especially careful about their fluid intake, and discuss how to avoid hot-weather related problems with their doctor(s).' "
Should I take salt tablets during hot weather?,"'Taking salt tablets is not a good idea. While the body loses many electrolytes when it sweats, there are mechanisms in place to compensate for the loss. Usually, keeping the body hydrated with plain water is adequate but does not resupply electrolytes. Sports drinks (for example, PowerAde, Gatorade) may be reasonable alternatives if prolonged exercise or work is required in hot conditions.' "
What is the best clothing for hot weather or a heat wave?,"""Evaporation works to cool the skin only if the sweat that the body produces is allowed to evaporate. Lightweight, loose clothing allows air circulation to the body's surface and helps promote cooling. While cotton is the classic fabric that can be used, some synthetic fabrics have been developed to wick sweat from the skin, which allows the skin to be more efficient at skin or body cooling."" "
What is the prognosis for heat rash?,"'Heat rash or prickly heat tends to be selflimiting, and gets better once the skin cools and is allowed to breathe. Prevention by not allowing heat to accumulate in body areas, followed by cooling the skin are the most common ways to obtain the best prognosis for heat rash.' "
What is a heat-related illness?,"'A heat-related illness is a medical condition that may occur as a result of heat exposure. Even short periods of high temperatures can cause serious health problems. Heat-related illness encompasses a spectrum of conditions that range from minor illnesses to life-threatening medical emergencies. There are several heat-related illnesses, including heat ''stroke'', heat exhaustion, heat ''cramps'', heat syncope (fainting), and ''heat rash''.''Summer can bring heat waves with unusually high temperatures that can last for days and sometimes weeks.' 

Read Doctor's View
   According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 7,415 death due to heat-related illness in the United States from 1999 to 2010, or an average of approximately 618 death per year. Heat waves lead to more deaths annually in the United States than tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes combined. In the summer of 1980, a severe heat wave hit the United States, and approximately 1,700 people lost their lives from heat-related illness; and in the summer of 2003, tens of thousands of people died in Europe from an extreme heat wave. The summer of 2012 heat wave in the United States led to many heat-related deaths, and numerous all-time high temperature records were broken throughout the United States. Most recently, a summer heat wave in Pakistan in 2015 led to more than 1,000 fatalities. High temperatures put people at risk."
What causes a heat-related illness?,"""People suffer heat-related illness when the body's normal temperature control system is unable to effectively regulate its internal temperature. Normally, at high temperatures the body primarily cools itself through the evaporation of sweat. However, under certain conditions (air temperatures above 95 F/35 C high humidity), this cooling mechanism becomes less effective. When the humidity is high, sweat will not evaporate as quickly, preventing the body from releasing heat quickly. Furthermore, without adequate fluid intake, excessive fluid losses and ""'electrolyte'' imbalances may also occur leading to ''dehydration'"". In such cases, a person's body temperature rises rapidly. Very high body temperatures can damage the brain and other vital organs.""'Other conditions that can limit the ability to regulate body temperature include old age, ''obesity'', ''fever'', ''dehydration'', ''heart disease'', poor circulation, ''sunburn'', and drug or ''alcohol'' use.'  "
Who is at risk of heat-related illness?,"'Those at greatest risk of heat-related illness include:''Infants and children up to four years of age are very sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and rely on others to regulate their environment and to provide adequate fluid intake. Moreover, they have a higher metabolic rate and inefficient ''sweating'' compared to adults.''People 65 years of age or older may not compensate for heat ''stress'' efficiently, and are less likely to sense and respond to changes in temperature. The elderly population also is at a higher risk because they usually have other pre-existing medical conditions, and they often take medications that can make them more vulnerable to dehydration (for example, diuretics).''Overweight individuals may be prone to heat-related illness because of their tendency to retain more body heat.'""Any health condition that causes dehydration makes the body more susceptible to heat-related illness. If you or someone you know is at higher risk, it is important to drink plenty of fluids, avoid overexertion, and get your doctor or pharmacist's advice about medications being taken for:"" infants and children up to four years of age, people 65 years of age or older, people who are overweight, people who overexert during outdoor work or exercise, people with mental illness, and people who are chronically ill or on certain medications. High blood pressure Mental illness Poor circulation"
What are the symptoms of heat-related illness?,"'Signs and symptoms of heat-related illness vary based on the severity of the illness.'  Heat rash symptoms: red bumps on the skin, a feeling of prickly or itchy skin. Heat syncope (fainting) symptoms: dizziness or lightheadedness and fainting, generally due to prolonged exposure to heat, dehydration, or orthostatic hypotension. Heat cramps symptoms: significant sweating, involuntary spasms of the muscles in the body, most often affecting the legs. Heat exhaustion symptoms: nausea and vomiting, headache, muscle cramps, weakness, and profuse sweating. Heat stroke symptoms: dizziness, muscle cramps and aches, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, headache, weakness, confusion and coma. Heat stroke is a medical emergency."
Heat stroke,"'Heat ''stroke'"" is a medical emergency requiring immediate medical attention. It is the most severe form of heat-related illness, and it can sometimes lead to death or permanent disability. Heat stroke occurs when the body's ability to regulate its internal temperature has failed. The body's temperature rises rapidly in excess of 104 F (40. C), leading to damage to the brain and other vital organs. Generally, the extent of injury depends on the duration of exposure to excessive heat and the peak temperature attained. Heat stroke is sometimes referred to as sunstroke.""'Heat stroke can be categorized as either ''exertional heat stroke (EHS)'' or ''nonexertional heat stroke (NEHS)''. Exertional heat stroke generally occurs in young, healthy individuals who engage in strenuous activity in hot weather. Nonexertional heat stroke (also referred to as classic heat stroke) typically occurs in the elderly, the very young, or the chronically ill.''Warning signs of heat stroke vary but may include:''If you see any of these signs, you may be dealing with a life-threatening emergency. ''Have someone call for immediate medical assistance while you begin cooling the affected individual: '""If the affected individual's muscles begin to twitch uncontrollably (""'seizure'') as a result of heat stroke; keep the individual from injuring themselves, and do not place any object in the mouth and do not give fluids. If there is vomiting, make sure the ''airway'' remains clear by turning the person on their side to prevent choking.' high body temperature (above 104 F or 40 C), skin that is red, hot, and either moist or dry (sweating may have stopped), rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, headache, dizziness, loss of coordination, nausea and vomiting, confusion and restlessness, seizures, and unconsciousness/coma. Get the person to a cool indoor or outdoor area and remove restrictive clothing. Cool the person rapidly using whatever methods you can. For example, if possible, immerse the person in a tub of cool water or place them in a cool shower. You may also spray them with lukewarm water and blow cool air from a fan towards them. If the humidity is low, loosely wrap the person's body in a cool, wet sheet and fan him or her vigorously. Alternatively, place ice or cold packs to the armpits, neck, and groin areas. Monitor body temperature, and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to about 102 F or lower (38.8 C), in order to prevent overcooling the affected individual. If emergency medical personnel are delayed, call the hospital emergency room for further instructions. If the affected individual is awake and alert, give them cool fluids to drink. Do not give them alcohol to drink."
Heat cramps,"""Heat cramps usually affect people who sweat significantly during strenuous activity. This sweating depletes the body's salt and moisture. The low salt level in the muscles causes painful muscle cramps, often following ""'exercise''. Heat cramps may also be a symptom of heat exhaustion.''What are the signs and symptoms of heat cramps? ''Heat cramps are muscle pains or ''muscle spasms'' (usually in the abdomen, arms, or legs) that may occur in association with strenuous activity. If the affected person has heart problems or are on a low sodium ''diet'', seek medical attention for heat cramps.' Stop all activity, and sit and rest in a cool place. Drink water or a sports beverage, and eat a salty snack. Passively stretch the affected muscles. Do not return to strenuous activity for a few hours after the cramps have subsided as further exertion can lead to heat exhaustion or rarely, heat stroke. Seek medical attention for heat cramps if they do not subside in 1 hour."
Heat exhaustion,"""Heat exhaustion is the body's response to an excessive ""'loss of water'' and salt contained in sweat as a result of engaging in physical activity (work or exercising) in a hot environment. The body temperature may be normal or mildly elevated, but not above 104 F (40 C). It often occurs in individuals who are not accustomed to working or exercising in the heat. The symptoms may range from minor complaints to more pronounced symptoms, however the affected individual will not experience the central nervous system manifestations noted with heat stroke. Many cases of heat exhaustion can be treated outside of the hospital setting however it is important to understand that heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke if not properly addressed in a timely fashion.''Warning signs of heat exhaustion include:'""The skin may be cool and moist. The affected individual's pulse rate may be fast, and breathing may be fast and shallow. If heat exhaustion is untreated and heat exposure continues, it may sometimes progress to heat stroke.""'Cooling measures that may be effective include:''Seek medical attention immediately if: ''Otherwise, help the person cool off, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or last longer than one hour.'  a normal or mildly elevated body temperature, heavy sweating, pallor (paleness), muscle cramps and muscle pain, fatigue, weakness, dizziness and lightheadedness, headache, and nausea. drink cool, non-alcoholic beverages, such as water and sports drinks, eat salty snacks, rest in the shade or in an air-conditioned environment, take a cool shower or bath, and loosen or remove restrictive clothing. the symptoms are severe or worsening, or the affected individual has serious underlying health problems (for example, heart disease or diabetes)."
Heat syncope (fainting),"'Heat syncope is a fainting episode that occurs in the heat, either during prolonged standing or exercise, or when rapidly standing from a lying or sitting position. It typically occurs in individuals who are not acclimatized to the heat. Dehydration can also contribute to this condition.' dizziness or lightheadedness, and fainting. Sit and rest in a cool place. The affected individual may also lie down and elevate the legs above the level of the heart. Drink water or a sports beverage. Seek immediate medical attention for repeated episodes of fainting, or if the individual experiences chest pain, seizures, or confusion."
Heat rash,"'Heat ''rash'' is a skin irritation that occurs in hot, humid weather. It is caused by profuse sweating, which can lead to the blockage of sweat ducts. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children.''Heat rash appears as a cluster of small red ''pimples'' or ''blisters''. This skin irritation can be ''itchy''. It typically occurs on the neck and upper chest, in the groin, under the breasts, and in the elbow creases.''The best treatment for heat rash is to avoid a hot, humid environment and to try to remain in cooler, less humid conditions. Try to keep the affected area dry, and wear light, loose clothing. Dusting powder may be used to increase comfort, but avoid using ointments or creams because they keep the skin warm and moist and may make the condition worse.''Treating heat rash is simple and usually does not require medical assistance.' "
Heat-related illness prevention,"'To protect your health when temperatures are extremely high, remember to keep cool and use common sense. The following tips are important.''Increase your fluid intake regardless of your activity level. Do not wait until you feel thirsty. During heavy exercise in a hot environment, drink 2-4 glasses (16-32 ounces) of cool fluids each hour.''Caution:'' If your doctor has prescribed a fluid-restricted ''diet'' or diuretics for you, ask your doctor how much you should drink.''Heavy sweating removes salt and ''minerals'' from the body. These are necessary for your body and must be replaced. The easiest and safest way to replace salt and minerals is through your diet.''These self-help measures are not a substitute for medical care but may help you recognize and respond promptly to warning signs of trouble. Your best defense against heat-related illness is prevention. Staying cool and making simple changes in your fluid intake, activities, and clothing during hot weather can help you remain safe and healthy.' During hot weather, you will need to drink more liquid than your thirst indicates. This is especially true for people 65 years of age and older who often have a decreased ability to respond to external temperature changes. Drinking plenty of liquids during exercise is especially important. However, avoid very cold beverages because they can cause stomach cramps. In addition, avoid drinks containing alcohol or caffeine, because they will actually cause you to lose more fluid. Drink a sports beverage during exercise or work in the heat. Do not take salt tablets unless directed by your doctor. If you are on a low-salt diet, ask your doctor before changing what you eat or drink, especially before drinking sports beverages. Wear as little clothing as possible when you are at home. Choose lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing. In the hot sun, a wide-brimmed hat will provide shade and keep the head cool. Sunburn affects the body's ability to cool itself and causes a loss of body fluids. It also causes pain and damages the skin. A variety of sunscreens are available to reduce the risk of sunburn. The protection that they offer against sunburn varies. Check the sun protection factor (SPF) number on the label of the sunscreen container. Select SPF 15 or higher to protect yourself adequately. Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before going outdoors and reapply according to package directions. If you are unaccustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment, start slowly and pick up the pace gradually. If exertion in the heat makes your heart pound and leaves you gasping for breath, STOP all activity. You should get into a cool area or in the shade, and rest, especially if you become lightheaded, weak, or faint. The most efficient way to beat the heat is to stay in a cool or air-conditioned area. If you do not have an air conditioner or evaporative cooling unit, consider a visit to a shopping mall, see a movie in a movie theater, or visit a public library for a few hours. Contact your local health department to see if there are any heat-relief shelters in your area. Electric fans may be useful to increase comfort and to draw cool air into your home at night, but do not rely on a fan as your primary cooling device during a heat wave. When the temperature is in the 90s or higher, a fan will not prevent heat-related illness. A cool shower or bath is a more effective way to cool off. Also, use your stove and oven less to maintain a cooler temperature in your home. If you must be out in the heat, try to plan your activities so that you are outdoors either before noon or in the evening. While outdoors, rest frequently in a shady area. Resting periodically will give your body's thermostat a chance to recover. When working in the heat, monitor the condition of your coworkers and have someone do the same for you. Heat-related illness can cause a person to become confused or lose consciousness. During a heat wave, have a friend or relative call to check in on you twice a day if you are 65 years of age or older. If you know anyone in this age group, check on them at least twice a day. Be aware that any sudden change in temperature, such as an early summer heat wave, will be stressful to your body. You will have a greater tolerance for the heat if you limit your physical activity until you become accustomed to the heat. If traveling to a hotter climate, allow several days to become acclimated before attempting any vigorous exercise, and work up to it gradually. Avoid hot foods and heavy meals as they may add heat to your body. Do not ever leave infants, children, or pets in a parked car. Dress infants and young children in cool, loose clothing and shade their heads and faces with hats or an umbrella. Make sure they use sunscreen when outdoors. Limit sun exposure during the mid-day hours and in places of potential heavy sun exposure, such as beaches. Ensure that infants and children drink adequate amounts of liquids. Make sure to keep your pet cool by giving them plenty of fresh water, and leave the water in a shady area."
What is heat exhaustion?,"'The body cools itself most efficiently by sweating and having that sweat evaporate. Should sweating be unable to meet the cooling demands of the body, ''heat-related illness'' can occur. This is a spectrum of conditions with minor symptoms such as ''prickly heat'' or ''heat rash'', progressing to heat ''cramps'', then heat exhaustion, and finally to heat ''stroke'', a life-threatening medical condition.''The line between each diagnosis is not sharply drawn. Heat cramps describe involuntary spasm of the large muscles of the body, while heat exhaustion has more systemic complaints such as the signs and symptoms listed above.''The affected individual may be a low-grade ''fever'"". Heat stroke is a life-threatening situation where the body's cooling system fails. The body temperature spirals out of control usually greater than 106F (41 C), sweating stops, and there are ""'mental status changes'' like ''confusion'', ''seizure'', or ''coma''.'""Heat exhaustion occurs when a person exercises or works in a hot environment and sweating cannot dissipate the heat generated within the body. Often dehydration occurs because the person hasn't replaced the water lost by sweating. Heat exhaustion also may occur if a person lives in a hot environment without adequate air circulation and does not drink an adequate amount of water."" "
What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?,"'There is no set line that distinguishes heat exhaustion from heat stroke. If a person is suffering from a heat-related illness such as heat exhaustion, and changes in mental status occur, he or she should be considered to be suffering from heat stroke. This includes confusion, lethargy, seizure, or ''coma''. This is a medical emergency, and if treatment is delayed mortality can be greater than 50%. While victims of heat exhaustion sweat profusely, people suffering from heat stroke stop sweating and have ''dry skin''. This is a warning sign of impending heat stroke.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion?,"'Individuals with heat exhaustion tend to have symptoms such as''As dehydration increases from the loss of body water, lightheadedness may occur and ''fainting'' (''syncope'') may occur, especially if the affected individual stands up quickly (due to ''orthostatic hypotension'').The person also may have a low-grade ''fever''.'   profuse sweating, weakness, muscle cramps, headache, and nausea and vomiting."
What causes heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion occurs when a person exercises and works in a hot environment and the body cannot cool itself adequately. Dehydration occurs with water loss from ''excessive sweating'"", which causes muscle cramps, weakness, and nausea and vomiting. The nausea and vomiting makes it difficult to drink enough fluid to replenish the body's water supply, and the lack of body water impairs further sweating, evaporation and cooling.""'Relative humidity is an important factor in developing heat exhaustion. If the humidity is too high, sweat on the skin cannot evaporate into the surrounding air and body temperature cooling fails.''Living in a hot environment may predispose a person to heat exhaustion. During a heat wave, the elderly, the poor, and those who live an isolated life may not have access to air conditioning and are at risk of heat-related illnesses.'  "
Who is at risk for heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion usually affects people who are working or exercising in a hot environment, and those who do not have access to adequate water. Those at risk for heat exhaustion include:''The body has the ability to acclimate to hot weather but if heat waves come suddenly, or if a person travels from a cooler environment to a hot environment, the risk of heat exhaustion increases. It takes about 7 to 10 days for the body to adapt to hot weather. A non-acclimated person can produce a liter or almost a quart of sweat in an hour to assist in cooling the body. A person who is acclimated to the heat can produce 2 or 3 liters of sweat per hour, doubling or tripling the cooling potential for the body.''This water lost in sweat needs to be replaced for the sweating/cooling mechanism to work. A liter of sweat weighs 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds.' Infants and young children are at risk because their temperature regulation mechanisms are not fully developed. They also are dependent upon others for water and appropriate clothing. The elderly are similarly at risk because of underlying medical conditions that limit the ability to sweat including poor circulation, skin changes, and chronic medication usage. Socioeconomic issues increase the risk of heat exhaustion if access to air conditioning is limited. During heat waves, large cities often open cooling centers to help minimize the risk of large numbers of people succumbing to heat-related illness. Certain medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and tranquilizers may impair the ability of the body to sweat. Alcohol consumption The overweight or obese"
When should an individual seek medical care for heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion usually can be treated at home as long as the affected individual can replace the lost fluid, keep well hydrated, and find a cool place to rest. Water, ''electrolyte'' replacement solutions, or sport ''drinks'' are appropriate to consume. If nausea and vomiting prevent rehydration, the individual should seek medical attention, and may need IV fluids for rehydration.''Muscles cramps can be severe and if stretching and rehydration cannot relieve recurrent cramps, medical care may be necessary.''It is important to recognize that if the person stops sweating, becomes confused, or has a seizure, ''heat stroke'', a life-threatening condition, may be developing. Emergency medical services should be activated immediately (call 911 if available). The affected individual should be moved to a cooler place, have their clothing removed, and attempts should be made to cool the body with ''cold'' compresses, spraying or sponging the body with cool water and promoting air circulation with oscillating fans.' "
Which type of doctors treat heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion is often treated by emergency physicians and health care providers working in urgent care clinics.''Since heat exhaustion also routinely occurs during athletic activities including practices, certified athletic trainers and team physicians are able to care for these patients.' "
How is heat exhaustion diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis of heat exhaustion is made by circumstantial evidence:''Laboratory tests are not routinely performed unless the health care professional is concerned about electrolyte imbalance or significant dehydration and ''kidney failure''.''However, it is important for the health care professional to consider other diagnoses, since there are many infectious illnesses that accompany a fever, weakness, nausea and vomiting. This is especially the case in the elderly and very young. In these groups, heat exhaustion may be a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other more serious illnesses should be considered before settling on heat as the cause of the problem. History and physical examination may be all that is needed.' History (exercising or working in a hot environment, living in a hot apartment with no air-conditioning) Symptoms (excess sweating, headache, weakness, nausea and vomiting) Physical examination (signs of dehydration)"
What is the first aid treatment for heat exhaustion?,"   Cooling and rehydration are the cornerstones for treating heat exhaustion. The affected individual should stop their activity, and then move or be moved from the hot environment to a cooler environment. The person may be placed in the shade or taken to an air-conditioned environment (don't forget that cars have air conditioning). Clothes may be removed to help with air circulation across the body. Misting the skin with cool water also helps by stimulating evaporation and cooling the body. Rehydration is the next important step in treating heat exhaustion. This may be a challenge if the person begins to suffer from nausea and vomiting. Small sips of water, a mouthful at a time, might be tolerated even if some vomiting persists. Water, sports drink and other electrolyte replacement drinks are reasonable options. If oral rehydration fails or if symptoms persist, intravenous fluids may be required to replace the water loss because of the excessive sweating. Hydration continues until the patient begins to urinate, a signal that the kidneys have sensed that there is enough fluid in the body, and it no longer retains fluid. Muscles cramps and pain may be treated with over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, etc.) and acetaminophen (Tylenol and others)."
What are the complications of heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion is one part of the spectrum of heat-related illness, and symptoms should be reversible with treatment. However, some affected individuals do not recognize their symptoms and if they are not removed from the hot environment, cooled, and rehydrated, the heat-related illness can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition.''Individuals who have suffered from heat exhaustion are more prone to experience another episode and should be cautious when working or exercising in hot conditions.'  "
How can heat exhaustion be prevented?,"""Understanding one's environment is perhaps the most important step in preventing heat-related illness. If possible, strenuous activities should not be performed in excessively hot or humid environments. However, people often have to work in the heat of the day, or indoors in hot situations and need to make the effort to protect their bodies. These can include frequent breaks taken in a cooler areas, adequate fluid intake, and slowing the pace of work to decrease heat generated by the body.""'A person at risk for heat exhaustion should watch their urine output to monitor their hydration status .If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will hold onto water, and make concentrated, strong smelling urine. If enough water is present, the urine will turn clear.''Acclimating to conditions allows the body to perform in situations that would otherwise be difficult. The body will make physiologic changes allowing it to cool more efficiently, if it has gradual exposure to hot conditions. Moving from a cool to very hot environment quickly increases the risk of developing heat related-illness symptoms.'""It is important to look after family and loved ones during heat waves. When the temperature rises, the elderly or those less fortunate may not have air conditioning or the ability to cool their homes. Cities often set up cooling centers when the heat index rises, and there is an increased risk of heat-related illness. In 1995, Chicago experienced a record heat wave that killed hundreds of people. Most were elderly and the poor who had no air conditioning or could not afford to use it. Some wouldn't open their windows for fear of crime. In 2015, heat waves were responsible for more than 5,000 deaths in India and Pakistan."" "
What is the prognosis for heat exhaustion?,"'Most individuals recover well from heat exhaustion. The key to recovery is recognizing symptoms before they progress to heat stroke. The earlier the activity is stopped, the individual is cooled and hydration begins, the greater the likelihood that complications will not occur.' "
What is heat stroke? Who is at risk?,"'Heat stroke is a form of hyperthermia or ''heat-related illness'', an abnormally elevated body temperature with accompanying physical symptoms including changes in the nervous system function. Unlike ''heat cramps'' and ''heat exhaustion'', two other forms of hyperthermia that are less severe, ''heat stroke is a true medical emergency that is often fatal if not properly and promptly treated. '' Heat stroke is also sometimes referred to as heatstroke or sun stroke. Severe hyperthermia is defined as a body temperature of 104 F (40 C) or higher.''The body normally generates heat as a result of metabolism, and is usually able to dissipate the heat by ''radiation'' of heat through the skin or by evaporation of sweat. However, in extreme heat, high humidity, or vigorous physical exertion under the sun, the body may not be able to sufficiently dissipate the heat and the body temperature rises, sometimes up to 106 F (41.1 C) or higher. Another cause of heat stroke is ''dehydration''. A dehydrated person may not be able to sweat fast enough to dissipate heat, which causes the body temperature to rise.''Heat stroke is not the same as a stroke. ""Stroke"" is the general term used to describe decreased oxygen flow to an area of the brain.''Those most susceptible (at risk) individuals to heat stroke include:''Heat stroke is sometimes classified as exertional heat stroke (EHS, which is due to overexertion in hot weather) or non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS, which occurs in climactic extremes and affects the elderly, infants, and chronically ill.'   Infants The elderly (often with associated heart diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, or who are taking medications that make them vulnerable to dehydration and heat strokes) Athletes Individuals who work outside and physically exert themselves under the sun Infants, children, or pets left in cars."
What are heat stroke symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of heat stroke can sometimes mimic those of ''heart attack'' or other conditions. Sometimes a person experiences symptoms of heat exhaustion before progressing to heat strokes.''Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion include''However, some individuals can develop symptoms of heat stroke suddenly and rapidly without warning.''Different people may have different symptoms and signs of heat stroke. ''Common symptoms and signs of heat stroke include;'   nausea, vomiting, fatigue, weakness, headache, muscle cramps and aches, and dizziness. high body temperature, the absence of sweating, with hot red or flushed dry skin, rapid pulse, difficulty breathing, strange behavior, hallucinations, confusion, agitation, disorientation, seizure, and/or coma."
"Can infants, children, and teens suffer from heat stroke?","'While the elderly are at greatest risk for heat stroke, infants and children are also at risk. In particular, infants or young children who are unattended in locked a car may suffer heat-related illness quickly, since the indoor temperature of a locked car can rise to dangerous levels even in moderate weather. Rarely, infants have died of heat stroke when overly bundled in their cribs. It is critically important that parents understand the medical dangers inherent in leaving children unattended in cars in addition to the obvious safety risks. Further, cars should always be kept locked when not in use so that children may not enter them and become trapped.''Among older children and ''teens'', heat stroke or heat-related illness is a risk for athletes who train in hot environmental conditions. Among reported heat-related illnesses in U.S. high school athletes, the majority of cases occur in football players during the month of August.' "
4 First aid treatments for heat stroke,"'Victims of heat stroke must receive immediate treatment to avoid permanent organ damage.'' ''First and foremost, cool the victim. '   Get the victim to a shady area, remove clothing, apply cool or tepid water to the skin (for example, you may spray the person with cool water from a garden hose), fan the victim to promote sweating and evaporation, and place ice packs under the armpits and groin. If the person is able to drink liquids, have them drink cool water or other cool beverages that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Monitor body temperature with a thermometer and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to 101 to 102 F (38.3 to 38.8 C). Always notify emergency services (911) immediately. If their arrival is delayed, they can give you further instructions for treatment of the victim."
How can you prevent heat stroke?,"   The most important measures to prevent heat strokes are to avoid becoming dehydrated and to avoid vigorous physical activities in hot and humid weather. If you have to perform physical activities in hot weather, drink plenty of fluids (such as water and sports drinks), but avoid alcohol, and caffeine (including soft drinks and tea), which may lead to dehydration. Your body will need replenishment of electrolytes (such as sodium) as well as fluids if you sweat excessively or perform vigorous activity in the sunlight for prolonged periods. Take frequent breaks to hydrate yourself. Wear hats and light-colored, lightweight, loose clothes. Keep cars locked when not in use and never, ever, leave infants, children or pets unattended in a locked car."
What is hepatitis?,"""The term 'hepatitis' simply means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis may be caused by a variety of viruses or other infections, medications, or a toxin such as ""'alcohol''. Hepatitis viruses that can cause injury to liver cells in addition to hepatitis B include the ''hepatitis A'' and ''hepatitis C'' viruses. These viruses are not related to each other or to the hepatitis B virus, and they differ in their structure, the ways they are spread among individuals, the severity of symptoms they can cause, the way they are treated, and the outcome of the infection. Other hepatitis viruses (hepatitis D, ''hepatitis E'', and ''hepatitis G'') cause disease much less commonly.''Other viruses that infect the liver but which are not specifically ""hepatitis viruses"" include ''Epstein-Barr virus'' (''EBV'', the virus that causes ''mononucleosis'') and ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'').''Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).''In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in 887,000 deaths, mostly from complications (including cirrhosis and hepatocellular ''carcinoma'').''It is estimated that 257 million people are living with hepatitis B virus infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-positive). According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 19,000 new cases of hepatitis B occurred in the United States in 2016.''After a marked decline in acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections reported to CDC since the 1990s, due to the widespread introduction of hepatitis B vaccination, there has been no consistent trend in acute HBV cases since 2012; that is, reported cases have been fluctuating around 3,000 cases each year. In 2016, there were 3,218 cases reported to the CDC. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, the estimated number of new HBV infections in 2016 was 20,900.'""When a person first gets hepatitis B, they are said to have an 'acute' infection. Most people are able to eliminate the virus and are cured of the infection. Some are not able to clear the virus and have a 'chronic' infection with hepatitis B that is usually life-long (see below). In the United States, an estimated 2.2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B.""'Hepatitis B is found throughout the world. Some countries have much higher rates of infection than the United States; for example, in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10% to 30% of adults are chronically infected with hepatitis B.''The hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is made up of deoxyribonucleic acids. It belongs to a family of viruses known as ''Hepadnaviridae''. The virus is primarily found in the liver but is also present in the blood and certain body fluids.''Hepatitis B virus consists of a core particle (central portion) and a surrounding envelope (outer coat). The core is made up of DNA and the core antigen (HBcAg). The envelope contains the surface antigen (HBsAg). These antigens are present in the blood and are markers that are used in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with suspected ''viral hepatitis''.''The hepatitis B virus reproduces in liver cells, but the virus itself is not the direct cause of damage to the liver. Rather, the presence of the virus triggers an immune response from the body as the body tries to eliminate the virus and recover from the infection. This immune response causes inflammation and may seriously injure liver cells. Therefore, there is a balance between the protective and destructive effects of the immune response to the hepatitis B virus.'  "
What are the symptoms of acute hepatitis B?,"'Acute hepatitis B is the period of illness that occurs during the first one to four months after acquiring the virus.Most healthy adults do not develop significant symptoms during acute infection. Early symptoms may be non-specific, including ''fever'', a ''flu-like'' illness, and ''joint pains''. Symptoms of acute hepatitis may include:''Rarely, acute hepatitis damages the liver so badly it can no longer function. This life-threatening condition is called ""fulminant hepatitis."" Patients with fulminant hepatitis are at risk of developing bleeding problems and ''coma'' resulting from the failure of the liver. Patients with fulminant hepatitis should be evaluated for liver transplantation.\xa0'""The body's immune response is the major determinant of the outcome in acute hepatitis B. Individuals who develop a strong immune response to the infection are more likely to clear the virus and recover. However, these patients also are more likely to develop more severe liver injury and symptoms due to the strong immune response that is trying to eliminate the virus. On the other hand, a weaker immune response results in less liver injury and fewer symptoms but a higher risk of developing chronic hepatitis B. People who recover and eliminate the virus will develop life-long immunity, that is, protection from subsequent infection from hepatitis B.""'Most infants and children who acquire acute hepatitis B viral infection have no symptoms. In these individuals, the immune system fails to mount a vigorous response to the virus. Consequently, the risk of an infected infant developing chronic hepatitis B is approximately 90%. In contrast, only 30% to 50% of people older than 5 years who have acute hepatitis B develop chronic hepatitis B.' fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and pain in the upper right abdomen (due to the inflamed liver)."
What are the symptoms of chronic hepatitis B?,"'The liver is a vital organ that has many functions. These include a role in the immune system, production of clotting factors, producing bile for ''digestion'';\xa0storing nutrients including sugars, ''fats'' and ''minerals'' for use by the body later; processing medications; and breaking down toxic substances. Patients with chronic hepatitis B develop symptoms in proportion to the degree of abnormalities in these functions. The signs and symptoms of chronic hepatitis B vary widely depending on the severity of the liver damage. They range from few and relatively mild signs and symptoms to signs and symptoms of severe ''liver disease''\xa0(cirrhosis or liver failure).'""Most individuals with chronic hepatitis B remain symptom free for many years or decades. During this time, the patient's ""'liver function'' blood tests usually are normal or only mildly abnormal. Some patients may deteriorate and develop inflammation or symptoms, putting them at risk for developing cirrhosis.''Inflammation from chronic hepatitis B can progress to cirrhosis (severe scarring) of the liver. Significant amounts of scarring and cirrhosis lead to liver dysfunction.''Symptoms may include:''Decreased absorption of ''vitamins'' A and D can cause impaired vision at night and thinning of bones (''osteoporosis''). Patients with liver cirrhosis also are at risk of infections because the liver plays an important role in the immune system.''In patients with advanced cirrhosis, the liver begins to fail. This is life-threatening condition.''Several complications occur in advanced cirrhosis:''Patients with chronic hepatitis B are at risk of developing ''liver cancer''. The way in which the ''cancer'' develops is not fully understood. ''Symptoms of liver cancer'' are nonspecific. Patients may have no symptoms, or they may experience ''abdominal pain'' and swelling, an ''enlarged liver'', ''weight loss'', and ''fever''. The most useful diagnostic screening tests for liver ''cancer'' are a blood test for a protein produced by the ''cancer'' called alpha-fetoprotein and an ''ultrasound'' imaging study of the liver. These two tests are used to screen patients with chronic hepatitis B, especially if they have cirrhosis or a family history of liver cancer.''Rarely, chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to disorders that affect organs other than the liver. These conditions are caused when the normal immune response to hepatitis B mistakenly attacks uninfected organs.''Among these conditions are:' weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, breast enlargement in men, a rash on the palms, difficulty with blood clotting, and spider-like blood vessels on the skin. Confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) results from the inability of the liver to detoxify certain toxic substances. Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) causes fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and may result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and may cause massive bleeding. Portal hypertension can also cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia, increased risk of infection and bleeding. In advanced cirrhosis, liver failure also results in decreased production of clotting factors. This causes abnormalities in blood clotting and sometimes spontaneous bleeding. Patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound, called bilirubin. Polyarteritis nodosa: a disease characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels throughout the body. This condition can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, nerve damage, deep skin ulcers, kidney problems, high blood pressure, unexplained fevers, and abdominal pain. Glomerulonephritis: another rare condition, which is inflammation of the small filtering units of the kidney."
How is the hepatitis B virus spread (transmitted)?,"'Hepatitis B is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. In infected individuals, the virus can be found in the blood, semen, ''vaginal discharge'', ''breast milk'', and saliva. Hepatitis B is not spread through food, water, or by casual contact.''In the United States, sexual contact is the most common means of transmission, followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs, tattooing, body piercing, or ''acupuncture''. Additionally, hepatitis B can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood.''Hepatitis B also may be spread from infected mothers to their ''babies'"" at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). This is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis B rates are high. The rate of transmission of hepatitis B from mother to ""'newborn'' is very high, and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis B. Fortunately, transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis (see below). ''Rarely, hepatitis B can be transmitted through transfused blood products, donated livers and other organs. However, blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.'  "
How is hepatitis B diagnosed?,"'Infection with hepatitis B is suspected when the medical history and the physical examination reveal risk factors for the infection or symptoms and signs that are suggestive of hepatitis B. Abnormalities in the ''liver tests'' (blood tests) also can raise suspicion; however, ''abnormal liver tests'"" can result from many conditions that affect the liver. The diagnosis of hepatitis B can be made only with specific hepatitis B virus blood tests. These tests are known as hepatitis 'markers' or 'serologies.'""'Markers found in the blood can confirm hepatitis B infection and differentiate acute from chronic infection. These markers are substances produced by the hepatitis B virus (antigens) and antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the virus. Hepatitis B virus has three antigens for which there are commonly-used tests - the surface antigen (HBsAg), the core antigen (HBcAg) and the e antigen (HBeAg).''The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood indicates that the patient is currently infected with the virus. HBsAg appears an average of four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. Individuals who recover from acute hepatitis B infections clear the blood of HBsAg within approximately four months after the onset of symptoms. These individuals develop antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Anti-HBs provides complete immunity to subsequent hepatitis B viral infection. Similarly, individuals who are successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B produce anti-HBs in the blood.''Patients who fail to clear the virus during an acute episode develop chronic hepatitis B. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is made when the HBsAg is present in the blood for at least six months. In chronic hepatitis B, HBsAg can be detected for many years, and anti-HBs does not appear.''In acute hepatitis, a specific class of early antibodies (IgM) appears that is directed against the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM). Later, another class of antibody, anti-HBc IgG, develops and persists for life, regardless of whether the individual recovers or develops chronic infection. Only anti-HBc IgM can be used to diagnose an acute hepatitis B infection.''Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is present when the hepatitis B virus is actively multiplying, whereas the production of the antibody, anti-HBe, (also called HBeAg seroconversion) signifies a more inactive state of the virus and a lower risk of transmission.''In some individuals infected with hepatitis B virus, the genetic material for the virus has undergone a structural change, called a pre-core mutation. This mutation results in an inability of the hepatitis B virus to produce HBeAg, even though the virus is actively reproducing. This means that even though no HBeAg is detected in the blood of people with the mutation, the hepatitis B virus is still active in these people and they can infect others.'""The best marker of hepatitis B virus reproduction is the level of hepatitis B virus DNA in the blood. Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in a blood sample signals that the virus is actively multiplying. In acute hepatitis, HBV DNA is present soon after infection, but is eliminated over time in patients' who clear the infection. In chronic hepatitis, levels of HBV DNA often continue to be elevated for many years and then decrease as the immune system controls the virus. HBV DNA levels are sometimes referred to as the 'viral load'.""'The following table gives the usual interpretation for sets of results from hepatitis B blood (serological) tests.'""*Interpretation of the hepatitis B virus blood tests should always be made by an experienced clinician with knowledge of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and results of the standard ""'liver blood tests''. Other conditions present in a patient can alter the way these test results are interpreted.'  "
What is the role of a liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis B?,"'During a ''liver biopsy'', a small sample of liver tissue is collected and examined under the microscope. This test is valuable because this sample reflects the health of the liver. It can show the amount of liver injury (inflammation or cirrhosis). Liver biopsy is not routinely needed to diagnose hepatitis B, but it is used for monitoring the progression of liver damage in people with chronic hepatitis and helping to choose or evaluate treatment options.' "
What is the natural course of chronic hepatitis B?,"""The course of chronic hepatitis B is variable and depends on several factors. These factors are the patient's age at which the infection began, the extent of viral multiplication, and the immune system's ability to control the infection.""'The infection can progress from an: ''For individuals infected at birth or at a young age, the immune system initially does not react to the hepatitis B virus. This phase of the infection is known as the immune tolerant phase. Despite high levels of virus in the body, there may be little evidence of inflammation and no symptoms. This phase typically lasts for years, even up to two or three decades. It is important to know that the immune tolerant phase is generally not seen in individuals who become infected during adulthood.''During the third to fourth decade of chronic hepatitis B acquired in childhood, the immune system may start to react to the virus. This is known as the immune clearance phase. In contrast, an infection acquired in adulthood usually begins with the immune clearance phase. In the immune clearance phase, the immune system attacks the hepatitis B virus-infected liver cells in an attempt to clear the virus. This causes inflammation, liver injury, and the development of ''scar tissue''. Standard liver blood tests are abnormal, and the liver biopsy shows inflammation and/or formation of ''scar'' tissue (fibrosis). The severity of liver cell destruction, the degree of fibrosis, and the duration of the immune clearance phase determine the outcome of chronic hepatitis B. The more severe the destruction and fibrosis and the longer the phase, the more likely it is that cirrhosis will develop.''Following the immune clearance phase, the viral infection may enter a less active phase known as the quiescent phase. During this phase, there are no symptoms, the levels of hepatitis B virus become very low, and the standard liver blood tests become normal or nearly normal. Advanced scaring or cirrhosis that may have developed earlier, however, remains. Occasionally, during the quiescent phase, the virus becomes active again. This is known as a ""flare,"" and often is associated with symptoms, abnormal liver blood tests, and further injury to the liver. The flares are caused by reactivation of the immune system against the virus. Flares can be very severe and result in further scarring of the liver. The disease in many of these individuals will progress to cirrhosis and eventually to advanced or end-stage cirrhosis with its associated complications, including liver cancer.''Infected individuals who experience a mild immune clearance phase and move into the quiescent phase are known as healthy carriers of hepatitis B virus. These individuals usually have normal liver tests and do not have symptoms; however, they can still transmit the hepatitis B viral infection to others. The risk of hepatitis B virus carriers developing cirrhosis and liver cell cancer is small although the risk is higher as compared to people without chronic hepatitis B.' immune tolerant phase (in which the immune system ignores the virus) immune clearance phase (in which the immune system attempts to eliminate the virus) quiescent phase (in which the virus is less active)"
What medications are used to treat hepatitis B?,"'Acute infection with hepatitis B usually does not require treatment. In rare cases, however, the infection may cause life-threatening liver failure. Patients with liver failure due to acute hepatitis B should be evaluated for liver transplantation.\xa0'""If a person is chronically infected with hepatitis B and has few signs or symptoms of complications, medications usually are not used. These patients are watched carefully and given periodic blood tests. One test measures the 'viral load,' that is, the amount of viral DNA in the blood. Doctors will recommend treatment if there are signs that the virus is beginning to cause damage or if the viral load is high. Another reason to prescribe medication is if the patient has a positive test for the Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) in the blood. HBeAg is associated with an increased risk of progression of ""'liver disease'' and its complications.''In chronic hepatitis B, the goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of complications including cirrhosis and liver failure. However, it takes decades for complications to occur, which makes it difficult to study the effect of medications. As a substitute for waiting years to find out what happens, scientists have used tests like the viral load or liver function tests to evaluate if medicines are working. This is logical because it is known that people who have large amounts of the virus in their blood are at highest risk to get cirrhosis. Up to one-third of people with very high viral loads (more than one million viral copies per milliliter of blood) will develop cirrhosis over a decade, compared to only 4.5% of those with low viral loads (fewer than 300 viral copies per milliliter).''Medications can reduce the number of viruses in the body and may be able to eliminate the virus from the bloodstream. Logically, this should lead to them having a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (<1% per year), although large, long-term studies have not been done. Even in people who clear the virus from their blood, low numbers of viruses still live in the liver and other cells. Thus, the medications do not cure the disease, but they can prevent or delay complications and symptoms. People who have a good response to treatment can still transmit the virus. Doctors follow blood tests that measure viral load and liver function and they may recommend liver biopsies to evaluate if the medications are working.''The medications in current use for chronic hepatitis B include the interferons and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. New agents are being developed although they are still under investigation and considered experimental. There are no accepted guidelines that tell how every patient should be treated. As a result, treatment is individualized.''Interferon'""-alpha has been used to treat hepatitis B for more than 20 years. Interferon-alpha is a naturally occurring protein that is made in the body by white blood cells to combat viral infections. In addition to its direct anti-viral effects, interferon works against the hepatitis B virus by stimulating the body's immune system to clear the virus. Compared to older interferon alpha agents, pegylated interferon alpha, marketed as Pegasys or Pegintron, has a more convenient dosing schedule, may be slightly more effective and suppresses the virus for a longer period of time. Pegylated interferon alpha is given once a week for 48 weeks.""'Only about a third of people who have Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) in their blood will be able to eliminate HBeAg and produce antibodies against the HBe antigen after treatment with interferon. Relapse may occur after treatment is stopped.'""Sustained response (undetectable viral load in the blood, normal liver function tests) occurs in approximately less than a third of patients after the drug is stopped. Although this is not a cure (some virus still lives in the liver and elsewhere), people with sustained response are at low risk for complications of liver disease. If the responder's immune system is compromised, for example through the use of steroids or acquiring ""'HIV'', the disease can recur. Periodic monitoring of blood tests can help confirm that the response continues to be sustained.''Interferon causes several side effects including:''The side effects may be severe enough that the patient is unable to continue treatment. During treatment, the normal immune response to the virus is stimulated and may cause worsening inflammation in the liver. This is normally a good sign showing that the interferon is working, but more extreme responses may in rare cases cause liver failure. Thus, physicians will monitor blood tests closely during therapy. People with unstable liver disease due to cirrhosis usually should not take interferon because of the increased risk of liver failure.''Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are man-made chemicals that mimic the nucleosides and nucleotides that are used for making DNA. When the virus tries to use the analogues to make its own DNA, it is unable to make the DNA and, therefore, cannot reproduce. Examples of these agents include adefovir (''Hepsera''), entecavir (Baraclude), ''lamivudine'' (''Epivir''-HBV, Heptovir, Heptodin), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and ''tenofovir'' (''Viread'').''Unfortunately, the hepatitis B virus may become resistant to NAs over time (see below). Adefovir may be effective against ''strains'' of virus that have become resistant to lamivudine and may be added to lamivudine when resistance appears. Simply switching from one NA to another is not recommended because this leads to virus strains that are resistant to multiple medications.''Currently, the optimal duration of treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is uncertain. people with HBeAg may be treated until six months after the HBeAg disappears from the blood and is replaced by antibodies (anti-HBe), if this occurs. In people without HBeAg, the endpoints are less clear. Some experts advocate treating until the viral load (viral DNA) is undetectable and the surface antigen (HbsAg) has been cleared from the blood. Others suggest continuing medications for prolonged periods to suppress the virus. All of these strategies are hampered by the risk of the virus becoming resistant to the medications. Patients who discontinue treatment with NAs should be monitored carefully for recurrent hepatitis, which may be severe.''There are no clear guidelines to recommend which agent to use first in treating chronic hepatitis B, as there are multiple options. Interferon is given for a defined period of time and may have a more prolonged response after the medication is discontinued than NAs. However, interferon is given as an injection, and side effects often are troublesome. NAs are given as a pill and have few side effects, but the duration of treatment is unclear, and prolonged therapy (years) may be required. NAs may be preferred in patients with unstable disease and cirrhosis because they are thought to be less likely to cause serious flares of hepatitis with more severe liver disease.' A significant reduction in the viral load or elimination of detectable viral DNA from the blood occurs in 25%-37% of people during treatment. Blood tests for liver functions normalize in approximately 23%-39% people treated with interferon or pegylated interferon. People who have significant abnormalities in liver function before therapy are more likely to respond to treatment. Those who have normal liver blood tests before treatment are less likely to respond to interferon therapy. Liver biopsy results show improvement in about one-third of patients. fatigue, generalized muscle aches, fever, chills and loss of appetite. These flu-like symptoms occur in approximately 80% of treated patients; mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects may occur; and thyroid gland abnormalities resulting inhypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone); significant suppression of thebone marrow and production of blood cells; infection; or hair loss may occur."
What are the effects of alcohol on hepatitis B?,"'Agents that damage the liver are particularly harmful in patients who already have hepatitis B. For this reason, it is recommended that people with hepatitis B avoid drinking alcohol.' "
What are the effects of immunosuppressive medications on hepatitis B?,"'Even in people with chronic hepatitis B, the immune system is working to suppress the virus. Medications that suppress the immune system allow the virus to reproduce in large numbers and may cause the hepatitis to flare. ''Examples of medications that suppress the immune system are:'""If an immunosuppressant drug is stopped, the body's immune system's activity may rebound and cause severe inflammation of the liver. "" prednisone: used to treat many diseases, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain types of skin disease and arthritis methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall): used to treat certain types of skin disease, arthritis, and cancer;  cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan): used to treat some cancers. 
"
What is delta hepatitis?,"'Delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis B. The delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis D or HDV) is an RNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. It is spread through exposure to contaminated blood, especially with illicit, intravenous ''drug use'', and by sexual contact. Delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis B. When this happens, infected people are quite sick but most are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. People who already have chronic hepatitis B can acquire delta hepatitis as well. This often causes severe inflammation of the liver, and the viruses are less likely to be cleared.''Delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis B much worse. It increases the risk of complications, especially cirrhosis, which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients.''There is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. Interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis, but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. ''Prevention'' includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners, using barrier methods of ''contraception''). Universal vaccination of newborns with ''hepatitis B vaccine'' effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis B virus.' "
What about co-infection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus?,"'Hepatitis C'' is caused by a virus that is spread through contaminated needles or blood products and, less commonly, through sexual intercourse. Few patients with chronic hepatitis B also are co-infected chronically with hepatitis C virus (''HCV''). The two viruses interfere with each other and one usually predominates. If hepatitis C is the predominant infection, treatment is directed against the hepatitis C. Patients infected with both viruses are at higher risk for complications of liver disease. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C. People with hepatitis C should be vaccinated against hepatitis B to prevent co-infection.' "
What happens in co-infection with hepatitis B virus and HIV?,"'The ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') and hepatitis B virus are transmitted in similar ways, and it is not uncommon for an individual to have both infections. People with ''HIV'' who acquire hepatitis B are more likely to become chronically infected with hepatitis B than people who do not have HIV. The reason for this is thought to be that HIV suppresses the immune system and impairs the ability of the body to eliminate the hepatitis B virus. Some nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (a class of antiretroviral drugs) are used to treat both HIV and hepatitis B, although dosages may vary in the two different infections. Stopping one of these agents when the HIV regimen is adjusted may cause hepatitis to flare.' "
What is new in the treatment of hepatitis B?,'New agents are under development to treat hepatitis B. Many of these are nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that investigators hope will be more effective than older agents. Experts also are working on treatment guidelines and the use of multi-drug therapy. Vaccination remains the key to preventing hepatitis B and holds the most promise for reducing disease burden.'  
What is the role of liver transplantation in hepatitis B?,"'Liver transplantation has been successful in patients who have irreversible, life-threatening complications of hepatitis B. This includes patients with liver failure due to end-stage cirrhosis or unusually severe (fulminant) hepatitis. Liver transplantation does not cure hepatitis B, and hepatitis may occur in the new liver. The incidence of recurrent hepatitis has been reduced to less than 10% through use of lamivudine and HBIG in transplant recipients. Use of these agents has also improved long-term survival, with 75% of patients alive after five years.' "
What can be done to prevent hepatitis B?,"'Hepatitis B is a preventable disease. Vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis have significantly reduced rates of infection. Risk can also be reduced by avoiding unprotected sex, contaminated needles, and other sources of infection.''The hepatitis B vaccine contains a protein (antigen) that stimulates the body to make protective antibodies. Examples of hepatitis B ''vaccines'' available in the United States include hepatitis B vaccine-injection (''Engerix-B'', Recombivax-HB). Three doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 months) are necessary to assure protection. There are also combination ''vaccines'' on the market that provide protection against hepatitis B and other diseases.''Examples include:''Hepatitis B ''vaccines'' are effective and safe. Most vaccinated individuals form effective antibodies and are protected from hepatitis B when they get full three-dose series of vaccine. In healthcare workers, high-risk public safety workers, ''dialysis'' patients, and sexual partners of infected people, a blood test for antibodies is recommended after vaccination to ensure that the person produced antibodies. For the few who do not form antibodies, revaccination may improve response, especially in infants. However, a small proportion of individuals will never respond to hepatitis B vaccination. Side effects from the vaccine are usually mild and include soreness at the site of injection. The risk of serious ''allergic'' reactions (''anaphylaxis'') is less than one per million doses. Vaccination has reduced the number of new cases of hepatitis B in the United States.''In the United States, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants at birth. Older children and adolescents should receive the vaccine if they did not do so at birth.''Adults in high risk situations also are advised to receive hepatitis B vaccine. This includes:''Centers that serve high-risk individuals are encouraged to provide the vaccine to their clients. Such centers include dialysis units, drug treatment facilities, ''sexually transmitted diseases'' clinics and correctional facilities. Some countries have a high prevalence of hepatitis B in their population. ''Travelers'' who visit these countries for a prolonged period of time (usually six months) and those who may be exposed to blood or semen should consider vaccination.''HBIG is a product that contains antibodies against hepatitis B. When injected, it provides temporary protection against hepatitis B. HBIG is used when people have had significant exposure to the virus. An example would be an accidental needle stick in an unvaccinated health care worker from a needle contaminated with blood from a person with hepatitis B. HBIG should be given as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within seven days. People who need HBIG should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. HBIG also is given to patients with hepatitis B following liver transplantation to suppress the hepatitis B virus in the transplanted liver.''Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to a known case of hepatitis B or to a person at high risk for hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician. Examples of such exposures include needle stick injuries in health care workers or sexual intercourse with an infected person. If the exposure is significant, the physician will recommend vaccination and also may recommend an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is prepared from the plasma of blood donors and contains antibodies to hepatitis B. Vaccination and HBIG can substantially reduce the risk of disease in people exposed to hepatitis B if given within one week of a needle stick or two weeks of sexual intercourse.''Vaccination provides long-term immunity in people who respond to the vaccine. There is no need for HBIG if an exposure occurs to a vaccinated person who is known to respond to the vaccine; however, a blood test might be drawn to verify that the person did respond to the vaccine.''Infected mothers can pass hepatitis B to their newborn infants. All ''pregnant'' women should have blood tested to determine if they are infected. Infants born to infected mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine at birth.' Hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a vaccine - injection (Twinrix), which provides protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Haemophilus B/hepatitis B vaccine - injection (Comvax) provides protection against hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a cause of meningitis). Pediarix provides protection against hepatitis B,tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and polio. health care workers dentists intimate and household contacts of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection public safety workers who may be exposed to blood men who have sex with men individuals with multiple sexual partners dialysis patients injection drug users people with chronic liver disease residents and staff in institutions that care for people with developmental disabilities people infected with HIV people who require repeated transfusions or blood products."
What causes heel pain?,"'Heel pain'' is most often caused by ''plantar fasciitis''. Plantar fasciitis or heel spur syndrome is the tissue swelling over the sole of the foot.''The other causes of ''heel pain'' include' Vitamin D deficiency causing weak muscles of the leg and foot Weakness of the calf muscle due to inactivity; this causes swelling of the tail of the muscle at the heels Stress fracture (due to very long marches, walks over uneven areas) Arthritis (wear and tear of ankle joint) Achilles tendonitis (swelling of a muscle at the ball of the feet) Trapped nerve (compression of the small nerve) Cyst (a type of swelling) Peripheral vascular disease (narrowing of blood vessels supplying the heel) Sever’s disease (occurs in children due to injury to the growth plate of the heel bone) Blister Vigorous physical activity Calcaneal apophysitis (the center of the heel bone is irritated due to new shoes or high athletic activity) Bursitis (inflammation of a sac that lines many joints) Pump bump (abnormal bony growth at the back of the heel) Prolonged standing Tumor Stone bruise"
How is heel pain treated?,"'Mostly, heel ''pain'' resolves on its own with proper care and rest. Treatment depends on the causes of heel ''pain''. The most common treatment regimens include''If these conservative treatments do not reduce the heel pain, then consult the doctor. The doctor might do certain blood tests to check ''Vitamin D'' levels and thyroid levels. An X-Ray may be done to rule out ''stress fracture'' or to check for the spur.''For plantar fasciitis, the doctor might recommend using a night splint or a short leg cast or they may inject ''corticosteroid'' medication.''The physician might also prescribe physical therapy to strengthen muscles and tendons and to prevent any further injury.''If a need arises, the physician might perform surgery to treat the underlying conditions or to release the trapped nerves.' Applying an ice pack to the affected area several times a day Temporary rest from activities Using properly fitting shoes Using heel pads and heel cushions (especially silicon insoles) Performing stretching exercises in the morning Doing regular physical activity to strengthen leg muscles Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as Tylenol or Motril (ibuprofen)"
How can you prevent heel pain?,"'You cannot prevent all types of heel pain, yet most heel pain can be prevented with the following methods' Maintaining a healthy weight Wearing proper-fitting shoes Maintaining proper posture during walking and running Warming up before participating in sports Doing stretching exercises to prevent injury to muscles Massaging the soles after prolonged standing or high-impact activities Giving brief periodic rest to heels when tired  Wearing the right shoes for physical activity"
When to call a doctor?,"'Heel pain may get better with rest and other home remedies. However, if the pain doesn’t go away within two to three weeks, you should immediately contact the doctor. Also, call the physician if you observe the following symptoms' Severe pain Sudden onset of pain Redness in the heel Swelling in the heel Walking seems to be impossible See signs of infection"
How long does heel pain last?,"'The duration of heel pain depends on the cause. Heel pain related to ''obesity'' improves gradually with ''weight loss''. The heel pain associated with a specific sport or ''exercise'' requires a period of rest. In general, heel pain heals either on its own or with treatment.' "
What is a heel spur? What are heel spur symptoms?,"'A heel spur is a pointed bony outgrowth of the bone of the heel (the calcaneus bone). Chronic local inflammation at the insertion of soft-tissue tendons or plantar fascia is a common cause of ''bone spurs'' (''osteophytes''). Heel spurs can be located at the back of the heel or under the heel, beneath the arch of the foot. Heel spurs at the back of the heel are frequently associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (tendinitis) and cause tenderness and heel ''pain'' made worse while pushing off the ball of the foot.'  "
How do heel spurs relate to plantar fasciitis? What causes heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs under the sole of the foot (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (plantar fasciitis), the ""bowstring-like"" ligament stretching underneath the sole that attaches at the heel. Plantar heel spurs cause localized tenderness and heel\xa0''pain'' made worse when stepping down on the heel.''Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases that cause ''arthritis'' (inflammation of the joints), such as ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease), ""'ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis'' (DISH). It is important to note that heel spurs may cause no symptoms at all and may be incidentally discovered during X-ray exams taken for other purposes.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs are diagnosed based on the history of heel pain and tenderness localized to the area of bony involvement. They are specifically identified when there is point tenderness at the bottom of the heel, which makes it difficult to walk barefoot on hard surfaces, like tile or wood floors. X-ray examination of the foot is used to identify the bony prominence (spur) of the heel bone (calcaneus).' "
What are heel spur treatment options? Are there any home remedies for heel spurs?,"'Heel spurs are treated by measures that decrease the associated inflammation and avoid reinjury. Local ice applications both reduce pain and inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') and\xa0''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''), or injections of cortisone, are often helpful.''Orthotic devices or shoe inserts are used to take pressure off plantar spurs (donut-shaped insert), and heel lifts can reduce ''stress'' on the Achilles tendon to relieve painful bone spurs at the back of the heel. Similarly, sports ''running'' shoes with soft, cushioned soles can be helpful in reducing irritation of inflamed tissues from heel spurs. Infrequently, surgery is performed on chronically inflamed spurs.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) of heel spurs?,"'The long-term outlook is generally good. The inflammation usually responds to conservative, nonsurgical treatments, like anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' and orthotics. Infrequently, surgical intervention is necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent heel spurs?,'Treating any underlying associated inflammatory disease can prevent heel spurs.' 
What is Helicobacter pylori (stomach bacteria)?,"'Helicobacter'' pylori'' (''H. pylori'' or, as it is sometimes termed, stomach bacteria) is a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium that can cause chronic inflammation of the inner lining of the stomach (gastritis) and in the duodenum (first part of the small bowel) in humans. This bacterium also is considered a common cause of ulcers worldwide; as many as 90% of people with ulcers are infected with ''H. pylori''. However, many people have these organisms residing in (colonising or mucosa-associated) their stomach and upper digestive tract and have few or no symptoms. LPS (lipopolysaccharide) is part of the ''H. pylori ''outer membrane and can be toxic when the bacteria die and lyse.'  "
How do you get H. pylori?,"'H. pylori'' bacteria may cause a stomach infection in some individuals. ''H. pylori'"" infections start with a person acquiring the bacterium from another person (via either the fecal-oral or oral-oral route). Although the majority of individuals who have these bacteria in their gastrointestinal (GI) tracts have few if any symptoms (see symptoms), most people develop stomach inflammation (gastritis) from the body's response to the bacterium itself and to a cytotoxin-associated substance termed Vac-A, a chemical that the bacterium produces.""'Researchers also suggest that stomach acid stimulates the bacterium to grow and produce the cytotoxin, and increases invasion of the lining of the stomach by the bacteria, with resulting inflammation, and ''peptic ulcer'' formation (''peptic ulcer'' disease). Other investigators have shown that these bacteria and their products cause alterations in the cells of the stomach lining that when altered are associated with stomach and other ''cancers'', although these are infrequently seen diseases.''The frequency of people infected may somehow be related to race. About 60% of Hispanics and about 54% of African Americans have detectable organisms as compared to about 20% to 29% of White Americans. In developing countries, children are very commonly infected.' "
What are the early and serious symptoms and signs of Helicobacter pylori infections?,"'Most individuals with ''Helicobacter pylori'' infections have few or no symptoms. Some may experience a few symptoms from mild gastritis episodes, for example,''Often, these symptoms simply go away. However, those individuals who have more serious infection experience signs and symptoms of stomach and duodenal ulcers or severe gastritis which include:''Other symptoms may include:''Persons with symptoms of black, ''tarry stools'' and ''fatigue'' should seek immediate medical help or go to an emergency department to be evaluated for intestinal bleeding.'   minor belching, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Abdominal pain and/or discomfort that usually does not wax and wane Nausea and vomiting sometimes with blood that is red, or the color is like coffee grounds or like vomitus Dark or tar-like stools (black color of feces due to bleeding ulcers) Fatigue Low red blood cell counts due to bleeding Full feeling after consuming a small amount of food Decreased appetite that is more constant Diarrhea Heartburn Bad breath (halitosis)"
Is H. pylori contagious?,"'Yes, ''H. pylori'' is ''contagious''. However, sometimes there is a gray area between the terms contagious and colonized. Contagious usually implies that a disease-causing agent is transferred from person to person, while colonization usually implies an agent that simply populates an organ but does not cause disease, even when transferred from person to person. The gray area occurs when many people have the agent that causes disease in some of them, but not in many others. Some microbiologists consider such organisms as adapting to their human hosts by slowly changing from infecting humans to colonizing them. Although this is a speculation, it seems to fit the ongoing situation with ''H. pylori''. However, others think the bacteria become infecting agents when ''H. pylori''’s genetic ''makeup'' is triggered by the surrounding GI environment to produce and release enough toxic chemicals to cause the GI tract to become inflamed.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat H. pylori infection?,"'Many individuals can be treated by their primary care doctors; however, some people may need specialists like infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, and possibly a surgeon to help manage and/or treat the person with ''H. pylori'' infection.' "
Is there a test to diagnose H. pylori infection?,"'Accurate and simple tests for the detection of ''H. pylori'' infection are available (''H. pylori'' infection tests). They include blood antibody tests, urea breath tests, ''stool'' antigen tests, and endoscopic biopsies.''Blood tests'' for the presence of antibodies to ''H. pylori'' can be performed easily and rapidly. However, blood antibodies can persist for years after complete eradication of ''H. pylori'' with antibiotics. Therefore, blood antibody tests (immunoglobulin G or IgG and/or IgA) may be good for diagnosing infection, but they are not good for determining if antibiotics have successfully eradicated the bacterium.''The urea breath test ''(UBT) is a safe, easy, and accurate test for the presence of ''H. pylori'' in the stomach. The breath test relies on the ability of ''H. pylori'' to break down the naturally occurring chemical, urea, into carbon dioxide, which is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated from the body in the breath. Ten to 20 minutes after swallowing a capsule containing urea labeled with either a minute amount of radioactive carbon or heavy but not radioactive carbon, a breath sample is collected and analyzed for labeled carbon dioxide. The presence of labeled carbon dioxide in the breath (a positive test) means that there is active infection. The test becomes negative (there is no radioactive carbon dioxide in the breath) shortly after eradication of the bacterium from the stomach with antibiotics. Individuals who are concerned about even minute amounts of radioactivity can be tested with urea labeled with heavy, nonradioactive carbon.''Endoscopy'' is an accurate test for diagnosing ''H. pylori'' as well as the inflammation and ulcers that it causes. For endoscopy, the doctor inserts a flexible viewing tube (endoscope) through the mouth, down the ''esophagus'', and into the stomach and duodenum. During endoscopy, small tissue samples (biopsies) from the stomach lining can be removed. A biopsy specimen is placed on a special slide containing urea (for example, CLO test slides). If the urea is broken down by ''H. pylori'' in the biopsy, there is a change in color around the biopsy on the slide. This means that there is an infection with ''H. pylori'' in the stomach. Endoscopy also allows determination of the severity of gastritis with biopsies as well as the presence of ulcers, MALT lymphoma, and ''cancer''.''Biopsies'' also may be cultured in the bacteriology laboratory for the presence of ''H. pylori''; however, this is done infrequently since other simpler tests are available.''Stool sample: A recently-developed test for ''H. pylori'' is a test in which the presence of the bacterium can be diagnosed from a sample of stool. The test uses an antibody to ''H. pylori'' to determine if ''H. pylori'' antigen is present in the stool. If it is, it means that ''H. pylori'' is infecting the stomach. Like the urea breath test, in addition to diagnosing infection with ''H. pylori'', the stool test can be used to determine if eradication has been effective soon after treatment.''In 2012, the FDA gave approval for the urea breath test to be done in children aged 3 years to 17 years old.'  "
What treatment medications cure H. pylori infections?,"'Chronic infection with ''H. pylori'' weakens the natural defenses of the lining of the stomach to the ulcerating action of acid. Medications that neutralize stomach acid (antacids), and medications that decrease the secretion of acid in the stomach (H2-blockers and ''proton pump inhibitors'' or ''PPIs'') have been used effectively for many years to treat ulcers.''Treating ''H. pylori'' with acid-reducing antacids, H2-blockers, and PPIs, however, does not eradicate ''H. pylori'' from the stomach, and ulcers frequently return promptly after these medications are discontinued. Hence, antacids, H2-blockers, or PPIs have to be taken daily for many years to prevent the return of the ulcers and the complications of ulcers such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of the stomach. Even such long-term treatments can fail.''Eradication of ''H. pylori'', however, usually prevents the return of ulcers and ulcer complications even after appropriate medications such as PPIs are stopped. Eradication of ''H. pylori'' also is important in the treatment of the rare condition known as MALT lymphoma of the stomach.''Treatment of ''H. pylori'' to prevent ''stomach cancer'' is controversial and discussed in this article.' ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), and nizatidine (Axid). omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), and esomeprazole (Nexium)."
Is H. pylori infection easy to cure?,"'H. pylori'' is difficult to eradicate (cure) from the stomach because it is capable of developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics (antibiotic-resistant ''H. pylori''). Therefore, two or more antibiotics usually are given together with a PPI and/or bismuth containing compounds to eradicate the bacterium. (Bismuth and PPIs have anti-''H. pylori'' effects.) Examples of combinations of medications that are effective are:''These combinations of medications can be expected to cure 70% to 90% of infections. However, studies have shown that resistance of ''H. pylori'' (failure of antibiotics to eradicate the bacterium) to clarithromycin is common among patients who have prior exposure to clarithromycin or other chemically similar macrolide antibiotics (such as ''erythromycin'').''Similarly, ''H. pylori'' resistance to metronidazole is common among patients who have had prior exposure to metronidazole. In these patients, doctors have to find other combinations of antibiotics to treat the ''H. pylori''. Antibiotic resistance is another reason why antibiotics should be used carefully and judiciously for the right reasons, and indiscriminate use of antibiotics for improper reasons should be discouraged.''First-line regimens for'' Helicobacter pylori'' eradication or cure are taken from the guidelines developed by the American College of Gastroenterology as follows:''*PPI = proton pump inhibitor; pcn = ''penicillin''; p.o. = orally; q.d. = daily; b.i.d. = twice daily; t.i.d. = three times daily; q.i.d. = four times daily.''A recent investigation reported that triple therapy of either ''levofloxacin'' (''Levaquin'') or ''rifabutin'' in combination with amoxicillin and esomeprazole yielded cure rates of 90% and 88.6%. The treatments lasted 10 to 12 days respectively (10 days of levofloxacin 20=50 mg b.i.d. or rifabutin 150 mg q.d. for 12 days. Amoxicillin dose was 1 gm, esomeprazole was 40 mg, both b.i.d.).''Some doctors may want to confirm eradication of ''H. pylori'' after treatment with a urea breath test or a stool antigen test, particularly if there have been serious complications of the infection such as perforation or bleeding in the stomach or duodenum. Endoscopic biopsies to determine eradication of the bacterium are not necessary, and blood tests are not good for determining eradication since it takes many months or years for the antibodies to ''H. pylori'' to decrease. The best tests for determining eradication are the breath and stool tests discussed previously. Patients who fail to eradicate ''H. pylori'' with treatment are retreated, often with a different combination of medications. Also, a meta-analysis study of patients started on low-dose aspirin showed less than 20% were tested for H. pylori; this is concerning because low-dose aspirin roughly doubles the risk factors for getting an upper GI bleed in individuals with H. pylori infection.'   a PPI, amoxicillin (Amoxil), and clarithromycin (Biaxin) a PPI, metronidazole (Flagyl), tetracycline, and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Bismuth) Standard dose of a *PPI (proton pump inhibitor) *b.i.d. (esomeprazole is *q.d.),clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 10-14 days Standard dose PPI b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. metronidazole 500 mg b.i.d. for 10-14 days Bismuth subsalicylate 525 mg p.o. q.i.d. metronidazole 250 mg * p.o. *q.i.d., tetracycline 500 mg p.o. q.i.d., ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. or standard dose PPI q.d. to b.i.d. for 10-14 days PPI + amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d., for 5 days, followed by PPI, clarithromycin 500 mg, tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d. for 5 days (used mainly in other countries)"
What natural treatments cure H. pylori infection?,"'There are many claims about natural treatment and cures for ''H. pylori'' infection. None of these have been scientifically proven to cure ''H. pylori'' infection, and include''Discuss all natural herbs and ''supplements'' with your doctor before taking them.''Nutritionists and health care professionals suggest avoiding spicy foods, coffee, carbonated ''drinks'', and pickled foods as these may increase the symptoms associated with the infection.' mastic gum, broccoli, matuka tea, manuka honey, coconut oil, and many others."
Does everyone have H. pylori bacteria in their stomach?,"'There is a general consensus among doctors that individuals should be treated if they are infected with ''H. pylori'"" and have ulcers. The goal of treatment is to eradicate the bacterium, heal ulcers if they are present, and prevent the ulcers' return. Patients with MALT lymphoma of the stomach also should be treated. MALT lymphoma is rare, but the ""'tumor'' often quickly regresses upon successful eradication of ''H. pylori''.''There currently is no formal recommendation to treat patients infected with ''H. pylori'' without ulcers or MALT lymphoma. Since antibiotic combinations can have side effects, and stomach cancers are infrequent in the United States, some health care professionals feel that the risks of treatment to eradicate ''H. pylori'' in patients without symptoms or ulcers may not justify the unproven benefits of treatment for the purpose of preventing ''stomach cancer''. On the other hand, ''H. pylori'' infection is known to cause atrophic gastritis (chronic inflammation of the stomach leading to atrophy of the inner lining of the stomach). Some doctors believe that atrophic gastritis can lead to cell changes (intestinal metaplasia) that can be precursors to stomach ''cancer''. Studies have also shown that eradication of ''H. pylori'' may reverse atrophic gastritis. Thus, some doctors are recommending treatment of ulcer- and symptom-free patients infected with ''H. pylori''.''Many physicians believe that ''dyspepsia'' (non-ulcer symptoms associated with meals) may be associated with infection with ''H. pylori''. Although it is not clear if ''H. pylori'' causes the dyspepsia, many doctors will test patients with dyspepsia for infection with ''H. pylori'' and treat them if infection is present.''Scientists studying the genetics of ''H. pylori'' have found different ''strains'' (types) of the bacterium. Some strains of ''H. pylori'' appear to be more prone to cause ulcers and stomach cancer. Meta-analysis of ''H. pylori'' eradication treatment seems to reduce ''gastric cancer'' risk. Further research in this area may help doctors to intelligently select those patients who need treatment. Vaccination against ''H. pylori'' is unlikely to be available in the near future.' "
Can you prevent H. pylori infections?,"'With at least 50% of the world population having detectable ''H. pylori'' in their stomachs, it seems likely that with no vaccine available, it will be very difficult or impossible for people to have no exposure to these bacteria. The chance of the organisms causing symptomatic infection is low, but certainly not absent. Currently, suggestions have been made to prevent ulcers, but the effectiveness of these recommendations are unknown. The following is a list of recommendations to help prevent ulcers:''Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent either the infection or colonization of the stomach by ''H pylori''. However, research is ongoing, and the NIH is funding vaccine studies in conjunction with vaccine makers (For example, Helicovax to prevent ''H. pylori'' colonization of human GI tracts by EpiVax, Inc.). Moreover, some nutritionists suggest that a ''diet'' high in fruits and vegetables, and low in ''sugar'' may help reduce or stop ''H. pylori'' infection. In many individuals, the immune response to infection is ineffective and leads to life-long infection.' Reduce or stop the intake of alcohol. Stop smoking. For pain control, use acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) instead of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Avoid caffeine in coffee and many ""power"" drinks. Check for GI symptoms and treat immediately during or after radiation therapy. Identify and reduce or avoid stress. Wash hands with uncontaminated water to avoid contracting the bacterium. If infected with H. pylori, antimicrobial treatment may prevent ulcer formation and extension of disease."
What is the prognosis for H. pylori infections? What if it is not  treated?,"'Many infections are mild and produce few, if any, symptoms. The prognosis of these infections is excellent. Patients with more serious symptoms who are treated appropriately usually have a good prognosis although up to 20% may have reoccurrence of the infection. Those with ulcers who have effective eradication of their infection heal their ulcers well (with usually minor scarring in the tissue).''Untreated and severe infections have a more guarded prognosis because extensive damage can occur with bleeding, scarring, anemia, and ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure'') occurring. Some patients with these symptoms will die if not treated quickly. About 1% of people with the infection go on to develop gastric cancer. Researchers have suggested that it may be possible to use special inhibitors that will block the bacteria from adhering to the lining of the stomach gastric tissue.' "
What is Helicobacter pylori (stomach bacteria)?,"'Helicobacter'' pylori'' (''H. pylori'' or, as it is sometimes termed, stomach bacteria) is a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium that can cause chronic inflammation of the inner lining of the stomach (gastritis) and in the duodenum (first part of the small bowel) in humans. This bacterium also is considered a common cause of ulcers worldwide; as many as 90% of people with ulcers are infected with ''H. pylori''. However, many people have these organisms residing in (colonising or mucosa-associated) their stomach and upper digestive tract and have few or no symptoms. LPS (lipopolysaccharide) is part of the ''H. pylori ''outer membrane and can be toxic when the bacteria die and lyse.'  "
How do you get H. pylori?,"'H. pylori'' bacteria may cause a stomach infection in some individuals. ''H. pylori'"" infections start with a person acquiring the bacterium from another person (via either the fecal-oral or oral-oral route). Although the majority of individuals who have these bacteria in their gastrointestinal (GI) tracts have few if any symptoms (see symptoms), most people develop stomach inflammation (gastritis) from the body's response to the bacterium itself and to a cytotoxin-associated substance termed Vac-A, a chemical that the bacterium produces.""'Researchers also suggest that stomach acid stimulates the bacterium to grow and produce the cytotoxin, and increases invasion of the lining of the stomach by the bacteria, with resulting inflammation, and ''peptic ulcer'' formation (''peptic ulcer'' disease). Other investigators have shown that these bacteria and their products cause alterations in the cells of the stomach lining that when altered are associated with stomach and other ''cancers'', although these are infrequently seen diseases.''The frequency of people infected may somehow be related to race. About 60% of Hispanics and about 54% of African Americans have detectable organisms as compared to about 20% to 29% of White Americans. In developing countries, children are very commonly infected.' "
What are the early and serious symptoms and signs of Helicobacter pylori infections?,"'Most individuals with ''Helicobacter pylori'' infections have few or no symptoms. Some may experience a few symptoms from mild gastritis episodes, for example,''Often, these symptoms simply go away. However, those individuals who have more serious infection experience signs and symptoms of stomach and duodenal ulcers or severe gastritis which include:''Other symptoms may include:''Persons with symptoms of black, ''tarry stools'' and ''fatigue'' should seek immediate medical help or go to an emergency department to be evaluated for intestinal bleeding.'   minor belching, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Abdominal pain and/or discomfort that usually does not wax and wane Nausea and vomiting sometimes with blood that is red, or the color is like coffee grounds or like vomitus Dark or tar-like stools (black color of feces due to bleeding ulcers) Fatigue Low red blood cell counts due to bleeding Full feeling after consuming a small amount of food Decreased appetite that is more constant Diarrhea Heartburn Bad breath (halitosis)"
Is H. pylori contagious?,"'Yes, ''H. pylori'' is ''contagious''. However, sometimes there is a gray area between the terms contagious and colonized. Contagious usually implies that a disease-causing agent is transferred from person to person, while colonization usually implies an agent that simply populates an organ but does not cause disease, even when transferred from person to person. The gray area occurs when many people have the agent that causes disease in some of them, but not in many others. Some microbiologists consider such organisms as adapting to their human hosts by slowly changing from infecting humans to colonizing them. Although this is a speculation, it seems to fit the ongoing situation with ''H. pylori''. However, others think the bacteria become infecting agents when ''H. pylori''’s genetic ''makeup'' is triggered by the surrounding GI environment to produce and release enough toxic chemicals to cause the GI tract to become inflamed.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat H. pylori infection?,"'Many individuals can be treated by their primary care doctors; however, some people may need specialists like infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, and possibly a surgeon to help manage and/or treat the person with ''H. pylori'' infection.' "
Is there a test to diagnose H. pylori infection?,"'Accurate and simple tests for the detection of ''H. pylori'' infection are available (''H. pylori'' infection tests). They include blood antibody tests, urea breath tests, ''stool'' antigen tests, and endoscopic biopsies.''Blood tests'' for the presence of antibodies to ''H. pylori'' can be performed easily and rapidly. However, blood antibodies can persist for years after complete eradication of ''H. pylori'' with antibiotics. Therefore, blood antibody tests (immunoglobulin G or IgG and/or IgA) may be good for diagnosing infection, but they are not good for determining if antibiotics have successfully eradicated the bacterium.''The urea breath test ''(UBT) is a safe, easy, and accurate test for the presence of ''H. pylori'' in the stomach. The breath test relies on the ability of ''H. pylori'' to break down the naturally occurring chemical, urea, into carbon dioxide, which is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated from the body in the breath. Ten to 20 minutes after swallowing a capsule containing urea labeled with either a minute amount of radioactive carbon or heavy but not radioactive carbon, a breath sample is collected and analyzed for labeled carbon dioxide. The presence of labeled carbon dioxide in the breath (a positive test) means that there is active infection. The test becomes negative (there is no radioactive carbon dioxide in the breath) shortly after eradication of the bacterium from the stomach with antibiotics. Individuals who are concerned about even minute amounts of radioactivity can be tested with urea labeled with heavy, nonradioactive carbon.''Endoscopy'' is an accurate test for diagnosing ''H. pylori'' as well as the inflammation and ulcers that it causes. For endoscopy, the doctor inserts a flexible viewing tube (endoscope) through the mouth, down the ''esophagus'', and into the stomach and duodenum. During endoscopy, small tissue samples (biopsies) from the stomach lining can be removed. A biopsy specimen is placed on a special slide containing urea (for example, CLO test slides). If the urea is broken down by ''H. pylori'' in the biopsy, there is a change in color around the biopsy on the slide. This means that there is an infection with ''H. pylori'' in the stomach. Endoscopy also allows determination of the severity of gastritis with biopsies as well as the presence of ulcers, MALT lymphoma, and ''cancer''.''Biopsies'' also may be cultured in the bacteriology laboratory for the presence of ''H. pylori''; however, this is done infrequently since other simpler tests are available.''Stool sample: A recently-developed test for ''H. pylori'' is a test in which the presence of the bacterium can be diagnosed from a sample of stool. The test uses an antibody to ''H. pylori'' to determine if ''H. pylori'' antigen is present in the stool. If it is, it means that ''H. pylori'' is infecting the stomach. Like the urea breath test, in addition to diagnosing infection with ''H. pylori'', the stool test can be used to determine if eradication has been effective soon after treatment.''In 2012, the FDA gave approval for the urea breath test to be done in children aged 3 years to 17 years old.'  "
What treatment medications cure H. pylori infections?,"'Chronic infection with ''H. pylori'' weakens the natural defenses of the lining of the stomach to the ulcerating action of acid. Medications that neutralize stomach acid (antacids), and medications that decrease the secretion of acid in the stomach (H2-blockers and ''proton pump inhibitors'' or ''PPIs'') have been used effectively for many years to treat ulcers.''Treating ''H. pylori'' with acid-reducing antacids, H2-blockers, and PPIs, however, does not eradicate ''H. pylori'' from the stomach, and ulcers frequently return promptly after these medications are discontinued. Hence, antacids, H2-blockers, or PPIs have to be taken daily for many years to prevent the return of the ulcers and the complications of ulcers such as bleeding, perforation, and obstruction of the stomach. Even such long-term treatments can fail.''Eradication of ''H. pylori'', however, usually prevents the return of ulcers and ulcer complications even after appropriate medications such as PPIs are stopped. Eradication of ''H. pylori'' also is important in the treatment of the rare condition known as MALT lymphoma of the stomach.''Treatment of ''H. pylori'' to prevent ''stomach cancer'' is controversial and discussed in this article.' ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), and nizatidine (Axid). omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix), and esomeprazole (Nexium)."
Is H. pylori infection easy to cure?,"'H. pylori'' is difficult to eradicate (cure) from the stomach because it is capable of developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics (antibiotic-resistant ''H. pylori''). Therefore, two or more antibiotics usually are given together with a PPI and/or bismuth containing compounds to eradicate the bacterium. (Bismuth and PPIs have anti-''H. pylori'' effects.) Examples of combinations of medications that are effective are:''These combinations of medications can be expected to cure 70% to 90% of infections. However, studies have shown that resistance of ''H. pylori'' (failure of antibiotics to eradicate the bacterium) to clarithromycin is common among patients who have prior exposure to clarithromycin or other chemically similar macrolide antibiotics (such as ''erythromycin'').''Similarly, ''H. pylori'' resistance to metronidazole is common among patients who have had prior exposure to metronidazole. In these patients, doctors have to find other combinations of antibiotics to treat the ''H. pylori''. Antibiotic resistance is another reason why antibiotics should be used carefully and judiciously for the right reasons, and indiscriminate use of antibiotics for improper reasons should be discouraged.''First-line regimens for'' Helicobacter pylori'' eradication or cure are taken from the guidelines developed by the American College of Gastroenterology as follows:''*PPI = proton pump inhibitor; pcn = ''penicillin''; p.o. = orally; q.d. = daily; b.i.d. = twice daily; t.i.d. = three times daily; q.i.d. = four times daily.''A recent investigation reported that triple therapy of either ''levofloxacin'' (''Levaquin'') or ''rifabutin'' in combination with amoxicillin and esomeprazole yielded cure rates of 90% and 88.6%. The treatments lasted 10 to 12 days respectively (10 days of levofloxacin 20=50 mg b.i.d. or rifabutin 150 mg q.d. for 12 days. Amoxicillin dose was 1 gm, esomeprazole was 40 mg, both b.i.d.).''Some doctors may want to confirm eradication of ''H. pylori'' after treatment with a urea breath test or a stool antigen test, particularly if there have been serious complications of the infection such as perforation or bleeding in the stomach or duodenum. Endoscopic biopsies to determine eradication of the bacterium are not necessary, and blood tests are not good for determining eradication since it takes many months or years for the antibodies to ''H. pylori'' to decrease. The best tests for determining eradication are the breath and stool tests discussed previously. Patients who fail to eradicate ''H. pylori'' with treatment are retreated, often with a different combination of medications. Also, a meta-analysis study of patients started on low-dose aspirin showed less than 20% were tested for H. pylori; this is concerning because low-dose aspirin roughly doubles the risk factors for getting an upper GI bleed in individuals with H. pylori infection.'   a PPI, amoxicillin (Amoxil), and clarithromycin (Biaxin) a PPI, metronidazole (Flagyl), tetracycline, and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, Bismuth) Standard dose of a *PPI (proton pump inhibitor) *b.i.d.

What natural treatments cure H. pylori infection?,"'There are many claims about natural treatment and cures for ''H. pylori'' infection. None of these have been scientifically proven to cure ''H. pylori'' infection, and include''Discuss all natural herbs and ''supplements'' with your doctor before taking them.''Nutritionists and health care professionals suggest avoiding spicy foods, coffee, carbonated ''drinks'', and pickled foods as these may increase the symptoms associated with the infection.' mastic gum, broccoli, matuka tea, manuka honey, coconut oil, and many others."
Does everyone have H. pylori bacteria in their stomach?,"'There is a general consensus among doctors that individuals should be treated if they are infected with ''H. pylori'"" and have ulcers. The goal of treatment is to eradicate the bacterium, heal ulcers if they are present, and prevent the ulcers' return. Patients with MALT lymphoma of the stomach also should be treated. MALT lymphoma is rare, but the ""'tumor'' often quickly regresses upon successful eradication of ''H. pylori''.''There currently is no formal recommendation to treat patients infected with ''H. pylori'' without ulcers or MALT lymphoma. Since antibiotic combinations can have side effects, and stomach cancers are infrequent in the United States, some health care professionals feel that the risks of treatment to eradicate ''H. pylori'' in patients without symptoms or ulcers may not justify the unproven benefits of treatment for the purpose of preventing ''stomach cancer''. On the other hand, ''H. pylori'' infection is known to cause atrophic gastritis (chronic inflammation of the stomach leading to atrophy of the inner lining of the stomach). Some doctors believe that atrophic gastritis can lead to cell changes (intestinal metaplasia) that can be precursors to stomach ''cancer''. Studies have also shown that eradication of ''H. pylori'' may reverse atrophic gastritis. Thus, some doctors are recommending treatment of ulcer- and symptom-free patients infected with ''H. pylori''.''Many physicians believe that ''dyspepsia'' (non-ulcer symptoms associated with meals) may be associated with infection with ''H. pylori''. Although it is not clear if ''H. pylori'' causes the dyspepsia, many doctors will test patients with dyspepsia for infection with ''H. pylori'' and treat them if infection is present.''Scientists studying the genetics of ''H. pylori'' have found different ''strains'' (types) of the bacterium. Some strains of ''H. pylori'' appear to be more prone to cause ulcers and stomach cancer. Meta-analysis of ''H. pylori'' eradication treatment seems to reduce ''gastric cancer'' risk. Further research in this area may help doctors to intelligently select those patients who need treatment. Vaccination against ''H. pylori'' is unlikely to be available in the near future.' "
Can you prevent H. pylori infections?,"'With at least 50% of the world population having detectable ''H. pylori'' in their stomachs, it seems likely that with no vaccine available, it will be very difficult or impossible for people to have no exposure to these bacteria. The chance of the organisms causing symptomatic infection is low, but certainly not absent. Currently, suggestions have been made to prevent ulcers, but the effectiveness of these recommendations are unknown. The following is a list of recommendations to help prevent ulcers:''Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent either the infection or colonization of the stomach by ''H pylori''. However, research is ongoing, and the NIH is funding vaccine studies in conjunction with vaccine makers (For example, Helicovax to prevent ''H. pylori'' colonization of human GI tracts by EpiVax, Inc.). Moreover, some nutritionists suggest that a ''diet'' high in fruits and vegetables, and low in ''sugar'' may help reduce or stop ''H. pylori'' infection. In many individuals, the immune response to infection is ineffective and leads to life-long infection.' Reduce or stop the intake of alcohol. Stop smoking. For pain control, use acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) instead of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Avoid caffeine in coffee and many ""power"" drinks. Check for GI symptoms and treat immediately during or after radiation therapy. Identify and reduce or avoid stress. Wash hands with uncontaminated water to avoid contracting the bacterium. If infected with H. pylori, antimicrobial treatment may prevent ulcer formation and extension of disease."
What is the prognosis for H. pylori infections? What if it is not  treated?,"'Many infections are mild and produce few, if any, symptoms. The prognosis of these infections is excellent. Patients with more serious symptoms who are treated appropriately usually have a good prognosis although up to 20% may have reoccurrence of the infection. Those with ulcers who have effective eradication of their infection heal their ulcers well (with usually minor scarring in the tissue).''Untreated and severe infections have a more guarded prognosis because extensive damage can occur with bleeding, scarring, anemia, and ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure'') occurring. Some patients with these symptoms will die if not treated quickly. About 1% of people with the infection go on to develop gastric cancer. Researchers have suggested that it may be possible to use special inhibitors that will block the bacteria from adhering to the lining of the stomach gastric tissue.' "
Who is at risk for H pylori infection?,"'In developing countries, you have greater chances of getting an H pylori infection during your childhood. You are at risk for H pylori infection if''In the United States and other developed countries, H pylori infections are more common in adults.' You live in crowded homes. You live in places where there is no reliable supply of clean water. You live in a developing country (since there are problems with sanitation, most people get affected before age 10). You live with someone who has an H pylori infection. Hispanics and African-Americans have a higher rate of infection than Caucasians. This may point to the genetic susceptibility of H pylori to certain people."
What are the symptoms of H pylori infection?,'H pylori infection can give rise to one or more of the following symptoms:' Nausea Vomiting Bloating Abdominal pain or discomfort (mostly in the upper abdomen) Heartburn (burning sensation in the chest) Diarrhea Hunger in the morning Halitosis (bad breath)
Which tests are used to diagnose H pylori infection?,"'The most common tests used to diagnose H pylori are:' Urea breath tests: You will be asked to drink a specialized solution and then blow through a straw into a glass tube. After that, your breath will be tested. The presence of carbon molecules in the breath makes the test positive (H pylori infection is present). Stool tests: Stool antigen tests are used to detect H pylori proteins in the stool. Blood tests: Certain blood tests can help identify if you have an active infection or have been previously infected."
What is the best treatment for H pylori infection?,"'The most effective treatment for H pylori often involves taking several medications for 2 weeks and is known as triple therapy. These medications include:''The best treatment regimens may differ from patient to patient depending on the ''antibiotic resistance''.''Successful treatment of H pylori can help in the healing of the ulcer, prevent the recurrence of ulcers, and reduce the risk of ulcer complications (like bleeding). To get maximum results from H pylori treatment, it is important to take the entire course of all medications.' A proton pump inhibitor: Some examples include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), and rabeprazole (AcipHex) Two different antibiotics (Metronidazole and Tetracycline or Metronidazole and Amoxicillin) Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol)"
What is the urea breath test?,"'The urea breath test (UBT) is a test for diagnosing the presence of a bacterium, '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'') infection in the stomach. ''H. pylori'' causes inflammation, ulcers, and atrophy of the stomach. The test also may be used to demonstrate that ''H. pylori'' has been eliminated by treatment with antibiotics.'  "
What is the preparation for the urea breath test? How is it performed?,"'Your\xa0doctor or other health care professional will provide you with instructions to prepare for the urea breath test.''During the test you will swallow a capsule containing urea, which is made from an isotope of carbon. (Isotopes of carbon occur in minuscule amounts in nature, and can be measured with special testing machines.) If ''H. pylori'' is present in the stomach, the urea is broken up and turned into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is absorbed across the lining of the stomach and into the blood. It then travels in the blood to the ''lungs'' where it is excreted in the breath. Samples of exhaled breath are collected, and the isotopic carbon in the exhaled carbon dioxide is measured.' "
How does the urea breath test diagnose H. pylori infection?,"'The urea breath test is based on the ability of ''H. pylori'' to break down urea, a chemical made up of nitrogen and carbon into carbon dioxide. which then is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated in the breath. (Urea normally is produced by the body from excess or ""waste"" nitrogen-containing chemicals and then eliminated in the urine.)' "
How are the results of the urea breath test interpreted?,"'If the urea breath test is positive and the isotope is detected in the breath, it means that ''H. pylori'' is present in the stomach. If the isotope is not found in the breath, the test results are negative for the infection.''When the ''H. pylori'' is effectively treated (eradicated) by antibiotics, the test changes from positive (isotope present) to negative (isotope absent).' "
"Are there any side effects, risks, or complications of the urea breath test?","'There are no side effects, risks, or complications of the urea breath test. You do not need to stop taking medications, including ''proton pump inhibitors'' (''PPIs''), prior to having the procedure performed by a doctor.'  "
What is a hepatic hemangioma?,"'Hepatic hemangiomas are thought to be present in as many as 7% of healthy people.  Hemangiomas are four to six times more common in women than in men. Female hormones may promote the formation and growth of hemangiomas.  Hemangiomas, although referred to as tumors,are not ''malignant'' and do not become cancerous.  Hemangiomas are not unique to the ''liver'' and can occur almost anywhere in the body.' "
What are the symptoms of a hepatic hemangioma?,"'Hemangiomas usually are small, measuring only a quarter inch in diameter, but they can be several inches in diameter or even larger. The vast majority of hemangiomas of the liver never causesymptoms or health problems.   Most hepatic hemangiomas are discoveredincidentally at the time of testing for unrelated medical problems, most commonly with ''ultrasound'' imaging or CT (''computerized tomography'')scanning of the abdomen.  Very large hemangiomas can cause symptoms, especially if they arepositioned near other organs.  ''Pain'', ''nausea'', or enlargement of theliver can occur.  Rarely, larger hemangiomas can rupture, causing severe ''pain'' and bleeding into the abdomen that may be severe or even life threatening.' "
How is the diagnosis of a hepatic hemangioma made?,"'When a ''hemangioma'' is suspected, the challenge forthe health care professional, is to be sure that it is in fact a hemangioma and not another type of ''tumor'', particularly a malignant one. With specialized tests,however, doctors can  reassure patients that the tumor is with little doubt a hemangioma.  Such special testing may include scintigraphy (using a tiny amount of aradioactive substance to identify the hemangioma), CT scanning, or ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'').  In general, a biopsy of suspected hemangiomas is avoided because of their benign nature and the potentialrisk of bleeding from the biopsy.  '  "
What is the treatment for hepatic hemangioma?,"'The vast majority of hepatichemangiomas require no treatment.  If a hepatic hemangioma islarge, especially if it is causing symptoms, surgical removal is an option.'  "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient. ' "
What is the hematocrit?,"'The hematocrit is the proportion, by volume, of the blood that consists of ''red blood cells''. The hematocrit (hct) is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means that there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.' "
How is the hematocrit measured?,"'The hematocrit is typically measured from a blood sample by an automated machine that makes several other measurements of the blood at the same time. Most of these machines in fact do not directly measure the hematocrit, but instead calculate it based on the determination of the amount of ''hemoglobin'' and the average volume of the red blood cells. The hematocrit can also be determined by a manual method using a centrifuge. When a tube of blood is centrifuged, the ''red cells'' will be packed into the bottom of the tube. The proportion of red cells to the total blood volume can then be visually measured.' "
What is a normal hematocrit ranges by ages?,"'The normal ranges for hematocrit are depended on the age and, after adolescence, the sex of the individual. The normal ranges are:''These values may vary slightly among different laboratories.' "
What does a low hematocrit mean?,"'A person who has a low hematocrit is referred to as being ''anemic''. There are many reasons for ''anemia''. Some of the more common reasons are' loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, and colon cancer), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by cancer, suppression by chemotherapy drugs, kidney failure), and abnormal hemoglobin (sickle cell anemia)."
What does a high hematocrit mean?,"'Higher than normal hematocrit levels represent abnormally elevated red blood cell counts.''Some other infrequent causes of an elevated hematocrit are' High hematocrits can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in chronic smokers. Dehydration produces a falsely high hematocrit that disappears when the proper fluid balance is restored. lung disease, certain tumors, a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera, and abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for ""blood doping"" purposes."
What is a hematoma?,"'A hematoma is an abnormal collection of blood outside of a blood vessel. It occurs because the wall of a blood vessel wall, artery, vein, or capillary, has been damaged and blood has leaked into tissues where it does not belong. The hematoma may be tiny, with just a dot of blood, or it can be large and cause significant swelling.''The blood vessels in the body are under constant repair. Minor injuries occur routinely and the body is usually able to repair the damaged vessel wall by activating the blood clotting cascade and forming fibrin patches. Sometimes the repair fails if the damage is extensive and the large defect allows for continued bleeding. If there is great pressure within the blood vessel, for example, a major artery, the blood will continue to leak through the damaged wall and the hematoma will expand.''Blood that escapes from within a blood vessel is very irritating to the surrounding tissue and may cause symptoms of inflammation including ''pain'', swelling, and redness. Symptoms of a hematoma depend upon their location, their size, and whether they cause associated swelling or ''edema''.''Hematomas may occur anywhere in the body. Regardless of how a hematoma is described or where it is located, it remains a collection of clotted blood outside of a blood vessel.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of a hematoma?,"'Hematomas cause irritation and inflammation. Symptoms of a hematoma depend upon their location, and whether the size of the hematoma or the associated swelling and inflammation cause nearby structures to be affected.''The common symptoms of inflammation from hematoma include:'   redness, tenderness, warmth, pain, and swelling."
What is the most common cause hematomas?,"'Trauma'' is the most common cause of a hematoma. When people think of ''trauma'', they generally think of car accidents, falls, ''head injuries'', broken bones, and gunshot wounds. Trauma to tissue also may be caused by an aggressive sneeze or an unexpected twist of an arm or leg. When a blood vessel is damaged, blood leaks into the surrounding tissue; this blood tends to coagulate or clot. The greater the amount of bleeding that occurs, the larger the amount of clot (hematoma) formation.' "
What conditions and medications cause hematomas?,"'Conditions that cause hematomas include:' Aneurysm Medications: Blood thinners or anticoagulation medications, including warfarin (Coumadin), aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) may increase the potential for spontaneous bleeding and for hematomas to expand because the body cannot efficiently repair blood vessels. This allows blood to continually leak through the damaged areas. Diseases or conditions that may decrease the number of platelets in the bloodstream (thrombocytopenia) or diminish their function: Viral infections (rubella, parvovirus, mumps, chickenpox, HIV, and hepatitis C), aplastic anemia, cancers from other organs, long-term alcohol abuse, and vitamin D deficiency may be associated with hematomas. Orthopedic injuries: Fractures are always associated with hematomas at the fracture site. Fractures of long bones such as the thigh (femur) and upper arm (humerus) can be associated with a significant amount of bleeding."
What are other conditions that cause hematomas?," Pelvic bone fractures: These breaks can also bleed significantly since it takes a large amount of force to break these bones and nearby veins and arteries also are frequently damaged. Menstruation: During menstruation, blood can accumulate in the vagina as part of the normal menses and, instead of flowing out immediately, it may form small blood clots. Pregnancy: Vaginal bleeding and passing blood clots or hematomas while pregnant are not normal and are reasons to seek immediate medical attention. Labor and delivery: Passing blood clots after delivering a baby is relatively common."
What are the types of hematomas?,"'Hematomas are often described based upon their location. The most dangerous hematomas are those that occur inside the skull. Because the skull is an enclosed container, anything that takes up space increases pressure within and potentially impairs the ability of the brain to function.' "
What are epidural and subdural hematomas?,"'Epidural hematomas'' occur because of trauma, often to the temple, where the middle meningeal artery is located. Bleeding accumulates in the epidural space, outside the ""dura"" which is the lining of the brain. Because of the way the dura is attached to the skull, small hematomas can cause significant pressure and ''brain injury''.''Subdural hematomas'' also occur because of trauma but the injury is usually to the veins in the brain. This causes a slower leak of blood, which enters the ""subdural"" space below the dura. The space below the dura has much more room for blood to accumulate before brain function suffers. As people age, they lose some brain tissue and the subdural space is relatively larger. Bleeding into the subdural space may be very slow, gradually stop, and not cause acute symptoms. These “chronic” subdural hematomas are often found incidentally on ''computerized tomography'' (CT) scans as part of a patient evaluation for ''confusion'' or because another traumatic incident occurred. However, subdural hematomas may be large, cause associated brain swelling, and may be lethal.' "
What are intracerebral and scalp hematomas?,"'Intracerebral hematomas'' occur within the brain tissue itself. Intracerebral hematomas may be due to bleeding from uncontrolled ''high blood pressure'', an ''aneurysm'' leak or rupture, trauma, ''tumor'', or ''stroke''.''Scalp'' hematomas'' occur on the outside of the skull, and often can be felt as a bump on the head. Because the injury is to the skin and muscle layers outside of the skull, the ''scalp'' hematoma itself cannot press on the brain.' "
What are ear and nasal hematomas?,"'Ear hematomas'"" may occur if an injury causes bleeding to the outside helix or cartilage structure of the ear. Often called boxer's ear, wrestler's ear, or ""'cauliflower ear'', blood becomes trapped between the thin layer of skin and the cartilage itself. Since the ear cartilage gets its blood supply directly from the overlying skin, a hematoma can decrease blood flow causing parts of the cartilage to shrivel and die. This results in a bumpy, deformed ''outer ear'' called a ""''cauliflower ear''.""''Septal hematomas'' occur with nasal trauma. A septal hematoma may form associated with a broken nose. If not recognized and treated, the cartilage can break down and cause a perforation of the septum.' "
What are intramuscular and subungual hematomas?,"'Intramuscular hematomas'' can be very painful due to the amount of swelling and inflammation. Some muscles are surrounded by tough bands of tissue. If enough bleeding occurs, the pressure within these compartments can increase to the point that ""''compartment syndrome''"" can occur. In this situation, the blood supply of the muscle is compromised and the muscle and other structures such as nerves can be permanently damaged. This is most commonly seen in the lower leg and forearm. ''Compartment syndrome'' may also be seen as a complication of fractures. This is a true surgical emergency and medical care should be accessed immediately if ''compartment syndrome'' is suspected. For the health care professional, one clue to think of the diagnosis is finding a patient whose pain is out of proportion to the physical findings.''Subungual hematomas'' are the result of crush injuries to the fingers or toes. Bleeding from a subungual hematoma occurs under the fingernail or toenail and since it is trapped, pressure builds causing pain. Trephination, or drilling a hole through the nail to remove the ''blood clot'', relieves the pressure and resolves the injury. Over time, the nail repairs itself.' "
What are subcutaneous and intra-abdominal hematomas?,"'Subcutaneous hematomas'' are ''bruises'' and ''contusions'' of the skin (ecchymosis). These occur due to trauma or injuries to the superficial blood vessels under the skin. Individuals who take ''anticoagulant'' medication are more prone to subcutaneous hematomas.''Intra-abdominal hematomas'' and hemorrhage may be due to a variety of injuries or illnesses. Regardless of how the blood gets into the abdomen, the clinical finding is ''peritonitis'' (irritation of the lining of the abdomen). Hematomas may occur in solid organs such as the liver, spleen, or kidney. They may occur within the walls of the bowel, including the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) or the ''large intestine'' (colon). Hematomas may also form within the lining of the abdomen called the peritoneum or behind the peritoneum in the retroperitoneal space (retro=behind).' "
Can a hematoma resolve (go away) without treatment?,"'In general, superficial hematomas of the skin, soft tissue, and muscle tend to resolve over time.' The initial firm texture of the blood clot gradually becomes more spongy and soft as the body breaks down the blood clot, and the shape changes as the fluid drains away and the hematoma flattens. The color changes from that of a purplish-blue bruise to yellow and brown as the blood chemicals gradually are metabolized and the hematoma resolves. Depending upon its location, the discolorations may travel through different tissue planes by gravity. For example, a forehead hematoma may cause bruising beneath the eyes and seems to travel to the neck as it resolves over time. Intracranial, epidural, subdural, and intracerebral hematomas often need neurosurgical intervention to stabilize the injury."
When should you call a doctor for a hematoma?,"'Most hematomas are due to minor trauma and the person is aware of the injury, knows what part of the body was injured, and can expect to recover with few problems.''Some hematomas may be more serious because of their location. Usually symptoms are caused by the nearby affected areas. Seek medical care in the following situations (this list is not exhaustive):' A person with a head injury with accompanying headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, muscle weakness, vision changes, or difficulty being aroused should seek immediate medical attention. People taking blood thinners are at increased risk for significant bleeding from even minor injuries. It is often wise for these people to seek medical attention if they are involved in even minor accidents or sustain minor injuries. Blood clots in the urine require prompt evaluation."
How are hematomas diagnosed?,"'Hematomas of the skin and soft tissues, such as muscle and joints, are often diagnosed by physical examination alone.''For patients exhibiting signs of ''internal bleeding'', the health care professional will decide what imaging modality is best to evaluate the situation. Plain ''X-rays'' may be needed to assess for bone ''fracture''. Patients with significant ''head injury'' often require ''CT scans''. ''Ultrasound'' is the testing modality of choice for females who are ''pregnant''.'  "
What is the treatment for hematomas?,"'Hematomas of the skin and soft tissues are often treated with rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE). Some health care professionals may advocate heat as another treatment alternative. The pain of a hematoma is usually due to the inflammation surrounding the blood and may be treated with ''over-the-counter'' pain medications. The choice of medication depends upon the underlying health of the patient. For those patients who are taking anticoagulation medications, ''ibuprofen'' is relatively contraindicated (not recommended) because of the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with ''liver disease'' should not take over-the-counter ''acetaminophen''. When in doubt, it is wise to ask the health care professional or pharmacist for a recommendation.''Treatment for hematomas involving other organs in the body depends upon what organ system is involved. In these cases, treatment will be tailored to the specific situation.'  "
How serious are hematomas?,"'Hematomas cause swelling and inflammation. Often the inflammation and swelling cause irritation of adjacent organs and tissues, and cause the symptoms and complications of a hematoma.\xa0One common complication of all hematomas is the risk of infection. While the hematoma is made of old blood, it has no blood supply itself and therefore is at risk for colonization with bacteria.' "
Can hematomas be prevented?,"'Accidents happen and most hematomas are inevitable once the trauma has occurred.''For patients taking anticoagulation medications, it is wise to avoid participating in events with high risk of injury. For patients taking ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), it is important to make certain that the dosing is appropriate and the blood is not thinned excessively.' "
What is a hematoma? What is a bruise?,"'A ''hematoma'' is a localized collection of blood in the tissues of the body outside of the blood vessels.''Also called a ''contusion'' or “black and blue mark,” a bruise is a discoloration of the skin that is a result of leakage of blood from capillaries into the skin.' "
What are causes and risk factors for bruises and hematomas?,"'Bruises'' and hematomas most commonly result from injury to the tissues. The tissue injury may be mild or severe. Risk factors for developing ''bruises'' or hematomas include:''The conditions that cause severe inability to coagulate blood properly (thrombocytopenia, bone marrow diseases, Von Willebrand disease, and others) can cause spontaneous ''bruising'' and hematomas without tissue injury from ''trauma''.''Bruising'' occurs more commonly with ''aging'', especially with a significant history of repeated sun damage to the skin.'   Contact sports (including soccer, football, basketball, rugby, lacrosse, and others) Gardening Slipping, falling, and tripping Abnormal compression on the skin Hypodermic needle injections Blood drawing Cupping treatments Blood thinning medications (aspirin, warfarin/Coumadin) Conditions or diseases resulting in diminished ability to coagulate blood properly (thrombocytopenia, bone marrow diseases, Von Willebrand disease, and others)"
What are signs and symptoms of a hematoma or a bruise?,"'Hematomas may or may not be associated with symptoms, such as localized ''pain'' and tenderness. Because a hematoma often does not directly involve the skin, it may not have any visible appearance, or it may be associated with a tender raised area under the skin. If the hematoma is in an internal organ, it will not be visible. If a hematoma is seriously affecting an organ, that organ may have impaired function. For example, a hematoma in the brain can cause ''paralysis''; a hematoma in the kidney may cause decreased kidney function.''A bruise will always appear in the skin as a localized area of discoloration. Originally, a bruise may appear bluish, blackish blue, or purple. Eventually, its color usually evolves to brownish, then light green as it fades. A bruise may or may not be tender. A typical sign of a bruise in the skin is that it does not blanch when pressed. Sometimes bruises are associated with tears in the skin.' "
When to seek medical care for hematoma or bruise,"'Seek medical care for any hematoma or spontaneous bruising that occurs without any known cause, so a health care professional can determine whether you have a serious underlying medical condition.''Both minor hematomas and bruising are common results of activities from daily living and usually require no specific treatment, other than avoiding reinjury.' "
What specialists treat hematomas and bruises?,'All general medicine and family medicine specialists treat hematomas and bruises. Other health care professionals who treat hematomas and bruises include:''The specialists who are involved with treating hematomas and bruising often depends on any associated symptoms and whether internal organs have injury.' Urgent care specialists Emergency room doctors General surgeons Neurosurgeons Dermatologists Nurse practitioners and nurses Internal medicine specialists Pediatricians
How do doctors diagnose hematomas and bruises?,"'Doctors can often diagnose hematomas located in the tissues just beneath the skin in the office during the history and physical examination. Swelling or tenderness in a local area can indicate a hematoma. Hematomas deeper in the body and in organs, such as the brain or spleen, can require radiologic imaging tests to detect them. These tests include ''CT scans'', ''MRI'' scans, and others.''Doctors diagnose bruises clinically during the history and physical examination based on the characteristic discolored, non-blanching appearance of the skin.' "
What are the treatments for hematomas and bruises?,"'Hematomas may not require any specific treatment, and the body eventually will biologically resorb the collection of blood over time. Initial treatment of a superficial hematoma can include ''cold'' compression. Later treatment, after all bleeding (hemorrhaging) has stopped, may include warm compresses to help reabsorbing the blood in the tissues. Serious hematomas, especially those affecting organs, can require surgical drainage to relieve pressure on the injured tissues. Occasionally, superficial hematomas under the skin can leave a fluid-filled sac, referred to as a ''seroma'', after the body has biologically resorbed the blood. Seromas can also require a drainage procedure, either with a needle and syringe or via surgical operation.''Bruises only require avoiding reinjury and protection of involved skin. If there are associated skin tears, you can use topical antibiotics and a bandage.' "
What is the prognosis for hematoma and bruise?,"'The prognosis of hematomas and bruises is usually good.\xa0The prognosis can be serious if internal organs are injured or if the hematoma or bruising occurs spontaneously without injury, as this can represent a serious underlying medical condition.' "
How to prevent hematoma and bruise,"'To prevent hematoma and bruise, avoid physical trauma.' "
What is blood in the urine (hematuria)?,"'Hematuria, or blood in the urine, can be either gross (visible) or microscopic (blood cells only visible through a microscope). Gross hematuria can vary widely in appearance, from light pink to deep red with clots. Although the amount of blood in the urine may be different, the types of conditions that can cause the problem are the same, and require the same kind of workup or evaluation.''People with gross hematuria will visit their doctor with this as a primary complaint. People who have microscopic hematuria, on the other hand, will be unaware of a problem and their condition will most commonly be detected as part of a periodic checkup by a primary-care physician.'  "
What are the causes of blood in the urine?,"'The causes of gross and microscopic hematuria are similar and may result from bleeding anywhere along the urinary tract. One cannot readily distinguish between blood originating in the kidneys, ureters (the tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder), bladder, or urethra. Any degree of blood in the urine should be fully evaluated by a physician, even if it resolves spontaneously.''Infection of the urine, (often called a ''urinary tract infection'' or ''UTI'') stemming either from the kidneys or bladder, is a common cause of microscopic hematuria. Urine is naturally sterile and should not contain bacteria. Kidney and bladder stones can cause irritation and ''abrasion'' of the urinary tract, leading to microscopic or gross hematuria. ''Trauma'' affecting any of the components of the urinary tract or the prostate can lead to ''bloody urine'"". Hematuria can also be associated with renal (kidney) disease, as well as hematologic disorders involving the body's clotting system. Medications that increase the risk of bleeding, such as ""'aspirin'', ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), or clopidogrel (''Plavix''), may also lead to bloody urine. Lastly, ''cancer'' anywhere along the urinary tract can present with hematuria.'  "
What tests diagnose the causes of blood in the urine?,"'The evaluation for blood in urine consists of taking a history, performing a physical examination, evaluating the urine with a chemical test strip and under a microscope, and obtaining a culture of the urine to identify any bacteria present. Lower urinary tract symptoms, such as urgency (feeling a strong need to urinate) and frequency (needing to urinate frequently), as well as burning or ''pain'' when urinating, the presence of ''fever'' or ''chills'', are suggestive of infection. Recent trauma, even if believed by the patient to have been inconsequential, should be considered as a potential cause. Abdominal or flank ''pain'', especially if radiating to the inguinal or the genital area, may suggest ureteral or\xa0''kidney stones''. All recent medications, including ''vitamins'' or herbal ''supplements'', should be reviewed with the health-care professional. However, it is important to note that even if the patient has been taking a medication that is associated with bleeding, a full workup (as listed below) should still be undertaken.''The physical exam will focus on possible sources of hematuria. ''Bruising'' over the back or abdomen may indicate trauma. A digital rectal exam should be performed, especially in males, as findings consistent with ''prostatitis'' (for example, tenderness on palpation of the prostate) or an ''enlarged prostate'' suggestive of ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' (''BPH''), may be useful in making a diagnosis. The finding of a nodule or an area of induration (hardening) of the prostate may be indicative of ''cancer''. A repeat ''urinalysis'', as well as a urine culture, should be obtained. The presence of white blood cells on urinalysis is more consistent with a ''urinary tract infection''. Protein, glucose, or sediment in the urine may indicate the presence of a disease of the kidneys. Blood tests are also important, as they will aid in assessing renal function and identifying any clotting abnormalities.''In addition to the basic history and physical exam, there are three additional components for any workup of hematuria: imaging, urine cytology, and cystoscopy.''The CT scan is an imaging evaluation of the urinary tract. Prior to the procedure, the patient ''drinks'' an oral contrast agent and a dye is injected intravenously. The patient then goes through the CT scan machine and images are taken of the abdomen and pelvis. Another test that can be performed, the intravenous pyelogram (IVP), is also a type of X-ray evaluation of the urinary tract. In this procedure, a dye is injected into the veins, and this is filtered by the urinary tract. A series of ''X-rays'' are then taken over a 30-minute period to look for abnormalities. The CT scan is more commonly performed than the IVP to evaluate the urinary tract and should be considered the test of choice. Both of these studies are especially useful for evaluating the kidneys and ureters, but not the bladder, prostate, or urethra. Therefore, a second examination called a cystoscopy is necessary. This is a simple 10-minute procedure using a thin, flexible cystoscope (or fiberoptic camera), which is inserted via the urethra into the bladder to directly visualize any lesions or sources of bleeding. This is usually done with local anesthetic jelly injected into the urethra. Finally, urine cytology involves giving a urine sample to be analyzed by a pathologist for the presence of cancerous or abnormal-appearing cells.' "
What are the treatments for blood in the urine treated?,"'Treatments for hematuria vary widely and depend on the reason for the bleeding. It is important to note that quite often no cause is found for the hematuria. This should not be a source of major concern, however, since an appropriate workup effectively rules out the most serious causes of hematuria (for example, ''cancer''). In cases where a workup is negative and the cause of the hematuria remains unknown, observation with repeat urinalyses is a reasonable option. A blood test to check kidney function and a blood-pressure check should be done as well. Caucasian men over 50 should discuss with their doctor an annual prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test which is used to screen for ''prostate cancer''. Prostate screening in African Americans traditionally begins at age 45 and in all races, a history of ''prostate cancer'' in close family members may indicate an earlier start of screening.''Further discussion of the treatment for hematuria would depend upon the results of the workup and the exact cause for the hematuria. The ''urologist'' who performs this examination is responsible for recommending any further treatment or workup that would be necessary.''Previous contributing author: Mark H. Katz, MD'  "
Introduction to hemodialysis,"'Hemodialysis'' is the most common method used to treat advanced and permanent ''kidney failure''. Since the 1960s, when hemodialysis first became a practical treatment for ''kidney failure'"", we've learned much about how to make hemodialysis treatments more effective and minimize side effects. In recent years, more compact and simpler ""'dialysis'' machines have made home dialysis increasingly attractive. However, even with better procedures and equipment, hemodialysis is still a complicated and inconvenient therapy that requires a coordinated effort from your whole health care team, including your nephrologist, dialysis nurse, dialysis technician, dietitian, and social worker. The most important members of your health care team are you and your family. By learning about your treatment, you can work with your health care team to give yourself the best possible results, and you can lead a full, active life. ' "
When Your Kidneys Fail,"'Healthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, ''minerals'', and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. When your kidneys fail, harmful wastes build up in your body, your ''blood pressure'' may rise, and your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough ''red blood cells''. When this happens, you need treatment to replace the work of your failed kidneys. ' "
How Hemodialysis Works,"'In hemodialysis, your blood is allowed to flow, a few ounces at a time, through a special filter that removes wastes and extra fluids. The clean blood is then returned to your body. Removing the harmful wastes and extra salt and fluids helps control your blood pressure and keep the proper balance of chemicals like potassium and sodium in your body. ''One of the biggest adjustments you must make when you start hemodialysis treatments is following a strict schedule. Most patients go to a clinic-a dialysis center-three times a week for 3 to 5 or more hours each visit. For example, you may be on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule or a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule. You may be asked to choose a morning, afternoon, or evening shift, depending on availability and capacity at the dialysis unit. Your dialysis center will explain your options for scheduling regular treatments. ''Researchers are exploring whether shorter daily sessions, or longer sessions performed overnight while the patient sleeps, are more effective in removing wastes. Newer dialysis machines make these alternatives more practical with home dialysis. However, the federal government has not yet established a policy to pay for more than three hemodialysis sessions a week. ''Several centers around the country teach people how to perform their own hemodialysis treatments at home. A family member or friend who will be your helper must also take the training, which usually takes at least 4 to 6 weeks. Home dialysis gives you more flexibility in your dialysis schedule. With home hemodialysis, the time for each session and the number of sessions per week may vary, but you must maintain a regular schedule by giving yourself dialysis treatments as often as you would receive them in a dialysis unit. ' "
Adjusting to Changes,"'Even in the best situations, adjusting to the effects of kidney failure and the time you spend on dialysis can be difficult. Aside from the ""lost time,"" you may have less energy. You may need to make changes in your work or home life, giving up some activities and responsibilities. Keeping the same schedule you kept when your kidneys were working can be very difficult now that your kidneys have failed. Accepting this new reality can be very hard on you and your family. A counselor or social worker can answer your questions and help you cope. ''Many patients feel ''depressed'' when starting dialysis, or after several months of treatment. If you feel depressed, you should talk with your social worker, nurse, or doctor because this is a common problem that can often be treated effectively. ' "
Getting Your Vascular Access Ready,"'One important step before starting hemodialysis is preparing a vascular access, a site on your body from which your blood is removed and returned. A vascular access should be prepared weeks or months before you start dialysis. It will allow easier and more efficient removal and replacement of your blood with fewer complications. For more information about the different kinds of vascular accesses and how to care for them, see the National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) fact sheet ''Vascular Access for Hemodialysis''. ' "
Equipment and Procedures,"""When you first visit a hemodialysis center, it may seem like a complicated mix of machines and people. But once you learn how the procedure works and become familiar with the equipment, you'll be more comfortable. ""'The ''dialysis machine'' is about the size of a dishwasher. This machine has three main jobs: ''The dialyzer is a large canister containing thousands of small fibers through which your blood is passed. Dialysis solution, the cleansing fluid, is pumped around these fibers. The fibers allow wastes and extra fluids to pass from your blood into the solution, which carries them away. The dialyzer is sometimes called an artificial kidney. ''Dialysis solution, also known as dialysate, is the fluid in the dialyzer that helps remove wastes and extra fluid from your blood. It contains chemicals that make it act like a sponge. Your doctor will give you a specific dialysis solution for your treatments. This formula can be adjusted based on how well you handle the treatments and on your blood tests. '""Many people find the needle sticks to be one of the hardest parts of hemodialysis treatments. Most people, however, report getting used to them after a few sessions. If you find the needle insertion painful, an anesthetic cream or spray can be applied to the skin. The cream or spray will numb your skin briefly so you won't feel the needle. ""'Most dialysis centers use two needles-one to carry blood to the dialyzer and one to return the cleaned blood to your body. Some specialized needles are designed with two openings for two-way flow of blood, but these needles are less efficient and require longer sessions. Needles for high-flux or high-efficiency dialysis need to be a little larger than those used with regular dialyzers. ''Some people prefer to insert their own needles. You\'ll need training on inserting needles properly to prevent infection and protect your vascular access. You may also learn a ""ladder"" strategy for needle placement in which you ""climb"" up the entire length of the access session by session so that you don\'t weaken an area with a grouping of needle sticks. A different approach is the ""buttonhole"" strategy in which you use a limited number of sites but insert the needle back into the same hole made by the previous needle stick. Whether you insert your own needles or not, you should know these techniques to better care for your access. ' pump blood and watch flow for safety clean wastes from blood watch your blood pressure and the rate of fluid removal from your body Reuse. Your dialysis center may use the same dialyzer more than once for your treatments. Reuse is considered safe as long as the dialyzer is cleaned before each use. The dialyzer is tested each time to make sure it's still working, and it should never be used for anyone but you. Before each session, you should be sure that the dialyzer is labeled with your name and check to see that it has been cleaned, disinfected, and tested. "
Tests to See How Well Your Dialysis Is Working,"'About once a month, your dialysis care team will test your blood by using one of two formulas-URR or Kt/V-to see whether your treatments are removing enough wastes. Both tests look at one specific waste product, called blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as an indicator for the overall level of waste products in your system. For more information about these measurements, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Hemodialysis Dose and Adequacy''. ' "
Conditions Related to Kidney Failure and Their Treatments,"'Your kidneys do much more than remove wastes and extra fluid. They also make hormones and balance chemicals in your system. When your kidneys stop working, you may have problems with ''anemia'' and conditions that affect your bones, nerves, and skin. Some of the more common conditions caused by kidney failure are extreme ''tiredness'', bone problems, joint problems, ''itching'', and ""restless legs."" Restless legs will keep you awake as you feel them twitching and jumping. ''Anemia'"" is a condition in which the volume of red blood cells is low. Red blood cells carry oxygen to cells throughout the body. Without oxygen, cells can't use the energy from food, so someone with anemia may tire easily and look pale. Anemia can also contribute to ""'heart'' problems. ''Anemia is common in people with ''kidney disease'' because the kidneys produce the hormone ''erythropoietin'"", or EPO, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. Diseased kidneys often don't make enough EPO, and so the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells. EPO is available commercially and is commonly given to patients on dialysis. ""'For more information about the causes of and treatments for anemia in kidney failure, see the NIDDK fact sheet''Anemia in Kidney Disease and Dialysis''. ''The term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. ''Renal osteodystrophy'', or bone disease of kidney failure, affects 90 percent of dialysis patients. It causes bones to become thin and weak or formed incorrectly and affects both children and adults. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with kidney disease even before they start dialysis. Older patients and women who have gone through ''menopause'' are at greater risk for this disease. ''Many people treated with hemodialysis complain of ''itchy'' skin, which is often worse during or just after treatment. ''Itching'"" is common even in people who don't have kidney disease; in kidney failure, however, itching can be made worse by wastes in the bloodstream that current dialyzer membranes can't remove from the blood. ""'The problem can also be related to high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Some people have found dramatic relief after having their parathyroid glands removed. The four parathyroid glands sit on the outer surface of the thyroid gland, which is located on the windpipe in the base of your neck, just above the collarbone. The parathyroid glands help control the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood. ''A cure for itching that works for everyone has not been found. Phosphate binders seem to help some people; these medications act like sponges to soak up, or bind, phosphorus while it is in the stomach. Others find relief after exposure to ultraviolet light. Still others improve with EPO shots. A few ''antihistamines'' (''Benadryl'', Atarax, ''Vistaril'') have been found to help; also, capsaicin cream applied to the skin may relieve itching by deadening nerve impulses. In any case, taking care of ''dry skin'' is important. Applying creams with lanolin or camphor may help. ''Patients on dialysis often have ''insomnia'', and some people have a specific problem called the ''sleep apnea'' syndrome, which is often signaled by ''snoring'' and breaks in ''snoring''. Episodes of apnea are actually breaks in ''breathing'' during ''sleep''. Over time, these ''sleep'' disturbances can lead to ""day-night reversal"" (''insomnia'' at night, sleepiness during the day), ''headache'', ''depression'', and decreased alertness. The apnea may be related to the effects of advanced kidney failure on the control of breathing. Treatments that work with people who have ''sleep apnea'', whether they have kidney failure or not, include losing weight, changing sleeping position, and wearing a mask that gently pumps air continuously into the nose (nasal continuous positive ''airway'' pressure, or ''CPAP'').''Many people on dialysis have trouble sleeping at night because of aching, uncomfortable, jittery, or ""restless"" legs. You may feel a strong impulse to kick or thrash your legs. Kicking may occur during sleep and disturb a bed partner throughout the night. The causes of restless legs may include nerve damage or chemical imbalances. ''Moderate ''exercise'' during the day may help, but exercising a few hours before bedtime can make it worse. People with ''restless leg syndrome'' should reduce or avoid ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and tobacco; some people also find relief with massages or warm baths. A class of ''drugs'' called ''benzodiazepines'', often used to treat ''insomnia'' or ''anxiety'', may help as well. These prescription drugs include ''Klonopin'', ''Librium'', ''Valium'', and ''Halcion''. A newer and sometimes more effective therapy is levodopa (''Sinemet''), a drug used to treat '""Parkinson's""' disease. ''Sleep disorders'"" may seem unimportant, but they can impair your quality of life. Don't hesitate to raise these problems with your nurse, doctor, or social worker. ""'Dialysis-related ''amyloidosis'' (DRA) is common in people who have been on dialysis for more than 5 years. DRA develops when proteins in the blood deposit on joints and tendons, causing ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and fluid in the joints, as is the case with ''arthritis''. Working kidneys filter out these proteins, but dialysis filters are not as effective. ' "
How Diet Can Help,"""Eating the right foods can help improve your dialysis and your health. Your clinic has a dietitian to help you plan meals. Follow the dietitian's advice closely to get the most from your hemodialysis treatments. Here are a few general guidelines. ""'You can also ask your dietitian for ''recipes'' and titles of cookbooks for patients with kidney disease. Following the restrictions of a diet for kidney disease might be hard at first, but with a little creativity, you can make tasty and satisfying meals. For more information, see the NIDDK booklet''Eat Right to Feel Right on Hemodialysis''. '  Fluids. Your dietitian will help you determine how much fluid to drink each day. Extra fluid can raise your blood pressure, make your heart work harder, and increase the stress of dialysis treatments. Remember that many foods-such as soup, ice cream, and fruits-contain plenty of water. Ask your dietitian for tips on controlling your thirst.  Potassium. The mineral potassium is found in many foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Potassium affects how steadily your heart beats, so eating foods with too much of it can be very dangerous to your heart. To control potassium levels in your blood, avoid foods like oranges, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, and dried fruits. You can remove some of the potassium from potatoes and other vegetables by peeling and soaking them in a large container of water for several hours, then cooking them in fresh water. Phosphorus. The mineral phosphorus can weaken your bones and make your skin itch if you consume too much. Control of phosphorus may be even more important than calcium itself in preventing bone disease and related complications. Foods like milk and cheese, dried beans, peas, colas, nuts, and peanut butter are high in phosphorus and should be avoided. You'll probably need to take a phosphate binder with your food to control the phosphorus in your blood between dialysis sessions. Salt (sodium chloride). Most canned foods and frozen dinners contain high amounts of sodium. Too much of it makes you thirsty, and when you drink more fluid, your heart has to work harder to pump the fluid through your body. Over time, this can cause high blood pressure and congestive heart failure. Try to eat fresh foods that are naturally low in sodium, and look for products labeled ""low sodium."" Protein. Before you were on dialysis, your doctor may have told you to follow a low-protein diet to preserve kidney function. But now you have different nutritional priorities. Most people on dialysis are encouraged to eat as much high-quality protein as they can. Protein helps you keep muscle and repair tissue, but protein breaks down into urea (blood urea nitrogen, or BUN) in your body. Some sources of protein, called high-quality proteins, produce less waste than others. High-quality proteins come from meat, fish, poultry, and eggs. Getting most of your protein from these sources can reduce the amount of urea in your blood. Calories. Calories provide your body with energy. Some people on dialysis need to gain weight. You may need to find ways to add calories to your diet. Vegetable oils-like olive, canola, and safflower oils-are good sources of calories and do not contribute to problems controlling your cholesterol. Hard candy, sugar, honey, jam, and jelly also provide calories and energy. If you have diabetes, however, be very careful about eating sweets. A dietitian's guidance is especially important for people with diabetes. Supplements. Vitamins and minerals may be missing from your diet because you have to avoid so many foods. Dialysis also removes some vitamins from your body. Your doctor may prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement designed specifically for people with kidney failure. Take your prescribed supplement after treatment on the days you have hemodialysis. Never take vitamins that you can buy off the store shelf, since they may contain vitamins or minerals that are harmful to you. "
Financial Issues,"'Treatment for kidney failure is expensive, but Federal health insurance plans pay much of the cost, usually up to 80 percent. Often, private insurance or State programs pay the rest. Your social worker can help you locate resources for financial assistance. For more information, see the NIDDK fact sheet ''Financial Help for Treatment of Kidney Failure''. ' "
Hope Through Research,"'The NIDDK, through its Division of Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases, supports several programs and studies devoted to improving treatment for patients with progressive kidney disease and permanent kidney failure, including patients on hemodialysis. ''The U.S. Government does not endorse or favor any specific commercial product or company. Trade, proprietary, or company names appearing in this document are used only because they are considered necessary in the context of the information provided. If a product is not mentioned, the omission does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory. ' The End-Stage Renal Disease Program promotes research to reduce medical problems from bone, blood, nervous system, metabolic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and endocrine abnormalities in kidney failure and to improve the effectiveness of dialysis and transplantation. The research focuses on evaluating different hemodialysis schedules and on finding the most useful information for measuring dialysis adequacy. The program also seeks to increase kidney graft and patient survival and to maximize quality of life. The HEMO Study, completed in 2002, tested the theory that a higher dialysis dose and/or high-flux membranes would reduce patient mortality (death) and morbidity (medical problems). Doctors at 15 medical centers recruited more than 1,800 hemodialysis patients and randomly assigned them to high or standard dialysis doses and high- or low-flux filters. The study found no increase in the health or survival of patients who had a higher dialysis dose, who dialyzed with high-flux filters, or who did both. The U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) collects, analyzes, and distributes information about the use of dialysis and transplantation to treat kidney failure in the United States. The USRDS is funded directly by the NIDDK in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The USRDS publishes an Annual Data Report, which identifies the total population of people being treated for kidney failure; reports on incidence, prevalence, death rates, and trends over time; and develops data on the effects of various treatment approaches. The report also helps identify problems and opportunities for more focused special studies of renal research issues. The Hemodialysis Vascular Access Clinical Trials Consortium is conducting a series of multicenter, clinical trials of drug therapies to reduce the failure and complication rate of arteriovenous (AV) grafts and fistulas in hemodialysis. These studies are randomized and placebo controlled, which means the studies meet the highest standard for scientific accuracy. AV grafts and fistulas prepare the arteries and veins for regular dialysis. See the NIDDK fact sheet Vascular Access for Hemodialysis for more information. Recently developed drugs to prevent blood clots may be evaluated in these large clinical trials. "

What is dialysis?,"'The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood. Dialysis is a procedure that is a substitute for many of the normal functions of the kidneys. The kidneys are two organs located on either side in the back of the abdominal ''cavity''. Dialysis can allow individuals to live productive and useful lives, even though their kidneys no longer work adequately. Statistics from 2015, U.S. Renal Data System Annual Data Report (USRDS), showed approximately 468,000 patients were receiving dialysis in the United States. More than an additional 193,000 patients had a functioning kidney transplant for ''end stage renal disease''.'""Dialysis helps the body by performing the functions of failed kidneys. The kidney has many roles. An essential job of the kidney is to regulate the body's fluid balance. It does this by adjusting the amount of urine that is excreted on a daily basis. On hot days, the body sweats more. Thus, less water needs to be excreted through the kidneys. On ""'cold'"" days, the body sweats less. Thus, urine output needs to be greater in order to maintain the proper balance within the body. It is the kidney's job to regulate fluid balance by adjusting urine output.""'Another major duty of the kidney is to remove the waste products that the body produces throughout the day. As the body functions, cells use energy. The operation of the cells produces waste products that must be removed from the body. When these waste products are not removed adequately, they build up in the body. An elevation of waste products, as measured in the blood, is called ""azotemia."" When waste products accumulate they cause a sick feeling throughout the body called ""''uremia'',"" which is due to urea and other nitrogenous waste compounds.'  "
When do patients require dialysis?,"'When the kidneys fail to filter the blood effectively, and fluid and waste products build up in the body to a critical level a person may need to start dialysis. The two main causes of ''kidney failure'' and need for dialysis treatment are ''diabetes'' and ''high blood pressure''.''When a person’s levels of waste products in their body become so high they start to become sick from them, he or she may need dialysis. The level of the waste products usually builds up slowly. Doctors that specialize in diseases and conditions of the kidneys are called nephrologists. To help nephrologists decide when dialysis is necessary for a patient, he she will order tests that measure several blood chemical levels in the patient’s body. The two major blood chemical levels that are measured are the ""''creatinine'' level"" and the ""blood urea nitrogen"" (BUN) level. As these two levels rise, they are indicators of the decreasing ability of the kidneys to cleanse the body of waste products.''Doctors use a urine test, the ""creatinine clearance,"" to measure the level of kidney function. The patient saves urine in a special container for one full day. The waste products in the urine and in the blood are estimated by measuring the creatinine. By comparing the blood and urine level of this substance, the doctor has an accurate idea of how well the kidneys are working. This result is called the creatinine clearance. Usually, when the creatinine clearance falls to 1 below 10 cc/minute, the patient needs dialysis.'""The doctor also uses other indicators of the patient's status to decide about the need for dialysis. If the patient is experiencing a major inability to rid the body of excess water, or is complaining of problems with the ""'heart'', ''lungs'', or stomach, or difficulties with taste or sensation in their legs, dialysis may be indicated even though the creatinine clearance has not fallen to the 10 cc/minute level.' "
What are the types of dialysis? How do they work?,"'There are two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.''Hemodialysis uses an external machine and a special type of filter to remove excess waste products and water from the blood.'""During hemodialysis, blood passes from the patient's body to the ""'dialysis machine'' through sterile tubing and into a filter, called a dialysis membrane. For this procedure, the patient has a specialized vascular tube placed between an artery and a vein in the arm or leg (called a gortex graft). Sometimes, a direct connection is made between an artery and a vein in the arm. This procedure is called a Cimino fistula. Needles are then placed in the graft or fistula, and blood passes to the dialysis machine, through the filter, and back to the patient. If the patient requires dialysis before a graft or a fistula is placed, a large diameter catheter (hemodialysis catheter) is placed directly into a large vein in the neck or leg in order to perform dialysis. In the dialysis machine, a solution on the other side of the filter receives the waste products from the patient.'""Peritoneal dialysis uses a fluid that is placed into the patient's abdominal cavity through a ""'plastic'' tube (peritoneal dialysis catheter) to remove excess waste products and fluid from the body.''Peritoneal dialysis uses the patients own body tissues inside of the belly (abdominal cavity) to act as the filter. The abdominal cavity is lined with a special membrane called the peritoneal membrane. A plastic tube called a peritoneal dialysis catheter is placed through the abdominal wall into the abdominal cavity. A special fluid called dialysate is then flushed into the abdominal cavity and washes around the ''intestines''. The peritoneal membrane acts as a filter between this fluid and the blood stream. By using different types of solutions, waste products and excess water can be removed from the body through this process.' "
Where do I get dialysis treatment? How long does it take? How often do I have to get it?,"'Treatment for hemodialysis usually takes place in a hemodialysis unit. This is a special building that is equipped with machines that perform the dialysis treatment. The dialysis unit is also the place where patients can receive dietary counseling and help with social needs.'""Patients generally go to the dialysis unit three times a week for treatment. For example, the schedule is either Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Before treatment, patients weigh themselves so that excess fluid accumulated since the last dialysis session can be measured. Patients then go to assigned chairs that are like lounge chairs. The area of the graft or fistula (the connection between the artery and vein), is cleaned thoroughly. Two needles are then inserted into the graft or fistula. One takes the blood to the machine where it is cleaned. The other needle allows blood that is returning to the patient to go back into the patient's body.""""Treatments last from 2 ½ to 4 ½ hours. During this time, the dialysis staff checks the patient's ""'blood pressure'' frequently and adjusts the dialysis machine to ensure that the proper amount of fluid is being removed from the patients body. Patients can read, watch television, ''sleep'', or do other work during treatment. On occasion, patients who are very motivated may be able to perform dialysis themselves at home in a process called home hemodialysis.'""Peritoneal dialysis requires the patient to play a more active role in their dialysis treatment. Of primary importance is the patient's responsibility for maintaining a clean surface on the abdomen and catheter, where treatment is administered, in order to prevent infection.""""During this process, the patient weighs herself/himself to determine the strength of fluid to be used. The patient then puts on a mask and cleans the peritoneal catheter site. Fluid that has been allowed to stay in the peritoneal cavity while the peritoneal membrane filters waste into the fluid. The fluid and waste are is then drained back into the plastic bag that originally contained the fluid. The patient then disconnects this bag containing waste in the fluid and connects a new bag of solution that is allowed to drain into the peritoneal cavity. Once the fluid is in the body, the new bag is rolled up and placed in the patient's underwear until the next treatment. This procedure usually takes 30 minutes to accomplish and must be done four to five times a day.""'As an alternative to this treatment, some patients on peritoneal dialysis use a machine called a ""cycler."" This cycler is used every night. Five to six ''bags'' of dialysis fluid are used on the cycler and the machine automatically changes the fluid while the patient sleeps.' "
What are the advantages of the different types of dialysis?,"'Each of the two types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, has advantages and disadvantages. It is up to the patient and their kidney doctor to decide which of these procedures is best by considering her/his life style, other medical conditions, support systems, and how much responsibility and participation in the treatment program he/she desires. The patient must realize that because of their specific medical condition, they may not be a candidate for one or the other type of dialysis. Each patient must view the two types of dialysis procedures from her/his own perspective.''Regardless of which type of dialysis is chosen, patients have certain responsibilities such as following a ''diet'' program, watching their fluid intake, taking special ''vitamins'', and other medicines to control blood pressure and calcium and phosphorus balance.''For many patients, the major advantage of hemodialysis is minimal participation in the treatment. However, patients are required to adhere to a specific schedule and travel to the dialysis unit three times a week. Hemodialysis also requires stricter ''diet'' control and fluid control than peritoneal dialysis.''For those patients preferring more independence, peritoneal dialysis allows for more flexible scheduling and can be performed at home. The patient must undergo a certain amount of dialysis each day, but can alter the exact timing of the dialysis procedure.''A major problem with peritoneal dialysis is infection. The patient has a plastic tube that goes from the peritoneal cavity to the outside of the body and this is a potential site for the entry of bacteria into the body. Great emphasis is placed on cleanliness and technique during the training sessions.' "
What is the life expectancy for someone on dialysis?,"'The expected lifespan of a patient receiving dialysis in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) report was approximately 8 years for dialysis patients 40 to 44 years of age and approximately 4.5 years for those 60 to 64 years of age. This is a highly variable range that is dependent on many factors such as:''Some patients do dialysis as a ''bridge'' (time to locate an appropriate donor kidney) to getting a kidney transplant (renal transplant). If a patient is successful in getting a transplant and is able to stop dialysis, their survival prognosis increases greatly.' race, age of patient, quality of dialysis treatment, other medical issues in the patient (comorbidities), quality of pre-dialysis treatment, control of potassium levels, and overall compliance of the patient."
How can patients learn more about dialysis?,"'As a patient approaches dialysis, there are numerous sources of information. The doctor often has access to training videos that explain the dialysis techniques and their respective advantages and disadvantages.''Throughout the country are regional units of the ''National Kidney Foundation''. These can be contacted, either through your physician or by contacting local dialysis units.''The National Kidney Foundation''30 East 33rd St.''New York, NY 10016''(800) 622-9010''The ''American Association of Kidney Patients'' is an active association of patients and families involved with dialysis and a very good source of information.''American Association of Kidney Patients''3505 E.

What is hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in ''red blood cells'' that carries oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.""'Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. The normal adult hemoglobin (abbreviated Hgb or Hb) molecule contains two alpha-globulin chains and two beta-globulin chains. In fetuses and infants, beta chains are not common and the hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two gamma chains. As the infant grows, the gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains, forming the adult hemoglobin structure.''Each globulin chain contains an important iron-containing porphyrin compound termed heme. Embedded within the heme compound is an iron atom that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood.''Hemoglobin also plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells. In their natural shape, red blood cells are round with narrow centers resembling a donut without a hole in the middle. Abnormal hemoglobin structure can, therefore, disrupt the shape of red blood cells and impede their function and flow through blood vessels.' "
How is hemoglobin measured?,"'Hemoglobin is usually measured as a part of the routine ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') test from a blood sample.''Several methods exist for measuring hemoglobin, most of which are done currently by automated machines designed to perform different tests on blood. Within the machine, the red blood cells are broken down to get the hemoglobin into a solution. The free hemoglobin is exposed to a chemical containing cyanide that binds tightly with the hemoglobin molecule to form cyanomethemoglobin. By shining a light through the solution and measuring how much light is absorbed (specifically at a wavelength of 540 nanometers), the amount of hemoglobin can be determined.' "
What are normal hemoglobin values?,"'The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters.''The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are:''All of these values may vary slightly between laboratories. Some laboratories do not differentiate between adult and ""after middle age"" hemoglobin values. ''Pregnant'' females are advised to avoid both high and low hemoglobin levels to avoid increasing risks of stillbirths (high hemoglobin – above the normal range) and premature birth or low-birth-weight baby (low hemoglobin – below the normal range).' Newborns: 17 to 22 gm/dL One (1) week of age: 15 to 20 gm/dL One (1) month of age: 11 to 15 gm/dL Children: 11 to 13 gm/dL Adult males: 14 to 18 gm/dL Adult women: 12 to 16 gm/dL Men after middle age: 12.4 to 14.9 gm/dL Women after middle age: 11.7 to 13.8 gm/dL"
What does a low hemoglobin level mean?,"'A ''low hemoglobin level'' is referred to as ''anemia'' or low red blood count. A lower than normal number of red blood cells is referred to as ''anemia'' and hemoglobin levels reflect this number. There are many reasons (causes) for anemia.''Some of the more common causes of anemia are:' loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, colon cancer, or stomach ulcer), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by cancer), suppression by red blood cell synthesis bychemotherapy drugs, kidney failure, and abnormal hemoglobin structure (sickle cell anemia or thalassemia)."
What does a high hemoglobin level mean?,"'Higher than normal hemoglobin levels can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in people who smoke. ''Dehydration'' produces a falsely high hemoglobin measurement that disappears when proper fluid balance is restored.''Some other infrequent causes are high hemoglobin levels are:' advanced lung disease (for example, emphysema); certain tumors; a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera, and; abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for blood doping purposes (increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body by chemically raising the production of red blood cells)."
What is sickle cell disease?,"'Sickle cell disease'' is a genetic condition in which the quality of hemoglobin is defective. This condition can cause abnormal hemoglobin that can result in abnormally-shaped (sickled) red blood cells (see illustration). These abnormal red blood cells cannot easily pass through small blood vessels leading to inadequate oxygen for the tissues of the body.''Sickle cells also have a shorter life span than normal red blood cells (10 to 20 days compared to 120 days). This rapid turnover may result in inadequate time to replace the red blood cells and may result in anemia.''In ''sickle cell anemia'', one defective hemoglobin gene is ''inherited'' from each parent. If only one gene is inherited from one parent, then the condition is milder and referred to as sickle cell trait.''Symptoms of sickle cell anemia vary depending on its severity. Patients with sickle cell trait may experience mild, if any, symptoms at all. In sickle cell disease, symptoms are more significant, especially in episodes of acute crisis. These symptoms can include:' generalized body aches and pain, chest pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, ulceration of skin, fatigue, strokes, blindness, and delayed growth and puberty."
What is thalassemia?,"""Thalassemia is a group of hereditary conditions with quantitative hemoglobin deficiency. The body's failure to make globulin molecules will lead to a compensatory mechanism to make other less compatible globulin molecules. The different types of thalassemia are defined based on what type of globulin molecule is deficient. The severity of these conditions depends on the type of deficient globulin chain, the number of deficient globulins, and the severity of the underproduction. Mild disease may only present as mild anemia whereas severe deficiency may not be compatible with life."" "
What is the hemoglobin A1c test?,"'Hemoglobin A1c'' or glycosylated hemoglobin is a rough indication of blood ''sugar'' control in people with ''diabetes mellitus'' over the preceding 3 months. As more glucose (blood ''sugar'') circulates in the blood on a daily basis, more glucose is bound to the circulating hemoglobin. Normal hemoglobin A1c levels range between 4% to 5.9%. As this number reaches 6% or greater, it signifies poorer ''diabetes'' control.''A hemoglobin A1c of 6% roughly correlates with an average blood sugar level of 135 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliters) over the previous 3 months. Each 1% increase in hemoglobin A1c above 6% represents an average blood sugar of approximately 35 mg/dL over 135 mg/dL. For example, a hemoglobin A1c measurement of 7% corresponds to an average blood sugar level of 170 mg/dL in the previous 3 months.' "
How can a person increase his or her hemoglobin level?,"'There are a number of ways to increase hemoglobin levels. In general, low hemoglobin levels that need to be increased are caused by three circumstances: decreased red blood cell production (for example, altered bone marrow hemoglobin production, ''iron deficiency''), increased red blood cell destruction (for example, ''liver disease''), and by blood loss (for example, ''trauma'' from a gunshot or knife ''wound''). Addressing these underlying causes of low hemoglobin levels initially determines what method to use to increase hemoglobin levels.''Methods to increase hemoglobin levels are varied and their use depends on the underlying problems. Some of the ways to increase hemoglobin include:''Individuals should not take iron ''supplements'' or other treatments for low hemoglobin levels without first discussing such treatments with their physician as side effects from these treatments and/or excess iron intake may cause additional problems. Also, iron ''supplements'' should be kept away from children as iron poisoning in young children can be fatal.' transfusing red blood cells receiving erythropoietin (a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell production in individuals with decreased red blood cell production or increased red cell destruction) taking iron supplements increasing the intake of iron-rich foods (eggs, spinach, artichokes, beans, lean meats, and seafood) and foods rich in cofactors (such as vitamin B6, folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin C) important for maintaining normal hemoglobin levels. Such foods include fish, vegetables, nuts, cereals, peas, and citrus fruits."
What is hemoglobin A1c?,"""To explain what hemoglobin A1c is, think in simple terms. Sugar sticks to things, and when it has been stuck to something for a long time, it's harder to the get sugar (glucose) off. In the body, sugar sticks too, particularly to proteins. The red blood cells that circulate in the body live for about three months before they die. When sugar (glucose) sticks to these red blood cells by binding to hemoglobin A1c, it gives the doctor an idea of how much glucose has been around in the blood for the preceding three months. Hemoglobin A1c is a minor component of hemoglobin to which glucose binds. Hemoglobin A1c levels depend on blood glucose concentrations. The higher the sugar concentration in the blood, the higher the detectable hemoglobin A1c levels. At any point in time, hemoglobin A1c levels represent the average blood sugar concentrations in the person with diabetes for approximately the preceding 3 months. Other ways hemoglobin A1c may be termed include HbA1c, A1c and Hb1c."" "
What causes high or low hemoglobin A1c levels?,"'Hemoglobin A1c levels can be altered by:'""The goal for people with diabetes, with their doctor's help, is to establish stable blood glucose levels resulting in hemoglobin A1c levels that are at least below 7% to reduce or stop complications of diabetes (for example, diabetic nerve, eye, and kidney disease).""   Oral or IV glucose intake Fasting Use of insulin Combinations of these and other factors"
"What are normal hemoglobin A1c levels, and are low or high levels dangerous?","""The benefits of measuring hemoglobin A1c is that is gives a more reasonable view of what's happening over the course of time (about 3 months) to the average glucose level in the blood. Hemoglobin A1c values do not bounce up or down as much as daily ""'finger stick'' blood sugar measurements.'   In most labs, the normal range for hemoglobin A1c is 4% to 5.9%. In well-controlled diabetic patients, hemoglobin A1c levels are less than 7.0%. In poorly controlled diabetes, its level is 8.0% or above."
Hemoglobin A1c conversion chart (HbA1c chart),"'While there are no guidelines to use hemoglobin A1c test levels as a screening tool, it gives a health-care professional a good idea that someone may be have diabetes if the value is elevated; however, it is used as a standard tool to determine blood sugar control in patients known to have diabetes.''The correlation between hemoglobin A1c levels and average blood sugar levels is presented in the following conversion chart:''The American Diabetes Association currently recommends an A1c goal of less than 7.0%, while other groups such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend a goal of less than 6.5%. In 2016, the ADA recommended that an A1c level of 6.5% as a cutoff level to diagnose diabetes.''Studies have shown there is a 10% decrease in relative risk for microvascular complications for every 1% reduction in hemoglobin A1c. So, if a person with diabetes has an initial hemoglobin A1c level of 10.7 and drops to 8.2, though they are not yet at goal (about 6.5%), they have managed to decrease their risk of microvascular complications by about 20%. The closer to normal the hemoglobin A1c, the lower the absolute risk for microvascular complications.' "
How often should you check your hemoglobin A1c levels?,"'The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests if people with diabetes want to reduce their hemoglobin A1c levels quickly, they should get their hemoglobin A1c levels checked every three months until they reach their treatment goals.''People with diabetes who are meeting treatment goals and have stable blood control are recommended to check their hemoglobin A1c every six months according to the ADA.''Tracking hemoglobin A1c levels allows an individual and their health-care professional to determine how well the person is controlling their blood sugar (glucose) levels over time. However, they are not a substitute for daily glucose monitoring.' "
What is anemia?,"'Anemia is a medical condition in which the red blood cell count or the hemoglobin is less than normal. The normal level of hemoglobin is generally different in males and females. For men, a normal hemoglobin level is typically defined as a level of more than 13.5 gram/100 ml, and in women as hemoglobin of more than 12.0 gram/100 ml. These definitions may vary slightly depending on the source and the laboratory reference used.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of anemia?,"'Some individuals with anemia have no symptoms. Others with anemia may:''Additional anemia symptoms may include:''If anemia is longstanding (chronic anemia), the body may adjust to low oxygen levels and the individual may not feel different unless the anemia becomes severe. On the other hand, if the anemia occurs rapidly (acute anemia), the patient may experience significant symptoms relatively quickly and with relatively mild fluctuations of hemoglobin levels.'   Feel tired Weakness Fatigue easily Appear pale Develop palpitations (feeling of heart racing) Notice shortness of breath Hair loss Malaise (general sense of feeling unwell) Worsening of heart problems"
What causes anemia?,"'Any process that can disrupt the normal life span of a red blood cell may cause anemia. Normal life span of a red blood cell is typically around 120 days. Red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.''Anemia is caused essentially through two basic pathways. Anemia is caused by either:''A more common classification of anemia (low hemoglobin) is based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which signifies the average volume of individual red blood cells.''Looking at each of the components of a ''complete blood count'' (CBC), especially the MCV, a physician can gather clues as to what could be the most common reason for anemia in each patient.' a decrease in production of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or an increase in loss or destruction of red blood cells. If the MCV is low (less than 80), the anemia is categorized as microcytic anemia (low red blood cell volume). If the MCV is in the normal range (80-100), it is called a normocytic anemia (normal red blood cell volume). If the MCV is high, then it is called a macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume)."
What is iron deficiency anemia?,"'Iron deficiency'"" is a very common cause of anemia. This is because iron is a major component of hemoglobin and essential for its proper function. Chronic blood loss due to any reason is the main cause of low iron level in the body as it depletes the body's iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of iron. Anemia that is due to low iron levels is called ""'iron deficiency anemia''.''Young women are likely to have low-grade ''iron deficiency'' anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal ''menstruation''. This is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary.''Another common reason for iron deficiency anemia can be recurring or small ongoing bleeding, for instance from ''colon cancer'' or from stomach ulcers. ''Stomach ulcer'' bleeding may be induced by medications, even very common ''over-the-counter'' ''drugs'' such as ''aspirin'' and ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''). Slow and chronic oozing from these ulcers can lead to loss of iron. Crohn’s disease can lead to iron deficiency anemia. In infants and young children, iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a ''diet'' lacking iron.''Interpretation of a complete blood count test (CBC) may lead to clues to suggest this type of anemia. For instance, iron deficiency anemia usually presents with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.'  "
What is aplastic anemia?,"'Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening form of complete bone marrow failure. As a result, the blood contains inadequate numbers of red blood cells (anemia) as well as insufficient white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (''thrombocytopenia''). Complete bone marrow failure causes all three cell lines produced in the bone marrow to be inadequate, a condition referred to as pancytopenia. Aplastic anemia can occur at nearly any age. Its onset can be sudden or gradual.''The symptoms of this anemia are similar to the symptoms of all anemias ( see above ) as well as recurrent infections and abnormal bleeding.''Causes of aplastic anemia include:' Chronic exposure to toxic chemicals Cancer treatments (radiation therapy; chemotherapy) Infections (certain viral infections) Medications (for examples, chloramhenicol, carbamazepine, and phenytoin) Myelodysplastic syndromes Genetic abnormalities"
What are other types and causes of anemia?,"'Some of the most common anemia causes include:' Vitamin B12 deficiency may cause pernicious anemia. This type of anemia could happen in people who are unable to absorb vitamin B12 from their intestines due to a number of reasons.Strict vegetarians are at risk if they do not balance their diets or take vitamin supplements.Long-term alcoholics.People who have abnormal structure or function of the stomach or intestines leading to impaired B12 absorption despite adequate intake.This typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume). Vitamin B12, along with folate, is involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. Folate deficiency can be the culprit of anemia as well. This may also be caused by inadequate absorption, under-consumption of green, leafy vegetables, and long-term heavy alcohol use. Strict vegetarians are at risk if they do not balance their diets or take vitamin supplements. Long-term alcoholics. People who have abnormal structure or function of the stomach or intestines leading to impaired B12 absorption despite adequate intake. This typically causes macrocytic anemia (large red blood cell volume). Vitamin B12, along with folate, is involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. Folate deficiency can be the culprit of anemia as well. This may also be caused by inadequate absorption, under-consumption of green, leafy vegetables, and long-term heavy alcohol use. There can be rupture or destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) due to antibodies clinging to the surface of the red blood cells. Examples of hemolytic anemia include hemolytic disease of the newborn, medication-induced hemolytic anemia, transfusion-related hemolysis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A wide assortment of bone marrow diseases can cause anemia.For example, cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow, or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to produce red blood cells inadequately, resulting in anemia.Certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production, resulting in anemia.Certain infections may involve the bone marrow and result in bone marrow impairment and anemia.Finally, patients with kidney disease may lack a hormone necessary to stimulate normal red blood cell production by the bone marrow.Chronic alcohol consumption may lead to anemia via different pathways and thus, anemia is commonly seen in alcoholics. For example, cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow, or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to produce red blood cells inadequately, resulting in anemia. Certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production, resulting in anemia. Certain infections may involve the bone marrow and result in bone marrow impairment and anemia. Finally, patients with kidney disease may lack a hormone necessary to stimulate normal red blood cell production by the bone marrow. Chronic alcohol consumption may lead to anemia via different pathways and thus, anemia is commonly seen in alcoholics. Another common cause of anemia is called anemia of chronic disease. This could typically occur in individuals with longstanding chronic diseases. Some medications can cause anemia in a variety of ways. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can cause anemia."
Can anemia be hereditary?,"'Yes, anemia may be genetic. Hereditary disorders create abnormal hemoglobin and can shorten the life span of the red blood cell and lead to anemia (for example, ''sickle cell disease''). Hereditary disorders can also cause anemia by impairing the production of normal hemoglobin (for example, ''alpha thalassemia'' and ''beta thalassemia'').''Depending on the degree of the genetic abnormality, hereditary anemias may cause mild, moderate, or severe anemia. In fact, some may be too severe to be compatible with life and may result in death of the fetus (unborn infant). On the other hand, some of these anemias are so mild that they are not noticeable and are incidentally revealed during routine blood work.' "
How does blood loss cause anemia?,'Acute blood loss from ''internal bleeding'' (as from a bleeding ulcer) or external bleeding (as from ''trauma'') can produce anemia in an amazingly short span of time. ''This type of anemia results in severe symptoms and consequences if not addressed promptly''. Severe sudden blood loss anemia may cause:' Dizziness Lightheadedness Fatigue Confusion Shortness of breath Loss of consciousness
How is anemia diagnosed?,"'Anemia is usually detected, or at least confirmed, by a complete blood cell (CBC) count. A CBC test may be ordered by a physician as a part of routine general checkup and screening or based on clinical signs and symptoms that may suggest anemia or other blood abnormalities.' "
What is a complete blood cell (CBC) count?,"'Traditionally, a doctor or a laboratory technician performed a CBC analysis by viewing a glass slide prepared from a blood sample under a microscope. Today, this work is automated. Six component measurements make up a CBC test:''Only the first three of these anemia tests -- the red blood cell (RBC) count, the hematocrit, and the hemoglobin -- are relevant to an anemia diagnosis.''Additionally, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also often reported in a CBC, which basically measures the average volume of red blood cells in a blood sample. This is important in distinguishing the causes of anemia. Units of MCV are reported in femtoliters, a fraction of one millionth of a liter.''Other useful clues to causes of anemia that are reported in a CBC are the size, shape, and color of red blood cells.' Red blood cell (RBC) count Hematocrit Hemoglobin White blood cell (WBC) count Differential blood count Platelet count"
How is blood collected for a CBC?,"""Blood is collected by venipuncture (using a needle to draw blood from a vein) in a lab, hospital, or doctor's office. Typically, blood is collected in a special sterile tube from an arm vein. The tube has some preservatives to prevent clotting of the blood. Results may be available in an hour or longer depending on the setting.""'In some instances, a quick in-office test called hemoglobin rapid test may be performed using a few drops of blood from a finger prick. The advantage of this quick test is that results may be obtained in a few minutes and only a few drops of blood may be required.' "
What is the red blood cell (RBC) count?,"'The red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) are the most common type of cells in the blood. We each have millions and millions of these little disc-shaped cells. The RBC count is done to determine if the number of red blood cells is low (anemia) or high (''polycythemia'').''In an RBC count, the number and size of the RBCs are determined. This is usually reported as number of RBCs per a specified volume, typically in millions of RBCs in microliters (one one-thousandth of an ml) of whole blood. The shape of the RBCs is also evaluated under a microscope. All of this information -- the number, size and shape of the RBCs -- is useful in the diagnosis of anemia. Further, the specific type of anemia may be determined by this information.' "
What is hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin is a red pigment that imparts the familiar red color to red blood cells and to blood. Functionally, hemoglobin is the key chemical compound that combines with oxygen from the ''lungs'' and carries the oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body. Oxygen is essential for all cells in the body to produce energy.''The blood also transports carbon dioxide, which is the waste product of this energy production process, back to the lungs from which it is exhaled into the air. The transport of the carbon dioxide back to the lung is also achieved by hemoglobin. The carbon dioxide bound to hemoglobin is unloaded in the lungs in exchange for oxygen to be transported to the tissues of the body.' "
What does a low hemoglobin level mean?,"'Low hemoglobin is called anemia. When there is a low hemoglobin level, there is often a low red blood cell count and a low hematocrit, too. Reference ranges are slightly different from one source to another, but typically hemoglobin of less than 13.5 gram/100 ml in men and less than 12.0 gram/100 ml in women is abnormal.' "
What is the hematocrit?,"'The hematocrit is specifically a measure of how much of the blood is made of ''red cells''. The hematocrit is a very convenient way to determine whether the red blood cell count is too high, too low, or normal. The hematocrit is a measure of the proportion of blood that is composed of the red blood cells.' "
How is hematocrit determined?,"""The red blood cells in the sample of blood can quickly be determined by spinning a tube of blood in a centrifuge under prescribed conditions. The proportion of the tube that consists of red blood cells is then measured. Let's say that it is 45%. The hematocrit is 45%."" "
How can anemia be treated?,"'Anemia treatment varies greatly. First, the underlying cause of the anemia needs to be identified and corrected. For example, anemia as a result of blood loss from a stomach ulcer should begin with medications to heal the ulcer. Likewise, surgery is often necessary to remove a colon ''cancer'' that is causing chronic blood loss and anemia.''Sometimes ''iron supplements'' will also be needed to correct iron deficiency. In severe anemia, blood transfusions may be necessary. Vitamin B12 injections will be necessary for patients with ''pernicious anemia'' or other causes of B12 deficiency.''In certain patients with bone marrow disease (or bone marrow damage from chemotherapy) or patients with ''kidney failure'', ''epoetin alfa'' (''Procrit'', ''Epogen'') may be used to stimulate bone marrow red blood cell production.''If a medication is thought to be the culprit, then it should be discontinued under the direction of the prescribing doctor.'  "
What are the complications of anemia?,"'As mentioned earlier, hemoglobin has the important role of delivering oxygen to all parts of the body for consumption and carries back carbon dioxide back to the lung to exhale it out of the body. If the hemoglobin level is too low, this process may be impaired, resulting in low levels of oxygen in the body (''hypoxia'""). Depending on the severity of the anemia and the length of the patient's illness, the anemia could have no long-term complications or have significant complications."" "
What is the prognosis for a person with anemia?,"'Anemia generally has a very good prognosis and it may be curable in many instances. The overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause of anemia, its severity, and the overall health of the patient.' "
What is the difference between hemoglobin and hematocrit?,"'Hemoglobin'' is a protein in ''red blood cells'' and ''hematocrit'' is a measurement of the amount of red blood cells as related to total blood cell count. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit are used to diagnose ''anemia''. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit can be measured from standard blood tests, and both values are typically reported when a doctor orders a blood count.''The hematocrit (''hct'') is volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a hematocrit of 25% means there are 25 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of blood.' "
Why do doctors measure hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein in red blood cells that contains an iron molecule. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. The iron in hemoglobin plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells.""'Normal hemoglobin ranges depend on age and gender, and the “normal” range may vary by the specific test used. Normal hemoglobin levels are:''Low hemoglobin levels are referred to as ''anemia'', or ''low red blood cell count''. Causes of anemia include blood loss, nutritional deficiency, bone marrow disorders, bone marrow suppression by ''chemotherapy'' or ''radiation'' exposure, ''kidney failure'', and abnormal hemoglobin structure, such as ''sickle cell anemia''. High hemoglobin levels are often seen in people who live in high altitudes and in ''smokers''. Other causes of high hemoglobin levels include ''dehydration'', lung disease, ''cancer'', bone marrow disorders (''polycythemia'' vera), and “blood doping” by athletes.' Newborns: 17 to 22 gm/dL One (1) week of age: 15 to 20 gm/dL One (1) month of age: 11 to 15 gm/dL Children: 11 to 13 gm/dL Adult males: 14 to 18 gm/dL Adult women: 12 to 16 gm/dL Men after middle age: 12.4 to 14.9 gm/dL Women after middle age: 11.7 to 13.8 gm/dL"
Why do doctors measure hematocrit?,"'As with hemoglobin, normal hematocrit ranges depend on age and gender, and the “normal” range may vary by the specific test used. Normal hematocrit levels are:''Just as low hemoglobin levels signify anemia, a person with a low hematocrit percentage is also ''anemic''. High hematocrit percentages are seen in the same populations that may have high hemoglobin levels.' Newborns: 55% to 68% One (1) week of age: 47% to 65% One (1) month of age: 37% to 49% Three (3) months of age: 30% to 36% One (1) year of age: 29% to 41% Ten (10) years of age: 36% to 40% Adult males: 42% to 54% Adult women: 38% to 46%"
What is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)?,"'Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disease of two body systems, the blood stream and the kidney. ''Hemolysis'' describes the destruction of red blood cells. In hemolytic uremic syndrome, blood within capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body, begins to clot abnormally. When red blood cells pass through the clogged capillaries, they are sheared apart and broken. (hemo = blood + lysis = destruction). The second failed system, kidney failure (uremia), occurs when urea and other waste products build up in the bloodstream because the kidneys cannot filter and dispose of them. (urea = a waste chemical + emia = in the blood).''HUS is also related to another disease caused by a similar normal clotting process within the capillaries called thrombotic thrombocytic purpura (TTP). Within the medical literature, these two conditions are often considered together. HUS is more widely known, however, because it has been discussed in the press because of its relationship to a special type of ''E. Coli'' (''Escherichia coli'') infection associated with ''food poisoning''.''HUS can be classified as typical or atypical. The typical type is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms including ''vomiting'' and ''diarrhea''. Atypical HUS is not associated with GI symptoms.' "
What causes hemolytic uremic syndrome?,"'While the cause of HUS has not been established with certainty, researchers believe that an abnormal inflammatory reaction is stimulated in the blood stream causing platelets (the parts of the blood that form clots) to sludge in small blood vessels and form ''blood clots'' where they are not supposed to. This uses up the platelets and causes a shortage of them in the rest of the body. This abnormal reaction may be caused by a yet unidentified chemical that is produced in blood plasma (the fluid or non-cellular part of the bloodstream).''The triggering events for HUS are varied and include:''Only the diarrheal form of HUS is considered to be typical HUS and is usually a disease of infants and children younger than 3 years of age.''The others are classified as atypical HUS and also include the familial form of the disease in which a gene mutation affects the blood clotting mechanism.'  
	Enterohemorrhagic E. Coli is a type of bacteria that causes 
	bloody diarrhea. 
	E. coli is a very common type of bacteria in the body, and it is only 
the OH157:H7 type that causes the problem. It can be found in undercooked meat 
and other foods; and is one of the causes of food recalls and restaurant-related 
food poisoning outbreaks. This accounts for almost 90% of HUS in children. The 
	2011 outbreak of HUS in Germany was due to a different type of Shigela 
	toxin-producing E. coli called 0104:H4.  Pregnancy and the early postpartum (after delivery) time period and the use 
of birth control pills are the more common associations with HUS. Pneumonia caused by the 
	Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria is another 
possible precipitating factor. HUS is rare complication of this common 
infection. Most often, this pneumonia is treated with antibiotics as an 
outpatient. However, it is the cause of 40% of atypical HUS. Medications may be also associated with HUS, including some chemotherapy 
and immunosuppression drugs, birth control pills,
	ticlopidine (Ticlid, 
	an anti-platelet drug) and
	quinine (Quinerva, 
	Quinite) an anti-platelet drug. AIDS may be associated with HUS."
What are the signs and symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome?,"'In typical HUS, ''gastroenteritis'' occurs with abdominal cramping, vomiting and profuse bloody, watery ''diarrhea'', as a symptom up to a week before the onset of HUS. This may cause significant ''dehydration'', weakness and lethargy, as well as ''electrolyte'' imbalances because of the loss of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the vomit and diarrhea. These symptoms may resolve before the onset of anemia and the ''kidney failure symptoms'' of HUS.''The anemia and uremia usually present with weakness, lethargy, and sleepiness. ''Seizures'' may occur. Purpura or small areas of bleeding in the skin may be seen because of low platelet counts (''thrombocytopenia'').'  "
How is hemolytic uremic syndrome diagnosed?,"'The health care professional will have a suspicion of the disease based on the history and physical examination, especially in a small child who has had the typical bloody diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory tests help confirm the diagnosis. These abnormal findings may include:''In atypical HUS, history is very important to search for other potential causes of the disease. Unfortunately, the case may not be found in up to half of cases of atypical HUS.''One of the distinguishing findings between HUS and TTP is a normal neurologic examination. The brain function is normal in HUS.' Hemolytic anemia: the red blood cell count is low and a peripheral blood 
smear, in which blood is examined under a microscope, will show that the red 
cells have been damaged and destroyed. This differentiates hemolysis (hemo=blood 
+ lysis=destruction) from anemia caused by decreased production of blood cells 
in the bone marrow. Thrombocytopenia: a low platelet count Uremia: Kidney function can be measured by testing the level of 
	waste products in the blood normally filtered by the kidney. BUN (blood urea 
	nitrogen) and creatinine are measures of this kidney function. When levels 
	rise, it is an indication of kidney failure or uremia in which the kidneys 
	cannot clear the waste products of metabolism from the body. Abnormal urine findings: Blood and protein may be found in the urine when 
normally they are not present. Stool cultures: Since E. coli O157:O7 is the most common 
	cause of HUS in children; attempts are made to culture the bacteria from 
	stool samples. 
	The body usually clears the bacteria from the stool within a week, so a 
	negative test does not exclude the disease. A positive test helps confirm 
	HUS and will be reported to public health authorities to try to determine 
	the source of the infection. In 2011, outbreaks in Europe were traced by 
	public health authorities to tainted sprouts."
What is the treatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome?,"  Typical HUS in children tends to be self-limiting, and supportive care is often all that is needed. This may include intravenous fluids for rehydration and rebalancing of electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which can be lost with the diarrhea. Blood transfusions are only used for the most severe cases of anemia in which the hemoglobin falls below 6 or 7 g/dL (depending on age, the normal value is 11-16). Kidney failure may be managed expectantly (by observation and supportive care), and dialysis is not often required. Adults with atypical HUS tend to become more ill and need more aggressive therapy than children with the condition. In addition to the supportive care discussed above, plasmapheresis or plasma exchange may be required. Since it is thought there is an abnormal chemical in the plasma stimulating the abnormal clot formation, removing the plasma and replacing it with donor plasma is helpful in treating adult HUS. Dialysis may be needed while awaiting recovery of the kidneys from the illness. Eculizumab (Soliris) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of atypical HUS. It is a monoclonal antibody that decreases the blood clotting in the capillary blood vessels, decreasing the potential destruction of cells. This type of therapy decreases the body's immune capabilities, and the risk of infection increases."
What is the prognosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome?," Typical HUS in children tends to be self-limiting, and full recovery is most likely. Adults do less well. Without aggressive therapy like plasmapheresis and dialysis, up to 25% of those affected with atypical HUS may die in the acute phase of the disease, and 50% may have developed long-term kidney impairment. Patients with HUS not related to a diarrheal illness have a worse prognosis than those whose illness is due to gastrointestinal infection. In those patients with genetically caused HUS, relapsing illness is common as are kidney failure requiring dialysis and death."
How can hemolytic uremic syndrome be prevented?,"'Most cases of typical HUS associated with diarrhea can be prevented by thorough washing and cooking of food products. The vast majority of cases of typical HUS are caused by poor food handling from the farmer to the wholesaler and grocer. Proper washing and cooking techniques in the kitchen is the key to ''prevention''. ''Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent atypical HUS.' "
What is hemophilia?,"'Hemophilia is not one disease but rather one of a group of inherited ''bleeding disorders'' that cause abnormal or exaggerated bleeding and poor blood clotting. The term is most commonly used to refer to two specific conditions known as hemophilia A and ''hemophilia B'', which will be the main subjects of this article. Hemophilia A and B are distinguished by the specific gene that is mutated (altered to become defective) and codes for a defective clotting factor (protein) in each disease. Rarely, hemophilia C (a deficiency of Factor XI) is encountered, but its effect on clotting is far less pronounced than A or B.''Hemophilia A and B are inherited in an X-linked recessive genetic pattern and are therefore much more common in males. This pattern of inheritance means that a given gene on the X chromosome expresses itself only when there is no normal gene present. For example, a boy has only one X chromosome, so a boy with hemophilia has the defective gene on his sole X chromosome (and so is said to be hemizygous for hemophilia). Hemophilia is the most common X-linked ''genetic disease''.''Although it is much rarer, a girl can have hemophilia, but she would have to have the defective gene on both of her X chromosomes or have one hemophilia gene plus a lost or defective copy of the second X chromosome that should be carrying the normal genes. If a girl has one copy of the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes and a normal second X chromosome, she does not have hemophilia but is said to be heterozygous for hemophilia (a carrier). Her male children have a 50% chance of inheriting the one mutated X gene and thus have a 50% chance of inheriting hemophilia from their carrier mother.''Hemophilia A occurs in about 1 out of every 5000 live male births. Hemophilia A and B occurs in all racial groups. Hemophilia A is about four times more common than B. B occurs in about 1 out of 20- 30,000 live male births.'""Hemophilia has been called the Royal Disease because Queen Victoria, Queen of England from 1837 to 1901, was a carrier. Her daughters passed the mutated gene on to members of the royal families of Germany, Spain, and Russia. Alexandra, Queen Victoria's granddaughter, who became Tsarina of Russia in the early 20th century when she married Tsar Nicholas II, was a carrier. Their son, the Tsarevich Alexei, suffered from hemophilia."" "
What causes hemophilia?,"'As mentioned above, hemophilia is caused by a genetic mutation. The mutations involve genes that code for proteins that are essential in the blood clotting process. The bleeding symptoms arise because blood clotting is impaired.''The process of blood clotting involves a series of complex mechanisms involving 13 different proteins, classically termed factors I through XIII and written with Roman numerals. If the lining of the blood vessels becomes damaged, platelets are recruited to the injured area to form an initial plug. These activated platelets release chemicals that start the clotting cascade, activating the series of 13 proteins known as clotting factors. Ultimately, fibrin is formed, the protein that crosslinks with itself to form a mesh that makes up the final ''blood clot''. The protein involved with hemophilia A is factor VIII (factor 8) and with hemophilia B is factor IX (factor 9).''Hemophilia A is caused by a mutation in the gene for factor VIII, so there is deficiency of this clotting factor. Hemophilia B (also called Christmas disease) results from a deficiency of factor IX due to a mutation in the corresponding gene.''A condition referred to as hemophilia C involves a deficiency of clotting factor XI. This condition is much rarer than hemophilia A and B and typically leads to mild symptoms. It is also not inherited in an X-linked manner and affects persons of both sexes.''Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B. About 80% of people with hemophilia have hemophilia A. Hemophilia B occurs in about 1 out of every 20,000 to 30,000 people. A subgroup of those with hemophilia B has the so-called Leyden phenotype, which is characterized by a severe hemophilia in childhood that improves at ''puberty''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hemophilia?,"'Hemophilia can vary in its severity, depending upon the particular type of mutation (genetic defect). The degree of symptoms depends upon the levels of the affected clotting factor. Severe disease is defined as <1% factor activity, 1% to 5% factor activity is moderate disease, and greater than 5% factor activity constitutes mild disease. The extent of bleeding is dependent upon the severity (the amount of factor activity) and is similar for hemophilia A and B.''With severe hemophilia (A or B), bleeding begins at an early age and may occur spontaneously. Those with mild hemophilia may only bleed excessively in response to injury or ''trauma''. Female carriers of hemophilia have variable degrees of factor activity; some may have near normal levels and do not show any bleeding tendencies, while some may have less than the predicted 50% reduction and may bleed more often than non-carrier females.''In severe hemophilia, bleeding episodes usually begin within the first 2 years of life. Heavy bleeding after ''circumcision'' in males is sometimes the first sign of the condition. Symptoms may develop later in those with moderate or mild disease. The bleeding of hemophilia can occur anywhere in the body. Common sites for bleeding are the joints, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract. Specific sites and types of bleeding are discussed below.'   Hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joints) is characteristic of hemophilia. The knees and ankles are most often affected. The bleeding causes distension of the joint spaces, significant pain, and over time, can be disfiguring. Over time, joint destruction occurs, and joint replacement surgeries can be required. Bleeding into the muscles may occur with hematoma formation (compartment syndrome). Bleeding from the mouth or nosebleeds may occur. Bleeding after dental procedures is common, and oozing of blood from the gums may occur in young children when new teeth are erupting. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract can lead to blood in the stool. Bleeding from the urinary tract can lead to blood in the urine (hematuria). Intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain or skull) can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or lethargy, and can lead to death. Increased bleeding after surgery or trauma is characteristic of hemophilia."
How is hemophilia diagnosed?,"'The majority of patients with hemophilia have a known family history of the condition. However, about one-third of cases occur in the absence of a known family history. Most of these cases without a family history arise due to a spontaneous mutation in the affected gene. Other cases may be due to the affected gene being passed through a long line of female carriers.''If there is no known family history of hemophilia, a series of blood tests can identify which part or protein factor of the blood clotting mechanism is defective if an individual has abnormal bleeding episodes.''The platelet (a blood particle essential for the clotting process) count and bleeding time test should be measured as well as two indices of blood clotting, the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). A normal ''platelet count'', normal PT, and a prolonged aPTT are characteristic of hemophilia A and hemophilia B. Specific tests for the blood clotting factors can then be performed to measure factor VII or factor IX levels and confirm the diagnosis.''Genetic testing to identify and characterize the specific mutations responsible for hemophilia is also available in specialized laboratories.'  "
Is it possible to know if you are a carrier of hemophilia?,"'Since men with the genetic mutation will have hemophilia, a man who does not have the condition cannot be a carrier of the disease. A woman who has a son with known hemophilia is termed an obligate carrier, and no testing is needed to establish that she is a carrier of hemophilia. ''Women whose carrier status is unknown can be evaluated either by testing for the clotting factors or by methods to characterize the mutation in the DNA. The DNA screening methods are generally the most reliable. ''Prenatal diagnosis'' is also possible with DNA-based tests performed on a sample obtained through ''amniocentesis'' or ''chorionic villus sampling''. Most individuals are seen and tested by consultants who specialize in genetically linked diseases.' "
What are treatments for hemophilia?,"'The mainstay of treatment is replacement of the blood clotting factors. Clotting factor concentrates can be purified from human donor blood or made in the laboratory using methods that do not use donor blood. This type of therapy is known as replacement therapy. Clotting factor replacement therapy is carried out by infusing the clotting factor concentrates into a vein, much like a ''blood transfusion''. This type of therapy can be administered at home with proper instruction and training.''Depending upon the severity of the condition, replacement therapy of the deficient clotting factor may be carried out on an as-needed basis (called demand therapy) or on a regular basis to prevent bleeding episodes (known as prophylactic therapy).''People who have mild cases of hemophilia A are sometimes treated with the drug desmopressin, also known as ''DDAVP''. This drug stimulates release of substances from platelets that help form the platelet plug. It is administered either slowly through the intravenous route (IV) or, occasionally, in nasal spray form.''Pain'' relievers may be prescribed for symptom relief, but ''pain'' relievers other than ''aspirin'' or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''naproxen'', ''ibuprofen'') must be used, since these types of ''drugs'"" further inhibit the blood's ability to clot. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) is often given for ''pain'' relief.'  "
Inhibitors,"'A major complication of treatment is the development of so-called inhibitors to the clotting factors. Inhibitors (antibodies) are produced because the body sees the factor concentrates used to treat patients to reduce or prevent bleeding, as foreign and activates an immune response in the patient to destroy the foreign substances (factor VIII or factor IX).''Inhibitors to factor VIII are the most common and occur in about one-third of those with severe hemophilia A and about 1 out of every 50 people with mild or moderate hemophilia A. They typically develop in childhood in those with severe hemophilia A and later in life in milder cases. Inhibitors destroy both the replacement factor VIII concentrates as well as any factor VIII that is present in the body. This is a serious complication of treatment because the factor concentrates are no longer effective in treating the condition. The action of inhibitors to destroy factor VIII concentrates shows different degrees of severity among individuals and can even vary over time in the same individual.''In about two-thirds of cases, the inhibitors disappear on their own or with treatment known as immune tolerance therapy (ITT) or immune tolerance induction (ITI). In cases of severe hemophilia A with persistence of inhibitors, other factor concentrates, such as activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, are administered to attempt to help control bleeding.''The development of inhibitors to factor IX is much less common and occurs in about 1% of those with hemophilia B. However, these can cause a very serious ''allergic reaction'' when factor IX concentrates are given. Immune tolerance therapy to eliminate inhibitors is less successful than with hemophilia A.' "
Infections,"'Blood-borne infections, such as the ''HIV'' virus and ''hepatitis B'' and C, were a major complication of treatment for hemophilia during the 1980s. These infections were transmitted through the factor concentrates and other blood products that were used to treat hemophilia. The use of large blood donor pools to prepare factor concentrates and the lack of specific tests for infectious agents both contributed to the contamination of blood products used to treat hemophilia. By 1985, about 90% of people with severe hemophilia were infected with the ''HIV'' virus, and about half of all people with hemophilia were ''HIV''-positive. Today, improved screening and manufacturing practices including virus removing techniques as well as the development of recombinant factors have essentially eliminated this tragic complication of treatment.' "
Can hemophilia be prevented?,"'Hemophilia is a genetic (inherited) disease and cannot be prevented. ''Genetic counseling'', identification of carriers through molecular genetic testing, and ''prenatal'' diagnosis are available to help individuals understand their risk of having a child with hemophilia.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for hemophilia?,"'Before factor concentrates were developed, those with hemophilia had a significantly decreased life expectancy. Life expectancy before the 1960s for those with severe hemophilia was limited to 11 years. Currently, the mortality (death) rate for males with hemophilia is twice that of healthy males. As mentioned before, the increase in ''HIV'' and ''hepatitis'' infections associated with therapy during the 1980s led to a corresponding increase in death rates.''Currently, prompt and adequate treatment can greatly reduce the risks of life-threatening bleeding episodes and the severity of long-term damage to joints, but joint deterioration remains a chronic complication of hemophilia.' "
What are possible future treatments for hemophilia?,"'Multiple trials and studies are underway to examine the possibility to use gene therapy to replace the defective genes in hemophilia. To date, stable and sustained production of the deficient clotting factors has not been achieved in humans, but this is an area of active investigation that holds great promise for the future.' "
What are hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'' are defined as an abnormally enlarged vein, mainly due to persistent increase in venous pressure, occurring within or just outside the anal sphincter of the rectum. The anal canal is the last four centimeters through which ''stool'' passes as it goes from the rectum to the outside world. The anus is the opening of the anal canal to the outside world.''Although most people think ''hemorrhoids'' are abnormal, they are present in everyone. It is only when the hemorrhoidal cushions enlarge that ''hemorrhoids'' can cause problems and be considered abnormal or a disease.''Although ''hemorrhoids'' occur in everyone, they become large and cause problems in only 4% of the general population. Hemorrhoids that cause problems occur equally in men and women, and their prevalence peaks between 45 and 65 years of age.' "
What is stapled hemorrhoidectomy?,"'Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is surgical technique for treating hemorrhoids, and is the treatment of choice for third-degree hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that protrude with straining and can be seen on physical exam outside the anal verge. Persistent or intermittent manual reduction is necessary). Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is a misnomer since the surgery does not remove the hemorrhoids but, rather, the abnormally lax and expanded hemorrhoidal supporting tissue that has allowed the hemorrhoids to prolapse downward.''For stapled hemorrhoidectomy, a circular, hollow tube is inserted into the anal canal. Through this tube, a suture (a long thread) is placed, actually woven, circumferentially within the anal canal above the internal hemorrhoids. The ends of the suture are brought out of the anus through the hollow tube. The stapler (a disposable instrument with a circular stapling device at the end) is placed through the first hollow tube and the ends of the suture are pulled. Pulling the suture pulls the expanded hemorrhoidal supporting tissue into the jaws of the stapler. The hemorrhoidal cushions are pulled back up into their normal position within the anal canal. The stapler then is fired. When it fires, the stapler ''cuts'' off the circumferential ring of expanded hemorrhoidal tissue trapped within the stapler and at the same time staples together the upper and lower edges of the cut tissue.'  "
Who is a good candidate for stapled hemorrhoidectomy?,"'Stapled hemorrhoidectomy, although it can be used to treat second degree hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids that extend outside the anus after a bowel movement or straining, but return inside by themselves), usually is reserved for higher grades of hemorrhoids - third and fourth degree. Third degree hemorrhoids can be pushed back into the anus with a finger after a bowel movement. Fourth degree hemorrhoids are always outside. If in addition to internal hemorrhoids there are small external hemorrhoids that are causing a problem, the external hemorrhoids may become less problematic after the stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Another alternative is to do a stapled hemorrhoidectomy and a simple excision of the external hemorrhoids. If the external hemorrhoids are large, a standard surgical hemorrhoidectomy may need to be done to remove both the internal and external hemorrhoids.' "
Pictures of stapled hemorrhoidectomy procedure, 
What happens to the staples from a stapled hemorrhoidectomy?,"'During stapled hemorrhoidectomy, the arterial blood vessels that travel within the expanded hemorrhoidal tissue and feed the hemorrhoidal vessels are cut, thereby reducing the blood flow to the hemorrhoidal vessels and reducing the size of the hemorrhoids. During the healing of the cut tissues around the staples, ''scar tissue'' forms, and this ''scar'' tissue anchors the hemorrhoidal cushions in their normal position higher in the anal canal. The staples are needed only until the tissue heals. After several weeks, they then fall off and pass in the ''stool'' unnoticed. Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is designed primarily to treat internal hemorrhoids, but if external hemorrhoids are present, they may be reduced as well.' "
How long does stapled hemorrhoidectomy take?,"'Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is faster than traditional hemorrhoidectomy, taking approximately 30 minutes. It is associated with much less ''pain'' than traditional hemorrhoidectomy and patients usually return earlier to work. Patients often sense a fullness or pressure within the rectum as if they need to defecate, but this usually resolves within several days. The risks of stapled hemorrhoidectomy include bleeding, infection, anal fissuring (tearing of the lining of the anal canal), narrowing of the anal or rectal wall due to scarring, persistence of internal or external hemorrhoids, and, rarely, ''trauma'' to the rectal wall.''Stapled hemorrhoidectomy may be used to treat patients who have both internal and external hemorrhoids; however, it also is an option to combine a stapled hemorrhoidectomy to treat the internal hemorrhoids and a simple resection of the external hemorrhoids.' "
What should you know about hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'' (''Piles'') are blood vessels located in the smooth muscles of the walls of the rectum and anus. They are a normal part of the anatomy and are located at the junction where small arteries merge into veins. They are cushioned by smooth muscles and connective tissue and are classified by where they are located in relationship to the pectinate line, the dividing point between the upper 2/3 and lower 1/3 of the anus. This is an important anatomic distinction because of the type of cells that line ''hemorrhoid'', and the nerves that provide sensation.''Internal ''hemorrhoids'' are located above the pectinate line and are covered with cells that are the same as those that line the rest of the ''intestines''. External ''hemorrhoids'' arise below the line and are covered with cells that resemble skin.''Hemorrhoids become an issue only when they begin to swell, causing ''itching'', ''pain'', and/or bleeding.' "
What do external and internal hemorrhoids look like (pictures)?,"'Normal hemorrhoidal tissue cannot be seen since they must first swell and become inflamed or develop a clot to cause symptoms. One can see swollen external hemorrhoids or internal prolapsed hemorrhoids exposed outside the anus but internal hemorrhoids cannot be seen because they remain inside the anus. A thrombosed ''hemorrhoid'' will appear as a lump at the anal verge, protruding from the anus, and will be dark bluish in color because of the ''blood clot'' contained inside the swollen blood vessel. Non-thrombosed hemorrhoids will appear as a rubbery lump. Often more than one swollen hemorrhoid appears at the same time.' "
What causes hemorrhoids?,"'While the presence of hemorrhoids is a reflection of the normal anatomy, most people and care professionals refer to hemorrhoids as an abnormal finding because they only present when they swell and cause problems.''Hemorrhoid swelling occurs when there is an increase in the pressure in the small vessels that make up hemorrhoids causing them to swell and engorge with blood. This causes them to increase in size leading to symptoms. Increased pressure may be caused by a variety of factors:'   A low-fiber diet and smaller caliber stool cause a person to strain when having a bowel movement, increasing the pressure within the blood vessels. Pregnancy is associated with hemorrhoid swelling and is likely due to increased pressure of the enlarged uterus on the rectum and anus. In addition, hormonal changes with pregnancy may weaken the muscles that support the rectum and anus. Prolonged sitting on the toilet may increase pressure within the hemorrhoid blood vessels. Obesity Diarrhea, both acute and chronic Colon cancer Previous rectal surgery Spinal cord injury and lack of erect posture"
What are symptoms and signs of hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids are the most common cause of rectal and anal complaints. The most common complaint symptoms are:''It is important to remember that ''rectal bleeding'' or ''blood in the stool'' is never normal and, while it may come from a relatively benign cause like hemorrhoids, more serious causes can be life-threatening. These include bleeding from ulcers, ''diverticulitis'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and tumors. If ''rectal bleeding'' occurs, it is important to contact your health care professional or seek emergency medical care. This is especially important if the person is taking blood-thinning medications.''When internal hemorrhoid becomes inflamed, it can cause swelling. This in itself does not cause pain because there are no pain fibers attached to the veins above the pectinate line. Passing a hard ''stool'' can scrape off the thinned lining of hemorrhoids causing painless bleeding. However, swollen hemorrhoids can also cause spasm of the muscles that surround the rectum and anus causing pain, especially if they protrude or prolapse through the anus. A lump can be felt at the anal verge. Internal hemorrhoids can also thrombose (clot) leading to severe pain.''Inflamed hemorrhoids can leak ''mucus'' that can cause inflammation of the skin surrounding the anus causing burning and ''itching'', known as pruritis ani. However, other causes of itching include yeast and other skin infections and parasites like ''pinworms''. Most importantly, just as blood in the stool should not be ignored because it might be a sign of colon ''cancer'', ''anal itching'' or bleeding should not be presumed to be due to hemorrhoids because it can be a sign of ''anal cancer'' ''tumor''.''External hemorrhoids behave differently since they are covered by ""regular skin"" and have pain fibers associated with them. A thrombosed external hemorrhoid occurs when an underlying vein within the hemorrhoid clots off causing intense pain from the rapid stretching of the skin covering hemorrhoids. A hard painful lump can be felt at the anus. External hemorrhoids can also result in excess ''skin tags'' that can be felt at the anal verge and can cause difficulties with cleaning after a bowel movement, leading to secondary skin infections.'

   painless bleeding from the anal area, anal itching, pain in the anal area, swelling and feeling a lump at the anus are all associated with inflamed hemorrhoids."
How are hemorrhoids diagnosed?,"'The common symptoms of a hemorrhoid include itching, pain, rectal fullness or lump, and bleeding. The diagnosis is made by history taking and physical examination. The history may focus on the associated symptoms including ''constipation'', hard bowel movements, and straining while going to the toilet. Other questions may be asked to look for other causes of rectal bleeding including tumors, ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and gastrointestinal bleeding.''Physical examination is performed to confirm the diagnosis and includes a rectal examination where a finger is used to feel for abnormal lumps or masses. Interestingly, internal hemorrhoids cannot usually be felt. The rectal exam may be deferred if there is intense pain or swelling. In addition, hemorrhoids and ''constipation'' may be associated with anal fissures or cracks in the skin surrounding the anus. The associated pain and spasm makes a rectal exam very uncomfortable.''If the health care professional is concerned that the symptoms, especially rectal bleeding, cannot be explained by hemorrhoids, anoscopy may be considered. Anoscopy is an office procedure where a lighted tube is inserted to look at the anus. ''Sigmoidoscopy'' or ''colonoscopy'' may be ordered if there is concern that the bleeding is arising from other areas of the colon. These procedures are usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist'' or surgeon.''Depending upon the situation, blood tests may be ordered. If there has been excessive bleeding, the ''hemoglobin'' or red blood cell count may be checked. If the patient is taking ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), an INR (international normalized ratio) or PT (protime) may be ordered to check for appropriate blood ""thinning.""\xa0Please note that there are many newer anticoagulation medications available to ""thin"" the blood and their activity cannot be measured by routine blood tests.' "
Can natural home remedies treat and prevent hemorrhoids?,"'Regardless of the size or swelling of a hemorrhoid, no treatment is required if symptoms do not exist. ''Prevention'' is perhaps the most effective treatment. ''Diet'' and adequate hydration are very important to maintain normal bowel movements. Hemorrhoid symptoms can occur with the passage of hard stool and ''constipation'', as well as ''diarrhea'' and frequent bowel movements. People with constipation\xa0may require a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and stool softeners. Those with too frequent bowel movements may require\xa0antidiarrheal medications and diet adjustments. These preventive measures decrease the amount of straining that is required to have a bowel movement, thus decreasing the pressure within the blood vessels to prevent swelling.\xa0The internal hemorrhoid always stays protruded or prolapsed and is at risk for thrombosis or strangulation should the anal muscles go into spasm.''Grade 1 hemorrhoids are treated symptomatically. There can be some spasm of the anal muscles. Warm sitz baths, sitting in a warm tub for 20 minutes, two or three times a day may be helpful. Avoiding spicy food may also prevent anal itching. ''Over-the-counter'' medications may be helpful.' "
How are hemorrhoids treated?,"'Once hemorrhoidal symptoms develop, a variety of treatment options exist, depending upon the situation and severity of the hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids are graded by the degree of prolapse below the pectinate line into the anal canal.''Grade 1'': The internal hemorrhoid bulges into the canal but does not prolapse or fall completely into it. These may bleed.''Grade 2'': The hemorrhoid protrudes past the anal verge with straining for a bowel movement or passage of flatus, but spontaneously returns to its original internal position once the straining has subsided.''Grade 3'': The hemorrhoid may protrude past the anal verge without any straining and requires the patient to push them inside manually.'

  "
What medications and other products treat hemorrhoids?,"'Medications are used to control symptoms by softening the stool, decreasing the inflammation of the hemorrhoids, and treating the pain. Stool softeners work by increasing the water and fat content within the stool allowing it to be passed more easily. ''Docusate'' sodium is the most often recommended drug in this class (''Colace'', Surfak, Correctal).''Inflammation can be controlled with over-the-counter creams or suppositories. Some brand ingredients (''Preparation H'') include low dose topical anesthetics to help with symptoms. Others (Anusol, ''witch hazel'') contain astringents that help shrink the swollen tissues. Both may contain low dose steroids (hydrocortisone) to decrease inflammation. People with ''diabetes'' should check with their pharmacist or health care professional before using OTC hemorrhoid treatments. If the medication contains a vasoconstrictor (for example, phenylephrine HCI, ''ephedrine'', or epinephrine) it may elevate blood ''sugar'' levels if absorbed in large amounts. Prescription-strength ''lidocaine'' or hydrocortisone may be offered by the health care professional.''Grade 2 and 3 hemorrhoids are initially treated the same way, using techniques to destroy hemorrhoids. These include injecting the hemorrhoid vein to make it sclerose or harden, using rubber bands to choke off the blood supply and make the hemorrhoidal tissue shrivel, or other procedures that cause the mucosa to shrivel and die.'  "
Will hemorrhoid surgery (hemorrhoidectomy) cure hemorrhoids?,"'People who have failed conservative therapy or who have grade 4 hemorrhoids are candidates for surgery to remove the swollen hemorrhoids and the larger external hemorrhoid skin tags. Options include hemorrhoid removal with laser surgery or hemorrhoidectomy (ectomy=removal) using a scalpel. Another alternative is ''stapled hemorrhoidectomy'', where a special staple gun is positioned to remove hemorrhoids and surround the tissue with a ring of staples to close the area as well as control\xa0the bleeding.''A thrombosed external hemorrhoid indicates that a clot has formed in hemorrhoids causing significant pain. Treatment involves cutting into hemorrhoids to remove the clot and reduce the swelling.'  "
How long does it take for hemorrhoids to go away?,"'Hemorrhoids are normal tissue and only raise concern when they swell, become inflamed or bleed. Hemorrhoids will recur after nonsurgical treatment about 50% of the time, while the recurrence rate after surgery is only 5%. The goal is to control hemorrhoid inflammation by diet and hydration so that surgery is not required. In this respect, hemorrhoids are a life-long condition, to be controlled and not cured.' "
What is Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)?,'Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a form of blood vessel inflammation or ''vasculitis''. There are many different conditions that feature vasculitis. Each of the forms of vasculitis tends to involve certain characteristic blood vessels. HSP affects the small vessels called capillaries in the skin and frequently the kidneys. HSP results in a purplish skin ''rash'' (most prominent over the buttocks and behind the lower extremities) associated with joint inflammation (arthritis) and sometimes cramping ''pain'' in the abdomen. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is also referred to as anaphylactoid purpura.'  
What causes HSP?,"""HSP occurs most often in the spring season and frequently follows an infection of the throat or breathing passages. HSP seems to represent an unusual reaction of the body's immune system that is in response to this infection (either bacteria or virus). Aside from infection, ""'drugs'' can also trigger the condition. HSP occurs most commonly in children, but people of all age groups can be affected, including adults.' "
What are risk factors for HSP?,"'The only known risk factors for HSP are exposure to certain ''viruses'' and drugs. The reaction to these agents that leads to HSP is not, however, predictable.' "
"What are HSP symptoms and 
signs?","'Classically, HSP causes a purple-appearing skin rash, pain in the abdomen, and joint inflammation (arthritis). Not all features need be present for the diagnosis. The rash of skin lesions appears in gravity-dependent areas, such as the legs. The joints most frequently affected with pain and swelling are the ankles and the knees. Patients with HSP can develop ''fever''. Inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidneys (nephritis) can cause blood and/or ''protein in the urine''. ''Abdominal pain'' and gastrointestinal bleeding is more common in children than in adults. Serious kidney complications are infrequent but can occur.''Symptoms usually last approximately a month. Recurrences are not frequent but do occur.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose Henoch-Schonlein purpura?,"'HSP is usually diagnosed based on the typical skin, joint, and kidney findings. Throat culture, ''urinalysis'', and blood tests for inflammation and kidney function are used to suggest the diagnosis. A biopsy of the skin, and less commonly kidneys, can be used to demonstrate vasculitis. Special staining techniques (direct immunofluorescence) of the biopsy specimen can be used with microscopic examination to document antibody deposits of IgA in the blood vessels of involved tissue.' "
What is the treatment for HSP?,"'While HSP is generally a mild illness that resolves spontaneously, it can cause serious problems in the kidneys and bowels. The rash can be very prominent, especially on the lower extremities.''The treatment of HSP is directed toward the most significant area of involvement. ''Joint pain'' can be relieved by anti-inflammatory medications such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''). Some patients can require cortisone medications, such as ''prednisone'' or ''prednisolone'', especially those with significant ''abdominal pain'' or ''kidney disease''. With more severe kidney disease, involvement called glomerulonephritis or nephritis, ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), or ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') have been used to suppress the immune system. Infection, if present, can require antibiotics.' "
What are complications of HSP?,"'HSP can have complications, which generally occur more frequently in children than in adults. These complications include severe ''abdominal pain'' and gastrointestinal bleeding. Adults can have extended kidney problems.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with HSP?,"'The prognosis (outlook) for patients with HSP is generally excellent. Nearly all patients have no long-term problems. The kidney is the most serious organ involved when it is affected. Rarely, patients can have serious long-term kidney damage or an abnormal bowel folding called ''intussusception''. Some patients have recurrences of symptoms, particularly skin rash, for months to a year after the onset of the illness.' "
Is it possible to prevent Henoch-Schonlein purpura?,"'HSP can be prevented only to the extent that one minimizes exposure to viruses and certain drugs that could cause the abnormal immune response. As it is impossible to know who will get HSP, it is not possible to actually prevent it.' "
What is hepatitis A?,"'Hepatitis A is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation and damage. Inflammation is swelling that occurs when tissues of the body become injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs.''Viruses invade normal cells in your body. Many viruses cause infections that can be spread from person to person. The hepatitis A virus typically spreads through contact with food or water that has been contaminated by an infected person’s ''stool''.''Hepatitis A is an acute or short-term infection, which means people usually get better without treatment after a few weeks. Hepatitis A does not lead to long-term complications, such as ''cirrhosis'', because the infection only lasts a short time.''You can take steps to protect yourself from hepatitis A, including getting the hepatitis A vaccine. If you have hepatitis A, you can take steps to prevent spreading hepatitis A to others.' "
How common is hepatitis A?,"'In the United States, hepatitis A has become relatively uncommon. Since the hepatitis A vaccine became available in 1995, the rate of hepatitis A infections has declined by 95 percent in the United States. Researchers estimate that about 2,500 cases of hepatitis A occurred in the United States in 2014.''Hepatitis A is more common in developing countries where sanitation is poor and access to clean water is limited. Hepatitis A is more common in parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe than it is in the United States.' "
Who is more likely to get hepatitis A?,"'People more likely to get hepatitis A are those who'   travel to developing countries have sex with an infected person are men who have sex with men use illegal drugs, including drugs that are not injected live with or care for someone who has hepatitis A"
What are the complications of hepatitis A?,"'People typically recover from hepatitis A without complications. In rare cases, hepatitis A may lead to liver failure. Liver failure due to hepatitis A is more common in adults older than age 50 and in people who have another ''liver disease''.' "
What are the symptoms of hepatitis A?,"'Some people have symptoms 2 to 6 weeks after they come in contact with the virus. People with hepatitis A typically get better without treatment after a few weeks. In some cases, symptoms can last up to 6 months. These symptoms may include''Some people infected with hepatitis A have no symptoms, including many children younger than age 6. Older children and adults are more likely to have symptoms.'   dark yellow urine feeling tired fever gray- or clay-colored stools joint pain loss of appetite nausea pain in the abdomen vomiting yellowish eyes and skin, called jaundice"
What causes hepatitis A?,"'You cannot get hepatitis A from''A baby cannot get hepatitis A from ''breast milk''.' eating food made by an infected person who did not wash his or her hands after using the bathroom drinking untreated water or eating food washed in untreated water placing a finger or an object in your mouth that came into contact with an infected person’s stool having close personal contact with an infected person, such as through sex or caring for someone who is ill being coughed on or sneezed on by an infected person sitting next to an infected person hugging an infected person"
How do doctors diagnose hepatitis A?,'Doctors diagnose hepatitis A based on symptoms and a blood test. A health care professional will take a blood sample from you and send the sample to a lab. A blood test will detect antibodies to the hepatitis A virus and show whether you have hepatitis A.' 
How do doctors treat hepatitis A?,"'Treatment includes resting, drinking plenty of liquids, and eating healthy foods to help relieve symptoms. Your doctor may also suggest medicines to help relieve symptoms.''Talk with your doctor before taking any prescription or ''over-the-counter'' medicines, ''vitamins'' or other ''dietary supplements'' , or complementary or alternative medicines—any of these could damage your liver. You should avoid alcohol until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered from hepatitis A.''See your doctor regularly to make sure your body has fully recovered. If you have symptoms for longer than 6 months, see your doctor again.'  "
How can I protect myself from hepatitis A infection?,"'You can protect yourself from hepatitis A by getting the hepatitis A vaccine. If you have not had the vaccine, you can take steps to reduce your chance of infection.''If you have had hepatitis A in the past, you cannot get hepatitis A again. You can still get other types of ''viral hepatitis'' though.' "
Hepatitis A vaccine,"'All children should receive the hepatitis A vaccine between 12 and 23 months of age. People who are more likely to be infected and people with chronic ''liver disease'' should also receive the vaccine.''Doctors give the hepatitis A vaccine in two shots. You should get the second shot 6 to 12 months after the first shot. You need to get both shots to be fully protected against the virus.''If you are traveling to a developing country where hepatitis A is common and you haven’t received the hepatitis A vaccine, try to get both shots before you go. If you don’t have time to get both shots, get the first shot as soon as you can. Most people gain some protection within 2 weeks of the first shot.' "
Reduce your chance of infection,"'When traveling in a developing country, drink bottled water. Use bottled water to brush your ''teeth'', make ice cubes, and wash fruits and vegetables.' after using the toilet after changing diapers before and after handling or preparing food"
Prevent infection after contact with the virus,"'If you think you have come in contact with the hepatitis A virus, see your doctor right away. A dose of the hepatitis A vaccine or a medicine called hepatitis A immune globulin may protect you from getting the infection. Your doctor may recommend a vaccine dose or medicine if''You must get the vaccine dose or medicine shortly after coming into contact with the virus to prevent infection.' you live with, have had sex with, or have had close contact with someone who has hepatitis A you shared illegal drugs with someone who had hepatitis A you ate food or drank water possibly containing the hepatitis A virus"
How can I prevent spreading hepatits A to others?,"'If you have hepatitis A, you can reduce your chance of spreading the infection by washing your hands with warm, soapy water after using the toilet and before fixing or eating food. While you are sick, avoid close contact with others, and don’t prepare food or serve food to others. Also, tell your doctor, dentist, and other health care professionals that you have hepatitis A.''Talk with a blood donation center before you donate blood. If you had hepatitis A when you were younger than 11, you may be able to donate blood. If you had hepatitis A when you were age 11 or older, you should not donate blood.''You are most ''contagious''—able to spread the virus to others—during the 2 weeks before you have symptoms. You may be contagious for up to 3 weeks after you develop symptoms. Children are often contagious longer than adults.' "
What should I eat and drink if I have hepatits A?,"'If you have hepatitis A, you should eat a balanced, healthy diet. Talk with your doctor about healthy eating. You should also avoid alcohol because it can cause more liver damage.' "
What is hepatitis C infection? How many people are infected?,"'Hepatitis C virus infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (also referred to as HCV or hep C). It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate hepatitis C from the body, and infection with hepatitis C usually becomes chronic. Over decades, chronic infection with hepatitis C damages the liver and can cause liver failure. In the U.S., the CDC has estimated that approximately 41,200 new cases of hepatitis C occurred in 2016. When the virus first enters the body there usually are no symptoms, so this number is an estimate. About 75%-85% of newly infected people become chronically infected. In the U.S., more than 2 million people are estimated to be chronically infected with hepatitis C. Infection is most commonly detected among people who are 40 to 60 years of age, reflecting the high rates of infection in the 1970s and 1980s. There are 8,000 to 10,000 deaths each year in the U.S. related to hepatitis C infection. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is a risk factor for ''liver cancer''. In 2016, 18,153 death certificates listed HCV as a contributing cause of death; this is believed to be an underestimate.''About 10%-20% of those who develop chronic HCV will develop ''cirrhosis'' within 20-30 years. Progression to cirrhosis may be accelerated by age over 50, male gender, ''alcohol'' consumption, nonalcoholic ''fatty liver disease'' (NASH), co-infection with ''hepatitis B'' or ''HIV'', and immune suppressing ''drugs''. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation due to liver failure in the U.S.''Those who have cirrhosis from HCV also have a yearly risk of liver ''cancer'' (hepatoma or hepatocellular ''carcinoma'') of about 1%-5%.' "
What is the hepatitis C virus?,"'Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C is one of several viruses that can cause viral hepatitis. It is unrelated to the other common hepatitis viruses (for example, ''hepatitis A'' or ''hepatitis B''). Hepatitis C is a member of the ''Flaviviridae'' family of viruses. Other members of this family of viruses include those that cause ''yellow fever'' and ''dengue fever''.''There are at least six different genotypes (''strains'') of the virus which have different genetic profiles (genotypes 1 to 6). In the U. S., genotype 1 is the most common strain of hepatitis C. Even within a single genotype there may be some variations (genotype 1a and 1b, for example). Genotyping is used to guide treatment because some viral genotypes respond better to some therapies than to others.''Like ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), hepatitis C multiplies very fast and attains very high levels in the body. The genes that make the surface proteins of the virus also mutate (change) quickly, and thousands of genetic variations of the virus (""quasi-species"") are produced daily. It is impossible for the body to keep up with making anti-HCV antibodies against all of the quasi-species circulating at one time. It has not been possible yet to develop an effective ''vaccine'' because the vaccine must protect against all genotypes.''Hepatitis C infection in the liver triggers the immune system, which leads to inflammation. About 20%-30% of those acutely infected will experience typical hepatitis symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', ''jaundice'', ''dark urine'' or clay-colored stools. However, chronic hepatitis C usually causes no symptoms until very late in the disease, and hepatitis C has been referred to by sufferers as the ""sleeping dragon."" Over several years or decades, chronic inflammation may cause death of liver cells and scarring (""fibrosis""). Extensive scarring in the liver is called cirrhosis. This progressively impairs vital functions of the liver. Cirrhotic livers are more prone to liver ''cancer''. Drinking alcohol speeds up liver damage with hepatitis C. Concurrent ''HIV'' infection, as well as acute ''hepatitis A'' or B infection, will also accelerate progression to cirrhosis.' "
What are the symptoms of hepatitis C infection?,"'About 70%-80% of people have no symptoms when they first get HCV infection. The remaining 20%-30% may have''Early ''symptoms of hepatitis C'' may include dark urine, yellow eyes, or clay-colored stools though this is unusual. Over time, people with chronic HCV infection may develop signs of liver inflammation that suggests that the infection may be present. Infected individuals may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. The later symptoms and signs of cirrhosis are often absent until inflammation is fairly advanced. As cirrhosis progresses, symptoms and signs increase and may include:'   fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, or fever. Elevated liver enzymes in the blood Weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss Breast enlargement in men (gynecomastia) Redness of the palms of the hands Difficulty with the clotting of blood Spider-like blood vessels on the skin Abdominal pain Clay-colored stools Bleeding from the esophagus Fluid in the abdomen Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Confusion Coma"
What is the contagious period for hepatitis C?,"'Because hepatitis C is transmitted by exposure to blood, there is no specific period of contagiousness. People who develop chronic hepatitis C carry the virus in their blood and, therefore, are ''contagious'' to others for their entire life, unless they are cured of their hepatitis C.' "
How long does it take for symptoms to appear (incubation period) after contracting hepatitis C?,"'This is hard to say for certain what the incubation period for hepatitis C is, because most people who are infected with hepatitis C do not have symptoms early in the course of the infection. Those who develop symptoms early after getting infected (2 to 12 weeks on average, but may be longer) experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms that may not prompt a visit to the doctor.' "
How is hepatitis C spread?," Like HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus, or HCV) is spread by exposure to infected blood (blood-borne pathogen). The most common way of getting hepatitis C is from contaminated blood on needles shared by IV drug users. In a multi-state survey in 2017, about 53% of people who inject drugs were estimated to be HCV-infected. Accidental needlesticks in health care workers also have transmitted the virus. The average risk of getting hepatitis C infection from a stick with a contaminated needle is 1.8%. Before 1992, most people acquired the hepatitis C virus from blood transfusions or blood products. Since 1992, all blood products have been screened for hepatitis C, and cases of hepatitis C due to blood transfusion now are extremely rare. Hepatitis C infection also can be passed from mother to unborn child. Approximately 4%-7% of children born to mothers infected with hepatitis C become infected. Hepatitis C is not transmitted by breast milk. However, nipples may crack and bleed during the first few weeks until the nipples are adapted to nursing, and the infant may be exposed to infected blood. If this occurs, breastfeeding should stop, and milk production can be maintained by pumping the milk and discarding it until healed. A very small number of hepatitis C cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse. The risk of hepatitis C transmission from an infected individual to a non-infected spouse or sexual partner without the use of condoms over a lifetime has been estimated to be between 1% and 4%. Hepatitis C is not transmitted by casual contact, kissing, coughing, sneezing, or sharing eating utensils. There is no transmission by bug bites. However, because of the potential for blood exposure, members of the household are advised not to share shaving razors, nail clippers, or toothbrushes. Poor infection control practices during tattooing and body piercing potentially can lead to spread of infection. This may occur in prison or nonprofessional situations, but it has not been reported in licensed, commercial tattooing facilities where it has been studied. There have been some outbreaks of hepatitis C when instruments exposed to blood have been re-used without adequate cleaning and sterilization between patients. Hepatitis C can be transmitted from an organ donor to an organ recipient. Donors of organs are tested for hepatitis C.If the donor who provides the organ is infected with hepatitis C, it is offered to a recipient who also is infected with hepatitis C.For kidney transplant recipients, however, this does not seem to affect long-term outcome after transplantation.For liver transplant recipients who have hepatitis C and receive an organ from a person who is not infected with hepatitis C, the transplanted organ is expected to become infected within a few weeks. Fortunately, newer medications are allowing successful treatment of hepatitis C after transplants, and this area of medicine continues to evolve. If the donor who provides the organ is infected with hepatitis C, it is offered to a recipient who also is infected with hepatitis C. For kidney transplant recipients, however, this does not seem to affect long-term outcome after transplantation. For liver transplant recipients who have hepatitis C and receive an organ from a person who is not infected with hepatitis C, the transplanted organ is expected to become infected within a few weeks. Fortunately, newer medications are allowing successful treatment of hepatitis C after transplants, and this area of medicine continues to evolve."
Can hepatitis C infection affect other organs besides the liver?,"'Most of the signs and symptoms of hepatitis C infection relate to the liver. Less often, hepatitis C infection can affect organs other than the liver.''Hepatitis C infection can cause the body to produce abnormal antibodies called cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins cause inflammation of arteries (''vasculitis''). This may damage skin, joints, and kidneys. Patients with ''cryoglobulinemia'' (cryoglobulins in the blood) may have'""In addition, infected individuals with cryoglobulinemia may develop Raynaud's phenomenon in which the fingers and toes turn color (white, then purple, then red), and become painful at ""'cold'' temperatures.' joint pain, arthritis, a raised purple rash on the legs, and generalized pain or swelling of their bodies."
Who is at high risk and should be tested for hepatitis C infection?,"'The U.S. Preventive Health Services task force recommends that all adults born between 1945 and 1965 be tested once routinely for hepatitis C, regardless of whether risk factors for hepatitis C are present. One-time testing also is recommended for:''People who may have been exposed to hepatitis C in the previous 6 months should be tested for viral RNA load rather than anti-HCV antibody, because antibody may not be present for up to 12 weeks or longer after infection, although HCV RNA may be detectable in blood as soon as 2-3 weeks after infection.''In general, yearly screening may be appropriate for people with ongoing risk factors such as repeated ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') or many sex partners, ongoing IV ''drug use'', or long-term sex partners of people with hepatitis C. Whether or not to test these people is determined on a case-by-case decision.' People who currently inject drugs or snort drugs, or ever did so, even once many years previously People with persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, a liver enzyme found in blood People who have HIV infection Children born to HCV- or HIV-infected mothers People who were ever on long-term hemodialysis People who got a tattoo in an unregulated setting, such as prison or by an unlicensed person People who received clotting factor produced before 1987 People who received transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992, or who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for hepatitis C infection Health care, emergency medical, and public safety workers after a needlestick, eye or mouth exposure to hepatitis C-infected blood"
Is screening for hepatitis C recommended during pregnancy?,"'There is a 4%-7% risk of transmitting HCV from mother to infant with each ''pregnancy''. Currently, there is no CDC recommendation for routine hepatitis C screening during pregnancy, and there is no currently recommended medicine to prevent transmission from mother to infant (prophylaxis). However, CDC is monitoring research findings and may make recommendations in the future as evidence arises.''While data is still limited, a recent study of over 1,000 cases in the United Kingdom found that 11% of infants had been infected at birth, and that these infants were likely to develop cirrhosis in their early 30s. The case for screening for HCV during pregnancy includes the potential to safely treat mothers during pregnancy with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) to treat the mother before cirrhosis develops, prevent infant transmission, and prevent transmission to others. Children born to HCV-infected mothers may also be offered treatment at an early age to prevent cirrhosis, as well as transmission to others. Coordination of care between multiple specialists will be important to accomplish these goals.''Children of HCV-infected mothers may be screened for hepatitis C as early as 1-2 months of age using hepatitis C viral load or ''PCR'' testing (See Blood tests for hepatitis C). Antibodies to hepatitis C passed from the mother to child will be present for up to 18 months, so children should be tested for HCV antibody no earlier than this.' "
What type of doctor treats hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C is treated by either a ''gastroenterologist'', a hepatologist (a gastroenterologist with additional training in ''liver disease''), or an infectious disease specialist. The treatment team may include more than one specialist, depending on the extent of liver damage.Surgeons who specialize in surgery of the liver, including liver transplantation, are part of the medical team and should see patients with advanced disease (liver failure or cirrhosis) early, before the patient needs a liver transplant. They may be able to identify issues that need to be addressed before surgery can be considered. Other persons who can be helpful in managing patients include dietitians to consult on nutritional issues and pharmacists to assist with management of drugs.' "
How is hepatitis C diagnosed?,"'There are several blood tests for the diagnosis of hepatitis C infection. Blood can be tested for antibody to hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody). It takes about 8-12 weeks on average, and up to 6 months, for antibodies to develop after the initial infection with hepatitis C, so screening for antibodies may miss a few newly infected individuals. Having antibodies is not an absolute indication of active, multiplying hepatitis C virus, but if the antibody test is positive (antibody is present), the statistical probability of active infection is greater than 99%.'""Several tests are available to measure the amount of hepatitis C virus in a person's blood (the viral load). The hepatitis C virus's RNA can be identified by a type of test called ""'polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) that detects circulating virus in the blood as early as 2-3 weeks after infection, so it can be used to detect suspected acute infection with hepatitis C early infection. It also is used to determine whether active hepatitis is present in someone who has antibodies to hepatitis C, and to follow the viral load during treatment.''Blood tests are also performed to identify the genotypes of HCV. Genotypes respond differently to different treatment, so this information is important in selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen.''Estimation of liver fibrosis using blood tests also is quite reliable in diagnosing clinically significant scarring; these include FIB-4, FibroSure, Fibrotest, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).'  "
Liver biopsy and non-invasive tests for hepatitis C,"'The next step is to determine the level of liver scarring that has occurred. ''Liver biopsy'' allows examination of a small sample of liver tissue under a microscope, however, liver biopsy is an invasive test, and has significant risks of bleeding. It also might miss abnormal areas in early disease.''Non-invasive tests have largely replaced liver biopsy except in special situations. Liver ''stiffness'' indicates that advanced liver scarring or cirrhosis may be present. Transient elastography may be used to measure this stiffness by ''ultrasound'' or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'').''Pre-treatment evaluation for hepatitis C also should include:' Testing for HIV Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B and hepatitis A and vaccination if antibodies are not present If past or current hepatitis B infection is detected, it may need to be treated at the same time. There are reports of hepatitis B that reactivated or progressed to serious liver failure or death in some patients who were treated only for hepatitis C. This has been reported to occur during or even after HCV treatment. Recommending abstinence from alcohol use Counseling about measures to prevent the spread of hepatitis C and HIV If cirrhosis is present, vaccination against pneumococcal infection, regardless of age"
What medications cure hepatitis C infection?,"'Interferons, for example, Roferon-A and Infergen, and pegylated interferons such as Peg-Intron''T'', Pegasys, were mainstays of treatment for years. Interferons produced sustained viral response (SVR, or cure) of up to 15%. Later, peglatedll forms produced SVR of 50%-80%. These drugs were injected, had many adverse effects, required frequent monitoring, and were often combined with oral ''ribavirin'', which caused ''anemia''. Treatment durations ranged up to 48 weeks.''Direct-acting anti-viral agents (DAAs) are antiviral drugs that act directly on hepatitis C multiplication.' 

Read Doctor's View
   They are taken by mouth, are well tolerated, and cure over 90% of patients. Treatment time is much shorter, often 12 weeks, depending on drug and genotype. Similar to treatments for HIV, treatment of HCV is most effective if the drugs are given in combination. The earliest options were sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and simeprevir (Olysio). These were approved by the FDA in 2013. Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) followed as a once-a-day combination pill, in 2014. With this combination of DAAs, about 94%-99% of people achieve an SVR (cure) in 12 weeks with few side effects. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets (Viekira Pak), is a combination approved in 2014. SVR with this combination is 91%-100%. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) was approved in 2016. SVR with this combination depends on the HCV genotype and whether individual patient factors require the addition of ribavirin. Genotype 1 has a 94%-97% SVR, and SVR is 97%-100% in genotype 4. In August 2017, FDA approved an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (Mavryet) for all HCV genotypes. Unlike some of the earlier regimens, this combination is effective whether or not the patient has cirrhosis. It also can be given to people on kidney dialysis, whose kidney function limits treatment options. Moreover, this regimen is effective in people with genotype 1 who have failed treatment with some of the other regimens."
What are the treatment guidelines for hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C treatment is best discussed with a doctor or specialist familiar with current and developing options as this field is changing, and even major guidelines may become outdated quickly.''The latest treatment guidelines by the American Association for the Study of ''Liver Disease'' (AASLD) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends use of DAAs as first-line treatment for hepatitis C infection. The choice of DAA varies by specific virus genotype, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. In the U.S., specific insurance providers also might influence the choice due to the high cost of DAAs. Although the individual, public health, and cost benefits of treating all patients with hepatitis C is clear, the most difficult barrier to treating all people with HCV is the very high cost of the drug regimens. Patients are encouraged to discuss options with their health care professional.''Treatment is recommended in all patients with chronic hepatitis C unless they have a short life expectancy that is not related to liver disease. Severe life-threatening liver disease may require liver transplantation. Newer therapies with DAAs have allowed more and more patients to be treated.''The ultimate goals of antiviral therapy are to''A side goal is preventing co-infections with other hepatitis viruses, such as A and B, which can cause more liver disease than HCV alone. These can be prevented by ''vaccines'' and treatment.' prevent transmission of hepatitis C, normalize liver tests, reduce inflammation and scarring, prevent progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer, and improve survival and quality of life."
What is the treatment for people with acute hepatitis C infection?,"'When people first get hepatitis C, the infection is said to be acute. Most people with acute hepatitis C do not have symptoms so they are not recognized as being infected. However, some have low-grade ''fever'', ''fatigue'' or other symptoms that lead to an early diagnosis. Others who become infected and have a known exposure to an infected source, such as a needlestick injury, are monitored closely.''Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Response to treatment is higher in acute hepatitis infection than chronic infection. However, many experts prefer to hold off treatment for 8-12 weeks to see whether the patient naturally eliminates the virus without treatment. Approaches to treatment are evolving. Patients with acute hepatitis C infection should discuss treatment options with a health care professional who is experienced in treating the disease. There is no established treatment regimen at this time.''If the hepatitis C RNA remains undetectable at the end of the treatment and follow-up period, this is called a sustained virologic response (SVR) and is considered a cure. Over 90% of people treated with DAAs are cured. These people have significantly reduced liver inflammation, and liver scarring may even be reversed.''About 5% of people who are treated for HCV infection are not cured by some of the older regimens. These people may still have options for cure with the newer regimens.''Few people with hepatitis C are at risk for problems if they are treated, however there are some factors that affect treatment regimens, such as concurrent HIV medications and kidney dysfunction. Some drugs are not safe for people with cirrhosis. Individuals who are unable to comply with the treatment schedule for psychological reasons or ongoing drug or ''alcohol abuse'' may not be good candidates for treatment because the drugs are very costly and require adherence to ''the pill'' regimen and regular follow-up visits. There are some important ''drug interactions'' with some of the medications that should be considered by the health care professional.''People with past hepatitis B or who have chronic active hepatitis B should not be treated for HCV without treating for ''HBV'' as well. As highly effective treatment for HCV has emerged, reports of serious hepatitis B have come to light. Similar to HCV, hepatitis B usually does not clear from the liver after acute infection, even though it is far less likely to cause chronic active hepatitis than hepatitis C infection. It remains dormant in most people, but it can reactivate with changes in the immune system. It is not clear why eliminating the HCV can allow the HBV infection to flare up. Hepatitis B screening is an important part of the hepatitis C evaluation. Those who have laboratory evidence of active or past infection with HBV should be monitored while receiving HCV treatment.' "
What are the side effects of treatments for hepatitis C infection?,"'Compared to interferons and ribavirin drugs, the side effects of DAAs are far fewer and more tolerable. These side effects usually do not require discontinuation of therapy and are self-limiting after completion of therapy.''Patients with hepatitis B co-infection should be monitored for symptoms of reactivation of hepatitis, which are the same as the symptoms of acute hepatitis. The treating doctor may perform blood screening for this as well.'   The most common side effects of interferon or pegylated interferon include fever, flu-like symptoms, and depression. Patients must be monitored closely for depression. Risk of suicide is a reason to avoid interferons. Interferons also reduce white blood cell and/or red blood cell counts (leucopenia and anemia, respectively). This may cause increased susceptibility to infection. Interferons also increase the risk of certain cancers. Death rarely occurs as a result of therapy, but may occur from progression of liver failure in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Ribavirin most commonly causes anemia due to destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). This can be severe enough that people with heart disease may suffer a heart attack from insufficient blood flow, so people with heart disease should not receive this drug. Anemia improves with a reduction in the dose of ribavirin. Injected growth factor (erythropoietin) that stimulates the production of red blood cells often is used to improve the anemia associated with ribavirin. Ribavirin also accumulates in the testicles and ovaries and causes birth defects in animals. Although no birth defects have been reported in humans, both men and women should use contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy during and for at least six months after ribavirin treatment. The most common and significant side effects of boceprevir (Victrelis), sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) includefatigue (feeling tired),headache, andtrouble sleeping (insomnia). fatigue (feeling tired), headache, and trouble sleeping (insomnia). The most common side effects of simeprevir (Olysio) includeitching,skin rash, andphotosensitivity (tendency to get sunburns). itching, skin rash, and photosensitivity (tendency to get sunburns). Simeprevir has significant drug interactions with other medications. Certain medications can affect levels of simeprevir in the body and make simeprevir less effective or more toxic. The combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir tablets with dasabuvir tablets (Viekira Pak) is very well tolerated, and the most commonly reported side effects arefatigue,trouble sleeping, anditching. fatigue, trouble sleeping, and itching. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) is well-tolerated. Most common side effects includefatigue,headache, andnausea.It may be used with ribavirin, which adds the side effect of anemia.About 1% of people in studies may develop elevated liver enzyme blood tests last into treatment or afterward, so these tests are closely monitored. fatigue, headache, and nausea. It may be used with ribavirin, which adds the side effect of anemia. About 1% of people in studies may develop elevated liver enzyme blood tests last into treatment or afterward, so these tests are closely monitored. The combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (Mavryet) is well tolerated. Most common side effects includefatigue,headache, andnausea. fatigue, headache, and nausea. Use of milk thistle should be discussed with the treating doctor, because it interacts with several DAAs."
Is liver transplantation an option for a person with hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C is the leading reason for 40% to 45% of liver transplants in the U.S. Hepatitis C usually recurs after transplantation and infects the new liver. Approximately 25% of these patients with recurrent hepatitis will develop cirrhosis within five years of transplantation. Despite this, the five-year survival rate for patients with hepatitis C is similar to that of patients who are transplanted for other types of liver disease.''Most transplant centers delay therapy until recurrent hepatitis C in the transplanted liver is confirmed. Oral, highly effective, direct-acting antivirals have shown encouraging results in patients who have undergone liver transplantation for hepatitis C infection and have recurrent hepatitis C. The choice of therapy needs to be individualized and is rapidly evolving.' "
How is monitoring done after treatment for hepatitis C?,"'Once patients successfully complete treatment, the viral load after treatment determines if there is an SVR or cure. If cure is achieved (undetectable viral load after treatment), no further additional testing is recommended unless the patient has cirrhosis. Those who are not cured will need continued monitoring for progression of liver disease and its complications.''While cure eliminates worsening of fibrosis by hepatitis C, complications may still affect those with cirrhosis. These individuals still need regular screening for liver cancer as well as monitoring for esophageal varices that may bleed.''Because hepatitis B co-infection may reactivate or worsen even after treatment for HCV, monitoring for hepatitis symptoms may be needed after the end of therapy.' "
What home remedies are available for hepatitis C?,'At this time there are no effective home or ''over-the-counter'' treatments for hepatitis C.' 
What are the complications of undiagnosed hepatitis C?,"'Over several years or decades, chronic inflammation may cause death of liver cells and cirrhosis (scaring, fibrosis). When the liver becomes cirrhotic, it becomes stiff, and it cannot perform its normal functions of clearing waste products from the blood. As fibrosis worsens, symptoms of liver failure begin to appear. This is called ""''decompensated cirrhosis''"" or ""''end-stage liver disease.''"" Symptoms of end-stage liver disease include:''The liver and spleen have an important function of clearing bacteria from the blood stream. Cirrhosis affects many areas of immune function, including attraction of white blood cells to bacteria, reduced killing of bacteria, reduced production of proteins involved in immune defenses, and decreased life span of white blood cells involved in immune defenses. This may be referred to as having'' cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome'' or CAIDS.' Hepatitis C is known to be associated with two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda. Diabetes, heart disease, and arterial blockage are more common among patients with chronic hepatitis C infection than in the general population. It may be that liver damage and chronic inflammation caused by hepatitis C may affect the levels of blood fats (lipids) and blood sugar. Low platelet counts may occur as a result of the destruction of platelets by antibodies. Hepatitis C also is associated with B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. Small spider veins begin to appear on the skin as the stiff, scarred liver obstructs the forward flow of blood. Body fluids back up and accumulate in the abdomen (ascites). The spleen enlarges because of back-pressure. Yellowing of eyes and skin (jaundice) occurs because the liver is not clearing bilirubin (a yellow pigment from breakdown of red blood cells) from the blood. A serious complication is severe bleeding from varicose veins that develop in the swallowing tube or esophagus (esophageal varices). Fluid in the abdomen often becomes infected (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and preventive antibiotics may be given for this type of infection. Bacteria also may enter the bloodstream easily (bacterial translocation), referred to as sepsis, especially when esophageal varices bleed. Individuals may succumb to many types of bacterial infections more easily than normal, but some are specific to liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C and fibrosis should avoid being exposed to these bacteria.Vibrio species of bacteria are a serious risk from eating raw oysters or exposure to sea water. Vibrio vulnificus may cause sepsis, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis, a “flesh-eating” infection.Listeria species may cause sepsis and meningitis, and are a risk from unpasteurized dairy products and salty processed meats.Yersinia species may be picked up from raw or undercooked pork, especially intestines (chitterlings).

Can hepatitis C be prevented?,"'Transmission of hepatitis C can be prevented in several ways.''Prevention'' programs aim at needle sharing among drug addicts. Needle exchange programs and education have reduced transmission of hepatitis C infection. However, IV drug users are a difficult to reach population, and rates of hepatitis C remain high among them.''Among health care workers, safe needle-usage techniques have been developed to reduce accidental needlesticks. Newer needle systems prevent manual recapping of needles after use of syringes, which is a frequent cause of accidental needlesticks''There is no clear way to prevent hepatitis C transmission from mother to fetus at this time.''People with multiple sexual partners should use barrier precautions such as condoms to limit the risk of hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.''If one partner is infected, monogamous couples may want to consider the low risk of transmission of hepatitis C infection when deciding whether to use condoms during sex. Some couples may decide to use them and some may not.''Screening of the blood supply has almost eliminated the risk of transmission of hepatitis C infection through transfusion.''People with hepatitis C infection should not share razors or toothbrushes with others because of the possibility that these items may be contaminated with blood.''People who want to get a body piercing(s) or ''tattoo''(s) are encouraged to do so only at licensed piercing and tattoo shops (facilities), and verify that the body piercing or tattoo shop uses infection-control practices.''It is critical that physicians and clinics follow manufacturers and regulatory agency directions for sterilizing/cleaning instruments and that disposable instruments be discarded properly. There is no need to use special isolation procedures when dealing with hepatitis C infected patients.' "
What is the prognosis of hepatitis C?,"'In general, among patients with untreated hepatitis C:''Drinking alcohol and acquiring other hepatitis viruses are risk factors for worse liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C should avoid drinking alcohol and should be screened for antibodies to hepatitis A and B. If they do not have antibodies, they should be vaccinated against these other hepatitis viruses.''People with hepatitis C should be educated about preventing HIV infection. Infection with both HIV and hepatitis C speeds up and worsens liver damage caused by hepatitis C. Hepatitis C also can affect the HIV infection and how it is treated. About 25% of people with HIV infection are co-infected (also infected) with hepatitis C, and up to 90% of IV drug users with HIV are co-infected with hepatitis C. Screening for hepatitis viruses is important in all people infected with HIV, just as screening for HIV is important in people who have hepatitis C.''Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or hepatoma) is associated with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis C. Some experts recommend screening patients with hepatitis C infection and cirrhosis for liver cancer periodically.' 75% to 85% become chronically infected, 60% to 70% develop liver disease, 5% to 20% develop cirrhosis, and 1% to 5% will die from complications of cirrhosis or liver cancer."
What is the current research and what is in the future for hepatitis C?,"'As our knowledge of hepatitis C increases, more and more patients are being diagnosed with chronic infection. Current research is very active and includes diagnosis, natural history, treatment, and vaccine development. Thus the field is constantly changing, with new guidelines added frequently.' "
What is hepatitis C (hep C)?,'Hepatitis'' (''hep C'') is a form of ''viral hepatitis''. ''Hepatitis C'' causes acute and chronic ''liver disease''. ''Hepatitis C'' is transmitted when the virus in infected blood from one person infects another person. ''Hepatitis C'' disease is caused by a virus termed ''HCV'' (a single strand RNA virus) that infects ''liver'' cells. ''Hepatitis'' C was referred to in older scientific publications as non-A or non-B ''hepatitis''.' 
Is hepatitis C contagious?,"'Hepatitis C'' is ''contagious''. It is mainly transmitted via blood-to-blood transfer. This transmission can occur by''Casual contact (including exposure to saliva and skin to skin such as with a handshake or) rarely, if ever, can transmit ''hepatitis C'' virus.' sharing needles, acupuncture, tattoo needles, surgical or diagnostic instruments, sexual contact, and organ transplants."
How long before I know I'm infected and have hepatitis C?,"'The incubation period (time from exposure to the virus to symptom development) for ''hep C'' is variable. The time period may vary from about 2 weeks to 6 months with 6-10 weeks being the average time span. However, about 80% of those infected may not develop acute symptoms.''Symptoms of hepatitis C'' develop slowly and include''About 70% to 90% of infected people do not clear the virus and become chronic carriers. Tests for diagnosing ''hepatitis C'' virus include detecting antibodies to the virus and a ''PCR'' test that detects virus antigens.'  anorexia, abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and occasionally jaundice."
How is hepatitis C spread?,"'Hepatitis'"" C is spread person-to-person usually by direct contact with another person's blood who is infected with hepatitis C virus. Individuals that share needles are at a high risk to become infected. Surgical and other instruments that are not properly decontaminated can also spread hepatitis C to others. Moreover, some patients that receive organ transplants from individuals that have the virus, but no symptoms, can transmit the disease to the organ transplant recipient."" "
How will you know when you are no longer contagious and cured of hepatitis C?,"'Treatments are usually long-term (for example, 12-24 weeks ) and a person is not considered ""''cured''"" until 6 months have passed with no virus detected in their blood samples. Treatments are varied according to the individual\'s disease.' "
When should you call a doctor if you think you may have hepatitis C?,"'If a person develops one or more of the following symptoms, they should seek medical care:''Let your doctor know if you shared needles with someone or you have had contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with hepatitis C.''If a person is known to have hepatitis C and develops severe ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', and/or ''mental status changes'' (''confusion'' or unresponsiveness, for example), they should be evaluated in an emergency department immediately.'  About 1-3 days of nausea and vomiting that is not improving Yellowish color to the skin and/or the eyes Dark urine Abdominal pain"
What is cirrhosis?,"'Cirrhosis is a complication of many liver diseases characterized by abnormal structure and function of the liver. The diseases that lead to cirrhosis do so because they injure and kill liver cells, after which the inflammation and repair that is associated with the dying liver cells causes ''scar tissue'' to form. The liver cells that do not die multiply in an attempt to replace the cells that have died. This results in clusters of newly formed liver cells (regenerative nodules) within the ''scar'' tissue. There are many causes of cirrhosis including chemicals (such as alcohol, fat, and certain medications), ''viruses'', toxic metals (such as iron and copper that accumulate in the liver as a result of genetic diseases), and autoimmune ''liver disease'"" in which the body's immune system attacks the liver."" "
Why does cirrhosis cause problems?,"'The liver is an important organ in the body. It performs many critical functions, two of which are producing substances required by the body, for example, clotting proteins that are necessary in order for blood to clot, and removing toxic substances that can be harmful to the body, for example, such as ''drugs''. The liver also has an important role in regulating the supply of glucose (''sugar'') and ''lipids'' (fat) that the body uses as fuel. In order to perform these critical functions, the liver cells must be working normally, and they must have a close proximity to the blood because the substances that are added or removed by the liver are transported to and from the liver by the blood.'""The relationship of the liver to the blood is unique. Unlike most organs in the body, only a small amount of blood is supplied to the liver by arteries. Most of the liver's supply of blood comes from the intestinal veins as the blood returns to the ""'heart''. The main vein that returns blood from the ''intestines'' is called the portal vein. As the portal vein passes through the liver, it breaks up into increasingly smaller and smaller veins. The tiniest veins (called sinusoids because of their unique structure) are in close contact with the liver cells. Liver cells line up along the length of the sinusoids. This close relationship between the liver cells and blood from the portal vein allows the liver cells to remove and add substances to the blood. Once the blood has passed through the sinusoids, it is collected in increasingly larger and larger veins that ultimately form a single vein, the hepatic vein, which returns the blood to the heart.''In cirrhosis, the relationship between blood and liver cells is destroyed. Even though the liver cells that survive or are newly formed may be able to produce and remove substances from the blood, they do not have the normal, intimate relationship with the blood, and this interferes with the liver cells\' ability to add or remove substances from the blood. In addition, the scarring within the cirrhotic liver obstructs the flow of blood through the liver and to the liver cells. As a result of the obstruction to the flow of blood through the liver, blood ""backs-up"" in the portal vein, and the pressure in the portal vein increases, a condition called ''portal hypertension''. Because of the obstruction to flow and high pressures in the portal vein, blood in the portal vein seeks other veins in which to return to the heart, veins with lower pressures that bypass the liver. Unfortunately, the liver is unable to add or remove substances from blood that bypasses it. It is a combination of reduced numbers of liver cells, loss of the normal contact between blood passing through the liver and the liver cells, and blood bypassing the liver that leads to many of the signs of cirrhosis.''A second reason for the problems caused by cirrhosis is the disturbed relationship between the liver cells and the channels through which bile flows. Bile is a fluid produced by liver cells that has two important functions: to aid in ''digestion'' and to remove and eliminate toxic substances from the body. The bile produced by liver cells is secreted into very tiny channels that run between the liver cells that line the sinusoids, called canaliculi. The canaliculi empty into small ducts which then join together to form larger and larger ducts. All of the ducts combine into one duct that enters the small intestine where it can help with the digestion of food. At the same time, toxic substances contained in the bile enter the intestine and then are eliminated in the ''stool''. In cirrhosis, the canaliculi are abnormal and the relationship between liver cells and canaliculi is destroyed, just like the relationship between the liver cells and blood in the sinusoids. As a result, the liver is not able to eliminate toxic substances normally, and they can accumulate in the body. To a minor extent, digestion in the intestine also is reduced.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis?,"""People with cirrhosis may have few or no symptoms and signs of liver disease. Some of the symptoms may be nonspecific and don't suggest the liver is their cause. Common symptoms and signs of cirrhosis include:""'People with cirrhosis lf the liver also develop symptoms and signs from the complications of the disease.'   Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood Fatigue Weakness Loss of appetite Itching Easy bruising from decreased production of blood clotting factors by the diseased liver."
What are the stages of cirrhosis of the liver?,"'Cirrhosis in itself is already a late stage of liver damage. In the early stages of liver disease there will be inflammation of the liver. If this inflammation is not treated it can lead to scarring (fibrosis). At this stage it is still possible for the liver to heal with treatment.''If fibrosis of the liver is not treated, it can result in cirrhosis. At this stage, the scar tissue cannot heal, but the progression of the scarring may be prevented or slowed. People with cirrhosis who have signs of complications may develop end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and the only treatment at this stage is liver transplantation.' Stage 1 cirrhosis involves some scarring of the liver, but few symptoms. This stage is considered compensated cirrhosis, where there are no complications. Stage 2 cirrhosis includes worsening portal hypertension and the development of varices. Stage 3 cirrhosis involves the development of swelling in the abdomen and advanced liver scarring. This stage marks decompensated cirrhosis, with serious complications and possible liver failure. Stage 4 cirrhosis can be life threatening and people have develop end-stage liver disease (ESLD), which is fatal without a transplant."
"Edema, ascites, and bacterial peritonitis complications of cirrhosis","'As cirrhosis of the liver becomes severe, signals are sent to the kidneys to retain salt and water in the body. The excess salt and water first accumulates in the tissue beneath the skin of the ankles and legs because of the effect of gravity when standing or sitting. This accumulation of fluid is called peripheral ''edema'' or ''pitting edema''. (Pitting edema refers to the fact that pressing a fingertip firmly against an ankle or leg with edema causes an indentation in the skin that persists for some time after release of the pressure. Any type of pressure, such as from the elastic band of a sock, may be enough to cause pitting.) The swelling often is worse at the end of a day after standing or sitting and may lessen overnight when lying down. As cirrhosis worsens and more salt and water are retained, fluid also may accumulate in the abdominal ''cavity'' between the abdominal wall and the abdominal organs (called ascites) causing swelling of the abdomen, abdominal discomfort, and increased weight.''Fluid in the abdominal ''cavity'' (ascites) is the perfect place for bacteria to grow. Normally, the abdominal cavity contains a very small amount of fluid that can resist infection well, and bacteria that enter the abdomen (usually from the intestine) are killed or find their way into the portal vein and to the liver where they are killed. In cirrhosis, the fluid that collects in the abdomen is unable to resist infection normally. In addition, more bacteria find their way from the intestine into the ascites. Infection within the abdomen and the ascites, called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or SBP, is likely to occur. SBP is a life- threatening complication. Some patients with SBP have no symptoms, while others have ''fever'', ''chills'', ''abdominal pain'' and tenderness, ''diarrhea'', and worsening ascites.' "
Bleeding and spleen complications of cirrhosis,"'In the cirrhotic liver, the scar tissue blocks the flow of blood returning to the heart from the intestines and raises the pressure in the portal vein (portal ''hypertension''). When pressure in the portal vein becomes high enough, it causes blood to flow around the liver through veins with lower pressure to reach the heart. The most common veins through which blood bypasses the liver are the veins lining the lower part of the ''esophagus'' and the upper part of the stomach.''As a result of the increased flow of blood and the resulting increase in pressure, the veins in the lower esophagus and upper stomach expand and then are referred to as esophageal and gastric varices; the higher the portal pressure, the larger the varices and the more likely a patient is to bleed from the varices into the esophagus or stomach.''Bleeding from varices is severe and without immediate treatment can be fatal. Symptoms of bleeding from varices include ''vomiting blood'' (it may appear as red blood mixed with clots or ""coffee grounds""), passing ''stool'' that is black and tarry due to changes in the blood as it passes through the intestine (melena), and orthostatic ''dizziness'' or ''fainting'' (caused by a drop in ''blood pressure'' especially when standing up from a lying position).''Bleeding may rarely occur from varices that form elsewhere in the intestines, for example, the colon. Patients hospitalized because of actively bleeding esophageal varices have a high risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, though the reasons for this are not yet understood.''The spleen normally acts as a filter to remove older ''red blood cells'', white blood cells, and platelets (small particles important for the clotting of blood.). The blood that drains from the spleen joins the blood in the portal vein from the intestines. As the pressure in the portal vein rises in cirrhosis, it increasingly blocks the flow of blood from the spleen. The blood ""backs-up,"" accumulating in the spleen, and the spleen swells in size, a condition referred to as ''splenomegaly''. Sometimes, the spleen is so enlarged it causes ''abdominal pain''.''As the spleen enlarges, it filters out more and more of the blood cells and platelets until their numbers in the blood are reduced. Hypersplenism is the term used to describe this condition, and it is associated with a ''low red blood cell count'' (''anemia''), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), and/or a ''low platelet count'' (''thrombocytopenia''). ''Anemia'' can cause weakness, leucopenia can lead to infections, and ''thrombocytopenia'' can impair the clotting of blood and result in prolonged bleeding' "
Liver (hepatic) complications of cirrhosis,"'Cirrhosis due to any cause increases the risk of primary liver ''cancer'' (hepatocellular ''carcinoma''). Primary refers to the fact that the ''tumor'' originates in the liver. A secondary liver ''cancer'' is one that originates elsewhere in the body and spreads (metastasizes) to the liver.''The most common symptoms and signs of primary liver cancer are ''abdominal pain'' and swelling, an ''enlarged liver'', ''weight loss'', and ''fever''. In addition, liver ''cancers'' can produce and release a number of substances, including ones that cause an increased in red blood cell count (erythrocytosis), ''low blood sugar'' (''hypoglycemia''), and high blood calcium (''hypercalcemia'').''Some of the protein in food that escapes digestion and absorption is used by bacteria that are normally present in the intestine. While using the protein for their own purposes, the bacteria make substances that they release into the intestine to then be absorbed into the body. Some of these substances, such as ammonia, can have toxic effects on the brain. Ordinarily, these toxic substances are carried from the intestine in the portal vein to the liver where they are removed from the blood and detoxified.''When cirrhosis is present, liver cells cannot function normally either because they are damaged or because they have lost their normal relationship with the blood. In addition, some of the blood in the portal vein bypasses the liver through other veins. The result of these abnormalities is that toxic substances cannot be removed by the liver cells, and instead accumulate in the blood.''When the toxic substances accumulate sufficiently in the blood, the function of the brain is impaired, a condition called ''hepatic encephalopathy''. Sleeping during the day rather than at night (reversal of the normal ''sleep'' pattern) is an early symptom of hepatic ''encephalopathy''. Other symptoms include irritability, inability to concentrate or perform calculations, ''memory loss'', ''confusion'', or ''depressed'' levels of consciousness. Ultimately, severe hepatic encephalopathy causes ''coma'' and death.''The toxic substances also make the brains of patients with cirrhosis very sensitive to drugs that are normally filtered and detoxified by the liver. Doses of many drugs may have to be reduced to avoid a toxic buildup in cirrhosis, particularly ''sedatives'' and drugs used to promote ''sleep''. Alternatively, drugs may be used that do not need to be detoxified or eliminated from the body by the liver, such as drugs eliminated by the kidneys.''Patients with worsening cirrhosis can develop hepatorenal syndrome. This syndrome is a serious complication in which the function of the kidneys is reduced. It is a functional problem in the kidneys, meaning there is no physical damage to the kidneys. Instead, the reduced function is due to changes in the way the blood flows through the kidneys themselves. The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as progressive failure of the kidneys to clear substances from the blood and produce adequate amounts of urine while other important functions of the kidney, such as retention of salt, are maintained. If ''liver function'' improves or a healthy liver is transplanted into a patient with hepatorenal syndrome, the kidneys usually begin to work normally again. This suggests that the reduced function of the kidneys is the result of either the accumulation of toxic substances in the blood or abnormal liver function when the liver fails. There are two types of hepatorenal syndrome. One type occurs gradually over months. The other occurs rapidly over a week or two.''Rarely, some patients with advanced cirrhosis can develop hepatopulmonary syndrome. These patients can experience difficulty ''breathing'' because certain hormones released in advanced cirrhosis cause the ''lungs'' to function abnormally. The basic problem in the lung is that not enough blood flows through the small blood vessels in the lungs that are in contact with the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs. Blood flowing through the lungs is shunted around the alveoli and cannot pick up enough oxygen from the air in the alveoli. As a result, the patient experiences ''shortness of breath'', particularly with exertion.' "
What are common causes of cirrhosis?,"'Common causes'' of cirrohsis of the liver include:''Less common causes'' of cirrhosis include:''In certain parts of the world (particularly Northern Africa), infection of the liver with a parasite (''schistosomiasis'') is the most common cause of liver disease and cirrhosis.'   Alcohol Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Cryptogenic causes Chronic viral hepatitis (A, B, and C) Autoimmune hepatitis Inhereited (genetic) disorders Primary biliary cirrhosis (PCB) Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) Infants born without bile ducts Unusual reactions to some drugs Prolonged exposure to toxins Chronic heart failure (cardiac cirrhosis)."
Alcohol and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"'Alcohol is a very common cause of cirrhosis, particularly in the Western world. Chronic, high levels of alcohol consumption injure liver cells. Thirty percent of individuals who drink daily at least eight to sixteen ounces of hard liquor or the equivalent for fifteen or more years will develop cirrhosis. Alcohol causes a range of liver diseases, which include simple and uncomplicated ''fatty liver'' (''steatosis''), more serious fatty liver with inflammation (steatohepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis), and cirrhosis.''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a wide spectrum of liver diseases that, like alcoholic liver disease, range from simple steatosis, to ''nonalcoholic steatohepatitis'' (NASH), to cirrhosis. All stages of NAFLD have in common the accumulation of fat in liver cells. The term nonalcoholic is used because NAFLD occurs in individuals who do not consume excessive amounts of alcohol, yet in many respects the microscopic picture of NAFLD is similar to what can be seen in liver disease that is due to excessive alcohol. NAFLD is associated with a condition called ''insulin resistance'', which, in turn, is associated with ''metabolic syndrome'' and ''diabetes mellitus'' type 2. ''Obesity'' is the main cause of ''insulin'' resistance, ''metabolic syndrome'', and ''type 2 diabetes''. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in the United States and is responsible for up to 25% of all liver disease. The number of livers transplanted for NAFLD-related cirrhosis is on the rise. Public health officials are worried that the current epidemic of obesity will dramatically increase the development of NAFLD and cirrhosis in the population.' "
"Hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis ","'Chronic viral hepatitis is a condition in which ''hepatitis B'' or ''hepatitis C'' virus infects the liver for years. Most patients with viral hepatitis will not develop chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. The majority of patients infected with ''hepatitis A'' recover completely within weeks, without developing chronic infection. In contrast, some patients infected with ''hepatitis B'' virus and most patients infected with ''hepatitis C'' virus develop chronic hepatitis, which, in turn, causes progressive liver damage and leads to cirrhosis, and, sometimes, liver cancers.''Autoimmune hepatitis is a liver disease found more commonly in women that is caused by an abnormality of the immune system. The abnormal immune activity in autoimmune hepatitis causes progressive inflammation and destruction of liver cells (hepatocytes), leading ultimately to cirrhosis.''Primary biliary cirrhosis'' (''PBC'') is a liver disease caused by an abnormality of the immune system that is found predominantly in women. The abnormal immunity in PBC causes chronic inflammation and destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver. The bile ducts are passages within the liver through which bile travels to the intestine. Bile is a fluid produced by the liver that contains substances required for digestion and absorption of fat in the intestine, as well as other compounds that are waste products, such as the pigment bilirubin. (Bilirubin is produced by the breakdown of ''hemoglobin'' from old red blood cells.). Along with the gallbladder, the bile ducts make up the biliary tract. In PBC, the destruction of the small bile ducts blocks the normal flow of bile into the intestine. As the inflammation continues to destroy more of the bile ducts, it also spreads to destroy nearby liver cells. As the destruction of the hepatocytes proceeds, scar tissue (fibrosis) forms and spreads throughout the areas of destruction. The combined effects of progressive inflammation, scarring, and the toxic effects of accumulating waste products culminates in cirrhosis.''Primary sclerosing cholangitis'' (''PSC'"") is an uncommon disease frequently found in patients with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. In PSC, the large bile ducts outside of the liver become inflamed, narrowed, and obstructed. Obstruction to the flow of bile leads to infections of the bile ducts and jaundice, eventually causing cirrhosis. In some patients, injury to the bile ducts (usually because of surgery) also can cause obstruction and cirrhosis of the liver.' "
"Inherited disorders, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and biliary atresia in infants","'Inherited'' (genetic) disorders that result in the accumulation of toxic substances in the liver, which leads to tissue damage and cirrhosis. Examples include the abnormal accumulation of iron (''hemochromatosis'') or copper (Wilson disease). In ''hemochromatosis'', patients inherit a tendency to absorb an excessive amount of iron from food. Over time, iron accumulation in different organs throughout the body causes cirrhosis, ''arthritis'', heart muscle damage leading to heart failure, and testicular dysfunction causing loss of sexual drive. Treatment is aimed at preventing damage to organs by removing iron from the body through phlebotomy (removing blood). In Wilson disease, there is an inherited abnormality in one of the proteins that controls copper in the body. Over time, copper accumulates in the liver, eyes, and brain. Cirrhosis, ''tremor'', psychiatric disturbances and other neurological difficulties occur if the condition is not treated early. Treatment is with oral medication, which increases the amount of copper that is eliminated from the body in the urine.''Cryptogenic cirrhosis (cirrhosis due to unidentified causes) is a common reason for liver transplantation. It is termed called cryptogenic cirrhosis because for many years doctors have been were unable to explain why a proportion of patients developed cirrhosis. Doctors now believe that cryptogenic cirrhosis is due to NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) caused by long standing obesity, ''type 2 diabetes'', and insulin resistance. The fat in the liver of patients with NASH is believed to disappear with the onset of cirrhosis, and this has made it difficult for doctors to make the connection between NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis for a long time. One important clue that NASH leads to cryptogenic cirrhosis is the finding of a high occurrence of NASH in the new livers of patients undergoing ''liver transplant'' for cryptogenic cirrhosis. Finally, a study from France suggests that patients with NASH have a similar risk of developing cirrhosis as patients with long standing infection with ''hepatitis C'' virus. (See discussion that follows.) However, the progression to cirrhosis from NASH is thought to be slow and the diagnosis of cirrhosis typically is made in people in their sixties.''Infants can be born without bile ducts (biliary atresia) and ultimately develop cirrhosis. Other infants are born lacking vital enzymes for controlling sugars that leads to the accumulation of sugars and cirrhosis. On rare occasions, the absence of a specific enzyme can cause cirrhosis and scarring of the lung (''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency'').''Less common causes of cirrhosis include unusual reactions to some drugs and prolonged exposure to toxins, as well as chronic heart failure (cardiac cirrhosis). In certain parts of the world (particularly Northern Africa), infection of the liver with a parasite (schistosomiasis) is the most common cause of liver disease and cirrhosis.' "
How is cirrhosis diagnosed and evaluated?,"'The single best test for diagnosing cirrhosis is biopsy of the liver. Liver biopsies carry a small risk for serious complications, and biopsy often is reserved for those patients in whom the diagnosis of the type of liver disease or the presence of cirrhosis is not clear. The history, physical examination, or routine testing may suggest the possibility of cirrhosis. If cirrhosis is present, other tests can be used to determine the severity of the cirrhosis and the presence of complications. Tests also may be used to diagnose the underlying disease that is causing the cirrhosis. Examples of how doctors diagnose and evaluate cirrhosis are:'   The patient's history. The doctor may uncover a history of excessive and prolonged intake of alcohol, a history of intravenous drug abuse, or a history of hepatitis. This can suggest the possibility of liver disease and cirrhosis. Patients who are known to have chronic viral hepatitis B or C have a higher probability of having cirrhosis. Some patients with cirrhosis have enlarged livers and/or spleens. A doctor can often feel (palpate) the lower edge of an enlarged liver below the right rib cage and feel the tip of the enlarged spleen below the left rib cage. A cirrhotic liver also feels firmer and more irregular than a normal liver. Some patients with cirrhosis, particularly alcoholic cirrhosis, have small red spider-like markings (telangiectasias) on the skin, particularly on the chest that are made up of enlarged, radiating blood vessels. However, these spider telangiectasias also can be seen in individuals without liver disease. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and of the whites of the eyes due to elevated bilirubin in the blood) is common among patients with cirrhosis, but jaundice can occur in patients with liver diseases without cirrhosis and other conditions such as hemolysis (excessive break down of red blood cells). Swelling of the abdomen (ascites) and/or the lower extremities (edema) due to retention of fluid is common among patients with cirrhosis, although other diseases can cause them commonly, for example, congestive heart failure. Patients with abnormal copper deposits in their eyes or certain types of neurologic disease may have Wilson disease, a genetic disease in which there is abnormal handling and accumulation of copper throughout the body, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis. Esophageal varices may be found unexpectedly during upper endoscopy (EGD), strongly suggesting cirrhosis. Computerized tomography (CT or CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and ultrasound examinations of the abdomen done for reasons other than evaluating the possibility of liver disease may unexpectedly detect enlarged livers, abnormally nodular livers, enlarged spleens, and fluid in the abdomen, which suggest cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis leads to a reduced level of albumin in the blood and reduced blood clotting factors due to the loss of the liver's ability to produce these proteins. Reduced levels of albumin in the blood or abnormal bleeding suggest cirrhosis. Abnormal elevation of liver enzymes in the blood (such as ALT and AST) that are obtained routinely as part of yearly health examinations suggests inflammation or injury to the liver from many causes as well as cirrhosis. Patients with elevated levels of iron in their blood may have hemochromatosis, a genetic disease of the liver in which iron is handled abnormally and which leads to cirrhosis. Autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody and anti-mitochondrial antibody) sometimes are detected in the blood and may be a clue to the presence of autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis, both of which can lead to cirrhosis. Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) may be detected by CT and MRI scans or ultrasound of the abdomen. Liver cancer most commonly develops in individuals with underlying cirrhosis. Elevation of tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein suggest the presence of liver cancer. If there is an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, a sample of the fluid can be removed using a long needle to be examined and tested. The results of testing may suggest the presence of cirrhosis as the cause of the fluid."
What are treatment options for cirrhosis?,"'Treatment of cirrhosis includes''Consume a balanced ''diet'' and one multivitamin daily. Patients with PBC with impaired absorption of fat soluble ''vitamins'' may need additional ''vitamins'' D and K.''Avoid drugs (including alcohol) that cause liver damage. All patients with cirrhosis should avoid alcohol. Most patients with alcohol induced cirrhosis experience an improvement in liver function with abstinence from alcohol. Even patients with chronic hepatitis B and C can substantially reduce liver damage and slow the progression towards cirrhosis with abstinence from alcohol.''Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'', e.g., ''ibuprofen''). Patients with cirrhosis can experience worsening of liver and kidney function with NSAIDs.''Eradicate hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus by using anti-viral medications. Not all patients with cirrhosis due to chronic viral hepatitis are candidates for drug treatment. Some patients may experience serious deterioration in liver function and/or intolerable side effects during treatment. Thus, decisions to treat viral hepatitis have to be individualized, after consulting with doctors experienced in treating liver diseases (hepatologists).'""Remove blood from patients with hemochromatosis to reduce the levels of iron and prevent further damage to the liver. In Wilson's disease, medications can be used to increase the excretion of copper in the urine to reduce the levels of copper in the body and prevent further damage to the liver.""'Suppress the immune system with drugs such as ''prednisone'' and ''azathioprine'' (Imuran) to decrease inflammation of the liver in autoimmune hepatitis.''Treat patients with PBC with a bile acid preparation, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also called ''ursodiol'' (''Actigall''). Results of an analysis that combined the results from several ''clinical trials'' showed that UDCA increased survival among PBC patients during 4 years of therapy. The development of portal ''hypertension'' also was reduced by the UDCA. It is important to note that despite producing clear benefits, UDCA treatment primarily retards progression and does not cure PBC. Other medications such as ''colchicine'' and ''methotrexate'' also may have benefit in subsets of patients with PBC.''Immunize patients with cirrhosis against infection with ''hepatitis A'' and B to prevent a serious deterioration in liver. There are currently no ''vaccines'' available for immunizing against hepatitis C.'   preventing further damage to the liver, treating the complications of cirrhosis, preventing liver cancer or detecting it early, and liver transplantation."
"Treatment for edema, acites, and hypersplenism complications","'Retaining salt and water can lead to swelling of the ankles and legs (edema) or abdomen (ascites) in patients with cirrhosis. Doctors often advise patients with cirrhosis to restrict dietary salt (sodium) and fluid to decrease edema and ascites. The amount of salt in the ''diet'' usually is restricted to 2 grams per day and fluid to 1.2 liters per day. In most patients with cirrhosis, salt and fluid restriction is not enough and diuretics have to be added.''Diuretics are medications that work in the kidneys to promote the elimination of salt and water into the urine. A combination of the diuretics ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') and ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') can reduce or eliminate the edema and ascites in most patients. During treatment with diuretics, it is important to monitor the function of the kidneys by measuring blood levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and ''creatinine'' to determine if too much diuretic is being used. Too much diuretic can lead to kidney dysfunction that is reflected in elevations of the BUN and creatinine levels in the blood.''Sometimes, when the diuretics do not work (in which case the ascites is said to be refractory), a long needle or catheter is used to draw out the ascitic fluid directly from the abdomen, a procedure called abdominal paracentesis. It is common to withdraw large amounts (liters) of fluid from the abdomen when the ascites is causing painful abdominal distension and/or difficulty breathing because it limits the movement of the diaphragms.''Another treatment for refractory ascites is a procedure called transjugular intravenous portosystemic shunting (TIPS).''The spleen normally acts as a filter to remove older red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (small particles important for the clotting of blood). The blood that drains from the spleen joins the blood in the portal vein from the intestines. As the pressure in the portal vein rises in cirrhosis, it increasingly blocks the flow of blood from the spleen. The blood ""backs-up,"" accumulating in the spleen, and the spleen swells in size, a condition referred to as splenomegaly. Sometimes, the spleen is so enlarged it causes abdominal ''pain''.''As the spleen enlarges, it filters out more and more of the blood cells and platelets until their numbers in the blood are reduced. Hypersplenism is the term used to describe this condition, and it is associated with a low red blood cell count (anemia), low white blood cell count (leukopenia), and/or a low ''platelet count'' (thrombocytopenia). Anemia can cause weakness, leucopenia can lead to infections, and thrombocytopenia can impair the clotting of blood and result in prolonged bleeding.' "
Treatment for bleeding from varices complications,"'If large varices develop in the esophagus or upper stomach, patients with cirrhosis are at risk for serious bleeding due to rupture of these varices. Once varices have bled, they tend to rebleed and the probability that a patient will die from each bleeding episode is high (30% to 35%). Treatment is necessary to prevent the first bleeding episode as well as rebleeding. Treatments include medications and procedures to decrease the pressure in the portal vein, and procedures to destroy the varices.' Propranolol (Inderal), a beta-blocker, is effective in lowering pressure in the portal vein and is used to prevent initial bleeding and rebleeding from varices in patients with cirrhosis. Another class of oral medications that lowers portal pressure is nitrates, such as isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil). Nitrates often are added to propranolol if propranolol alone does not adequately lower portal pressure or prevent bleeding. Octreotide (Sandostatin) also decreases portal vein pressure and has been used to treat variceal bleeding. During upper endoscopy (EGD) sclerotherapy or band ligation can be performed to obliterate varices, stop active bleeding, and prevent rebleeding. Sclerotherapy is less commonly used due to a higher risk of complications as compared to band ligation. Band ligation involves applying rubber bands around the varices to obliterate them. (Band ligation of the varices is analogous to rubber banding of hemorrhoids.) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a non-surgical, radiologic procedure to decrease the pressure in the portal vein. TIPS is performed by a radiologist who inserts a stent (tube) through a neck vein, down the inferior vena cava and into the hepatic vein within the liver. The stent then is placed so that one end is in the high-pressure portal vein and the other end is in the low-pressure hepatic vein. This tube shunts blood around the liver and by so doing lowers the pressure in the portal vein and varices and prevents bleeding from the varices. TIPS is particularly useful in patients who fail to respond to beta-blockers or variceal banding. TIPS also is useful in treating patients with ascites that do not respond to salt and fluid restriction and diuretics. TIPS can be used in patients with cirrhosis to prevent variceal bleeding while the patients are waiting for liver transplantation. The most common side effect of TIPS is hepatic encephalopathy. Another major problem with TIPS is the development of narrowing and blocking (occlusion) of the stent, causing recurrence of portal hypertension and variceal bleeding and ascites. Fortunately, there are methods to open blocked stents. Other complications of TIPS include bleeding due to inadvertent puncture of the liver capsule or a bile duct, infection, heart failure, and liver failure. A surgical operation to create a shunt (passage) from the high-pressure portal vein to veins with lower pressure can lower blood flow and pressure in the portal vein and prevent varices from bleeding. One procedure is called distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS). A surgical shunt may be considered for patients with portal hypertension who have early cirrhosis. The risks of major shunt surgery in these patients is less than in patients with advanced cirrhosis. During DSRS, the surgeon detaches the splenic vein from the portal vein and attaches it to the renal vein. Blood is then shunted from the spleen around the liver, lowering the pressure in the portal vein and varices and preventing bleeding from the varices."
Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy ,"'Patients with an abnormal sleep cycle, impaired thinking, odd behavior, or other signs of hepatic encephalopathy usually should be treated with a low ''protein diet'' and oral ''lactulose''. Dietary protein is restricted because it is a source of toxic compounds that cause hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose, which is a liquid, traps toxic compounds in the colon so they cannot be absorbed into the blood stream, and thus cause encephalopathy. Lactulose is converted to lactic acid in the colon, and the acidic environment that results is believed to trap the toxic compounds produced by the bacteria. To be sure adequate lactulose is present in the colon at all times, the patient should adjust the dose to produce 2 to 3 semiformed bowel movements a day. Lactulose is a ''laxative'', and the effectiveness of treatment can be judged by loosening or increasing frequency of stools. ''Rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan'') is an antibiotic taken orally that is not absorbed into the body but rather remains in the intestines. It is the preferred mode of treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Antibiotics work by suppressing the bacteria that produce the toxic compounds in the colon.' "
Treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis complications,"'Patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis usually will undergo paracentesis. Fluid that is removed is examined for white blood cells and cultured for bacteria. Culturing involves inoculating a sample of the ascites into a bottle of nutrient-rich fluid that encourages the growth of bacteria, thus facilitating the identification of even small numbers of bacteria. Blood and urine samples also are often obtained for culturing because many patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis also will have infection in their blood and urine. Many doctors believe infection may have begun in the blood and the urine and spread to the ascitic fluid to cause spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Most patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics such as cefotaxime (Claforan). Patients usually treated with antibiotics include:''Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a serious infection. It often occurs in patients with advanced cirrhosis whose immune systems are weak, but with modern antibiotics and early detection and treatment, the prognosis of recovering from an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is good.''In some patients oral antibiotics (''norfloxacin'' [''Noroxin''] or ''sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim'' [''Bactrim'']) can be prescribed to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Not all patients with cirrhosis and ascites should be treated with antibiotics to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but some patients are at high risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and warrant preventive treatment.' Ascites fluid cultures that contain bacteria. Patients without bacteria in their blood, urine, and ascitic fluid but who have elevated numbers of white blood cells (neutrophils) in the ascitic fluid (greater than 250 neutrophils/cc). Elevated neutrophil numbers in ascitic fluid often means there is bacterial infection. Doctors believe the lack of bacteria with culturing in some patients with increased neutrophils is due either to a very small number of bacteria or ineffective culturing techniques. Patients with cirrhosis who are hospitalized for bleeding varices have a high risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and should be started on antibiotics early during the hospitalization to treat presumed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis Patients with recurring episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis Patients with low protein levels in the ascitic fluid (ascitic fluid with low levels of protein is more likely to become infected)."
"Prevention and early detection for liver cancer, and liver transplantation ","'Several types of liver disease that cause cirrhosis (such as hepatitis B and C) are associated with a high incidence of liver cancer. It is useful to screen for liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis, as early surgical treatment or transplantation of the liver can cure the patient of cancer. The difficulty is that the methods available for screening are only partially effective, identifying at best only half of patients at a curable stage of their cancer. Despite the partial effectiveness of screening, most patients with cirrhosis, particularly hepatitis B and C, are screened yearly or every six months with ultrasound examination of the liver and measurements of cancer-produced proteins in the blood, for example, alpha fetoprotein.''Cirrhosis is irreversible. Liver function usually gradually worsens despite treatment, and complications of cirrhosis increase and become difficult to treat. When cirrhosis is far advanced liver transplantation often is the only option for treatment. Recent advances in surgical transplantation and medications to prevent infection and rejection of the transplanted liver have greatly improved survival after transplantation. On average, more than 80% of patients who receive transplants are alive after five years. Not everyone with cirrhosis is a candidate for transplantation. Furthermore, there is a shortage of livers to transplant, and there usually is a long (months to years) wait before a liver for transplanting becomes available. Measures to slow the progression of liver disease, and treat and prevent complications of cirrhosis are vitally important.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for cirrhosis of the liver? ,"'The prognosis and life expectancy for cirrhosis of the liver varies and depends on the cause, the severity, any complications, and any underlying diseases.' In compensated cirrhosis, patients have not developed any major complications and the average survival rate is more than 12 years. The prognosis for is worse for patients who have decompensated cirrhosis and have developed complications such as ascites, variceal hemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatopulmonary syndrome. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis often require liver transplantation and in those who are unable to receive an organ transplant, life expectancy may be less than 6 months."
What research is ongoing to prevent and treat cirrohsis of the liver?,"'Progress in the management and ''prevention'' of cirrhosis continues. Research is ongoing to determine the mechanism of scar formation in the liver and how this process of scarring can be interrupted or even reversed. Newer and better treatments for viral liver disease are being developed to prevent the progression to cirrhosis. Prevention of viral hepatitis by vaccination, which is available for hepatitis B, is being developed for hepatitis C. Treatments for the complications of cirrhosis are being developed or revised and tested continually. Finally, research is being directed at identifying new proteins in the blood that can detect liver cancer early or predict which patients will develop liver cancer.' "
What is Gilbert syndrome?,"'Gilbert Syndrome'' is a common, harmless genetic condition in which a ''liver'' enzyme essential to the disposal of ''bilirubin'' (the chemical that results from the normal breakdown of ''hemoglobin'' from ''red blood cells'') is abnormal. The condition has also been referred to as constitutional hepatic dysfunction and familial nonhemolytic ''jaundice''. The enzyme abnormality in Gilbert syndrome results in mild elevations of bilirubin in the blood, particularly after starvation, consumption of ''alcohol'', or ''dehydration''.' "
What causes Gilbert syndrome?,"'Gilbert syndrome is the result of a genetic mutation in the promoter region of a gene for the enzyme UGT1A (one of the enzymes called UGT glucuronosyltransferases that are important for bilirubin metabolism). The gene is located on chromosome 2. Other types of mutations in the same gene cause the Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which is a more severe and dangerous form of hyperbilirubinemia (high bilirubin in the blood).''People with two copies of the abnormal promoter region for the UGT1A gene (one ''inherited'"" from each parent) have Gilbert's syndrome and elevated bilirubin levels, suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. This means that both parents require the gene for expression of the abnormality in the offspring.""'Gilbert syndrome is a frequent finding in people in the United States and Europe. The condition is usually detected serendipitously (purely by accident) in the course of routine blood screening.' "
What are the symptoms of Gilbert syndrome?,"'The elevated bilirubin pigment can sometimes cause mild yellowing (''jaundice'') of the eyes. People with Gilbert syndrome are otherwise entirely normal with no other signs or symptoms. Their liver enzyme levels in blood serum are also entirely normal.''Gilbert syndrome is most commonly diagnosed after  ''puberty'', when alterations in sex hormone levels cause the blood bilirubin levels to rise. Situations that aggravate elevated blood bilirubin levels (such as fasting, destruction of red blood cells, or illnesses) may be the initial factors that cause the patient to seek medical attention.'  "
What is the treatment for Gilbert syndrome?,"'There is no need for treatment, and the prognosis (outlook) is excellent.'  "
What is a hepatic hemangioma?,"'Hepatic hemangiomas are thought to be present in as many as 7% of healthy people.  Hemangiomas are four to six times more common in women than in men. Female hormones may promote the formation and growth of hemangiomas.  Hemangiomas, although referred to as tumors,are not ''malignant'' and do not become cancerous.  Hemangiomas are not unique to the ''liver'' and can occur almost anywhere in the body.' "
What are the symptoms of a hepatic hemangioma?,"'Hemangiomas usually are small, measuring only a quarter inch in diameter, but they can be several inches in diameter or even larger. The vast majority of hemangiomas of the liver never causesymptoms or health problems.   Most hepatic hemangiomas are discoveredincidentally at the time of testing for unrelated medical problems, most commonly with ''ultrasound'' imaging or CT (''computerized tomography'')scanning of the abdomen.  Very large hemangiomas can cause symptoms, especially if they arepositioned near other organs.  ''Pain'', ''nausea'', or enlargement of theliver can occur.  Rarely, larger hemangiomas can rupture, causing severe ''pain'' and bleeding into the abdomen that may be severe or even life threatening.' "
How is the diagnosis of a hepatic hemangioma made?,"'When a ''hemangioma'' is suspected, the challenge forthe health care professional, is to be sure that it is in fact a hemangioma and not another type of ''tumor'', particularly a malignant one. With specialized tests,however, doctors can  reassure patients that the tumor is with little doubt a hemangioma.  Such special testing may include scintigraphy (using a tiny amount of aradioactive substance to identify the hemangioma), CT scanning, or ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'').  In general, a biopsy of suspected hemangiomas is avoided because of their benign nature and the potentialrisk of bleeding from the biopsy.  '  "
What is the treatment for hepatic hemangioma?,"'The vast majority of hepatichemangiomas require no treatment.  If a hepatic hemangioma islarge, especially if it is causing symptoms, surgical removal is an option.'  "
What is hepatitis A?,"'Hepatitis A is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation and damage. Inflammation is swelling that occurs when tissues of the body become injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs.''Viruses invade normal cells in your body. Many viruses cause infections that can be spread from person to person. The hepatitis A virus typically spreads through contact with food or water that has been contaminated by an infected person’s ''stool''.''Hepatitis A is an acute or short-term infection, which means people usually get better without treatment after a few weeks. Hepatitis A does not lead to long-term complications, such as ''cirrhosis'', because the infection only lasts a short time.''You can take steps to protect yourself from hepatitis A, including getting the hepatitis A vaccine. If you have hepatitis A, you can take steps to prevent spreading hepatitis A to others.' "
How common is hepatitis A?,"'In the United States, hepatitis A has become relatively uncommon. Since the hepatitis A vaccine became available in 1995, the rate of hepatitis A infections has declined by 95 percent in the United States. Researchers estimate that about 2,500 cases of hepatitis A occurred in the United States in 2014.''Hepatitis A is more common in developing countries where sanitation is poor and access to clean water is limited. Hepatitis A is more common in parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe than it is in the United States.' "
Who is more likely to get hepatitis A?,"'People more likely to get hepatitis A are those who'   travel to developing countries have sex with an infected person are men who have sex with men use illegal drugs, including drugs that are not injected live with or care for someone who has hepatitis A"
What are the complications of hepatitis A?,"'People typically recover from hepatitis A without complications. In rare cases, hepatitis A may lead to liver failure. Liver failure due to hepatitis A is more common in adults older than age 50 and in people who have another ''liver disease''.' "
What are the symptoms of hepatitis A?,"'Some people have symptoms 2 to 6 weeks after they come in contact with the virus. People with hepatitis A typically get better without treatment after a few weeks. In some cases, symptoms can last up to 6 months. These symptoms may include''Some people infected with hepatitis A have no symptoms, including many children younger than age 6.

How do doctors diagnose hepatitis A?,'Doctors diagnose hepatitis A based on symptoms and a blood test. A health care professional will take a blood sample from you and send the sample to a lab. A blood test will detect antibodies to the hepatitis A virus and show whether you have hepatitis A.' 
How do doctors treat hepatitis A?,"'Treatment includes resting, drinking plenty of liquids, and eating healthy foods to help relieve symptoms. Your doctor may also suggest medicines to help relieve symptoms.''Talk with your doctor before taking any prescription or ''over-the-counter'' medicines, ''vitamins'' or other ''dietary supplements'' , or complementary or alternative medicines—any of these could damage your liver. You should avoid alcohol until your doctor tells you that you have completely recovered from hepatitis A.''See your doctor regularly to make sure your body has fully recovered. If you have symptoms for longer than 6 months, see your doctor again.'  "
How can I protect myself from hepatitis A infection?,"'You can protect yourself from hepatitis A by getting the hepatitis A vaccine. If you have not had the vaccine, you can take steps to reduce your chance of infection.''If you have had hepatitis A in the past, you cannot get hepatitis A again. You can still get other types of ''viral hepatitis'' though.' "
Hepatitis A vaccine,"'All children should receive the hepatitis A vaccine between 12 and 23 months of age. People who are more likely to be infected and people with chronic ''liver disease'' should also receive the vaccine.''Doctors give the hepatitis A vaccine in two shots. You should get the second shot 6 to 12 months after the first shot. You need to get both shots to be fully protected against the virus.''If you are traveling to a developing country where hepatitis A is common and you haven’t received the hepatitis A vaccine, try to get both shots before you go. If you don’t have time to get both shots, get the first shot as soon as you can. Most people gain some protection within 2 weeks of the first shot.' "
Reduce your chance of infection,"'When traveling in a developing country, drink bottled water. Use bottled water to brush your ''teeth'', make ice cubes, and wash fruits and vegetables.' after using the toilet after changing diapers before and after handling or preparing food"
Prevent infection after contact with the virus,"'If you think you have come in contact with the hepatitis A virus, see your doctor right away.

How can I prevent spreading hepatits A to others?,"'If you have hepatitis A, you can reduce your chance of spreading the infection by washing your hands with warm, soapy water after using the toilet and before fixing or eating food. While you are sick, avoid close contact with others, and don’t prepare food or serve food to others. Also, tell your doctor, dentist, and other health care professionals that you have hepatitis A.''Talk with a blood donation center before you donate blood. If you had hepatitis A when you were younger than 11, you may be able to donate blood. If you had hepatitis A when you were age 11 or older, you should not donate blood.''You are most ''contagious''—able to spread the virus to others—during the 2 weeks before you have symptoms. You may be contagious for up to 3 weeks after you develop symptoms. Children are often contagious longer than adults.' "
What should I eat and drink if I have hepatits A?,"'If you have hepatitis A, you should eat a balanced, healthy diet. Talk with your doctor about healthy eating. You should also avoid alcohol because it can cause more liver damage.' "
What is hepatitis?,"""The term 'hepatitis' simply means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis may be caused by a variety of viruses or other infections, medications, or a toxin such as ""'alcohol''. Hepatitis viruses that can cause injury to liver cells in addition to hepatitis B include the ''hepatitis A'' and ''hepatitis C'' viruses. These viruses are not related to each other or to the hepatitis B virus, and they differ in their structure, the ways they are spread among individuals, the severity of symptoms they can cause, the way they are treated, and the outcome of the infection. Other hepatitis viruses (hepatitis D, ''hepatitis E'', and ''hepatitis G'') cause disease much less commonly.''Other viruses that infect the liver but which are not specifically ""hepatitis viruses"" include ''Epstein-Barr virus'' (''EBV'', the virus that causes ''mononucleosis'') and ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'').''Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV).''In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in 887,000 deaths, mostly from complications (including cirrhosis and hepatocellular ''carcinoma'').''It is estimated that 257 million people are living with hepatitis B virus infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-positive). According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), approximately 19,000 new cases of hepatitis B occurred in the United States in 2016.''After a marked decline in acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections reported to CDC since the 1990s, due to the widespread introduction of hepatitis B vaccination, there has been no consistent trend in acute HBV cases since 2012; that is, reported cases have been fluctuating around 3,000 cases each year. In 2016, there were 3,218 cases reported to the CDC. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, the estimated number of new HBV infections in 2016 was 20,900.'""When a person first gets hepatitis B, they are said to have an 'acute' infection. Most people are able to eliminate the virus and are cured of the infection. Some are not able to clear the virus and have a 'chronic' infection with hepatitis B that is usually life-long (see below). In the United States, an estimated 2.2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B.""'Hepatitis B is found throughout the world. Some countries have much higher rates of infection than the United States; for example, in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, as many as 10% to 30% of adults are chronically infected with hepatitis B.''The hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is made up of deoxyribonucleic acids. It belongs to a family of viruses known as ''Hepadnaviridae''. The virus is primarily found in the liver but is also present in the blood and certain body fluids.''Hepatitis B virus consists of a core particle (central portion) and a surrounding envelope (outer coat). The core is made up of DNA and the core antigen (HBcAg). The envelope contains the surface antigen (HBsAg). These antigens are present in the blood and are markers that are used in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with suspected ''viral hepatitis''.''The hepatitis B virus reproduces in liver cells, but the virus itself is not the direct cause of damage to the liver. Rather, the presence of the virus triggers an immune response from the body as the body tries to eliminate the virus and recover from the infection. This immune response causes inflammation and may seriously injure liver cells. Therefore, there is a balance between the protective and destructive effects of the immune response to the hepatitis B virus.'  "
What are the symptoms of acute hepatitis B?,"'Acute hepatitis B is the period of illness that occurs during the first one to four months after acquiring the virus.Most healthy adults do not develop significant symptoms during acute infection. Early symptoms may be non-specific, including ''fever'', a ''flu-like'' illness, and ''joint pains''. Symptoms of acute hepatitis may include:''Rarely, acute hepatitis damages the liver so badly it can no longer function. This life-threatening condition is called ""fulminant hepatitis."" Patients with fulminant hepatitis are at risk of developing bleeding problems and ''coma'' resulting from the failure of the liver. Patients with fulminant hepatitis should be evaluated for liver transplantation.\xa0'""The body's immune response is the major determinant of the outcome in acute hepatitis B. Individuals who develop a strong immune response to the infection are more likely to clear the virus and recover. However, these patients also are more likely to develop more severe liver injury and symptoms due to the strong immune response that is trying to eliminate the virus. On the other hand, a weaker immune response results in less liver injury and fewer symptoms but a higher risk of developing chronic hepatitis B. People who recover and eliminate the virus will develop life-long immunity, that is, protection from subsequent infection from hepatitis B.""'Most infants and children who acquire acute hepatitis B viral infection have no symptoms. In these individuals, the immune system fails to mount a vigorous response to the virus. Consequently, the risk of an infected infant developing chronic hepatitis B is approximately 90%. In contrast, only 30% to 50% of people older than 5 years who have acute hepatitis B develop chronic hepatitis B.' fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and pain in the upper right abdomen (due to the inflamed liver)."
What are the symptoms of chronic hepatitis B?,"'The liver is a vital organ that has many functions. These include a role in the immune system, production of clotting factors, producing bile for ''digestion'';\xa0storing nutrients including sugars, ''fats'' and ''minerals'' for use by the body later; processing medications; and breaking down toxic substances. Patients with chronic hepatitis B develop symptoms in proportion to the degree of abnormalities in these functions. The signs and symptoms of chronic hepatitis B vary widely depending on the severity of the liver damage. They range from few and relatively mild signs and symptoms to signs and symptoms of severe ''liver disease''\xa0(cirrhosis or liver failure).'""Most individuals with chronic hepatitis B remain symptom free for many years or decades. During this time, the patient's ""'liver function'' blood tests usually are normal or only mildly abnormal. Some patients may deteriorate and develop inflammation or symptoms, putting them at risk for developing cirrhosis.''Inflammation from chronic hepatitis B can progress to cirrhosis (severe scarring) of the liver. Significant amounts of scarring and cirrhosis lead to liver dysfunction.''Symptoms may include:''Decreased absorption of ''vitamins'' A and D can cause impaired vision at night and thinning of bones (''osteoporosis''). Patients with liver cirrhosis also are at risk of infections because the liver plays an important role in the immune system.''In patients with advanced cirrhosis, the liver begins to fail. This is life-threatening condition.''Several complications occur in advanced cirrhosis:''Patients with chronic hepatitis B are at risk of developing ''liver cancer''. The way in which the ''cancer'' develops is not fully understood. ''Symptoms of liver cancer'' are nonspecific. Patients may have no symptoms, or they may experience ''abdominal pain'' and swelling, an ''enlarged liver'', ''weight loss'', and ''fever''. The most useful diagnostic screening tests for liver ''cancer'' are a blood test for a protein produced by the ''cancer'' called alpha-fetoprotein and an ''ultrasound'' imaging study of the liver. These two tests are used to screen patients with chronic hepatitis B, especially if they have cirrhosis or a family history of liver cancer.''Rarely, chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to disorders that affect organs other than the liver. These conditions are caused when the normal immune response to hepatitis B mistakenly attacks uninfected organs.''Among these conditions are:' weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, breast enlargement in men, a rash on the palms, difficulty with blood clotting, and spider-like blood vessels on the skin. Confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) results from the inability of the liver to detoxify certain toxic substances. Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) causes fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and may result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and may cause massive bleeding. Portal hypertension can also cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia, increased risk of infection and bleeding. In advanced cirrhosis, liver failure also results in decreased production of clotting factors. This causes abnormalities in blood clotting and sometimes spontaneous bleeding. Patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound, called bilirubin. Polyarteritis nodosa: a disease characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels throughout the body. This condition can cause a wide range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, nerve damage, deep skin ulcers, kidney problems, high blood pressure, unexplained fevers, and abdominal pain. Glomerulonephritis: another rare condition, which is inflammation of the small filtering units of the kidney."
How is the hepatitis B virus spread (transmitted)?,"'Hepatitis B is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. In infected individuals, the virus can be found in the blood, semen, ''vaginal discharge'', ''breast milk'', and saliva. Hepatitis B is not spread through food, water, or by casual contact.''In the United States, sexual contact is the most common means of transmission, followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs, tattooing, body piercing, or ''acupuncture''. Additionally, hepatitis B can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood.''Hepatitis B also may be spread from infected mothers to their ''babies'"" at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). This is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis B rates are high. The rate of transmission of hepatitis B from mother to ""'newborn'' is very high, and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis B. Fortunately, transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis (see below). ''Rarely, hepatitis B can be transmitted through transfused blood products, donated livers and other organs. However, blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.'  "
How is hepatitis B diagnosed?,"'Infection with hepatitis B is suspected when the medical history and the physical examination reveal risk factors for the infection or symptoms and signs that are suggestive of hepatitis B. Abnormalities in the ''liver tests'' (blood tests) also can raise suspicion; however, ''abnormal liver tests'"" can result from many conditions that affect the liver. The diagnosis of hepatitis B can be made only with specific hepatitis B virus blood tests. These tests are known as hepatitis 'markers' or 'serologies.'""'Markers found in the blood can confirm hepatitis B infection and differentiate acute from chronic infection. These markers are substances produced by the hepatitis B virus (antigens) and antibodies produced by the immune system to fight the virus. Hepatitis B virus has three antigens for which there are commonly-used tests - the surface antigen (HBsAg), the core antigen (HBcAg) and the e antigen (HBeAg).''The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood indicates that the patient is currently infected with the virus. HBsAg appears an average of four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. Individuals who recover from acute hepatitis B infections clear the blood of HBsAg within approximately four months after the onset of symptoms. These individuals develop antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Anti-HBs provides complete immunity to subsequent hepatitis B viral infection. Similarly, individuals who are successfully vaccinated against hepatitis B produce anti-HBs in the blood.''Patients who fail to clear the virus during an acute episode develop chronic hepatitis B. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is made when the HBsAg is present in the blood for at least six months. In chronic hepatitis B, HBsAg can be detected for many years, and anti-HBs does not appear.''In acute hepatitis, a specific class of early antibodies (IgM) appears that is directed against the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM). Later, another class of antibody, anti-HBc IgG, develops and persists for life, regardless of whether the individual recovers or develops chronic infection. Only anti-HBc IgM can be used to diagnose an acute hepatitis B infection.''Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is present when the hepatitis B virus is actively multiplying, whereas the production of the antibody, anti-HBe, (also called HBeAg seroconversion) signifies a more inactive state of the virus and a lower risk of transmission.''In some individuals infected with hepatitis B virus, the genetic material for the virus has undergone a structural change, called a pre-core mutation. This mutation results in an inability of the hepatitis B virus to produce HBeAg, even though the virus is actively reproducing. This means that even though no HBeAg is detected in the blood of people with the mutation, the hepatitis B virus is still active in these people and they can infect others.'""The best marker of hepatitis B virus reproduction is the level of hepatitis B virus DNA in the blood. Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in a blood sample signals that the virus is actively multiplying. In acute hepatitis, HBV DNA is present soon after infection, but is eliminated over time in patients' who clear the infection. In chronic hepatitis, levels of HBV DNA often continue to be elevated for many years and then decrease as the immune system controls the virus. HBV DNA levels are sometimes referred to as the 'viral load'.""'The following table gives the usual interpretation for sets of results from hepatitis B blood (serological) tests.'""*Interpretation of the hepatitis B virus blood tests should always be made by an experienced clinician with knowledge of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and results of the standard ""'liver blood tests''. Other conditions present in a patient can alter the way these test results are interpreted.'  "
What is the role of a liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis B?,"'During a ''liver biopsy'', a small sample of liver tissue is collected and examined under the microscope. This test is valuable because this sample reflects the health of the liver. It can show the amount of liver injury (inflammation or cirrhosis). Liver biopsy is not routinely needed to diagnose hepatitis B, but it is used for monitoring the progression of liver damage in people with chronic hepatitis and helping to choose or evaluate treatment options.' "
What is the natural course of chronic hepatitis B?,"""The course of chronic hepatitis B is variable and depends on several factors. These factors are the patient's age at which the infection began, the extent of viral multiplication, and the immune system's ability to control the infection.""'The infection can progress from an: ''For individuals infected at birth or at a young age, the immune system initially does not react to the hepatitis B virus. This phase of the infection is known as the immune tolerant phase. Despite high levels of virus in the body, there may be little evidence of inflammation and no symptoms. This phase typically lasts for years, even up to two or three decades. It is important to know that the immune tolerant phase is generally not seen in individuals who become infected during adulthood.''During the third to fourth decade of chronic hepatitis B acquired in childhood, the immune system may start to react to the virus. This is known as the immune clearance phase. In contrast, an infection acquired in adulthood usually begins with the immune clearance phase. In the immune clearance phase, the immune system attacks the hepatitis B virus-infected liver cells in an attempt to clear the virus. This causes inflammation, liver injury, and the development of ''scar tissue''. Standard liver blood tests are abnormal, and the liver biopsy shows inflammation and/or formation of ''scar'' tissue (fibrosis). The severity of liver cell destruction, the degree of fibrosis, and the duration of the immune clearance phase determine the outcome of chronic hepatitis B. The more severe the destruction and fibrosis and the longer the phase, the more likely it is that cirrhosis will develop.''Following the immune clearance phase, the viral infection may enter a less active phase known as the quiescent phase. During this phase, there are no symptoms, the levels of hepatitis B virus become very low, and the standard liver blood tests become normal or nearly normal. Advanced scaring or cirrhosis that may have developed earlier, however, remains. Occasionally, during the quiescent phase, the virus becomes active again. This is known as a ""flare,"" and often is associated with symptoms, abnormal liver blood tests, and further injury to the liver. The flares are caused by reactivation of the immune system against the virus. Flares can be very severe and result in further scarring of the liver. The disease in many of these individuals will progress to cirrhosis and eventually to advanced or end-stage cirrhosis with its associated complications, including liver cancer.''Infected individuals who experience a mild immune clearance phase and move into the quiescent phase are known as healthy carriers of hepatitis B virus. These individuals usually have normal liver tests and do not have symptoms; however, they can still transmit the hepatitis B viral infection to others. The risk of hepatitis B virus carriers developing cirrhosis and liver cell cancer is small although the risk is higher as compared to people without chronic hepatitis B.' immune tolerant phase (in which the immune system ignores the virus) immune clearance phase (in which the immune system attempts to eliminate the virus) quiescent phase (in which the virus is less active)"
What medications are used to treat hepatitis B?,"'Acute infection with hepatitis B usually does not require treatment. In rare cases, however, the infection may cause life-threatening liver failure. Patients with liver failure due to acute hepatitis B should be evaluated for liver transplantation.\xa0'""If a person is chronically infected with hepatitis B and has few signs or symptoms of complications, medications usually are not used. These patients are watched carefully and given periodic blood tests. One test measures the 'viral load,' that is, the amount of viral DNA in the blood. Doctors will recommend treatment if there are signs that the virus is beginning to cause damage or if the viral load is high. Another reason to prescribe medication is if the patient has a positive test for the Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) in the blood. HBeAg is associated with an increased risk of progression of ""'liver disease'' and its complications.''In chronic hepatitis B, the goal of treatment is to reduce the risk of complications including cirrhosis and liver failure. However, it takes decades for complications to occur, which makes it difficult to study the effect of medications. As a substitute for waiting years to find out what happens, scientists have used tests like the viral load or liver function tests to evaluate if medicines are working. This is logical because it is known that people who have large amounts of the virus in their blood are at highest risk to get cirrhosis. Up to one-third of people with very high viral loads (more than one million viral copies per milliliter of blood) will develop cirrhosis over a decade, compared to only 4.5% of those with low viral loads (fewer than 300 viral copies per milliliter).''Medications can reduce the number of viruses in the body and may be able to eliminate the virus from the bloodstream. Logically, this should lead to them having a low rate of progression to cirrhosis (<1% per year), although large, long-term studies have not been done. Even in people who clear the virus from their blood, low numbers of viruses still live in the liver and other cells. Thus, the medications do not cure the disease, but they can prevent or delay complications and symptoms. People who have a good response to treatment can still transmit the virus. Doctors follow blood tests that measure viral load and liver function and they may recommend liver biopsies to evaluate if the medications are working.''The medications in current use for chronic hepatitis B include the interferons and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. New agents are being developed although they are still under investigation and considered experimental. There are no accepted guidelines that tell how every patient should be treated. As a result, treatment is individualized.''Interferon'""-alpha has been used to treat hepatitis B for more than 20 years. Interferon-alpha is a naturally occurring protein that is made in the body by white blood cells to combat viral infections. In addition to its direct anti-viral effects, interferon works against the hepatitis B virus by stimulating the body's immune system to clear the virus. Compared to older interferon alpha agents, pegylated interferon alpha, marketed as Pegasys or Pegintron, has a more convenient dosing schedule, may be slightly more effective and suppresses the virus for a longer period of time. Pegylated interferon alpha is given once a week for 48 weeks.""'Only about a third of people who have Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) in their blood will be able to eliminate HBeAg and produce antibodies against the HBe antigen after treatment with interferon. Relapse may occur after treatment is stopped.'""Sustained response (undetectable viral load in the blood, normal liver function tests) occurs in approximately less than a third of patients after the drug is stopped. Although this is not a cure (some virus still lives in the liver and elsewhere), people with sustained response are at low risk for complications of liver disease. If the responder's immune system is compromised, for example through the use of steroids or acquiring ""'HIV'', the disease can recur. Periodic monitoring of blood tests can help confirm that the response continues to be sustained.''Interferon causes several side effects including:''The side effects may be severe enough that the patient is unable to continue treatment. During treatment, the normal immune response to the virus is stimulated and may cause worsening inflammation in the liver. This is normally a good sign showing that the interferon is working, but more extreme responses may in rare cases cause liver failure. Thus, physicians will monitor blood tests closely during therapy. People with unstable liver disease due to cirrhosis usually should not take interferon because of the increased risk of liver failure.''Nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are man-made chemicals that mimic the nucleosides and nucleotides that are used for making DNA. When the virus tries to use the analogues to make its own DNA, it is unable to make the DNA and, therefore, cannot reproduce. Examples of these agents include adefovir (''Hepsera''), entecavir (Baraclude), ''lamivudine'' (''Epivir''-HBV, Heptovir, Heptodin), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and ''tenofovir'' (''Viread'').''Unfortunately, the hepatitis B virus may become resistant to NAs over time (see below). Adefovir may be effective against ''strains'' of virus that have become resistant to lamivudine and may be added to lamivudine when resistance appears. Simply switching from one NA to another is not recommended because this leads to virus strains that are resistant to multiple medications.''Currently, the optimal duration of treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues is uncertain. people with HBeAg may be treated until six months after the HBeAg disappears from the blood and is replaced by antibodies (anti-HBe), if this occurs. In people without HBeAg, the endpoints are less clear. Some experts advocate treating until the viral load (viral DNA) is undetectable and the surface antigen (HbsAg) has been cleared from the blood. Others suggest continuing medications for prolonged periods to suppress the virus. All of these strategies are hampered by the risk of the virus becoming resistant to the medications. Patients who discontinue treatment with NAs should be monitored carefully for recurrent hepatitis, which may be severe.''There are no clear guidelines to recommend which agent to use first in treating chronic hepatitis B, as there are multiple options. Interferon is given for a defined period of time and may have a more prolonged response after the medication is discontinued than NAs. However, interferon is given as an injection, and side effects often are troublesome. NAs are given as a pill and have few side effects, but the duration of treatment is unclear, and prolonged therapy (years) may be required. NAs may be preferred in patients with unstable disease and cirrhosis because they are thought to be less likely to cause serious flares of hepatitis with more severe liver disease.' A significant reduction in the viral load or elimination of detectable viral DNA from the blood occurs in 25%-37% of people during treatment. Blood tests for liver functions normalize in approximately 23%-39% people treated with interferon or pegylated interferon. People who have significant abnormalities in liver function before therapy are more likely to respond to treatment. Those who have normal liver blood tests before treatment are less likely to respond to interferon therapy. Liver biopsy results show improvement in about one-third of patients. fatigue, generalized muscle aches, fever, chills and loss of appetite. These flu-like symptoms occur in approximately 80% of treated patients; mood swings, depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric effects may occur; and thyroid gland abnormalities resulting inhypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone); significant suppression of thebone marrow and production of blood cells; infection; or hair loss may occur."
What are the effects of alcohol on hepatitis B?,"'Agents that damage the liver are particularly harmful in patients who already have hepatitis B. For this reason, it is recommended that people with hepatitis B avoid drinking alcohol.' "
What are the effects of immunosuppressive medications on hepatitis B?,"'Even in people with chronic hepatitis B, the immune system is working to suppress the virus. Medications that suppress the immune system allow the virus to reproduce in large numbers and may cause the hepatitis to flare. ''Examples of medications that suppress the immune system are:'""If an immunosuppressant drug is stopped, the body's immune system's activity may rebound and cause severe inflammation of the liver. "" prednisone: used to treat many diseases, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain types of skin disease and arthritis methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall): used to treat certain types of skin disease, arthritis, and cancer;  cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan): used to treat some cancers. 
"
What is delta hepatitis?,"'Delta hepatitis is caused by a virus that only infects people who already have hepatitis B. The delta hepatitis virus (also known as hepatitis D or HDV) is an RNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is made up of ribonucleic acid. It is spread through exposure to contaminated blood, especially with illicit, intravenous ''drug use'', and by sexual contact. Delta hepatitis can be acquired at the same time as acute hepatitis B. When this happens, infected people are quite sick but most are eventually able to eliminate the viruses from their bodies. People who already have chronic hepatitis B can acquire delta hepatitis as well. This often causes severe inflammation of the liver, and the viruses are less likely to be cleared.''Delta hepatitis makes chronic hepatitis B much worse. It increases the risk of complications, especially cirrhosis, which occurs in up to two-thirds of patients.''There is no vaccine against delta hepatitis. Interferon treatment may cause improvement in the hepatitis, but relapse is common after therapy is stopped. ''Prevention'' includes avoiding contaminated needles and practicing safer sex (abstaining or limiting the number of partners, using barrier methods of ''contraception''). Universal vaccination of newborns with ''hepatitis B vaccine'' effectively prevents delta hepatitis because the delta hepatitis virus only causes disease in the presence of hepatitis B virus.' "
What about co-infection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus?,"'Hepatitis C'' is caused by a virus that is spread through contaminated needles or blood products and, less commonly, through sexual intercourse. Few patients with chronic hepatitis B also are co-infected chronically with hepatitis C virus (''HCV''). The two viruses interfere with each other and one usually predominates. If hepatitis C is the predominant infection, treatment is directed against the hepatitis C. Patients infected with both viruses are at higher risk for complications of liver disease. There is no effective vaccine against hepatitis C. People with hepatitis C should be vaccinated against hepatitis B to prevent co-infection.' "
What happens in co-infection with hepatitis B virus and HIV?,"'The ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') and hepatitis B virus are transmitted in similar ways, and it is not uncommon for an individual to have both infections. People with ''HIV'' who acquire hepatitis B are more likely to become chronically infected with hepatitis B than people who do not have HIV. The reason for this is thought to be that HIV suppresses the immune system and impairs the ability of the body to eliminate the hepatitis B virus. Some nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (a class of antiretroviral drugs) are used to treat both HIV and hepatitis B, although dosages may vary in the two different infections. Stopping one of these agents when the HIV regimen is adjusted may cause hepatitis to flare.' "
What is new in the treatment of hepatitis B?,'New agents are under development to treat hepatitis B. Many of these are nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that investigators hope will be more effective than older agents. Experts also are working on treatment guidelines and the use of multi-drug therapy. Vaccination remains the key to preventing hepatitis B and holds the most promise for reducing disease burden.'  
What is the role of liver transplantation in hepatitis B?,"'Liver transplantation has been successful in patients who have irreversible, life-threatening complications of hepatitis B. This includes patients with liver failure due to end-stage cirrhosis or unusually severe (fulminant) hepatitis. Liver transplantation does not cure hepatitis B, and hepatitis may occur in the new liver. The incidence of recurrent hepatitis has been reduced to less than 10% through use of lamivudine and HBIG in transplant recipients. Use of these agents has also improved long-term survival, with 75% of patients alive after five years.' "
What can be done to prevent hepatitis B?,"'Hepatitis B is a preventable disease. Vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis have significantly reduced rates of infection. Risk can also be reduced by avoiding unprotected sex, contaminated needles, and other sources of infection.''The hepatitis B vaccine contains a protein (antigen) that stimulates the body to make protective antibodies. Examples of hepatitis B ''vaccines'' available in the United States include hepatitis B vaccine-injection (''Engerix-B'', Recombivax-HB). Three doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 months) are necessary to assure protection. There are also combination ''vaccines'' on the market that provide protection against hepatitis B and other diseases.''Examples include:''Hepatitis B ''vaccines'' are effective and safe. Most vaccinated individuals form effective antibodies and are protected from hepatitis B when they get full three-dose series of vaccine. In healthcare workers, high-risk public safety workers, ''dialysis'' patients, and sexual partners of infected people, a blood test for antibodies is recommended after vaccination to ensure that the person produced antibodies. For the few who do not form antibodies, revaccination may improve response, especially in infants. However, a small proportion of individuals will never respond to hepatitis B vaccination. Side effects from the vaccine are usually mild and include soreness at the site of injection. The risk of serious ''allergic'' reactions (''anaphylaxis'') is less than one per million doses. Vaccination has reduced the number of new cases of hepatitis B in the United States.''In the United States, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants at birth. Older children and adolescents should receive the vaccine if they did not do so at birth.''Adults in high risk situations also are advised to receive hepatitis B vaccine. This includes:''Centers that serve high-risk individuals are encouraged to provide the vaccine to their clients. Such centers include dialysis units, drug treatment facilities, ''sexually transmitted diseases'' clinics and correctional facilities. Some countries have a high prevalence of hepatitis B in their population. ''Travelers'' who visit these countries for a prolonged period of time (usually six months) and those who may be exposed to blood or semen should consider vaccination.''HBIG is a product that contains antibodies against hepatitis B. When injected, it provides temporary protection against hepatitis B. HBIG is used when people have had significant exposure to the virus. An example would be an accidental needle stick in an unvaccinated health care worker from a needle contaminated with blood from a person with hepatitis B. HBIG should be given as soon as possible after exposure, preferably within seven days. People who need HBIG should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. HBIG also is given to patients with hepatitis B following liver transplantation to suppress the hepatitis B virus in the transplanted liver.''Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to a known case of hepatitis B or to a person at high risk for hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician. Examples of such exposures include needle stick injuries in health care workers or sexual intercourse with an infected person. If the exposure is significant, the physician will recommend vaccination and also may recommend an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is prepared from the plasma of blood donors and contains antibodies to hepatitis B. Vaccination and HBIG can substantially reduce the risk of disease in people exposed to hepatitis B if given within one week of a needle stick or two weeks of sexual intercourse.''Vaccination provides long-term immunity in people who respond to the vaccine. There is no need for HBIG if an exposure occurs to a vaccinated person who is known to respond to the vaccine; however, a blood test might be drawn to verify that the person did respond to the vaccine.''Infected mothers can pass hepatitis B to their newborn infants. All ''pregnant'' women should have blood tested to determine if they are infected. Infants born to infected mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine at birth.' Hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a vaccine - injection (Twinrix), which provides protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

What is hepatitis C infection? How many people are infected?,"'Hepatitis C virus infection is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (also referred to as HCV or hep C). It is difficult for the human immune system to eliminate hepatitis C from the body, and infection with hepatitis C usually becomes chronic. Over decades, chronic infection with hepatitis C damages the liver and can cause liver failure. In the U.S., the CDC has estimated that approximately 41,200 new cases of hepatitis C occurred in 2016. When the virus first enters the body there usually are no symptoms, so this number is an estimate. About 75%-85% of newly infected people become chronically infected. In the U.S., more than 2 million people are estimated to be chronically infected with hepatitis C. Infection is most commonly detected among people who are 40 to 60 years of age, reflecting the high rates of infection in the 1970s and 1980s. There are 8,000 to 10,000 deaths each year in the U.S. related to hepatitis C infection. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and is a risk factor for ''liver cancer''. In 2016, 18,153 death certificates listed HCV as a contributing cause of death; this is believed to be an underestimate.''About 10%-20% of those who develop chronic HCV will develop ''cirrhosis'' within 20-30 years. Progression to cirrhosis may be accelerated by age over 50, male gender, ''alcohol'' consumption, nonalcoholic ''fatty liver disease'' (NASH), co-infection with ''hepatitis B'' or ''HIV'', and immune suppressing ''drugs''. HCV infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation due to liver failure in the U.S.''Those who have cirrhosis from HCV also have a yearly risk of liver ''cancer'' (hepatoma or hepatocellular ''carcinoma'') of about 1%-5%.' "
What is the hepatitis C virus?,"'Hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis C is one of several viruses that can cause viral hepatitis. It is unrelated to the other common hepatitis viruses (for example, ''hepatitis A'' or ''hepatitis B''). Hepatitis C is a member of the ''Flaviviridae'' family of viruses. Other members of this family of viruses include those that cause ''yellow fever'' and ''dengue fever''.''There are at least six different genotypes (''strains'') of the virus which have different genetic profiles (genotypes 1 to 6). In the U. S., genotype 1 is the most common strain of hepatitis C. Even within a single genotype there may be some variations (genotype 1a and 1b, for example). Genotyping is used to guide treatment because some viral genotypes respond better to some therapies than to others.''Like ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), hepatitis C multiplies very fast and attains very high levels in the body. The genes that make the surface proteins of the virus also mutate (change) quickly, and thousands of genetic variations of the virus (""quasi-species"") are produced daily. It is impossible for the body to keep up with making anti-HCV antibodies against all of the quasi-species circulating at one time. It has not been possible yet to develop an effective ''vaccine'' because the vaccine must protect against all genotypes.''Hepatitis C infection in the liver triggers the immune system, which leads to inflammation. About 20%-30% of those acutely infected will experience typical hepatitis symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', ''jaundice'', ''dark urine'' or clay-colored stools. However, chronic hepatitis C usually causes no symptoms until very late in the disease, and hepatitis C has been referred to by sufferers as the ""sleeping dragon."" Over several years or decades, chronic inflammation may cause death of liver cells and scarring (""fibrosis""). Extensive scarring in the liver is called cirrhosis. This progressively impairs vital functions of the liver. Cirrhotic livers are more prone to liver ''cancer''. Drinking alcohol speeds up liver damage with hepatitis C. Concurrent ''HIV'' infection, as well as acute ''hepatitis A'' or B infection, will also accelerate progression to cirrhosis.' "
What are the symptoms of hepatitis C infection?,"'About 70%-80% of people have no symptoms when they first get HCV infection. The remaining 20%-30% may have''Early ''symptoms of hepatitis C'' may include dark urine, yellow eyes, or clay-colored stools though this is unusual. Over time, people with chronic HCV infection may develop signs of liver inflammation that suggests that the infection may be present. Infected individuals may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. The later symptoms and signs of cirrhosis are often absent until inflammation is fairly advanced. As cirrhosis progresses, symptoms and signs increase and may include:'   fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, or fever. Elevated liver enzymes in the blood Weakness Loss of appetite Weight loss Breast enlargement in men (gynecomastia) Redness of the palms of the hands Difficulty with the clotting of blood Spider-like blood vessels on the skin Abdominal pain Clay-colored stools Bleeding from the esophagus Fluid in the abdomen Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Confusion Coma"
What is the contagious period for hepatitis C?,"'Because hepatitis C is transmitted by exposure to blood, there is no specific period of contagiousness. People who develop chronic hepatitis C carry the virus in their blood and, therefore, are ''contagious'' to others for their entire life, unless they are cured of their hepatitis C.' "
How long does it take for symptoms to appear (incubation period) after contracting hepatitis C?,"'This is hard to say for certain what the incubation period for hepatitis C is, because most people who are infected with hepatitis C do not have symptoms early in the course of the infection. Those who develop symptoms early after getting infected (2 to 12 weeks on average, but may be longer) experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms that may not prompt a visit to the doctor.' "
How is hepatitis C spread?," Like HIV and hepatitis B, hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus, or HCV) is spread by exposure to infected blood (blood-borne pathogen). The most common way of getting hepatitis C is from contaminated blood on needles shared by IV drug users. In a multi-state survey in 2017, about 53% of people who inject drugs were estimated to be HCV-infected. Accidental needlesticks in health care workers also have transmitted the virus. The average risk of getting hepatitis C infection from a stick with a contaminated needle is 1.8%. Before 1992, most people acquired the hepatitis C virus from blood transfusions or blood products. Since 1992, all blood products have been screened for hepatitis C, and cases of hepatitis C due to blood transfusion now are extremely rare. Hepatitis C infection also can be passed from mother to unborn child. Approximately 4%-7% of children born to mothers infected with hepatitis C become infected. Hepatitis C is not transmitted by breast milk. However, nipples may crack and bleed during the first few weeks until the nipples are adapted to nursing, and the infant may be exposed to infected blood. If this occurs, breastfeeding should stop, and milk production can be maintained by pumping the milk and discarding it until healed. A very small number of hepatitis C cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse. The risk of hepatitis C transmission from an infected individual to a non-infected spouse or sexual partner without the use of condoms over a lifetime has been estimated to be between 1% and 4%. Hepatitis C is not transmitted by casual contact, kissing, coughing, sneezing, or sharing eating utensils. There is no transmission by bug bites. However, because of the potential for blood exposure, members of the household are advised not to share shaving razors, nail clippers, or toothbrushes. Poor infection control practices during tattooing and body piercing potentially can lead to spread of infection. This may occur in prison or nonprofessional situations, but it has not been reported in licensed, commercial tattooing facilities where it has been studied. There have been some outbreaks of hepatitis C when instruments exposed to blood have been re-used without adequate cleaning and sterilization between patients. Hepatitis C can be transmitted from an organ donor to an organ recipient. Donors of organs are tested for hepatitis C.If the donor who provides the organ is infected with hepatitis C, it is offered to a recipient who also is infected with hepatitis C.For kidney transplant recipients, however, this does not seem to affect long-term outcome after transplantation.For liver transplant recipients who have hepatitis C and receive an organ from a person who is not infected with hepatitis C, the transplanted organ is expected to become infected within a few weeks. Fortunately, newer medications are allowing successful treatment of hepatitis C after transplants, and this area of medicine continues to evolve. If the donor who provides the organ is infected with hepatitis C, it is offered to a recipient who also is infected with hepatitis C. For kidney transplant recipients, however, this does not seem to affect long-term outcome after transplantation. For liver transplant recipients who have hepatitis C and receive an organ from a person who is not infected with hepatitis C, the transplanted organ is expected to become infected within a few weeks. Fortunately, newer medications are allowing successful treatment of hepatitis C after transplants, and this area of medicine continues to evolve."
Can hepatitis C infection affect other organs besides the liver?,"'Most of the signs and symptoms of hepatitis C infection relate to the liver. Less often, hepatitis C infection can affect organs other than the liver.''Hepatitis C infection can cause the body to produce abnormal antibodies called cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins cause inflammation of arteries (''vasculitis''). This may damage skin, joints, and kidneys. Patients with ''cryoglobulinemia'' (cryoglobulins in the blood) may have'""In addition, infected individuals with cryoglobulinemia may develop Raynaud's phenomenon in which the fingers and toes turn color (white, then purple, then red), and become painful at ""'cold'' temperatures.' joint pain, arthritis, a raised purple rash on the legs, and generalized pain or swelling of their bodies."
Who is at high risk and should be tested for hepatitis C infection?,"'The U.S. Preventive Health Services task force recommends that all adults born between 1945 and 1965 be tested once routinely for hepatitis C, regardless of whether risk factors for hepatitis C are present. One-time testing also is recommended for:''People who may have been exposed to hepatitis C in the previous 6 months should be tested for viral RNA load rather than anti-HCV antibody, because antibody may not be present for up to 12 weeks or longer after infection, although HCV RNA may be detectable in blood as soon as 2-3 weeks after infection.''In general, yearly screening may be appropriate for people with ongoing risk factors such as repeated ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') or many sex partners, ongoing IV ''drug use'', or long-term sex partners of people with hepatitis C. Whether or not to test these people is determined on a case-by-case decision.' People who currently inject drugs or snort drugs, or ever did so, even once many years previously People with persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, a liver enzyme found in blood People who have HIV infection Children born to HCV- or HIV-infected mothers People who were ever on long-term hemodialysis People who got a tattoo in an unregulated setting, such as prison or by an unlicensed person People who received clotting factor produced before 1987 People who received transfusions or organ transplants before July 1992, or who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for hepatitis C infection Health care, emergency medical, and public safety workers after a needlestick, eye or mouth exposure to hepatitis C-infected blood"
Is screening for hepatitis C recommended during pregnancy?,"'There is a 4%-7% risk of transmitting HCV from mother to infant with each ''pregnancy''. Currently, there is no CDC recommendation for routine hepatitis C screening during pregnancy, and there is no currently recommended medicine to prevent transmission from mother to infant (prophylaxis). However, CDC is monitoring research findings and may make recommendations in the future as evidence arises.''While data is still limited, a recent study of over 1,000 cases in the United Kingdom found that 11% of infants had been infected at birth, and that these infants were likely to develop cirrhosis in their early 30s. The case for screening for HCV during pregnancy includes the potential to safely treat mothers during pregnancy with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) to treat the mother before cirrhosis develops, prevent infant transmission, and prevent transmission to others. Children born to HCV-infected mothers may also be offered treatment at an early age to prevent cirrhosis, as well as transmission to others. Coordination of care between multiple specialists will be important to accomplish these goals.''Children of HCV-infected mothers may be screened for hepatitis C as early as 1-2 months of age using hepatitis C viral load or ''PCR'' testing (See Blood tests for hepatitis C). Antibodies to hepatitis C passed from the mother to child will be present for up to 18 months, so children should be tested for HCV antibody no earlier than this.' "
What type of doctor treats hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C is treated by either a ''gastroenterologist'', a hepatologist (a gastroenterologist with additional training in ''liver disease''), or an infectious disease specialist. The treatment team may include more than one specialist, depending on the extent of liver damage.Surgeons who specialize in surgery of the liver, including liver transplantation, are part of the medical team and should see patients with advanced disease (liver failure or cirrhosis) early, before the patient needs a liver transplant. They may be able to identify issues that need to be addressed before surgery can be considered. Other persons who can be helpful in managing patients include dietitians to consult on nutritional issues and pharmacists to assist with management of drugs.' "
How is hepatitis C diagnosed?,"'There are several blood tests for the diagnosis of hepatitis C infection. Blood can be tested for antibody to hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibody). It takes about 8-12 weeks on average, and up to 6 months, for antibodies to develop after the initial infection with hepatitis C, so screening for antibodies may miss a few newly infected individuals. Having antibodies is not an absolute indication of active, multiplying hepatitis C virus, but if the antibody test is positive (antibody is present), the statistical probability of active infection is greater than 99%.'""Several tests are available to measure the amount of hepatitis C virus in a person's blood (the viral load). The hepatitis C virus's RNA can be identified by a type of test called ""'polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) that detects circulating virus in the blood as early as 2-3 weeks after infection, so it can be used to detect suspected acute infection with hepatitis C early infection. It also is used to determine whether active hepatitis is present in someone who has antibodies to hepatitis C, and to follow the viral load during treatment.''Blood tests are also performed to identify the genotypes of HCV. Genotypes respond differently to different treatment, so this information is important in selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen.''Estimation of liver fibrosis using blood tests also is quite reliable in diagnosing clinically significant scarring; these include FIB-4, FibroSure, Fibrotest, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).'  "
Liver biopsy and non-invasive tests for hepatitis C,"'The next step is to determine the level of liver scarring that has occurred. ''Liver biopsy'' allows examination of a small sample of liver tissue under a microscope, however, liver biopsy is an invasive test, and has significant risks of bleeding. It also might miss abnormal areas in early disease.''Non-invasive tests have largely replaced liver biopsy except in special situations. Liver ''stiffness'' indicates that advanced liver scarring or cirrhosis may be present. Transient elastography may be used to measure this stiffness by ''ultrasound'' or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'').''Pre-treatment evaluation for hepatitis C also should include:' Testing for HIV Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B and hepatitis A and vaccination if antibodies are not present If past or current hepatitis B infection is detected, it may need to be treated at the same time. There are reports of hepatitis B that reactivated or progressed to serious liver failure or death in some patients who were treated only for hepatitis C. This has been reported to occur during or even after HCV treatment. Recommending abstinence from alcohol use Counseling about measures to prevent the spread of hepatitis C and HIV If cirrhosis is present, vaccination against pneumococcal infection, regardless of age"
What medications cure hepatitis C infection?,"'Interferons, for example, Roferon-A and Infergen, and pegylated interferons such as Peg-Intron''T'', Pegasys, were mainstays of treatment for years. Interferons produced sustained viral response (SVR, or cure) of up to 15%. Later, peglatedll forms produced SVR of 50%-80%. These drugs were injected, had many adverse effects, required frequent monitoring, and were often combined with oral ''ribavirin'', which caused ''anemia''. Treatment durations ranged up to 48 weeks.''Direct-acting anti-viral agents (DAAs) are antiviral drugs that act directly on hepatitis C multiplication.' 

Read Doctor's View
   They are taken by mouth, are well tolerated, and cure over 90% of patients. Treatment time is much shorter, often 12 weeks, depending on drug and genotype. Similar to treatments for HIV, treatment of HCV is most effective if the drugs are given in combination. The earliest options were sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) and simeprevir (Olysio). These were approved by the FDA in 2013. Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (Harvoni) followed as a once-a-day combination pill, in 2014. With this combination of DAAs, about 94%-99% of people achieve an SVR (cure) in 12 weeks with few side effects. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets (Viekira Pak), is a combination approved in 2014. SVR with this combination is 91%-100%. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) was approved in 2016. SVR with this combination depends on the HCV genotype and whether individual patient factors require the addition of ribavirin. Genotype 1 has a 94%-97% SVR, and SVR is 97%-100% in genotype 4. In August 2017, FDA approved an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir (Mavryet) for all HCV genotypes. Unlike some of the earlier regimens, this combination is effective whether or not the patient has cirrhosis. It also can be given to people on kidney dialysis, whose kidney function limits treatment options. Moreover, this regimen is effective in people with genotype 1 who have failed treatment with some of the other regimens."
What are the treatment guidelines for hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C treatment is best discussed with a doctor or specialist familiar with current and developing options as this field is changing, and even major guidelines may become outdated quickly.''The latest treatment guidelines by the American Association for the Study of ''Liver Disease'' (AASLD) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends use of DAAs as first-line treatment for hepatitis C infection. The choice of DAA varies by specific virus genotype, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. In the U.S., specific insurance providers also might influence the choice due to the high cost of DAAs. Although the individual, public health, and cost benefits of treating all patients with hepatitis C is clear, the most difficult barrier to treating all people with HCV is the very high cost of the drug regimens. Patients are encouraged to discuss options with their health care professional.''Treatment is recommended in all patients with chronic hepatitis C unless they have a short life expectancy that is not related to liver disease. Severe life-threatening liver disease may require liver transplantation. Newer therapies with DAAs have allowed more and more patients to be treated.''The ultimate goals of antiviral therapy are to''A side goal is preventing co-infections with other hepatitis viruses, such as A and B, which can cause more liver disease than HCV alone. These can be prevented by ''vaccines'' and treatment.' prevent transmission of hepatitis C, normalize liver tests, reduce inflammation and scarring, prevent progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer, and improve survival and quality of life."
What is the treatment for people with acute hepatitis C infection?,"'When people first get hepatitis C, the infection is said to be acute. Most people with acute hepatitis C do not have symptoms so they are not recognized as being infected. However, some have low-grade ''fever'', ''fatigue'' or other symptoms that lead to an early diagnosis. Others who become infected and have a known exposure to an infected source, such as a needlestick injury, are monitored closely.''Treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Response to treatment is higher in acute hepatitis infection than chronic infection. However, many experts prefer to hold off treatment for 8-12 weeks to see whether the patient naturally eliminates the virus without treatment. Approaches to treatment are evolving. Patients with acute hepatitis C infection should discuss treatment options with a health care professional who is experienced in treating the disease. There is no established treatment regimen at this time.''If the hepatitis C RNA remains undetectable at the end of the treatment and follow-up period, this is called a sustained virologic response (SVR) and is considered a cure. Over 90% of people treated with DAAs are cured. These people have significantly reduced liver inflammation, and liver scarring may even be reversed.''About 5% of people who are treated for HCV infection are not cured by some of the older regimens. These people may still have options for cure with the newer regimens.''Few people with hepatitis C are at risk for problems if they are treated, however there are some factors that affect treatment regimens, such as concurrent HIV medications and kidney dysfunction. Some drugs are not safe for people with cirrhosis. Individuals who are unable to comply with the treatment schedule for psychological reasons or ongoing drug or ''alcohol abuse'' may not be good candidates for treatment because the drugs are very costly and require adherence to ''the pill'' regimen and regular follow-up visits. There are some important ''drug interactions'' with some of the medications that should be considered by the health care professional.''People with past hepatitis B or who have chronic active hepatitis B should not be treated for HCV without treating for ''HBV'' as well. As highly effective treatment for HCV has emerged, reports of serious hepatitis B have come to light. Similar to HCV, hepatitis B usually does not clear from the liver after acute infection, even though it is far less likely to cause chronic active hepatitis than hepatitis C infection. It remains dormant in most people, but it can reactivate with changes in the immune system. It is not clear why eliminating the HCV can allow the HBV infection to flare up. Hepatitis B screening is an important part of the hepatitis C evaluation. Those who have laboratory evidence of active or past infection with HBV should be monitored while receiving HCV treatment.' "
What are the side effects of treatments for hepatitis C infection?,"'Compared to interferons and ribavirin drugs, the side effects of DAAs are far fewer and more tolerable. These side effects usually do not require discontinuation of therapy and are self-limiting after completion of therapy.''Patients with hepatitis B co-infection should be monitored for symptoms of reactivation of hepatitis, which are the same as the symptoms of acute hepatitis. The treating doctor may perform blood screening for this as well.'   The most common side effects of interferon or pegylated interferon include fever, flu-like symptoms, and depression. Patients must be monitored closely for depression. Risk of suicide is a reason to avoid interferons. Interferons also reduce white blood cell and/or red blood cell counts (leucopenia and anemia, respectively). This may cause increased susceptibility to infection. Interferons also increase the risk of certain cancers. Death rarely occurs as a result of therapy, but may occur from progression of liver failure in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Ribavirin most commonly causes anemia due to destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). This can be severe enough that people with heart disease may suffer a heart attack from insufficient blood flow, so people with heart disease should not receive this drug. Anemia improves with a reduction in the dose of ribavirin. Injected growth factor (erythropoietin) that stimulates the production of red blood cells often is used to improve the anemia associated with ribavirin. Ribavirin also accumulates in the testicles and ovaries and causes birth defects in animals. Although no birth defects have been reported in humans, both men and women should use contraceptive measures to avoid pregnancy during and for at least six months after ribavirin treatment. The most common and significant side effects of boceprevir (Victrelis), sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) includefatigue (feeling tired),headache, andtrouble sleeping (insomnia). fatigue (feeling tired), headache, and trouble sleeping (insomnia). The most common side effects of simeprevir (Olysio) includeitching,skin rash, andphotosensitivity (tendency to get sunburns). itching, skin rash, and photosensitivity (tendency to get sunburns). Simeprevir has significant drug interactions with other medications. Certain medications can affect levels of simeprevir in the body and make simeprevir less effective or more toxic. The combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir tablets with dasabuvir tablets (Viekira Pak) is very well tolerated, and the most commonly reported side effects arefatigue,trouble sleeping, anditching. fatigue, trouble sleeping, and itching. The combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir (Zepatier) is well-tolerated.

Use of milk thistle should be discussed with the treating doctor, because it interacts with several DAAs."
Is liver transplantation an option for a person with hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C is the leading reason for 40% to 45% of liver transplants in the U.S. Hepatitis C usually recurs after transplantation and infects the new liver. Approximately 25% of these patients with recurrent hepatitis will develop cirrhosis within five years of transplantation. Despite this, the five-year survival rate for patients with hepatitis C is similar to that of patients who are transplanted for other types of liver disease.''Most transplant centers delay therapy until recurrent hepatitis C in the transplanted liver is confirmed. Oral, highly effective, direct-acting antivirals have shown encouraging results in patients who have undergone liver transplantation for hepatitis C infection and have recurrent hepatitis C. The choice of therapy needs to be individualized and is rapidly evolving.' "
How is monitoring done after treatment for hepatitis C?,"'Once patients successfully complete treatment, the viral load after treatment determines if there is an SVR or cure. If cure is achieved (undetectable viral load after treatment), no further additional testing is recommended unless the patient has cirrhosis. Those who are not cured will need continued monitoring for progression of liver disease and its complications.''While cure eliminates worsening of fibrosis by hepatitis C, complications may still affect those with cirrhosis. These individuals still need regular screening for liver cancer as well as monitoring for esophageal varices that may bleed.''Because hepatitis B co-infection may reactivate or worsen even after treatment for HCV, monitoring for hepatitis symptoms may be needed after the end of therapy.' "
What home remedies are available for hepatitis C?,'At this time there are no effective home or ''over-the-counter'' treatments for hepatitis C.' 
What are the complications of undiagnosed hepatitis C?,"'Over several years or decades, chronic inflammation may cause death of liver cells and cirrhosis (scaring, fibrosis). When the liver becomes cirrhotic, it becomes stiff, and it cannot perform its normal functions of clearing waste products from the blood. As fibrosis worsens, symptoms of liver failure begin to appear. This is called ""''decompensated cirrhosis''"" or ""''end-stage liver disease.''"" Symptoms of end-stage liver disease include:''The liver and spleen have an important function of clearing bacteria from the blood stream. Cirrhosis affects many areas of immune function, including attraction of white blood cells to bacteria, reduced killing of bacteria, reduced production of proteins involved in immune defenses, and decreased life span of white blood cells involved in immune defenses. This may be referred to as having'' cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome'' or CAIDS.' Hepatitis C is known to be associated with two skin conditions, lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda. Diabetes, heart disease, and arterial blockage are more common among patients with chronic hepatitis C infection than in the general population. It may be that liver damage and chronic inflammation caused by hepatitis C may affect the levels of blood fats (lipids) and blood sugar. Low platelet counts may occur as a result of the destruction of platelets by antibodies. Hepatitis C also is associated with B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. Small spider veins begin to appear on the skin as the stiff, scarred liver obstructs the forward flow of blood. Body fluids back up and accumulate in the abdomen (ascites). The spleen enlarges because of back-pressure. Yellowing of eyes and skin (jaundice) occurs because the liver is not clearing bilirubin (a yellow pigment from breakdown of red blood cells) from the blood. A serious complication is severe bleeding from varicose veins that develop in the swallowing tube or esophagus (esophageal varices). Fluid in the abdomen often becomes infected (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and preventive antibiotics may be given for this type of infection. Bacteria also may enter the bloodstream easily (bacterial translocation), referred to as sepsis, especially when esophageal varices bleed. Individuals may succumb to many types of bacterial infections more easily than normal, but some are specific to liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C and fibrosis should avoid being exposed to these bacteria.Vibrio species of bacteria are a serious risk from eating raw oysters or exposure to sea water. Vibrio vulnificus may cause sepsis, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis, a “flesh-eating” infection.Listeria species may cause sepsis and meningitis, and are a risk from unpasteurized dairy products and salty processed meats.Yersinia species may be picked up from raw or undercooked pork, especially intestines (chitterlings).

Yersinia species may be picked up from raw or undercooked pork, especially intestines (chitterlings)."
Can hepatitis C be prevented?,"'Transmission of hepatitis C can be prevented in several ways.''Prevention'' programs aim at needle sharing among drug addicts. Needle exchange programs and education have reduced transmission of hepatitis C infection. However, IV drug users are a difficult to reach population, and rates of hepatitis C remain high among them.''Among health care workers, safe needle-usage techniques have been developed to reduce accidental needlesticks. Newer needle systems prevent manual recapping of needles after use of syringes, which is a frequent cause of accidental needlesticks''There is no clear way to prevent hepatitis C transmission from mother to fetus at this time.''People with multiple sexual partners should use barrier precautions such as condoms to limit the risk of hepatitis C and other sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.''If one partner is infected, monogamous couples may want to consider the low risk of transmission of hepatitis C infection when deciding whether to use condoms during sex. Some couples may decide to use them and some may not.''Screening of the blood supply has almost eliminated the risk of transmission of hepatitis C infection through transfusion.''People with hepatitis C infection should not share razors or toothbrushes with others because of the possibility that these items may be contaminated with blood.''People who want to get a body piercing(s) or ''tattoo''(s) are encouraged to do so only at licensed piercing and tattoo shops (facilities), and verify that the body piercing or tattoo shop uses infection-control practices.''It is critical that physicians and clinics follow manufacturers and regulatory agency directions for sterilizing/cleaning instruments and that disposable instruments be discarded properly. There is no need to use special isolation procedures when dealing with hepatitis C infected patients.' "
What is the prognosis of hepatitis C?,"'In general, among patients with untreated hepatitis C:''Drinking alcohol and acquiring other hepatitis viruses are risk factors for worse liver disease. People with chronic hepatitis C should avoid drinking alcohol and should be screened for antibodies to hepatitis A and B. If they do not have antibodies, they should be vaccinated against these other hepatitis viruses.''People with hepatitis C should be educated about preventing HIV infection. Infection with both HIV and hepatitis C speeds up and worsens liver damage caused by hepatitis C. Hepatitis C also can affect the HIV infection and how it is treated. About 25% of people with HIV infection are co-infected (also infected) with hepatitis C, and up to 90% of IV drug users with HIV are co-infected with hepatitis C. Screening for hepatitis viruses is important in all people infected with HIV, just as screening for HIV is important in people who have hepatitis C.''Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma, or hepatoma) is associated with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis C. Some experts recommend screening patients with hepatitis C infection and cirrhosis for liver cancer periodically.' 75% to 85% become chronically infected, 60% to 70% develop liver disease, 5% to 20% develop cirrhosis, and 1% to 5% will die from complications of cirrhosis or liver cancer."
What is the current research and what is in the future for hepatitis C?,"'As our knowledge of hepatitis C increases, more and more patients are being diagnosed with chronic infection. Current research is very active and includes diagnosis, natural history, treatment, and vaccine development. Thus the field is constantly changing, with new guidelines added frequently.' "
"What is hepatitis C (HCV, hep C)?","'Hepatitis C'' (''HCV'', ''hep C'') is one of several ''viruses'' that cause ''hepatitis'' (inflammation of the ''liver''). It Is hard for the human immune system to eliminate the virus from the body, and 85% of infections with hep C become chronic. Over decades, chronic infection damages the liver and can cause end-stage ''liver disease'' in the form of ''cirrhosis''.''Hepatitis C'' usually it does not cause symptoms or signs even though the damage to organ health is occurring. A person infected with the ''hepatitis C'' virus may have normal or slightly elevated ''liver enzymes'' in the blood (liver enzymes measure liver inflammation). In the U.S., infection with the ''hepatitis'' C virus is the most common cause of chronic hepatitis, and the most common reason for liver transplantation. Chronic infection also is associated with ''liver cancer''.'  "
What are the symptoms and complications of hepatitis C?,"'Hepatitis C infection may cause disease outside of the liver (extrahepatic). Extrahepatic inflammatory conditions may include:''More importantly, chronic inflammation caused by chronic hepatitis C can lead to:''Peole infected with both the hepatitis C virus and ''HIV'' (coinfection) develop ''hardening of the arteries'' and ''diabetes'' much faster, and often die earlier from these conditions than from the ''HIV'' or hepatitis.' Nausea Vomiting Fatigue Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) Pain (arthritis-like pain in joints and muscle pain) Skin (porphyria cutanea tarda) Blood (mixed cryoglobulinemia) Kidney (glomerulonephritis, hemodialysis) Poor health Early or more severe atherosclerosis (heart disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke) Diabetes (high blood sugar). Patients with the virus are three times as likely to develop diabetes."
How do you get hepatitis C? Is it contagious?,"'Hepatitis refers to any cause of liver inflammation, with or without scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). It is ''contagious'', and is ''spread from person-to-person by blood-to-blood contact.'' Other viral causes of hepatitis include ''hepatitis A'', B, C, and E. Other types of noninfectious causes of hepatitis include:'  Excessive alcohol intake Medications such as some prescription medications or even acetaminophen, for example, Tylenol liver damage and drug induced liver disease. Bacteria and viruses other than the hepatitis viruses Transmission of hepatitis A and E: These forms of the virus are acquired from improper hygiene during food or drink preparation by someone who's infected. Transmission of hepatitis B: This form is spread by blood-to-blood or sexual contact."
How is hepatitis C transmitted or spread?,"'Hepatitis C spreads most commonly through inadvertent'' blood-to-blood exposure from sharing needles during intravenous ''drug abuse''.''At room temperature, the hepatitis C virus can survive on surfaces and other objects for up to 3 weeks, but you cannot become infected from surfaces because there is no blood-to-blood contact.' Recreational drugs and HIV-infected men: There is an especially high incidence of HCV in those who inject recreational drugs and share injection equipment or needles, as well as HIV-infected men who have sex with men, thus these individuals should be screened for the disease at least once a year. Sharing razors, toothbrushes, nail clippers, etc.: People with HCV should not share razors or toothbrushes with anyone else, because of the risk of blood-to-blood contact. Sexual contact risks: The risk is very low of acquiring hepatitis C through sexual contact (even in long-term relationships). However, risky behaviors such as unprotected sex with multiple partners without condoms has a higher likelihood of sexual transmission from breaks in the skin. Using drugs and/or alcohol during sex, adds risks for any blood-borne infection, including HCV and HIV. During pregnancy and breastfeeding: The risk is very low of your baby becoming infected inutero or while being breastfed. Casual household items: Casual household contact, like sharing utensils or sharing drinks with someone, does not transmit HCV. Tattooing: The risk of acquiring hepatitis C from tattooing is very low when performed by a licensed professional practitioner who uses proper infection prevention precautions in a facility that passes regular public health inspections. Health care workers have a low risk of getting the disease from accidental needle sticks. The occupational risk for hepatitis C transmission has dropped from 3% to 1.8%. While the virus can be transmitted by blood transfusion, the blood supply has been carefully undergoing screening since 1992, and this risk is very rare."
Can a vaccination prevent hepatitis C?, 
Can hepatitis C be cured?,"'Considerable progress has been made by past ''clinical trials'' in the medical treatment of hepatitis C. The rate of cure has increased (about 95%-98%) with the development of direct-acting, all-oral antiviral regimens, and the length of therapy is much shorter. Treatment recommendations continue to change as new medicines become available. Treatment helps to reduce progression of liver damage to cirrhosis, may prevent liver ''cancer'', and may prevent spread of the infection to other people.' "
Can hepatitis C go away without treatment?,"'About 15% of people who are infected with hepatitis C are able to eliminate it in the first several weeks of infection. At present, there is no clinical sign or test that helps predict which patient will clear the virus and which will develop chronic infection.' "
What drugs cure hepatitis C infection?,"'Most hepatitis C is currently treated with all-oral (""''interferon''-free"") medical regimens of ""direct-acting antivirals"" or DAAs. DAAs is a term used to distinguish these hepatitis C drugs from an older generation of injected medicines (interferon, pegylated interferon) that act indirectly on the immune response to the hepatitis C virus. DAAs act directly on the virus to block different steps in its life cycle. There are several DAAs that are used in combinations that have been scientifically proven to cure hepatitis C. They are not interchangeable, and some are only available combined in one pill or dose pack as a specific combination. DAAs are not used as single-drug therapy because of the high risk of the virus developing resistance and because they work best in combinations. The choice of which regimen to use depends upon the genotype of the virus, the level of liver fibrosis (liver scarring), and any ''drug resistance'' that may be present (for example, someone who has received treatment before, but was not cured).''Examples of combination DAAs with cure rates between 91%-100% include:''Genotype 1a and 1b are the commonest genotypes in the United States. Of all the genotypes, genotype 3 has been the most difficult to treat with DAAs alone and required the use of ''ribavirin'', which has significant side effects. All genotypes can now be treated with oral DAAs without ribavirin. Some genotypes may still require the use of injected pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin if there is no response to DAAs.''The goals of treatment include prevention of cirrhosis and liver ''cancer'', stopping diseases that affect other organs, and preventing transmission to others. Thus people who should have higher priority for treatment include those with advanced liver fibrosis or who may need a ''liver transplant'', those with extrahepatic diseases, and those with risk factors for transmitting HCV, such as women planning pregnancy, IV drug users, and men who have sex with men.''A complete list of all approved hepatitis C used to treat the infection is available at the FDA website.'  Harvoni (edipasvir and sofosbuvir) Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets) Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) Mavyret (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir)"
What are the side effects of hepatitis C drugs?,"'The DAA are overall very well tolerated. This is a major advantage over interferon-based treatments, which may cause many physical and mental side effects, some of which may be life-threatening. An older medicine, ribavirin, is used in certain combinations for retreatment of hepatitis C virus not responding to DAAs. Ribavirin may cause ''anemia'' that may require additional treatment for it.''In the era of highly effective DAAs, a new and unanticipated adverse effect of hepatitis C therapy is flare up of liver inflammation in those who have had ''hepatitis B''.''1 ''This may occur even if ''hepatitis B'' infection resolved years earlier. After early infection, hepatitis B may become ""latent"" or live in the liver cells without causing chronic hepatitis. Treating or eliminating the HCV somehow allows or triggers the hepatitis B to reactivate. This has caused hepatitis B to flare up severely and even cause liver failure in some cases. Some of these cases occurred even after the end of HCV therapy. Therefore people are now screened for hepatitis B antibodies before HCV treatment. If there is evidence of current or past hepatitis B infection medication to suppress hepatitis B is given along with the treatment for hepatitis C. A complete list of approved drugs used to treat hepatitis B is available at the FDA website.' "
How long does it take to cure hepatitis C?,"'Depending on the drug combination, the specific genotype of hepatitis C that is to be treated, any prior treatment, and whether the person has cirrhosis, the duration of medical therapy may be as few as 8 weeks, or up to 24 weeks. Most regimens are for 12 consecutive weeks. This is much shorter than the interferon-based treatments years ago that lasted up to 48 weeks. Generally, a person is not considered ""cured"" until the ""RNA viral load"" is undetectable (there is no hepatitis C detected in the blood) for 24 weeks after therapy is stopped. This is called ""sustained virologic response"" or SVR.''The presence of cirrhosis or liver fibrosis (liver scarring) is determined by ''liver biopsy'', noninvasive fibrosis scans, or formulas that estimate liver fibrosis based on blood tests, such as AST-to-platelet Ratio Index (APRI) or Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index.''3''A very important aspect of treatment is the elimination of all alcohol consumption. Alcohol adds fuel to the fire when it comes to chronic hepatitis. Drinking alcohol greatly worsens liver fibrosis and speeds progression to cirrhosis, and there is no ""safe"" amount to drink for someone with chronic hepatitis. Drinking alcohol also makes it harder for the medications to be effective and may interfere with proper dosing.' "
How much does hepatitis C treatment cost?,"""It is impossible to say what the exact cost is for the various regimens, but it is in the tens of thousands of dollars. In general, out of pocket cost would be very high for the average person, and most people are treated through a health insurer, federal health benefits, or veteran's benefits. The cost of hepatitis C and the care of its complications, however, is much higher over a person's lifetime, and the roughly estimated savings is believed to make treatment a good health and financial investment. Liver transplantation alone may cost several hundred thousand dollars for the procedure alone, followed by several hundred thousand for the medications needed in the first 6 months afterward.""'2'' This does not include the many complications of liver transplantation.''Because negotiations are confidential business contracts, little is known about how much is actually paid for medical treatments by these drugs. One example is the medication sofosbuvir. Estimated costs for a standard 12-week treatment with sosobuvir was $84,000 in the US. Actual costs to individuals depend upon price contracts between pharmaceutical companies and health insurers, as well as government and private organizations. Thus, an individual with healthcare coverage may only pay a monthly co-pay.''4' "
Can I drink alcohol if I have hepatitis C?,"'The combination of any cause of hepatitis, such as alcohol on top of HCV, adds to and accelerates liver damage. Both hepatitis B and C can cause chronic hepatitis and progression to cirrhosis and liver ''cancer'', although the disease is much more likely to become chronic in the U.S. Therefore, people with chronic HCV should not drink alcohol and should talk to a doctor about ''vaccines'' for other hepatitis viruses.' "
What should I know about hepatitis E (hep E) viral infection?,"'Hepatitis E is a viral infection'', which is caused by the hepatitis E virus that usually comes from dirty water. Hep E is uncommon in the U.S., Canada, Northern Europe, and Australia and ''very uncommon ''in the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, and Australia. It is more common in Mexico, Central America, North and Northeast Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Southeast Asia. Most outbreaks of hepatitis E occur in Southeast and East Asia. Hepatitis E viral infection ''causes'' symptoms and signs, for example, soreness and swelling of the liver (hepatitis) and yellow eyes (jaundice).  ''Hepatitis E viral infection symptoms'' and signs include yellow eyes and skin, nausea and vomiting, pain in the right side of the abdomen, dark or brown urine, and light-colored stool. ''Rare complications'' of hepatitis E include severe (""fulminant"") hepatitis, liver failure, and death. ''Hepatitis E can be very serious, especially for pregnant women. ''Up to one-quarter of pregnant women with HEV can die from it. ''Hepatitis E is contagious'' from one week before symptoms start to four weeks afterward. Some people have no symptoms or signs and do not know they are contagious with the infection.''Hepatitis E is diagnosed'' by blood and stool (feces) tests. People with hepatitis E should not (any type of hepatitis) drink alcohol. There are no specific drugs or treatments to ''treat and cure'' hepatitis E, moreover, the only country that has a hep E vaccination is China at this time.''Home remedies and lifestyle changes ''for hepatitis E include rest, keeping hydrated, and avoiding alcohol. A health professional should be consulted before taking any over-the-counter medications, especially those containing acetaminophen. ''Recovery time'' from hepatitis E is about six weeks.''The ''prognosis and life expectancy'' for hepatitis E after recovery is usually good. Most people do not have long-term liver problems from it. Hepatitis E does not cause chronic hepatitis except in some people with weak immune systems, especially after organ transplantation.' "
What is hepatitis E (hep E) viral infection? Who has it?,"'The medical definition of hepatitis E is a kind of inflammation and swelling of the liver that is caused by the hepatitis E virus (hep E). There are about 20 million cases of hep E infections per year in the world. About 3 million of them have symptoms or signs. HEV can be dangerous to some groups of people. About 3.3% of people with hep E infection die. Death rate is much higher in women who are pregnant. Up to one-quarter of pregnant women who get hep E ''may die.'' Most hep E infections happen in parts of the world that have poor sanitation or unsafe water supplies.''The hepatitis E virus exists throughout the world. It is most common in Mexico, Central America, North and East Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Southeast Asia. Cases of hepatitis E are very uncommon in developed countries like the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, and Australia. Most hepatitis E outbreaks occur in Southeast and East Asia. Even though hepatitis E virus is uncommon in the U.S., surveys have shown that up to 20% of Americans have antibodies to it and have probably been exposed. ''HEV can be acute or chronic. Acute hepatitis E is more common than chronic hepatitis E. Acute hepatitis E lasts for a limited time and then goes away. It does not cause lasting or ongoing liver damage after it has run its course. Chronic hepatitis does not go away and is a long-lasting infection of the liver. Chronic viral hepatitis E can cause cirrhosis (liver scarring) over time that leads to liver failure. Chronic hepatitis E is more common in most people with hepatitis C. However, hep E occurs less often than hep B, and very rarely, with hep E can become chronic in people whose immunity is suppressed by drugs given to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ.' "
"What are the signs and symptoms 
of hepatitis E infection?","'Symptoms and signs of HEV infection include fever, poor appetite (not hungry), tiredness, nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting (throwing up), yellow eyes or skin (jaundice), ache in right side of the belly (pain in the liver), soreness in the right side of the belly when pressed (swollen liver), dark or brown urine, light-colored or clay-colored stool, itchy skin, with or without a rash, and painful joints. Symptoms and signs may last for up to six weeks.''Between one in two to one in 13 people with hep E will develop symptoms and signs of acute hepatitis. Often, hepatitis E often causes symptoms and signs in people aged 15 to 40 years. Children generally have no or very mild symptoms and signs.''The fatality rate for most HEV outbreaks is only 1% but may be much higher in women who are pregnant. ' "
How do you get hepatitis E? How does it spread? What are risk factors for HEV infection?,"'Hepatitis C is like hepatitis A. You get both infections by the ""fecal-oral route."" This means that it passes on in endemic areas by eating or drinking food or water contaminated by feces. In poor areas of the world, there may be few options for disposing of human feces or public sanitation. Feces may contaminate water that people use for drinking and cooking. Sometimes sanitation, water, and public health systems break down during wars or natural disasters. In these situations, infection often happens from drinking dirty water. Hepatitis E infection can happen if someone is using dirty water to prepare food. A person who has HEV or is caring for a child with hep E can cause an outbreak if he or she does not wash hands before cooking for others.''Less often, people can get HEV food-borne infection from eating undercooked pork or deer meat or organs (especially liver). Hep E genotype 3 or 4 are most likely to be transmitted by meat. Rarely, raw or undercooked shellfish may pose a risk. It is less likely, but possible, to get transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E. Rarely, a woman who is pregnant can pass HEV infection to her baby.'""Hepatitis E has not been reported to be a sexually transmitted disease (STDs). However, it may be possible that we aren't aware of it yet because it is so uncommon in areas with clean water and sanitation. Hepatitis A spreads the same way as hepatitis E, except it has been transmitted by mouth-to-anus (oral-anal) sex. Theoretically, it is possible for hepatitis E infection to spread like an STD."" "
Is hepatitis E contagious?,"'HEV appears in the feces about one week before symptoms and signs begin and may last for up to four weeks. People who are shedding the virus are contagious if they do not wash their hands after using the bathroom. Babies and young children in diapers may be contagious to anyone who handles their diapers without washing their hands afterward. Some people may not be aware they are sick or shedding a virus. ''To prevent the spread of hepatitis E virus (and other infections), people who prepare food or drinks for others should wash their hands with soap and water, whether they feel sick or not. Anyone can start a hepatitis E outbreak without realizing it.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose hepatitis E? Is there a way to test for it?,"'Blood or stool (feces) tests diagnose hepatitis E infection. Blood tests can be used for testing for antibodies against the hepatitis E virus or HEV RNA. Hep C IgM is found during current infection. Hepatitis E IgG detects past infection. Blood and feces can be tested for the presence of hepatitis E virus (hep E) ""viral load"" or ""PCR"". There is no antigen test for the hep E.''Because hepatitis E infections are rare in the U.S., it can cause outbreaks of the infection. Doctors and other health professionals should call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) if they suspect that they have hepatitis E. CDC has a Viral Hepatitis Reference Lab. They offer testing at no cost. Specimens must be ordered by a health professional and shipped by a medical laboratory according to instructions provided by the CDC. Not all commercial laboratories offer these tests, and they are not free of charge.' "
What if you have hepatitis E during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?,"'Pregnant women are at very high risk of problems from hep E infections, especially severe hep E, and acute liver failure. The body shuts down parts of the immune system in order to keep from ""rejecting"" the baby. This makes the second half of pregnancy a time of weakened immunity. Women who get hep C after 12 weeks of pregnancy are more likely to experience severe hepatitis, acute liver failure, loss of the fetus, or even death from liver failure. Death rate (case-fatality or mortality) may be as high as 25% for women infected after 29 weeks.''Breastfeeding is not known to increase the risk of passing hep E infections to infants and toddlers. Collecting and preparing breast milk for bottle feeding requires careful sanitation of equipment, safe storage, and clean hands.' "
What drugs and other therapies are used for the treatment hepatitis E?,"'There is no antiviral drug recommended for most cases of acute hepatitis E at this time. The disease must run its course. For people with weak immune systems from drugs taken to prevent transplant rejection, the doses may be lowered if it is safe to do so.''There is a small amount of experimental evidence for using ribavirin or pegylated interferon-alpha drugs for cases in which hep E becomes a chronic infection. This only happens to people who have weak immunity after organ transplant. These drugs have a lot of side effects and are not used for most people who get acute hep E. If you are pregnant and have hep E talk, talk to your OB/GYN to discuss options for hep E treatment because they can cause birth defects and other serious side effects.' "
Is there a diet for hepatitis E?,"'There are no special foods that should be eaten or avoided if a person has hepatitis E, but alcohol should be completely avoided. Usually, a person with hep E has a poor appetite, and then he or she may lose weight. The best diet for hep E is eating a well-balanced diet with foods that are appealing to the person infected.' "
Can I drink alcohol if I have hepatitis E?,"'Alcohol (like beer, wine, or hard liquor) is inflammatory to the liver, especially a liver that is already sick. Alcohol worsens liver inflammation from hep E. It can increase the risk of severe hepatitis and liver failure from acute viral hepatitis. Alcohol should be completely avoided when a person has any type of hepatitis or liver disease.' "
What home remedies and lifestyle changes are used for the treatment hepatitis E?,"""A person with hepatitis E should listen to their body's signals of fatigue and get plenty of rest. The infected person should be encouraged to at least drink plenty of liquids every day. This is especially important if they have been vomiting, have fevers, or do not feel like taking much by mouth. Alcohol must be eliminated completely with all types of hepatitis (A, B, C, E, D, F, G) until the liver has fully healed.""'If you are pregnant with hepatitis E, eat and keep hydrated, and keep in close contact with your OB/GYN or midwife. He or she may want to monitor you frequently. You may need to be hospitalization to ensure the well-being of you and your baby if you cannot keep up fluids, or if you lose weight at home.'""The liver's most important job is to process chemicals (like drug), toxins, and waste products. This job is weakened during acute hepatitis. Consult your doctor before taking any over-the-counter (OTC) medications. For example, usually acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories) like ibuprofen (Motrin and others) are safe when used for fevers and body aches, but it may need to be limited while the liver is inflamed. The normal dose might create too much damage to the liver to handle and may even cause overdose or more liver damage."" "
What is the recovery time for hepatitis E?,"'In most people with acute hepatitis E infection, it will resolve on its own without specific treatment in one to six weeks. Unlike hepatitis B or C virus, hep E is usually self-limiting and rarely causes chronic infection. This can happen to people with weakened immunity after organ transplantation.' "
What are the complications of treated and untreated hepatitis E?,"""There is no antiviral drug for acute hepatitis E. There is no complication related to lack of treatment. However, dehydration can cause weakness and further reduce the person's ability to take in fluids. It can cause dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension). A person who is not eating may lose fat and muscle mass. This harms the immune functions needed to fight the infection. These complications are especially threatening to a woman who is pregnant. They can cause premature labor, poor fetal growth, or loss of the baby. Her health care professional may decide to monitor her in the hospital when the infection is at its worst. Severe hepatitis may cause acute liver failure that may affect other organ systems. People with weakened immunity who get chronic HEV infection may develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).""'Rarely, complications in organs other than the liver may be related to hepatitis E. Hepatitis E has been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney inflammation), acute pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia in people who have glucose phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), and thrombocytopenia (very low platelets).' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for hepatitis E?,"'Prognosis (outcome) is excellent for most people with hepatitis E infection, and a full recovery is common. Hepatitis E itself does not cause lasting complications or liver damage once the disease runs its course, even in pregnant women or their babies.''Unfortunately, people who have liver disease from other causes, like chronic hepatitis C or cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, can worsen if they get another type of hepatitis viral infection. If the person does contract hepatitis A, B, or E infections on top of their hepatitis C, it may worsen their liver scarring and even shorten their lifespan from liver failure. People who develop chronic hep E because of weakened immunity can develop cirrhosis and liver failure over time, leading death.' "
Can you die from hepatitis E infection? Can it be cured?,"'There is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis E except in China at this time. The only way to prevent hepatitis E is to ensure that you use proper sanitation, dispose of human waste, and proper treatment of water supplies.''If you are pregnant, have received an organ transplant, or have liver problems like cirrhosis, you should protect yourself from hepatitis E by not eating undercooked or raw pork, deer, or seafood.'""While traveling to poorer parts of the world, you can protect yourself against hepatitis E by drinking only purified or chlorinated water and eating only fully cooked foods. Always wash your hands with purified or chlorinated water before handling or eating food or drink to help prevent other diseases that are transmitted the same way, such as traveler' diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever (""'Salmonella'').' "
What is hepatitis?,"""The term '""'hepatitis'""' means inflammation of the ""'liver''. ''Hepatitis'' can be caused by ''viruses'', other infectious agents, ''alcohol'', and other chemicals. The two viruses that most commonly infect the liver are the ''hepatitis A'' virus and the ''hepatitis B'' virus. Although their names are similar, these viruses are not related. They differ in the way they are transmitted from person to person and their ability to cause chronic infection.' "
Hepatitis A vaccine,"'Hepatitis A'' is caused by a virus which is spread predominately through the fecal-oral route when small amounts of infected fecal matter are inadvertently ingested. Infected individuals shed large amounts of the virus in their ''stool'', starting about two weeks before symptoms present, and continue shedding the virus in their ''stool'' for one to three months.''Some patients with hepatitis A infection have no symptoms, and these asymptomatic infections are more common in children.''Most adults experience symptoms including:''Although the symptoms resolve over several weeks, ''fatigue'' can be prolonged. Rarely, ''viral hepatitis'' caused by hepatitis A can lead to liver failure, ''coma'' and death.''Hepatitis A does not cause chronic or persistent infection of the liver. Once a person has recovered from hepatitis A, he or she is immune to reinfection with hepatitis A for life. This is true because effective antibodies are developed against the hepatitis A virus. After infection with hepatitis A, these antibodies provide life-long protection against the virus. The ability of the body to make protective antibodies after infection with hepatitis A led researchers to develop ''vaccines'' against the disease.''Hepatitis A ''vaccine'"" is made of killed hepatitis A viruses and causes the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the hepatitis A virus. In most vaccine recipients, antibodies start to develop immediately after the first dose but do not reach protective levels for 2 to 4 weeks. A second dose of the vaccine is recommended at least six months after the first dose to provide prolonged protection.""'Two hepatitis A ''vaccines'' are currently available in the United States (''Havrix'' and ''Vaqta''). The vaccine is given as an injection into the deltoid muscle of the arm. Both Havrix and Vaqta provide high level protection against hepatitis A. There is also a combination vaccine called hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a-vaccine injection (''Twinrix'') that protects against both hepatitis A and ''hepatitis B''. The dosing schedule for Twinrix is different from the other hepatitis A ''vaccines'' and requires three doses over six months.''In the United States, hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for all children at one year of age. Vaccination also is recommended for individuals in high-risk settings. Examples include:''Side effects of the hepatitis A vaccine usually are mild. Soreness at the site of injection is common. Less commonly, recipients may complain of ''headache'' or ''fatigue''. Serious ''allergic'' reactions are possible, but are rare.'""A second option for protecting people against hepatitis A is to administer antibodies that are already programmed to attack the virus. When people donate blood, the part of the blood carrying antibodies (the 'immune globulin' fraction) can be separated. Because some blood donors are likely to have antibodies against the hepatitis A virus, pooled immune globulin from many donors is likely to contain antibodies against hepatitis A. This immune globulin can be injected into a person at risk for hepatitis A and will provide immediate but temporary protection against infection. Protection with immune globulin lasts two to four months depending on the dose. Immune globulin is used when immediate protection against hepatitis A is required. An example would be someone who is leaving immediately to travel to rural areas of a developing country. Such a ""'traveler'' would also receive hepatitis A vaccine but would not have time to develop antibodies before departure. Immune globulin sometimes is in short supply and should be used only when necessary.''These measures will reduce the risk that the exposed person will contract hepatitis A by 85% to 90% if given within two weeks of exposure.' Close contact with an infected person increases the chances of contracting the virus. Children are particularly contagious because they have lower standards of hygiene and may not appear sick. The hepatitis A virus also may be spread by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated by infected individuals. Much less commonly, contaminated needles or blood may spread hepatitis A. nausea, poor appetite, abdominal pain, fatigue, jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), and dark urine. travelers to developing countries, men who have sex with men, users of illicit drugs, persons needing frequent blood products, and people who have chronic liver disease. If an unvaccinated person is exposed to hepatitis A, he or she should be given the vaccine or immune globulin as soon as possible. Vaccine is used for exposed persons aged one to 40 years. Immune globulin currently is recommended for exposed persons over the age of 40 years."
Hepatitis B vaccine,"'Hepatitis B'' was previously referred to as ""serum hepatitis"" because it usually is spread by the transfer of infected blood or serum (for example, through needle sticks, blood transfusions, ''hemodialysis'', and ''childbirth''). Hepatitis B also is spread through sexual intercourse and may be passed from mother to child. Inadvertent exposure to infected blood or body fluids may occur during tattooing, body piercing, or when sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person. Persons infected with hepatitis B may be asymptomatic or may develop fatigue, ''jaundice'', and ''weight loss''. Rarely - though more commonly than with hepatitis A - acute infection with hepatitis B can cause liver failure and death.''Most infected adults are able to clear the hepatitis B virus from their body and become immune to further infections with hepatitis B. However, some people are not able to clear the hepatitis B virus and it progresses to chronic (persistent) infection and inflammation of the liver. Most infants infected at birth and 25% to 50% of infected children aged 1–5 years have chronic persistent infection.''Chronic infection may be mild or may damage the liver. The majority of individuals with chronic hepatitis B who clear the virus and are ""cured"" still have detectable virus in the liver. However, the importance of this fact is unclear since there is no evidence of consequences to the presence of the virus except that it can be reactivated with immunosuppression. Individuals with hepatitis B virus only in the liver are not infectious. Some people with chronic hepatitis B infection have their lives shortened by complications of ''liver disease'', ''cirrhosis'', or ''liver cancer''.''Vaccination has reduced the number of new cases of hepatitis B by more than 75% in the United States. The hepatitis B vaccine contains a protein (antigen) that stimulates the body to make protective antibodies. Examples of hepatitis B vaccines available in the United States include hepatitis B vaccine-injection (''Engerix-B''\xa0and\xa0Recombivax-HB). Three doses (given at 0, 1, and 6 months) are necessary to assure protection.''There are also combination vaccines on the market that provide protection against hepatitis B and other diseases. For example:''Hepatitis B vaccines are effective and safe. Most vaccinated individuals develop protective antibodies when they get the vaccine and are protected from infection with hepatitis B. Among individuals at high risk for infection with hepatitis B include:''Centers that serve high-risk individuals are encouraged to provide the vaccine to their clients. Such centers include:''A blood test for hepatitis B antibodies is recommended after vaccination to ensure that antibodies have been produced. For the few who do not form antibodies, revaccination may improve the response, especially in infants. However, a small proportion of individuals will never respond to hepatitis B vaccination. Side effects from the vaccine usually are mild, primarily soreness at the site of injection. The risk of serious allergic reactions (''anaphylaxis'') is less than one per million doses.''In the United States, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants at birth. Older children and adolescents should receive the vaccine if they did not receive it at birth. Adults in high risk situations also are advised to receive hepatitis B vaccine.''Some countries have a high prevalence of hepatitis B in their population. ''Travelers'' who visit these countries for a prolonged period of time (usually 6 months or longer) and those who may be exposed to blood or semen should consider vaccination.''Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to a known case of hepatitis B or to a person at high risk for hepatitis B should be evaluated by a physician. Examples of such exposures include needle stick injuries in health care workers or sexual intercourse with an infected person. If the exposure is significant, the physician will recommend vaccination and may also recommend an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is prepared from the plasma of blood donors and contains antibodies to hepatitis B. Vaccination and HBIG can substantially reduce the risk of disease in persons exposed to hepatitis B if given within one week of a needle stick or two weeks of sexual intercourse.''Vaccination provides long-term immunity in people who respond to the vaccine. There is no need for HBIG if an exposure occurs to a vaccinated person who is known to have responded to the vaccine; however, a blood test might be drawn to verify that the person did respond to the vaccine and form antibodies.''Infected mothers can pass hepatitis B to their ''newborn'' infants. All ''pregnant'' women should have blood drawn to determine if they are infected. Infants born to infected mothers should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine at birth. This is 85% to 95% effective in eliminating the risk of hepatitis B infection in the infant.' hepatitis-b-hepatitis-a-vaccine injection (Twinrix), which provides protection against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B; Haemophilus B/hepatitis B vaccine - injection (Comvax) provides protection against hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b (a cause of meningitis); and Pediarix provides protection against hepatitis B, tetanus, pertussis and polio. health care workers, dentists, intimate and household contacts of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, public safety workers who may be exposed to blood products, men who have sex with men, individuals with multiple sexual partners, dialysis patients, injection drug users, persons with chronic liver disease, residents and staff in institutions that care for persons with developmental disabilities, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and persons who require repeated transfusions or blood products. dialysis units, drug treatment facilities, sexually transmitted diseases clinics and correctional facilities."
What is hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare hereditary disease that causes swelling with fluid accumulation of the skin and tissues just beneath the skin (subcutaneous tissue). The disease is unique in each individual. How often the swelling occurs and how severe it is along with its location is variable. If the swelling occurs in throat tissue, it can cause a medical emergency as breathing could be inhibited or stopped by swollen tissue.' "
What are the symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'The main symptom of hereditary angioedema is swelling of the skin that does not cause ''itching'"" that is experienced intermittently. Symptoms last about 2 to 5 days and then slowly decrease. Although people are born with a genetic defect, the symptoms start in childhood and worsen during teenage years. Many people don't know they have HAE until they are diagnosed in adulthood.""'These symptoms may occur with hereditary angioedema:'  Swelling of the skin (note that above symptoms may occur before swelling begins) Extreme fatigue or tiredness Headache Muscle aches Tingling in the skin Abdominal or belly pain (may be extreme enough to lead to surgical exploration) Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Hoarseness Shortness of breath Mood changes Swelling of the hands and feet Laryngeal edema that can actually result in asphyxiation Multiple reoccurrence of the above symptoms"
What are the types or forms of hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'There are three forms or types of hereditary angioedema. They are distinguished by laboratory tests and genetic testing. The disease is inherited as autosomal dominant gene, meaning only one abnormal gene is required from a parent for the offspring to inherit the disease.' Type I HAE is caused by low levels of C1 inhibitor protein. Type II HAE is characterized by normal or elevated levels of dysfunctional C1 inhibitor protein. Type III is identified as an estrogen-dependent form of angioedema occurring mainly in women and is a result of mutations in the gene for coagulation factor XII."
What causes hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"""The cause of hereditary angioedema is due to a problem with a gene that produces a protein termed C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). The problem with the autosomal dominant gene is that it does not produce enough C1 inhibitor (a protein that inhibits the complement system from self-activation) so that the body allows fluid to escape from tiny blood vessels into many different areas. The swelling can occur very quickly almost anywhere in the person's body. In addition, there are various triggers that cause an individual to have an attack of hereditary angioedema (see the triggers section). Males and females have about a 50-50 chance of inheriting the disease if one of their parents has HAE."" "
What triggers hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'Although some attacks of HAE may occur for no known reason, other attacks are caused by certain triggers. Some of the most common HAE triggers include:' Stress Anxiety Minor injuries Surgical procedures Dental procedures Illnesses (for example, colds, flu, pneumonia) Intermittent physical activities (using a lawn mower, starting a construction project, for example) Medications Menstrual periods Pregnancy Hormone therapy"
What about pregnancy and hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'Females who are pregnant and have ''abdominal pain'' may be difficult to diagnose, but they can be treated with the same medications as other hereditary angioedema patients in consultation with her OB/GYN.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"""Although the patient's primary care doctor and/or pediatrician can help manage hereditary angioedema, consultants in the specialties of genetics, internal medicine, allergists, immunologists, dermatologists and OB/GYN are frequently consulted."" "
How is hereditary angioedema (HAE) diagnosed?,"'Hereditary angioedema is sometimes difficult to diagnose because of the irregularity of attacks and because some symptoms mimic other diseases. Patients that have a parent with hereditary angioedema have a good possibility of inheriting the disease (about 50%), so the family genetics history is part of the diagnostic workup if hereditary angioedema is suspected. A serum C4 level is considered a reliable and cost-effective screening test for hereditary angioedema as it is almost always decreased during attacks, and usually is low in between attacks. In addition, the three types of HAE are characterized by genetic testing and by blood tests of complement levels such as C1, C2, and C4. Ultrasound, CT scan and X-rays may show fluid accumulation in various tissues.' "
What are the treatment guidelines for hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'The World Allergy Organization (WAO) issued the these guidelines for HAE Types I and II in 2013:'  Assess all patients suspected of having HAE-I/II for blood levels of C4, C1 esterase inhibitor (C-INH) protein, and C1-INH function. Consider on-demand treatment for all hereditary angioedema attacks that (1) result in debilitation/dysfunction and/or (2) involve the face, neck, or abdomen. Attacks affecting the upper airways must be treated. Treat all hereditary angioedema attacks as early as possible with C1-INH, Kalbitor (ecallantide), or Firazyr (icatibant); do not use oral anti-fibrinolytics as on-demand treatment. Consider intubation or tracheotomy early in progressive upper airway edema. Administer adjuvant therapy in hereditary angioedema attacks when indicated, but use specific therapies without delay when indicated. All HAE-I/II patients should have on-demand treatment for two attacks and carry their on-demand treatment at all times. Plasma-derived C1-INH is the preferred on-demand therapy for HAE-I/II attacks in children and for pregnant females or women who are breastfeeding.  All individuals with HAE should have an action plan, product available to treat HAE attacks, and an HAE identification card. Self-administration of treatment should be taught to all individuals whom are licensed for self-administration to give or be given on-demand treatment of HAE. All individuals with HAE should have at least one annual assessment by an HAE specialist."
How can a person with hereditary angioedema (HAE) avoid triggers and manage the disease?,"""In addition, the WAO's 2013 recommendations regarding prophylaxis, and screening in hereditary angioedema are:"" Consider administering short-term pre-procedural prophylaxis, particularly in cases involving dental/intraoral surgery, bronchoscopy or endoscopy, endotracheal intubation, or manipulation of the upper airway or pharynx. Before beginning long-term prophylaxis with androgens, a person with HAE should be assessed for cardiac risk factors, and obtain a complete blood count (CBC), urine analysis, liver function test results, lipid profile, and liver ultrasonography. During the use of androgens for long-term prophylaxis, and for 6 months after cessation of therapy, the person's CBC, urine analysis, lipid profile, liver function test results, and blood pressure should be monitored every 6 months, and an annual ultrasonography of the liver should be performed. Defer screening children for HAE-I/II until the age of 12 months. Test all offspring of an affected parent. Family members of people with HAE (I or II) should be screened so that appropriate therapy can be available for treatment. People with HAE-I/II receiving blood products including Plasma-derived C1-INH should receive a hepatitis A and B vaccination. All individuals with HAE-I/II should receive an influenza vaccine. Guidelines are subject to change as newer drugs and modifications of treatment protocols are made available. People with HAE are urged to discuss their treatments and treatment changes, if any, with their health-care professional(s)."
Tips for managing and living with hereditary angioedema (HAE),"""Parents of children and teenagers should discuss their child's diagnosis with all family members and caregivers so that they are well-informed about the disease. It especially important to know what to do if there's any swelling in the throat because that constitutes a medical emergency."" Share your medical history (especially that you have HAE) with emergency medical responders, because it could be lifesaving. Symptoms like laryngeal swelling mimic allergic responses, and medications such as epinephrine or cortisone, commonly used to treat allergic reactions, have little or no effect on hereditary angioedema-induced laryngeal swelling. As stated by the WHO previously, people with hereditary angioedema should carry with them two treatments for acute HAE attacks at all times. It may be useful to keep a notebook about hereditary angioedema attacks so that you or your child can begin to identify triggers that precipitate HAE. As previously noted there are some common triggers (surgery, dental procedures, for example) of HAE. Consequently, it is possible to prophylactically treat people with HAE in advance of these potential triggers to avoid a hereditary angioedema attack. Remember that it is possible to recognize some symptoms that occur in some individuals just before an HAE attack starts. Recognizing those symptoms in an individual can allow them to treat themselves immediately to stop or lessen symptoms of HAE. Once diagnosed with hereditary angioedema, with the help of their health-care professional(s), people with HAE and/or their family members may be put in contact with others that have the same diagnosis, and they may learn other ways people with HAE have developed to manage their disease."
What are the complications of hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"""The most dangerous complication of hereditary angioedema is laryngeal edema, which can result in a rapidly advancing shortness of breath to complete airway obstruction within a few hours. Other complications can include visual disturbances, difficulty walking, and even some scarring in areas where the swelling has cut off or decreased blood flow to the body's tissues."" "
What is the prognosis for a person with hereditary angioedema (HAE)?,"'There is no known cure for hereditary angioedema. The prognosis for an individual with hereditary angioedema ranges from good to fair. Those who are undiagnosed have a poorer prognosis as they may receive treatments for symptoms of hereditary angioedema that simply are not effective. Once diagnosed, better awareness of their disease process and current medications allow optimal control and/or management of symptoms. Research in hereditary angioedema is ongoing (see reference 2).' "
What is a hiatal hernia (definition)?,'The ''esophagus'' connects the throat to the stomach. It passes through the chest and enters the abdomen through a hole in the ''diaphragm'' called the esophageal hiatus. The term hiatal ''hernia'' describes a condition where the upper part of the stomach that normally is located just below the diaphragm in the abdomen pushes or protrudes through the esophageal hiatus to rest within the chest ''cavity''.'  
What does a hiatal hernia feel like (symptoms and signs)?,"'Hiatal hernias do not cause\xa0symptoms, and most are found incidentally when a person has a ''chest X-ray'' or abdominal ''X-rays'', including;''Unfortunately, the esophagus does not have a similar protective lining. Instead, it relies on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a band of muscle located at the junction of the stomach and esophagus, and the muscle of the diaphragm surrounding the esophagus to act as a valve to prevent acid from refluxing from the stomach into the esophagus.''Moreover, to the esophageal sphincter (LES), the normal location of the stomach and esophageal junction within the abdominal ''cavity'' is important in keeping acid where it belongs. There is increased pressure within the abdominal cavity compared to the chest cavity, particularly during inspiration which would normally cause the acid and contents from the stomach to reflux back into the esophagus, but the combination of pressure exerted within the lower mostly is from the esophageal sphincter (LES), and the muscle of the diaphragm create a zone of higher pressure that keeps stomach acid in the stomach.''In the situation of a sliding hiatal hernia, the gasatroesophageal\xa0and esophagus junction moves above the diaphragm and into the chest, and the portion of the higher-pressure zone due to the diaphragm is lost. Acid is allowed to reflux back into the esophagus causing inflammation of the lining of the esophagus.\xa0''The ''symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') include''People of any age can get a hiatal hernia\xa0from infants to the elderly. Fortunately, it is very rare.''Usually, people with a paraesophageal sphincter\xa0have no symptoms of reflux because the gastroeophageal esophagus\xa0junction remains below the diaphragm, but if the hernia is large, the way the stomach rotates into the chest, there is the possibility of volvulus of the stomach in which the stomach twists upon itself. Fortunately, paraesophageal hernias are relatively uncommon.''Rarely, gastric volvulus of the stomach in which an abnormal rotation of the stomach more than 180 degrees is a surgical emergency and causes difficulty with'

In some people with a hiatal hernia, it refluxes into the lower esophagus that sets off nervous reflexes that can cause a cough or even spasm of the small airways within the lungs people. Rarely, some people with a hiatal hernia, it may reflux acid droplets into the back of their throat. This acid can be inhaled or aspirated into the lung causingcoughing spasms,asthma, orrepeated lung infections including pneumonia and bronchitis. coughing spasms, asthma, or repeated lung infections including pneumonia and bronchitis. painful swallowing, chest pain, and vomiting."
What causes a hiatal hernia? What does it look like (pictures)?,"'Normally, the space\xa0where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm is sealed by the phrenoesophageal membrane, (a thin membrane of tissue connecting the esophagus with the diaphragm) where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm.\xa0 Thus, the chest cavity and abdominal cavity are separated from each other. Because the muscles of the esophagus tighten and the esophagus shortens with each swallow, essentially squeezing food into the stomach, this membrane needs to be elastic to allow the esophagus to move up and down.''Normal physiology allows the gastroeophageal junction, where the esophagus and stomach meet, to move back and forth within the hiatus. However; at rest the gastroeophageal junction should be located below the diaphragm and in the abdominal cavity. It is important to remember that these distances are very short.''Over time, the phrenoesophageal membrane may weaken, and a part of the stomach may herniate through the membrane.\xa0 It may remain above the diaphragm permanently or move back and forth across the diaphragm.''Hiatal hernias are common, and in the majority of cases the cause is unknown.\xa0They may be present at birth or develop later in life.' Pregnancy: Theoretically, decreased abdominal muscle tone and increased pressure within the abdominal cavity could lead to the development of a hiatal hernia. Thus, people who are obese and women who are pregnant may be at an increased risk for developing a hiatal hernia although this has not been demonstrated. Constipation and vomiting: People who have repetitive vomiting or those who have constipation and strain to have a bowel movement, increase the intra-abdominal pressure when they strain, and this may weaken the phrenoesophageal membrane. The membrane also may weaken and lose its elasticity as a part of aging. Ascites: Ascites is an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which is often seen in people with liver failure, also may be associated with the development of a hiatal hernia."
What are the types of hiatal hernias?,"'There are three types of hiatal hernias.'   Sling hiatal hernia: A sliding hiatal hernia is the most common type of hiatal hernia is a sliding hiatal hernia.A sliding hiatal hernia accounts for 95% of all hiatal hernias. In a sliding hernia, a portion of the stomach slides upward through the diaphragm and into the chest such that the junction of the esophagus and stomach (gastro- esophageal junction) lies in the chest.A sliding hernia is present during inspiration when the diaphragm contracts and descends toward the abdominal cavity and when the esophagus shortens during swallowing, but at rest it is not present. A sliding hiatal hernia accounts for 95% of all hiatal hernias.  In a sliding hernia, a portion of the stomach slides upward through the diaphragm and into the chest such that the junction of the esophagus and stomach (gastro- esophageal junction) lies in the chest. A sliding hernia is present during inspiration when the diaphragm contracts and descends toward the abdominal cavity and when the esophagus shortens during swallowing, but at rest it is not present. Paraesophageal hernia: A paraesophageal hernia accounts for only 5% of hiatal hernias, the gap in the the diaphragm through which the hernia occurs, phrenoesophageal membrane is larger, and a portion of the stomach herniates into the chest alongside the esophagus and stays there, but the junction between the stomach and the esophagus remains below the diaphragm. Paraesophageal and sliding: In a combination of events, should the defect in the diaphragm become larger, the junction between the stomach and the esophagus can herniate through the diaphragm into the chest causing a hernia that is both paraesophageal and sliding."
What procedures and tests diagnose hiatal hernias?," X-rays, EDG, and CT scan: Most often, a hiatal hernia is found incidentally with gastrointestinal X-rays, EGD, and sometimes CT scan, since by itself, it causes no symptoms. Only when there are associated symptoms of GERD will that usually need treatment. With symptoms of GERD, it is likely that a hiatal hernia is present since most people with GERD have hiatal hernias. Barium swallow or upper GI series: Often, the diagnosis of a hiatal hernia is confirmed by a barium swallow or upper GI series, where a radiologist uses fluoroscopy to observe in real time as the swallowed barium outlines the esophagus, stomach and upper part of the small intestine. In addition to seeing the anatomy, the radiologist also can comment upon the movement of the muscles that work to propel the barium (and presumably) food through the esophagus into the stomach and beyond. Endoscopy: Endoscopy is a procedure performed under sedation by a gastroenterologist to look at the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A hiatal hernia may be diagnosed easily in this manner and more importantly, the physician may be able to see complications of GERD from the reflux of acid. Endoscopy is used to diagnose scarring with strictures (narrowing of the esophagus) and precancerous conditions like Barrett's esophagus. Biopsies or small tissue samples may be taken and examined under a microscope."
What is the treatment for hiatal hernias?,"'The treatment for hiatal hernia is really treatment for GERD and minimizing ''acid reflux''. This includes'

When is surgery for a hiatal hernia necessary?,"'Most often, the surgery is done as a minimally invasive procedure using a laparoscope. While there are different techniques, the results are similar and the best option is usually the one the surgeon feels most comfortable performing in a specific situation.''Proton pump inhibitor medications:'' With the development of proton pump inhibitor medications, medical therapy has decreased the necessity of surgery for sliding hiatal hernias, and it is often only recommended for people who have failed aggressive drug treatment or who have developed complications of GERD include\xa0''Paraesophageal hernias:'' People with paraesophageal hernias often have no symptoms, and surgery is required only if the hernias become trapped in the chest and become stuck in the diaphragmatic hiatus or rotate to cause a volvulus.

What is an abdominal hernia?,"'An abdominal hernia occurs when an organ or other piece of tissue protrudes through a weakening in one of the muscle walls that enclose the abdominal ''cavity''. The sac that bulges through the weak area may contain a piece of intestine or fatty lining of the colon (omentum) if the hernia occurs in the abdominal wall or groin. If the hernia occurs through the ''diaphragm'', the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, part of the stomach may be involved.''The abdominal wall is made up of layers of different muscles and tissues. Weak spots may develop in these layers to allow contents of the abdominal ''cavity'' to protrude or herniate. The most common abdominal hernias are in the groin (''inguinal hernia''), in the diaphragm (''hiatal hernia''), and the ''belly button'' (''umbilical hernia''). Hernias may be present at birth (congenital), or they may develop at any time thereafter (acquired).' "
What are the different types of abdominal hernias?,"'The abdominal wall is made up of two sets of muscles on each side of the body that mirror each other. They include the rectus abdominus muscles, the internal obliques, the external obliques, and the transversalis.'   Inguinal hernias are the most common of the abdominal hernias. The inguinal canal is an opening that allows the spermatic cord and testicle to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum as the fetus develops and matures. After the testicle descends, the opening is supposed to close tightly, but sometimes the muscles that attach to the pelvis leave a weakened area. If later in life there is a stress placed on that area, the weakened tissues can allow a portion of small bowel or omentum to slide through that opening, causing pain and producing a bulge. Inguinal hernias are less likely to occur in women because there is no need for an opening in the inguinal canal to allow for the migration and descent of testicles. A femoral hernia may occur through the opening in the floor of the abdomen where there is space for the femoral artery and vein to pass from the abdomen into the upper leg. Because of their wider bone structure, femoral hernias tend to occur more frequently in women. Obturator hernias are the least common hernia of the pelvic floor. These are mostly found in women who have had multiple pregnancies or who have lost significant weight. The hernia occurs through the obturator canal, another connection of the abdominal cavity to the leg, and contains the obturator artery, vein, and nerve. When epigastric hernias occur in infants, they occur because of a weakness in the midline of the abdominal wall where the two rectus muscles join together between the breastbone and belly button. Sometimes this weakness does not become evident until later in adult life as it appears as a bulge in the upper abdomen. Pieces of bowel, fat, or omentum can become trapped in this type of hernia. The belly button, or umbilicus, is where the umbilical cord attached the fetus to mother allowing blood circulation to the fetus. Umbilical hernias cause abnormal bulging in the belly button and are very common in newborns and often do not need treatment unless complications occur. Some umbilical hernias enlarge and may require repair later in life. Spigelian hernias occur on the outside edges of the rectus abdominus muscle and are rare. Incisional hernias occur as a complication of abdominal surgery, where the abdominal muscles are cut to allow the surgeon to enter the abdominal cavity to operate. Although the muscle is usually repaired, it becomes a relative area of weakness, potentially allowing abdominal organs to herniate through the incision. Diastasis recti is not a true hernia but rather a weakening of the membrane where the two rectus abdominus muscles from the right and left come together. The diastasis causes a bulge in the midline. It is different than an epigastric hernia because, the diastasis does not trap bowel, fat, or other organs inside it. Hiatal hernias occur when part of the stomach slides through the opening in the diaphragm where the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen. A sliding hiatal hernia is the most common type and occurs when the lower esophagus and portions of the stomach slide through the diaphragm into the chest. Paraesophageal hernias occur when only the stomach herniates into the chest alongside the esophagus. This can lead to serious complications of obstruction or the stomach twisting upon itself (volvulus). Traumatic diaphragmatic hernias may occur due to major injury where blunt trauma weakens or tears the diaphragm muscle, allowing immediate or delayed herniation of abdominal organs into the chest cavity. This may also occur after penetrating trauma from a stab or gunshot wound. Usually these hernias involve the left diaphragm because the liver, located under the right diaphragm, tends to protect it from herniation of bowel. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are rare and are caused by failure of the diaphragm to completely form and close during fetal development. This can lead to failure of the lungs to fully mature, and it leads to decreased lung function if abdominal organs migrate into the chest. The most common type is a Bochdalek hernia at the side edge of the diaphragm. Morgagni hernias are even rarer and are a failure of the front of the diaphragm."
What causes an abdominal hernia?,"'A hernia may be congenital and present at birth or it may develop over time in areas of weakness within the abdominal wall. Increasing the pressure within the abdominal cavity can cause ''stress'' at the weak points and allow parts of the abdominal cavity to protrude or herniate.''Increased pressure within the abdomen may occur in a variety of situations including''The pressure may increase due to lifting excess weight, straining to have a bowel movement or urinate, or from trauma to the abdomen. ''Pregnancy'' or excess abdominal weight and girth are also factors that can lead to a hernia.'   chronic cough, increased fluid within the abdominal cavity (ascites), peritoneal dialysis used to treat kidney failure, and tumors or masses in the abdomen."
What are the risk factors for a hernia?,"'Increased intra-abdominal pressure may lead to weakening of a portion of the abdominal wall, either acutely or gradually over time. Some risk factors include the following:' Chronic constipation Chronic cough Recurrent vomiting Obesity Ascites (an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity) Peritoneal dialysis Abdominal masses Pregnancy Abdominal surgeries (a risk for incisional hernias) Repeatedly moving or lifting heavy objects"
What are the signs and symptoms of an abdominal hernia?,"'Most people can feel a bulge where an ''inguinal hernia'' develops in the groin. There may be a burning or sharp ''pain'' sensation in the area because of inflammation of the inguinal nerve or a full feeling in the groin with activity. If a hernia occurs because of an event like lifting a heavy weight, a sharp or tearing pain may be felt. However, many people do not have any complaint other than a feeling of fullness in the area of the inguinal canal.''Complications occur when a piece of intestine or omentum becomes trapped (incarcerated) in the hernia sac. A piece of bowel may enter the hernia and become stuck. If the bowel swells, it can cause a surgical emergency as it loses its blood supply and becomes strangulated. In this situation, there can be significant pain and ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', signaling the possible development of a bowel obstruction. ''Fever'' may be associated with strangulated, dead bowel.'""A Richter's hernia is an uncommon type of hernia that leads to strangulation. Only one part of the bowel wall becomes stuck in the hernia. It won't necessarily cause a complete bowel obstruction initially, since the passageway of the intestine still allows bowel contents to pass, but that portion of bowel wall that is trapped can start to swell, strangulate, and die.""'Femoral and obturator hernias present in much the same way as inguinal hernias, though because of their anatomic location, the fullness or lumps may be much more difficult to appreciate.''Umbilical hernias are easy to appreciate and in adults often pop out with any increase in abdominal pressure. The complications again include incarceration and strangulation.''A hiatal hernia does not cause many symptoms by itself, but when a sliding hernia occurs, the abnormal location of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction above the diaphragm affects its function and stomach contents can reflux into the esophagus. Gastroesophageal reflux (''GERD'') may cause burning ''chest pain'', epigastric pain and burning in the upper abdomen,\xa0''nausea'', vomiting, and a sour taste from stomach acid that washes into the back of the throat.''A sports hernia is a tear or strain of any tissue in the lower abdomen or groin. It causes pain in the groin or inguinal area. It can involve any soft tissue, including muscle, tendon, or ligament and can be initiated by physical activity, usually involving twisting or blunt force trauma to the abdomen.'  "
What types of medical professionals treat and repair hernias?,"'Most often, primary care providers are the first to diagnose and treat a hernia. For hiatal hernias, usually medical, not surgical, care is needed and controlling the ''symptoms of GERD'' is the primary goal. Occasionally, a ''gastroenterologist'' will be involved in the care to assess the severity of ''GERD''. Some hiatal hernias do require surgery and a general surgeon and/or a thoracic surgeon performs the operation, depending upon the location of the organs in the stomach or chest and the size of the defect in the diaphragm.''While primary care providers make the diagnosis of an abdominal wall hernia, it is the general surgeon who performs the operation and repairs the hernia.''When a hernia becomes incarcerated, often the patient goes to the emergency department and the doctor there makes the diagnosis and sometimes can push the hernia back into place (reduced). If the hernia is reduced, referral as an outpatient to a general surgeon may be an option. If the hernia remains trapped (incarcerated) or if there is concern that the hernia is strangulated, an immediate consultation with a surgeon is required.''Hernias in the ''neonatal'' period are often recognized by the pediatrician or family doctor in the delivery suite or the ''newborn'' nursery. A pediatric surgeon may be consulted for their evaluation.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose abdominal hernias?,"'For inguinal hernias, most patients notice a feeling of fullness or a lump in the groin area with pain and burning. Physical examination can usually confirm the diagnosis. Femoral or obturator hernias are more difficult to appreciate and symptoms of recurrent inguinal or ''pelvic pain'' without obvious physical findings may require a ''CT scan'' to reveal the diagnosis. Umbilical hernias are much easier to locate with the bulging of the belly button.''Hernias that are incarcerated or strangulated present a greater challenge since the potential complication of dead bowel increases the urgency. The health care professional seeks clues of obstruction, including a history of pain, nausea, vomiting, or ''fever''. During a physical examination, a doctor may often discover that a patient has a markedly tender abdomen. These hernias are often exquisitely tender and firm. The exam may be enough to suspect incarceration or strangulation and require immediate consultation with a surgeon. Doctors may use ''X-rays'' or ''CT scans'' to confirm the diagnosis, depending upon the clinical situation.'""Doctors may be able to diagnose hiatal hernias associated with GERD by learning a patient's medical history during his or her physical exam. A ""'chest X-ray'' can reveal part of the stomach within the chest. If there is concern about complications including esophageal inflammation (''esophagitis''), ulcers, or bleeding, a gastroenterologist may need to perform an ''endoscopy''.' "
What types of surgery repair an abdominal hernia?,"'Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the U.S. with almost a million operations occurring each year. Most abdominal wall hernias are repaired electively when the health of the patient can be maximized to decrease the risk of both the surgery and the anesthetic.'""Surgery to repair a hernia may use a laparoscope or an open procedure called a herniorrhaphy, where the surgeon directly repairs the hernia through an incision in the abdominal wall. The type of operation depends upon the clinical situation and the urgency of surgery. The decision as to which operation to perform depends upon the patient's clinical situation.""'Other abdominal wall hernias can similarly be repaired to strengthen the defect in the abdominal wall and decrease the complication risk of bowel incarceration and strangulation.''Sliding hiatal hernias may be treated surgically to place the stomach back into the abdominal cavity and to strengthen the gastroesophageal junction. However, doctors do not routinely offer surgery because most symptoms are due to GERD and medical therapy is often adequate. Medication, ''diet'', lifestyle changes, and ''weight loss'' may help control symptoms and minimize the need for surgery.''Paraesophageal hernia repair is done to prevent the complication of strangulation or volvulus.'  "
What nonsurgical treatments are available for an abdominal hernia?,"'If an inguinal or umbilical hernia is small and does not cause symptoms, a watchful waiting approach may be reasonable. Routine follow-up may be all that is needed, especially if the hernia does not grow in size. However, if the hernia does grow or if there is concern about potential incarceration, then surgery may be recommended. Patients who are at high risk for surgery and anesthesia may be offered a watch and wait approach.''Trusses, corsets, or binders can hold hernias in place by placing pressure on the skin and abdominal wall. These are temporary approaches and potentially can cause skin damage or breakdown, and infection because of rubbing and ''chafing''. They are often used in older or debilitated patients when the hernia defect is very large and there is an increased risk of complications should they undergo surgery.''Unless the defect is large, umbilical hernias in children tend to resolve on their own by 1 year of age. Surgery may be considered if the hernia is still present at age 3 or 4, or if the defect in the umbilicus is large.''Hiatal hernias by themselves do not cause symptoms. Instead it is the ''acid reflux'' that causes ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (GERD). Treatment is aimed at decreasing acid production in the stomach and preventing acid from entering the esophagus. For more, please refer to the ''Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease'' (GERD) article.' "
What are hernia complications?,"'The major complication of a hernia is incarceration, where a piece of bowel or fat gets stuck in the hernia sac and cannot be reduced. Swelling can occur to the point that blood supply to the tissue is lost and it dies. This is called a strangulated hernia.''If a hiatal hernia is large, part of the stomach and esophagus can displace into the chest. Depending on the situation and anatomy, the stomach can twist (volvulus), potentially leading to strangulation. This is a surgical emergency.' "
What is the prognosis for an abdominal hernia?,"'Most patients who undergo elective hernia repair do well. Incisional hernias may recur up to 10% of the time. The prognosis for patients who undergo emergent hernia repair because of incarcerated or strangulated bowel depends upon the extent of surgery, how much intestine is damaged, and their underlying health and physical condition prior to the surgery. For this reason, elective hernia repair is much preferred.' "
Is it possible to prevent an abdominal hernia?,"'While congenital hernias cannot be prevented, the risk of developing a hernia that occurs as life goes on can be minimized. The goal is to avoid an increase in pressure within the abdomen that could stress the weak areas in the abdominal wall.' Maintain a healthy weight. Eat a healthy diet and exercise routinely to minimize the risk of constipation and straining to have a bowel movement. Use proper lifting techniques especially when trying to lift heavy objects. This is important to remember at work, home, and in sports. Stop smoking to decrease recurrent coughing. If a hernia develops, seek medical care to have it evaluated and potentially treated before it gets too large or becomes incarcerated."
How are the spine and its discs designed?,"'The vertebrae are the bony building blocks of the spine. Between each of the largest parts (bodies) of the vertebrae are the discs. Ligaments are situated around the spine and discs. The spine has seven vertebrae in the neck (cervical vertebrae), 12 vertebrae in the mid-back (thoracic vertebrae), and five vertebrae in the low back (lumbar vertebrae). In addition, in the mid-buttock, beneath the fifth lumbar vertebra, is the ''sacrum'', followed by the tailbone (''coccyx'').''The bony spine is designed so that vertebrae ""stacked"" together can provide a movable support structure while also protecting the spinal cord (nervous tissue that extends down the spinal column from the brain) from injury. Each vertebra has a spinous process, which is a bony prominence behind the spinal cord that shields the cord\'s nerve tissue. The vertebrae also have a strong bony ""body"" in front of the spinal cord to provide a platform suitable for weight-bearing.''The discs are pads that serve as ""cushions"" between the vertebral bodies that serve to minimize the impact of movement on the spinal column. Each disc is designed like a jelly donut with a central softer component (nucleus pulposus). Ligaments are strong fibrous soft tissues that firmly attach bones to bones. Ligaments attach each of the vertebrae and surround each of the discs. When ligaments are injured as the disc degenerates, localized ''pain'' in the area affected can result.' "
What is a herniated disc? What causes a herniated disc?,"'As described above, each disc of the spine is designed much like a jelly donut. As the disc degenerates from age or injury, the softer central portion can rupture (herniate) through the surrounding outer ring (annulus fibrosus). This abnormal rupture of the central portion of the disc is referred to as a disc herniation. This is commonly referred to as a ""''slipped disc''.""'""The most common location for a herniated disc to occur is in the disc at the level between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae in the low back. This area is constantly absorbing the impact of bearing the weight of the upper body. This is especially important when we are standing or sitting. The lower back is also critically involved in our body's movements throughout the day, as we twist the torso in rotating side to side and as we hinge the back in flexion and extension while bending or lifting."" "
What are risk factors for a herniated disc?,'Risk factors for a herniated disc include degeneration of the spine and heavy lifting or bending of the spine.' 
What are symptoms of a herniated disc?,"'The symptoms of a herniated disc depend on the exact level of the spine where the disc herniation occurs and whether or not nerve tissue is being irritated. A disc herniation may not cause any symptoms. However, disc herniation can cause local pain at the level of the spine affected.''If the disc herniation is large enough, the disc tissue can press on the adjacent spinal nerves that exit the spine at the level of the disc herniation. This can cause shooting pain in the distribution of that nerve and usually occurs on one side of the body and is referred to as ''sciatica''. For example, a disc herniation at the level between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae of the low back can cause a shooting pain down the buttock into the back of the thigh and down the leg. Sometimes this is associated with numbness, ''weakness'', and tingling in the leg. The pain often is worsened upon standing and decreases with lying down. This is often referred to as a ""''pinched nerve''.""''If the disc herniation occurs in the cervical spine, the pain may shoot down one arm and cause a ''stiff neck'' or ''muscle spasm'' in the neck.''If the disc herniation is extremely large, it can press on spinal nerves on both sides of the body. This can result in severe pain down one or both lower extremities. There can be marked muscle weakness of the lower extremities and even ''incontinence of bowel'' and bladder. This complication is medically referred to as ''cauda equina syndrome''.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose a herniated disc?,"'The doctor will suspect a herniated disc when symptoms described above are present. The neurologic examination can reveal abnormal reflexes. Often pain can be elicited when the straight leg is raised when lying or sitting. This is referred to as a ""positive straight leg raising test."" There can be abnormal sensation in the foot or leg.''A variety of blood tests are frequently done to determine if there are signs of inflammation or infection.''Plain film ''X-rays'' can indicate ""wear and tear"" (degeneration) of the spine. They do not, however, demonstrate the status of discs. In order to determine whether or not a disc is herniated, an ''MRI'' scan or ''CT scan'' is performed for diagnosis. Sometimes a CT myelogram is used to further define the structures affected by a herniated disc. A CT myelogram is a CT that is performed after contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal. This allows for better visualization of the discs in certain cases. An ''electromyogram'' (''EMG'') can be used to document precisely which nerves are being irritated by a disc herniation.'  "
What is the treatment for a herniated disc?,"'Occasionally, disc herniation is incidentally detected when a test such as an MRI is performed for other reasons. If no symptoms are present, no particular treatment is necessary.''Depending on the severity of symptoms, treatments for a herniated disc include physical therapy, muscle-relaxant medications, pain medications, anti-inflammation medications, local injection of cortisone (epidural injections), and surgical operations. In any case, all people with a disc herniation should rest and avoid reinjuring the disc. Sometimes, even people with relatively severe pain early on can respond to conservative measures, including physical therapy with an ''exercise'' regimen, epidural ''cortisone injection'', and/or oral cortisone medication (such as ''methylprednisolone'' or ''prednisone''), without the need for surgical intervention.''There are now a variety of surgical approaches to treat disc herniation. Each type of operation is customized to the individual situation and depends a great deal on the condition of the spine around the disc affected. Surgical options include microdiscectomy using small surgical instruments and open surgical repair (either from a posterior or anterior approach). The urgent operation can be necessary when ''cauda equina syndrome'' is present (reviewed above).'  "
What are home remedies for a herniated disc?,"'Home remedies for disc herniation can be very effective in relieving the pain. These include ''over-the-counter'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' sodium (''Aleve''), as well as the application of heat and ice. Alternating heat and ice is very effective for pain relief for many people. Activity modification is also important, which includes avoidance of activities that aggravate pain and may worsen the nerve impingement. Bed rest and complete inactivity are unnecessary; they hinder recovery and are not advised.' "
What exercises and stretches can be done for a herniated disc?,"'Exercising is not advised for new symptoms of a herniated disc. On the other hand, building and maintaining strength in the back muscles and abdominal muscles is very important to prevent and treat chronic back problems. Exercises such as ''walking'', physical therapy, and ''yoga'' have been proven to be very beneficial for those with chronic ''back pain''.''Simple stretching can be very beneficial for symptoms of a herniated disc. Stretching should be started slowly and carefully. Stretching generally involves stretching the back in a backward bending position, called extension.' "
What kind of health care professionals treat herniated discs?,"'Many different health care providers treat herniated discs. Usually patients will see their primary care provider initially, who may be a general practitioner or specialist in internal medicine or family practice. Other physicians who frequently see patients with herniated discs include emergency-medicine physicians, pain-management specialists, orthopedists, neurosurgeons, ''rheumatologists'', and neurologists.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for a herniated disc?,"'The outlook for herniated disc depends on the severity and accompanying symptoms. While it is often possible to have full recovery with conservative treatment measures, sometimes surgical intervention is necessary because of persistent symptoms.' "
Is it possible to prevent a herniated disc?,'A herniated disc can only be prevented by avoiding injury to the spine.' 
What is herpangina?,"'Herpangina is an acute, self-limited viral illness often seen in young children during the summer months. Affected children usually complain of ''mouth sores'' and ''fever''. A number of ''viruses'', all members of the ''Enterovirus'' family, cause herpangina. Coxsackievirus, a member of the ''Enterovirus'' family, is the most common cause of the infection. At the onset of symptoms, most children develop a high ''fever'' and complain of a ''sore throat''. They then develop vesicles (blisters) or ulcers (sores) at the back of the throat and palate. Children, especially younger children, may refuse to eat or drink because of the ''pain'' and are at risk for developing signs and ''symptoms of dehydration''.' "
What causes herpangina?,"'Several common members of the Coxsackie A virus family and a number of other enteroviruses (for example, ''enterovirus'' 71) can cause herpangina. The ''viruses'' are usually spread via the ""fecal-oral route"" (contamination of hands and other surfaces with fecal matter) or via the ""respiratory route"" (air droplets from ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''). One can develop the illness from contact with either of these materials from an individual infected with one of these viruses. Interestingly, half of individuals infected with some of these ''Enterovirus'' family members remain asymptomatic (having no symptoms) which makes preventing transmission more difficult.' "
Is herpangina contagious?,"'Coxsackievirus infections are extremely ''contagious'' and can easily pass from child to child through contaminated surfaces, unwashed hands, and through ''sneezing'' and ''coughing''. Typically, people infected with the virus are most ''contagious'' during the first week of illness. Animals and home pets do not pass virus from person to person.' "
How long is the incubation period for herpangina?,'The normal course of the infection involves an incubation period (the duration between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms) lasting anywhere from 1 to 2 weeks. The infected individual is generally thought to be contagious during the incubation period.' 
What are herpangina symptoms and signs?,"'Typically, children with herpangina have the following:'   Fever Sore throat Small blisters and ulcers may cover the soft palate, uvula, tonsils, and posterior pharynx (the back part of the mouth). The rest of the mouth is normal in appearance. The gingiva (""gums""), buccal mucosa (inner cheek region) and tongue are not generally involved. These blisters can last for up to a week. Sometimes tender and enlarged lymph nodes along the neck (lymphadenopathy) Rash may or may not be present. A rash is relatively rare."
How do health care professionals diagnose herpangina?,"""Since herpangina is a clinical diagnosis, and the illness is self-limited, there is no real reason to perform any laboratory studies. Some children (hospitalized or immune-compromised for example) may have viral studies performed on specimens from the nose or throat. Isolating virus from these samples takes a long time, and generally, symptoms resolve long before the identification of the virus is available. It's possible to measure antibodies to Coxsackievirus if desired, but that is generally unnecessary.""  "
What are treatment options and home remedies for herpangina?,"'Treatment is supportive, just like for most virus infections. Fever and ''pain'' control with ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''/''Motrin'') are generally the primary treatments. It is important to keep children well hydrated as well, and often young children will be resistant to drinking or eating. The aptly named ""magic mouthwash"" is an alternative treatment used to control the mouth ''pain'' associated with herpangina. There are various ''recipes'', but most include a topical ''pain'' medication such as viscous ''lidocaine'', as well as some sort of additional liquids that function as a barrier. A child\'s health care provider might prescribe one of these mixtures. These medications are designed either to be ""swished"" in the mouth or gargled. Drinking excessive ''lidocaine'"" my affect the patient's ""'heart'' rhythm. Remember that since a virus causes herpangina, antibiotics have no role in the treatment, nor do any antiviral medications currently available. Many young patients find that a ''diet'' of ''cold'', soft items provide a special treat and lessen their symptoms (if only by a placebo effect). Ice cream, smoothies, milk shakes, yogurt and frozen yogurt may all be helpful.'  "
How long does herpangina last? What is the prognosis for herpangina?,"""The entire duration of the illness is usually four to seven days. The prognosis is usually excellent. Very rarely, younger patients may refuse to drink or eat and will require hospitalization for intravenous fluids for hydration. It is important to manage a young child's pain to prevent this from occurring. Rarely, enteroviral infections can also cause viral or aseptic ""'meningitis''. These patients usually recover fully.' "
"What is the difference between herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Enteroviruses cause both herpangina and ''hand, foot, and mouth'' (HFM) disease. Both cause oral blisters and ulcers. Both conditions spread by the fecal-oral route or respiratory route (see above). The locations of the blisters differ, with HFM lesions occurring at the front of the mouth and herpangina lesions occurring at the back of the mouth. Approximately 75% of children with HFM also develop skin lesions on the palms and soles (as the name implies), but children with herpangina rarely develop any typical ''rashes''. Both conditions may have infected individuals who never develop symptoms or signs.' "
What is the difference between herpangina and herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1)?,"'Herpes'' simplex 1 (HSV-1) infections are also very common in young children. Unlike herpangina, HSV-1 infections do not have a seasonal preference. ''Gingivostomatitis'' is another term for HSV-1 infection. The characteristic changes in the mouth are zones of multiple small (1-2 mm) vesicles with a surrounding 1-2 mm halo of inflamed tissue. Areas involved are more varied than seen in herpangina. HSV-1 infections commonly involve the buccal mucosa (inner cheek tissue), ''gingiva'' (gums), tongue (also known as ""stomatitis"") and the hard and soft palate. Approximately 60% of infected people will develop lesions on the lips and adjacent skin, commonly known as ""''cold sores''.""''Common characteristics shared by herpangina and HSV-1 infections include moderate fever, reduced appetite, ''headache'', and malaise. The typical HSV-1 infection lasts for 7 to 10 days. Herpangina symptoms generally last for 4 to 7 days. While there are no antiviral ''drugs'"" to treat herpangina, it's possible to lessen HSV-1 infection symptoms if an individual starts oral ""'acyclovir'' immediately upon developing early symptoms. Topical preparations of ''acyclovir'' are not helpful.' "
Is it possible to prevent herpangina?,"'Prevention'' of herpangina depends upon good hygiene (for example, frequent hand washing with soap and water and wearing gloves during ''diaper'' changing -- especially at day care centers) and avoidance of individuals infected with Coxsackievirus. This is easier said than done, since as mentioned earlier, 50% of infected individuals remain asymptomatic. There is no ''vaccine''.' "
Where can people find more information about herpangina?,"'""''Non-Polio Enterovirus'',"" CDC''http://www.cdc.gov/non-''polio''-enterovirus/index.html''""Viral Exanthems,"" Dermatology Online Journal''http://dermatology.cdlib.org/93/reviews/viral/scott.html' "
What are the signs and symptoms of herpangina and HFMD?,"'Fever'' and ''sore throat'' can develop a few days before the appearance of red spots in the throat and over the palate in herpangina. There may be reddish bumpy ''rashes'' on the body.''In cases of HFMD, the reddish ''rash'' may appear on tips of hands, over the mouth, buttocks, genitalia, and on the lips and under the tongue. ''Fever'' may be seen.''In both cases, children refuse to accept any food or ''drinks'' and look irritable and tired. Older children can complain of a ''sore throat'' and ''headache''.' "
How do herpangina and HFMD spread?,"'Herpangina and ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' can happen throughout the year but are most common in the summer and early fall.''Children spread the virus through direct contact. The route of spread of each virus is mainly fecal-oral. The virus can survive for days on the touched surfaces of toys as well.''Herpangina and HFMD are most infectious during the first week of the infection, and they can continue to spread for several days even after the symptoms get cleared.''After exposure to the virus, it takes about 2-6 days for the symptoms to show up. During this symptom-free period also, the person can spread the virus.''The ulcers and spots in both illnesses will go away on their own within 10 days.' "
How are herpangina and HFMD treated?,"'Being viral infections, herpangina and HFMD does not have any dedicated medicine to treat them. There is no antiviral medication available. Treatment is supportive as followed in other simple viral infections. ''Prevention'' is the best cure, and the sick child must be kept at home so that the infection is not passed on in the community.''Medicines are given to control the symptoms of fever and ''pain''. Examples include ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''/''Motrin'').''Children should be encouraged to drink plenty of water or fluids to prevent ''dehydration''. Chicken soup, eggs, and increased proteins in the ''diet'' help strengthen immunity.''Antibiotics do not help in controlling herpangina and HFMD.' "
How can herpangina and HFMD be prevented?,"'Following simple steps can help prevent the risk of contracting herpangina and HFMD:' Proper and thorough washing of hands: Parents should wash their hands with soap and water properly or rub their hands with a hand scrub/sanitizer liquid after changing their child’s diapers and before making food. Disinfection of common, shared areas/items: The childcare center should regularly disinfect the entire place including children’s toys. Good hygiene practices: Parents should demonstrate to their children a few hygiene practices, such as not putting their fingers in the mouth and wash their hands before eating food. Isolation: If the child shows signs and symptoms of herpangina or HFMD, such as fever and sore throat, parents should not send them to daycare centers and schools till the symptoms do not go away. They should isolate their children at home."
What are herpes simplex infections?,"'Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause infections that affect the mouth, face, genitals, skin, buttocks, and the anal area. This article will concentrate on nongenital herpes. Many people acquire the virus and have no symptoms or signs. For others, painful fluid-filled small ''blisters'' appear near the area where the virus entered the body. Typically, the blisters heal completely but may reappear at some point in the future. In between attacks, the virus resides deep in the roots of the nerves of the involved area. When herpes simplex flare-ups appear in their most common location, around the mouth, chin, and upper lip, people often refer to them as ""''cold'' sores"" or ""''fever blisters''."" Oral herpes may cause ulcers, fluid-filled blisters, or sores anywhere inside the mouth, including the gums and the tongue. It may also cause sores inside the nose and around the nostrils. Herpes may also affect the eye.'  "
What causes cold sores?,"'There are two types of HSV, ''herpes simplex virus type 1'' and type 2.''However, both types of HSV are capable of infecting the skin at any location on the body. Thus, the virus that usually causes oral herpes (HSV-1) can cause genital herpes as well as herpes on the hands and eye. The virus that causes genital herpes (HSV-2) can also cause oral herpes, although it almost exclusively infects the genital area. HSV-1 may cause genital herpes via self-inoculation from oral lesions, or via oral sex.''Herpes infections, no matter where they occur first, have a tendency to recur in more or less the same place. Such recurrences may happen often (for example, several times per year) or only occasionally. You would know that you have herpes if you have an outbreak or if a doctor performs a blood test to tell if you have been infected with it. Most adults have been infected with oral or genital herpes and never know it.' In general, HSV-1, also known as herpes labialis or oral herpes, causes infections above the waist, most commonly as ""cold sores."" HSV-2 infections occur mainly below the waist, leading to genital herpes."
What are the risk factors for herpes simplex infections?,"'Exposure to someone with cold sores increases the risk of getting oral herpes. HSV is most ''contagious'' when the person has ''mouth sores'' or blisters on the lips. The virus can also shed from saliva when there are no visible lesions. This is called ""asymptomatic shedding."" Therefore, a person can be contagious without having a ''cold sore'' outbreak. Direct contact with the virus, from kissing or sharing personal items, or skin-to-skin contact, will increase the chance of getting infected with HSV. Abnormal areas of skin such as ''eczema'' may be especially prone to herpes infection.''Health care workers, such as dentists, dental hygienists, and respiratory therapists, are at risk of developing ''herpetic whitlow'"" because of contact with people's mouths.""""Medical conditions or treatments that weaken a person's immune system can increase the risk of severe complications from the virus. These include ""'HIV'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', and steroids.' "
What makes herpes (cold sores) recur?,"'After infection, the virus enters the nerve cells and travels up the nerve until it comes to a place called a ''ganglion''. There, it resides quietly in a stage that is referred to as ""dormant"" or ""latent."" At times, the virus can become active and start replicating again and travel down the nerve to the skin, causing a cold sore outbreak. The exact mechanism behind this is not clear, but it is known that some conditions seem to trigger recurrences, including' a fever, a cold, or the flu; UV rays (sun exposure or a sunburn); emotional or physical stress (such as an illness or surgery); weakening of the immune system; trauma to the involved area such as dental work; and sometimes there is no apparent cause of the recurrence."
Are cold sores contagious?,'Oral herpes is contagious to others who do not have it.' 
How do cold sores spread?,"'The virus is spread from person to person by kissing, by close contact with herpes lesions, or from saliva even when sores are not present. Infected saliva is a common means of virus transmission. The contagious period is highest when people have active blisters or moist sores. Once the blisters have dried and crusted over (within a few days), the risk of contagion is significantly lessened. HSV can also be spread through personal items that are contaminated with the virus, such as lipstick, utensils, and razors. Despite popular myth, catching herpes (cold sores) from surfaces, towels, or washcloths is a very low risk, since the virus does not usually survive long on dry surfaces.' "
What is the incubation period for cold sores?,'The time between infection and symptoms of primary oral herpes is anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks.' 
What is primary oral herpes?,"'Primary herpes refers to the initial outbreak of symptoms after infection, often presenting with painful sores on the lips, gums, and mouth.''In some people, primary herpes is associated with ''fever'', ''swollen lymph nodes'', and ''bleeding gums'', together with painful ulcers around the mouth (gingivostomatitis) and ''sore throat''. These signs and symptoms may last several days. Difficulty in eating and drinking may lead to ''dehydration''. The sores heal completely in 2-6 weeks, usually without scarring. Virus can be recovered from the saliva for days after the lesions heal. Primary herpes usually occurs during childhood.''Not everyone has a severe primary attack when they are first infected with herpes. In most people, the virus infects the body without causing any symptoms. The process generates an antibody response, causing the immune system to produce antibodies against the herpes virus. This antibody response helps reduce recurrences and keep them mild. Antibodies also make it harder for the virus to get a foothold somewhere else in the body. However, it is possible to transfer the herpes virus to other parts of the body (autoinoculation).' "
What does recurrent herpes look like?,"'Recurrent herpes occurs in the area where it first appeared, though most of the time, there are fewer blisters or a milder outbreak than the first time. Although the face is the most common site of infection, other areas of the body may be involved:''In recurrent herpes, it often takes 7-10 days before the ulcers completely disappear and the skin returns to normal.' Labial herpes: This is the familiar cold sore that appears on the lip margins (labial refers to the lip). When labial herpes reappears, it usually occurs at the same location each time or a few millimeters away. L-lysine and other vitamin supplements have not been shown to speed healing or reduce outbreaks. Herpetic whitlow: Sometimes, the herpes virus shows up on the fingers. This is especially common in dental and medical workers who have to put their fingers inside people's mouths, despite the use of gloves. In herpetic whitlow, the virus has entered the finger. Occasionally, the virus re-emerges and causes blister-like sores on the fingertip. Wrestlers' herpes or herpes gladiatorum: Wrestlers or any athlete engaged in direct contact sports can contract herpes from an opponent who is shedding the virus. This form of herpes can appear anywhere over the body, but the face, neck, and arms are common locations. Unlike most other types of infection, lesions may occur at multiple sites. Eczema herpeticum: This may occur in people (especially children) who have areas of eczema or atopic (allergic) dermatitis, which is very itchy. They may scratch and spread herpes to these areas if they have cold sores or other sources of active herpes infection (autoinoculation). The skin involved with eczema or allergic dermatitis is less able to fight viral infections, and herpes spread to this area may result in widespread sores."
What are the signs and symptoms of cold sores?,"""The hallmark symptom of herpes is tingling or a burning sensation before the appearance of the outbreak. The classic sign of herpes is a cluster of blisters on a base of red skin. The blisters look like a drop of water filled with clear liquid. These blisters dry up rapidly and leave a crust or scab that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on the severity of the infection. This pattern has important implications for the many people who fear they have herpes but don't, If you are healthy and the ""'rash'' lasts for weeks, it is unlikely to be herpes.''Herpes infections feel dry and crusty, and they may cause ''pain'' or ''itch''. Some patients have a ""prodrome,"" which is the occurrence of certain symptoms before the actual sores become fully evident. The prodrome to herpes infections typically involves ''flu-like symptoms'' and a burning or tingling sensation that precedes the appearance of blisters by a few hours or a day or two.'  "
What other conditions can look like oral herpes (cold sores)?,"'There are many conditions that can be confused with herpes, including' scrapes, razor burns, pimples, impetigo, angular stomatitis (sores at the corners of the mouth), and canker sores (aphthous ulcers)."
What is angular stomatitis?,"'Angular stomatitis refers to inflammation, cracking, or irritation at the corners of the mouth. In contrast, herpes infections usually appear on the upper or lower lip margins, not in the corners. Angular stomatitis may be an initial sign of ''anemia'' or vitamin deficiency. It can also occur in people who wear ''dentures'', whose saliva can accumulate and lead to the overgrowth of yeast.' "
What are canker sores?,"'Canker sores'', or aphthous ulcers, are ulcerations that occur inside the mouth along the mucosa. They are found on the inner cheeks and lower lip as well as on the tongue, palate, and the gums. Canker sores are round and very painful. They are gray in color with a distinct edge. They are not contagious and are caused by ''stress'' or trauma to the area. They are not related to herpes, although they be may confused with oral ulcers caused by herpes.' "
What types of doctors treat cold sores?,"'Most pediatricians and primary care providers are very familiar with cold sores and their treatment. Most cases do not need the services of a dermatologist (skin specialist). An infectious-disease specialist is often consulted in complicated cases, such as herpes ''encephalitis'' or herpes in a person with a weak immune system. The care of an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) is important in managing ''ocular'' herpes, or herpes ''keratitis''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose oral herpes?,"'The diagnosis of herpes (cold sores) is easily made based on the visual appearance of the lesions, and the best approach is to see a doctor at the first sign of a blister. If there is concern that the ''rash'' may not be herpes, a swab of blister fluid may be collected for viral culture or ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'"") test. This is most useful in the first 48 hours before the blister has crusted over. If lesions resolve, then cultures are of no help, because there's nothing left to culture. Culture results take a minimum of 3-5 days.""'PCR testing detects herpes DNA, but it is not as readily available as culture and is a very expensive test to do for simple cold sores.''Blood tests for herpes antibodies are not usually needed, since finding antibodies to herpes just means that the body has been exposed to this virus at some point in the past. It does not determine if the current lesion is due to herpes. They can be done, though, if the diagnosis is unclear or there is a specific reason to know for certain.'  "
How long do cold sores last?,"'In primary herpes, the healing process usually takes 2-3 weeks, but skin pain can last for 1-6 weeks.' "
What home remedies and over-the-counter drugs are used for the treatment of cold sores?,"'Home remedies include applying a cool wet compress to the lesion to decrease pain and keep the lesion from drying and cracking. Applying compresses too often will cause more drying, however, so a moisturizing balm should be applied after the lesion is first softened with a wet compress. ''Lemon balm'' (''Melissa officinalis'') and L-lysine are popularly used as home remedies. While there is there is very limited data suggesting that these substances have antiviral properties, and not enough data to support recommendations, these remedies seem generally well tolerated for those who wish to try them at their own risk.''Lemon balm, L-lysine ''supplements'', citrus bioflavonoids, ''Lactobacillus acidophilus'' and bulgaricus, ''vitamin C'', ''vitamin E'' oil, and vitamin B12 have also been considered in the potential treatment of herpes simplex virus, but there is no good clinical evidence to support these treatments. Lemon balm may have some anti-herpes properties, but it is impossible to tell if it is effective in affected people from the few laboratory experiments that have been published. L-lysine similarly has limited laboratory data suggesting antiviral properties and has been touted for reducing recurrence of herpes. Unfortunately, results in patients with cold sores have been highly variable; and there are no high quality studies suggesting benefit.'  "
What prescription drugs treat cold sores?,"'Prescription-strength topical medications: Treatment with topical acyclovir (''Zovirax'' 5% cream) or penciclovir (''Denavir'' 1% cream) will reduce healing time by approximately half a day and decrease pain associated with the lesion. Topical treatment is limited in its effectiveness because it has poor penetration to the site of replication of the virus and therefore is restricted in its healing ability. Acyclovir cream should be applied five times per day for 4 days, and penciclovir cream should be applied every two hours while awake for 4 days. A cream containing 5% acyclovir and a topical steroid (hydrocortisone) called Xerese is also available.''Oral prescription-strength medications: The current FDA-approved oral antiviral ''drugs'' used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus in adults are acyclovir, ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex''), and ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''). These oral medications have been shown to decrease the duration of the outbreak, especially when started during the prodrome before the rash appears. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are considered relatively safe and effective when used in ''pregnancy'', although topical treatment would be preferred when appropriate. Acyclovir and valacyclovir have been used while ''breastfeeding''. However, ''pregnant'' women and ''nursing'' mothers should contact their physician or pharmacist prior to using any medication. These medications are generally well tolerated with few side effects, though they may cause ''headache'', ''nausea'', or ''diarrhea''. Doses may vary depending on the individual situation as determined by the prescriber.''Treatment for the first outbreak of oral herpes in an otherwise healthy person may include:' Acyclovir, 400 mg (milligrams) orally three times a day for 10 days or until the lesions have crusted Valacyclovir, 2,000 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 day Famciclovir, 250 mg orally three times a day for 7-10 days Treatment doses for recurrent oral herpes are as follows: Acyclovir, 400 mg orally three times a day for 5 days: It may also be given as 800 mg orally twice a day for 5 days or 800 mg three times a day for 2 days. Valacyclovir, 2,000 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 day Famciclovir, 1,500 mg orally once Suppressive treatment for those with frequent outbreaks may be given for 12 months, but it may be extended if needed: Acyclovir, 400 mg orally twice a day Valacyclovir, 500 mg orally once a day Famciclovir, 250 mg orally twice a day"
What is the treatment for cold sores in children?,"'Treatment for children is similar to that in adults (other than being dosed by weight), except that famciclovir does not have an approved pediatric dose.' "
"What are the possible complications of oral 
herpes (cold sores)?","'""Autoinoculation"" from touching a cold sore on the lip can cause herpes of the finger (herpetic whitlow). Autoinoculation occurs most commonly at the time of primary infection, when viral shedding is high and the immune system is still gearing up to contain it. The antibodies that are made after primary infection are usually -- but not always -- successful in preventing autoinoculation during recurrent attacks.''A more serious complication is infection of the eye, or ocular herpes (herpetic keratitis). It may be a mild surface ulceration with little discomfort, or it may cause deeper, painful ulcers that threaten vision. Ocular herpes is also caused by autoinoculation. If not treated, ocular herpes may lead to serious damage or even ''blindness''.''Rarely, herpes simplex may infect the brain, causing ''encephalitis''. This infection requires hospitalization and intravenous antiviral medications. HSV-1 is among the commonest causes of fatal viral encephalitis worldwide.''In immunocompromised people, such as those with ''HIV'' infection or those receiving chemotherapy, severe outbreaks of herpes may occur. Colds sores may spread to large parts of the lower face or invade organs. Antiviral drugs are used to prevent or lessen such attacks.''In a few people, outbreaks of herpes will be associated with ''erythema nodosum''. ''Erythema nodosum'' is an inflammatory skin reaction characterized by red and painful skin lumps that usually appear on the front side of the legs. This condition can be caused by many inflammatory and infectious diseases, including herpes virus infections. Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in 3 to 6 weeks. Treatment of the herpes episode usually hastens the resolution of erythema nodosum.' "
What is the prognosis for oral herpes (cold sores)? Can they be cured?,"'Currently, there is no cure or ''vaccine'' for herpes simplex virus. Avoiding risk factors, such as ''sunburn'' and stress, can help prevent additional outbreaks. Cold sores will usually heal within 2 weeks without treatment. However, there are established cold sore treatments available to help decrease healing time, reduce pain, and in specific cases, suppress the recurrence of the virus.''Cold sores, if they recur, are most likely to do so during the first year after infection. They usually resolve on their own within 1-2 weeks. After the initial outbreak, cold sores may never appear again, or appear only when something triggers them. Usually people with cold sores lead normal lives and are not terribly affected by them unless they happen to recur very often (several times a year or more).' "
Is it possible to prevent cold sores?,"""The best way to prevent a herpes simplex infection is to avoid physical contact with someone else's cold sores. Items that touch the lips but cannot be washed or sanitized, such as lipstick or lip balm, should not be shared. During an outbreak, frequent hand washing and sanitizing with 60% ethanol-based hand sanitizer will help reduce the spread of the virus to other parts of the body or to other people. Wash hands immediately after applying topical treatments to a cold sore. L-lysine and other supplements have not been shown to consistently reduce outbreaks.""'To prevent future outbreaks,' avoid long periods of time in the sun and use sunblock on lips and face, reduce stress by getting adequate rest and relaxation, avoid trauma to the mouth or involved area, and take any antiviral medication exactly as prescribed."
What are herpes viruses?,"'There are several members of the ''herpes'' virus family. They include herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), ''herpes zoster'' (HZV, also known as ''varicella-zoster virus'' or VZV), ''cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV''), and others.' "
What causes herpes eye infections?,"'The two types of herpes virus that most commonly affect the eyes are herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (the same virus that causes ''cold sores'' on the lips) and ''varicella''-zoster virus (VZV; herpes zoster), which causes ''chickenpox'' in childhood and ''shingles'' in adulthood.''Less commonly, ''cytomegalovirus'' can cause eye disease in immunocompromised people, such as ''HIV''-infected patients with ''low T'' cell counts.'  "
Is ocular herpes contagious?,"'Herpes can be ''contagious''. People with active corneal herpes simplex and herpes zoster have live virus in their tears, as well as skin vesicles in ''chickenpox'' and ''shingles'' ''rashes''. Careful hand washing is important, particularly when in contact with unimmunized ''babies'' and children, as well as people with weakened immune systems.' "
How do people transmit ocular herpes?,"'In most cases, people do not transmit ''ocular'' herpes simplex from one eye to another. Instead, people first acquire the virus by direct contact but typically produces no initial signs or symptoms other than a mild ''rash'' or ''pink eye'"" that subsides on its own. The virus settles in the body's nervous system, where it remains in its latent, dormant state. Months or years later, the virus can reactivate and travel to the eye where it causes ocular herpes, or the lip, where it causes a ""'cold sore''.''Individuals most often acquire herpes zoster (varicella zoster) virus through the air during epidemics of chickenpox in childhood, after which the virus can sit dormant for decades before reactivating and producing ''shingles'' in the eye or elsewhere in the body.' "
What parts of the eyes are susceptible to herpes viruses?,"'All the parts of the eye are susceptible. ''Herpes ophthalmicus'' is the term for herpes infection of any part of the eye.''HSV and HZV most often affects the ''cornea''. Herpetic ''keratitis'' is infection or inflammation of the cornea. But these ''viruses'' can also affect the skin of the eyelids, the uveal tissue (''iris'' and choroid), and the retina. For this reason, physicians recommend a thorough eye exam to assess the extent of eye involvement.' "
Who is at risk for herpes infections of the eyes?,"'Although a very large percentage of the population (85% or more) carries the HSV-1 virus, not everyone who carries the virus gets an eye infection.''When a person carrying the virus becomes immunocompromised (for example their immune system becomes weakened) due to ''HIV'', medications (steroids, ''chemotherapy''), age, and perhaps ''stress'', the virus is more likely to become ""active"" and incite an outbreak that may include an eye infection.''However, in many (if not most) cases of HSV keratitis, the frequency of eye infections appears to be random and not necessarily associated with episodes of ''stress'' or immune ''weakness'"". In fact, studies have suggested that the particular subtype of HSV-1 virus that an individual acquires has as much to do with the frequency of eye infections as the individual's immune system."" "
What is the incubation period for ocular herpes?,'The incubation period (the time between acquiring the virus and the appearance of ocular symptoms) can range from a few days to several decades.' 
What are the signs and symptoms of herpes eye infections?,"'The most common presentation for ocular HSV and HZV infection is ''pain'', ''blurred vision'', redness, tearing, and light sensitivity in one eye.''Shingles'' ''rash'' consisting of small ""vesicles"" (''blisters'' or sores) on the eyelids and forehead above the affected eye, and sometimes the tip of the nose, often accompanies HZV.'  "
What health care professionals diagnose and treat ocular herpes?,"'Your primary care doctor (family practice doctor, pediatrician, or internist) often makes an initial diagnosis, but in most cases, individuals should follow up with an eye doctor (optometrist or ophthalmologist). Special eye examination equipment allows a much more detailed assessment, and physicians can tailor the treatment plan to the degree and extent of eye involvement.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose herpes eye infections?,"'Most of the time, physicians make the diagnosis based on the symptoms and the signs alone.''Herpes keratitis typically produces a distinct erosion of the outer layer of the cornea (a ""dendrite""), which has a tree-branching pattern that can be seen by the examiner using a blue light and an eyedrop containing a dye. Under a slit-lamp microscope, the eye doctor can look for further clues to distinguish between a HSV and a HZV keratitis, but in either case, the initial antiviral treatment is the same.''Health care professionals perform a close examination of the other eye tissues (including the skin, ''conjunctiva'', anterior chamber, iris, retina, and more) to assess the extent of the infection. In questionable cases, doctors obtain a culture to confirm the diagnosis.' "
What are treatment options for herpes eye infections?,"'Initial treatment is with either topical (drop) or oral antiviral medication. In certain less common cases, intravenous medication is also necessary.''The antiviral ''drugs'' currently available work by suppressing the reproduction of the virus, thus reducing the number of active viruses. This may shorten the duration and severity of the infection and possibly reduce the odds of a recurrence.''Unfortunately, there is still no antiviral medication that ""cures"" one of herpes. The herpes viruses reside in the cells in our nervous system where they remain inactive and quiet (""latent"") for months or years. No treatment has been developed to date that can eradicate the viruses in their latent state.''When the virus becomes ""active"" for whatever reason, it begins reproducing and its progeny virus travel along a nerve to the site of the infection (at the skin or cornea). The antiviral medications available today only affect these actively replicating viruses, not the latent viruses in the nervous system.''In addition to antiviral medications, patients may use antibiotic drops or ointment as a preventative measure to reduce their chances of a bacterial infection developing in the area of viral infection. This is because an eroded cornea becomes more vulnerable to a secondary bacterial infection.''The eye pressure (''intraocular pressure'') can rise due to internal swelling (inflammation) of the eye or direct herpes virus infection of the trabecular meshwork (the internal drainage channels within the eye). If so, doctors will prescribe a pressure-lowering medication.''Herpes affecting the middle layer of the cornea (herpetic stromal keratitis), back layer of the cornea (herpetic endotheliitis), and iris (herpetic ''iritis'') are associated with significant inflammation. Inflammation of any of the tissues of the eye may require anti-inflammatory medications such as steroids. In some cases, the inflammation is chronic or recurring, requiring several rounds of steroid treatment.'  "
What are the possible risks and complications of untreated herpes eye infections?,"'In the worst-case scenario, untreated herpes eye infections lead to ''blindness'', ''chronic pain'', and loss of the eye. Aggressive treatment aims to reduce the chances of scarring, eye pressure problems, and direct damage to the eye tissues.' "
What is the prognosis of herpes eye infections?,"'Most herpes simplex keratitis (HSV eye infections) are limited to the outer layer of the cornea and resolve within a couple of weeks with antiviral therapy, leaving little or no permanent damage. HSV infections of the deeper tissue layers may have a higher complication rate due to inflammation.''HZV and shingles involving the outer layer of the cornea may also resolve over a couple of weeks with antiviral therapy. However, it is common for a painful burning sensation to linger in the area of the skin rash for months or even years. This is ''postherpetic neuralgia'' and sometimes requires treatments for ''pain'"" control. Both types of herpes eye infections can leave residual corneal scarring that can blur the vision. In some cases, it's possible to correct this with surgery.""'Damage to the corneal nerves can also lead to chronic numbness of the cornea, causing ''dry eye'' and, in advanced cases, predisposing to dry-eye related corneal erosions or ulcers. In these cases, lubricating drops, punctal plugs, and sometimes ''eyelid surgery'' may help protect the cornea.''Unfortunately, both HSV and HZV ophthalmicus can recur with unpredictable frequency in either eye. Frequent recurrences should warrant a general medical checkup to rule out any underlying condition that may be weakening the immune system. However, in many cases, it is the virulence of the particular virus strain that determines its activity level.' "
Is it possible to prevent herpes eye infections?,"'For patients with frequent recurrences of herpes eye infections, taking a low-dose antiviral drug on a daily basis can reduce the frequency of recurrences in some cases. Your eye doctor will help determine if this is a safe option.''There is no ''vaccine'' against HSV at this time. There is a vaccine against chickenpox for babies and toddlers (varicella vaccine). A zoster vaccine (approved for adults 50 years of age and over) may reduce the frequency and severity of shingles and HZV eye disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends that all adults aged 60 and over receive this vaccine but does not recommend vaccination of those aged 50-59. Research is ongoing to develop a means of eradicating the viruses in their latent states.' "
What are herpes simplex infections?,"'Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause infections that affect the mouth, face, genitals, skin, buttocks, and the anal area. This article will concentrate on nongenital herpes. Many people acquire the virus and have no symptoms or signs. For others, painful fluid-filled small ''blisters'' appear near the area where the virus entered the body. Typically, the blisters heal completely but may reappear at some point in the future. In between attacks, the virus resides deep in the roots of the nerves of the involved area. When herpes simplex flare-ups appear in their most common location, around the mouth, chin, and upper lip, people often refer to them as ""''cold'' sores"" or ""''fever blisters''."" Oral herpes may cause ulcers, fluid-filled blisters, or sores anywhere inside the mouth, including the gums and the tongue. It may also cause sores inside the nose and around the nostrils. Herpes may also affect the eye.'  "
What causes cold sores?,"'There are two types of HSV, ''herpes simplex virus type 1'' and type 2.''However, both types of HSV are capable of infecting the skin at any location on the body. Thus, the virus that usually causes oral herpes (HSV-1) can cause genital herpes as well as herpes on the hands and eye. The virus that causes genital herpes (HSV-2) can also cause oral herpes, although it almost exclusively infects the genital area. HSV-1 may cause genital herpes via self-inoculation from oral lesions, or via oral sex.''Herpes infections, no matter where they occur first, have a tendency to recur in more or less the same place. Such recurrences may happen often (for example, several times per year) or only occasionally. You would know that you have herpes if you have an outbreak or if a doctor performs a blood test to tell if you have been infected with it. Most adults have been infected with oral or genital herpes and never know it.' In general, HSV-1, also known as herpes labialis or oral herpes, causes infections above the waist, most commonly as ""cold sores."" HSV-2 infections occur mainly below the waist, leading to genital herpes."
What are the risk factors for herpes simplex infections?,"'Exposure to someone with cold sores increases the risk of getting oral herpes. HSV is most ''contagious'' when the person has ''mouth sores'' or blisters on the lips. The virus can also shed from saliva when there are no visible lesions. This is called ""asymptomatic shedding."" Therefore, a person can be contagious without having a ''cold sore'' outbreak. Direct contact with the virus, from kissing or sharing personal items, or skin-to-skin contact, will increase the chance of getting infected with HSV. Abnormal areas of skin such as ''eczema'' may be especially prone to herpes infection.''Health care workers, such as dentists, dental hygienists, and respiratory therapists, are at risk of developing ''herpetic whitlow'"" because of contact with people's mouths.""""Medical conditions or treatments that weaken a person's immune system can increase the risk of severe complications from the virus. These include ""'HIV'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', and steroids.' "
What makes herpes (cold sores) recur?,"'After infection, the virus enters the nerve cells and travels up the nerve until it comes to a place called a ''ganglion''. There, it resides quietly in a stage that is referred to as ""dormant"" or ""latent."" At times, the virus can become active and start replicating again and travel down the nerve to the skin, causing a cold sore outbreak. The exact mechanism behind this is not clear, but it is known that some conditions seem to trigger recurrences, including' a fever, a cold, or the flu; UV rays (sun exposure or a sunburn); emotional or physical stress (such as an illness or surgery); weakening of the immune system; trauma to the involved area such as dental work; and sometimes there is no apparent cause of the recurrence."
Are cold sores contagious?,'Oral herpes is contagious to others who do not have it.' 
How do cold sores spread?,"'The virus is spread from person to person by kissing, by close contact with herpes lesions, or from saliva even when sores are not present. Infected saliva is a common means of virus transmission. The contagious period is highest when people have active blisters or moist sores. Once the blisters have dried and crusted over (within a few days), the risk of contagion is significantly lessened. HSV can also be spread through personal items that are contaminated with the virus, such as lipstick, utensils, and razors. Despite popular myth, catching herpes (cold sores) from surfaces, towels, or washcloths is a very low risk, since the virus does not usually survive long on dry surfaces.' "

What home remedies and over-the-counter drugs are used for the treatment of cold sores?,"'Home remedies include applying a cool wet compress to the lesion to decrease pain and keep the lesion from drying and cracking. Applying compresses too often will cause more drying, however, so a moisturizing balm should be applied after the lesion is first softened with a wet compress. ''Lemon balm'' (''Melissa officinalis'') and L-lysine are popularly used as home remedies. While there is there is very limited data suggesting that these substances have antiviral properties, and not enough data to support recommendations, these remedies seem generally well tolerated for those who wish to try them at their own risk.''Lemon balm, L-lysine ''supplements'', citrus bioflavonoids, ''Lactobacillus acidophilus'' and bulgaricus, ''vitamin C'', ''vitamin E'' oil, and vitamin B12 have also been considered in the potential treatment of herpes simplex virus, but there is no good clinical evidence to support these treatments. Lemon balm may have some anti-herpes properties, but it is impossible to tell if it is effective in affected people from the few laboratory experiments that have been published. L-lysine similarly has limited laboratory data suggesting antiviral properties and has been touted for reducing recurrence of herpes. Unfortunately, results in patients with cold sores have been highly variable; and there are no high quality studies suggesting benefit.'  "
What prescription drugs treat cold sores?,"'Prescription-strength topical medications: Treatment with topical acyclovir (''Zovirax'' 5% cream) or penciclovir (''Denavir'' 1% cream) will reduce healing time by approximately half a day and decrease pain associated with the lesion. Topical treatment is limited in its effectiveness because it has poor penetration to the site of replication of the virus and therefore is restricted in its healing ability. Acyclovir cream should be applied five times per day for 4 days, and penciclovir cream should be applied every two hours while awake for 4 days. A cream containing 5% acyclovir and a topical steroid (hydrocortisone) called Xerese is also available.''Oral prescription-strength medications: The current FDA-approved oral antiviral ''drugs'' used in the treatment of herpes simplex virus in adults are acyclovir, ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex''), and ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''). These oral medications have been shown to decrease the duration of the outbreak, especially when started during the prodrome before the rash appears. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are considered relatively safe and effective when used in ''pregnancy'', although topical treatment would be preferred when appropriate. Acyclovir and valacyclovir have been used while ''breastfeeding''. However, ''pregnant'' women and ''nursing'' mothers should contact their physician or pharmacist prior to using any medication. These medications are generally well tolerated with few side effects, though they may cause ''headache'', ''nausea'', or ''diarrhea''. Doses may vary depending on the individual situation as determined by the prescriber.''Treatment for the first outbreak of oral herpes in an otherwise healthy person may include:' Acyclovir, 400 mg (milligrams) orally three times a day for 10 days or until the lesions have crusted Valacyclovir, 2,000 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 day Famciclovir, 250 mg orally three times a day for 7-10 days Treatment doses for recurrent oral herpes are as follows: Acyclovir, 400 mg orally three times a day for 5 days: It may also be given as 800 mg orally twice a day for 5 days or 800 mg three times a day for 2 days. Valacyclovir, 2,000 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 day Famciclovir, 1,500 mg orally once Suppressive treatment for those with frequent outbreaks may be given for 12 months, but it may be extended if needed: Acyclovir, 400 mg orally twice a day Valacyclovir, 500 mg orally once a day Famciclovir, 250 mg orally twice a day"
What is the treatment for cold sores in children?,"'Treatment for children is similar to that in adults (other than being dosed by weight), except that famciclovir does not have an approved pediatric dose.' "
"What are the possible complications of oral 
herpes (cold sores)?","'""Autoinoculation"" from touching a cold sore on the lip can cause herpes of the finger (herpetic whitlow). Autoinoculation occurs most commonly at the time of primary infection, when viral shedding is high and the immune system is still gearing up to contain it. The antibodies that are made after primary infection are usually -- but not always -- successful in preventing autoinoculation during recurrent attacks.''A more serious complication is infection of the eye, or ocular herpes (herpetic keratitis). It may be a mild surface ulceration with little discomfort, or it may cause deeper, painful ulcers that threaten vision. Ocular herpes is also caused by autoinoculation. If not treated, ocular herpes may lead to serious damage or even ''blindness''.''Rarely, herpes simplex may infect the brain, causing ''encephalitis''. This infection requires hospitalization and intravenous antiviral medications. HSV-1 is among the commonest causes of fatal viral encephalitis worldwide.''In immunocompromised people, such as those with ''HIV'' infection or those receiving chemotherapy, severe outbreaks of herpes may occur. Colds sores may spread to large parts of the lower face or invade organs. Antiviral drugs are used to prevent or lessen such attacks.''In a few people, outbreaks of herpes will be associated with ''erythema nodosum''. ''Erythema nodosum'' is an inflammatory skin reaction characterized by red and painful skin lumps that usually appear on the front side of the legs. This condition can be caused by many inflammatory and infectious diseases, including herpes virus infections. Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in 3 to 6 weeks. Treatment of the herpes episode usually hastens the resolution of erythema nodosum.' "
What is the prognosis for oral herpes (cold sores)? Can they be cured?,"'Currently, there is no cure or ''vaccine'' for herpes simplex virus. Avoiding risk factors, such as ''sunburn'' and stress, can help prevent additional outbreaks. Cold sores will usually heal within 2 weeks without treatment. However, there are established cold sore treatments available to help decrease healing time, reduce pain, and in specific cases, suppress the recurrence of the virus.''Cold sores, if they recur, are most likely to do so during the first year after infection. They usually resolve on their own within 1-2 weeks. After the initial outbreak, cold sores may never appear again, or appear only when something triggers them. Usually people with cold sores lead normal lives and are not terribly affected by them unless they happen to recur very often (several times a year or more).' "
Is it possible to prevent cold sores?,"""The best way to prevent a herpes simplex infection is to avoid physical contact with someone else's cold sores. Items that touch the lips but cannot be washed or sanitized, such as lipstick or lip balm, should not be shared. During an outbreak, frequent hand washing and sanitizing with 60% ethanol-based hand sanitizer will help reduce the spread of the virus to other parts of the body or to other people. Wash hands immediately after applying topical treatments to a cold sore. L-lysine and other supplements have not been shown to consistently reduce outbreaks.""'To prevent future outbreaks,' avoid long periods of time in the sun and use sunblock on lips and face, reduce stress by getting adequate rest and relaxation, avoid trauma to the mouth or involved area, and take any antiviral medication exactly as prescribed."
What is shingles? What does shingles look like?,"'Shingles is a disease characterized by a painful, blistering skin rash that affects one side of the body, typically the face or torso. This condition may also be referred to as herpes zoster, zoster, or zona. The word ''shingles'' comes from the Latin word ''cingulum'', which means belt. There are approximately 1 million estimated new cases per year in the U.S., with almost one out of every three people developing shingles at some point in their lifetime. Though most people who develop shingles will only have a single episode, there are some who develop recurrent cases of shingles. Shingles is more common in older individuals and in those with weakened immune systems.''The characteristic rash of shingles typically appears after an initial period of burning, tingling, ''itching'', or stinging in the affected area. After a few days, the rash then appears in a stripe or band-like pattern along a nerve path (called a dermatome), affecting only one side of the body without crossing the midline. The rash erupts as clusters of small red patches that develop into ''blisters'', which may appear similar to ''chickenpox''. The blisters then break open and slowly begin to dry and eventually crust over.'  "
What causes shingles?,"'Shingles is caused when the varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivates, the same virus that causes chickenpox (varicella). Varicella-zoster belongs to the ''Herpesviridae'' family. Only those who have previously had chickenpox can develop shingles later in life, and rarely, those who have received the varicella vaccine can develop shingles later in life. Initial exposure to VZV, which typically occurs in children or adolescents, leads to the development of varicella. After the episode of chickenpox has resolved, the virus remains in a dormant state in the nervous system in certain nerve cells of the body located in the spine. While in this inactive state, you will not experience any symptoms from the varicella zoster virus. However, in certain individuals and for reasons that are not completely clear, the varicella zoster virus may re-emerge years later and travel along nerve fibers to cause shingles. The location and pattern of the ensuing rash reflects the region of the affected nerves.''Though similar in name, herpes zoster is not the same disease as herpes simplex (which is caused by the herpes simplex virus causing ''cold sores'', ''fever blisters'', or ''genital herpes'').' "
What are risk factors for shingles?,"'Shingles can only occur in individuals who have previously been exposed to the varicella zoster virus. Risk factors for the development of shingles include the following:' Increasing age: Though shingles can rarely occur in children, it is much more common in older adults, with the incidence increasing with age. This is thought to be in large part due to waning immunity as people age. Approximately 50% of all cases of shingles occur in adults 60 years of age or older. Weakened immune system: Individuals with impaired immune systems have a higher probability of developing shingles. This can be seen in diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS, or in individuals taking certain medications. Patients taking steroids or other immunosuppressive medications, such as people who have undergone organ transplants, and individuals with certain autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) are at increased risk for developing shingles. Psychological and emotional stressors are also thought to possibly contribute to the development of shingles, perhaps from the detrimental effects of stress on the immune system and the person's health."
What is the contagious period for shingles?,"'The virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be transmitted from person to person by direct contact with the fluid from the active blistering rash. Therefore, susceptible individuals should avoid contact with people who have active shingles, especially ''pregnant'' women who have never had chickenpox and immunocompromised individuals. It cannot be transmitted by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'', and it is not ''contagious'' before the blisters appear. Once the shingles rash has dried and developed crusting, it generally is not considered to be contagious.''There are a few important points to consider when discussing the varicella zoster virus and transmissibility. If an individual who has never had chickenpox or the ''chickenpox vaccine'' comes in direct contact with the fluid from the shingles rash, they may go on to develop chickenpox, but they will not immediately develop shingles. It is possible, however, for them to develop shingles later in life, just as it is with others who have previously been exposed to the virus and developed chickenpox. Also, if you have previously been exposed to the varicella zoster virus and you have had chickenpox, you will not contract the virus from others with shingles.' "
What are shingles symptoms and signs? What are the stages of shingles?,"'Shingles usually starts with burning, tingling, itching, or stinging in the region where the rash will ultimately develop. Sometimes, this pain can be severe and individuals may complain of extremely sensitive skin. This discomfort typically occurs a few days before the visible rash develops. In rare instances, the characteristic shingles rash will not appear (a condition called zoster sine herpete).''Often, individuals may also experience other symptoms such as''A few days after the skin discomfort begins (or rarely, several weeks afterward), the characteristic rash of shingles will appear. It typically begins as clusters of small red patches that eventually develop into small blisters. These fluid-filled blisters eventually break open, and the small sores begin to slowly dry and scab over. The crusts usually fall off after several weeks, and the shingles rash typically clears up after approximately two to four weeks. Though uncommon, in cases of a severe rash, skin discoloration or scarring of the skin is possible.''The location of the shingles rash can vary. Though shingles can appear almost anywhere on the body, it most commonly affects the torso and the face (including the eyes, ears, and mouth). It is often present in the area of the ribcage or the waist. This characteristic rash is in a stripe or band-like pattern that affects only one side of the body (the right or the left), and it usually does not cross over the midline. In some cases, the rash can affect adjacent dermatomes (an area of skin that is supplied by a single ''spinal nerve''), and rarely it can affect three or more dermatomes (a condition termed disseminated zoster). Disseminated zoster generally occurs only in individuals with a compromised immune system.'

How do health care professionals diagnose shingles?,"'Shingles can often be diagnosed by your doctor based upon the distinctive appearance and distribution of the characteristic shingles rash. A painful, blistering rash that is localized to defined dermatomes is a sign highly suggestive of shingles. Blood work or other testing is usually not necessary. Diagnosing shingles before the appearance of the rash or in cases of zoster sine herpete (zoster without rash) can be challenging. In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, laboratory tests are available to help confirm the diagnosis. Depending on the clinical situation, testing can be done using either blood work (to detect antibodies to the varicella zoster virus) or by specialized testing of skin lesion samples.' "
What types of health care professionals treat shingles?,"'Shingles is most commonly diagnosed and treated by a primary care physician (family practitioner, pediatrician, and internist) or an ''emergency medicine'' physician. For certain individuals who develop complications of shingles, a specialist in ophthalmology, neurology, or infectious disease may also be involved. Select patients with postherpetic neuralgia may require the care of a pain specialist.' "
What are medical treatments for shingles?,"'The treatment for shingles is aimed at diminishing the effects of the virus, as well as ''pain management''. There are several medications that can be used, and your doctor will discuss the best treatment options for your particular situation. The vast majority of cases of shingles can be managed at home. In some cases, people with an impaired immune system or individuals with severe symptoms and/or complications may require hospital admission.''Antiviral ''drugs'' (medications used to combat viral infections) are used against the varicella zoster virus. These medications help shorten the course of the illness, decrease the severity of the illness, and hasten the healing of the skin lesions. They may also help prevent the potential complications sometimes encountered with shingles. Antiviral medications are most effective when started within 72 hours of the first appearance of the rash, however, in select cases of shingles (for example, in an immunocompromised person), it can be started after 72 hours. There are several antiviral medications that can be used, including ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax''), ''famciclovir'' (''Famvir''), and ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex''). In certain situations, intravenous (IV) antiviral medication may need to be administered.''Pain medication can be used to help relieve the discomfort caused by the rash, which can sometimes be severe. For some individuals with mild ''shingles pain'', ''over-the-counter'' analgesics such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or the anti-inflammatory drug ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'' or ''Advil'') may be all that is needed. Individuals with more severe pain may require stronger opioid pain medication.''Over-the-counter ''antihistamine'' medication such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') may help alleviate the localized itching.''The use of a ''corticosteroid'' medication, such as ''prednisone'', is used only in select cases of complicated shingles, such as those with eye or ear involvement, and it should be used with concurrent antiviral therapy. Prednisone is not generally recommended in cases of uncomplicated shingles.'

Are there any home remedies for shingles?,"'Care of the skin rash can be provided at home, and this can offer some symptom relief. Topical ''calamine lotion'"" can be applied to the rash in order to decrease itching. Cool wet compresses against the painful rash can sometimes be soothing, and for some individuals, a compress with aluminum acetate solution (Burow's solution or ""'Domeboro'') may also be helpful. For some, colloidal oatmeal baths may also provide relief from the itching. It is important to maintain good personal hygiene, avoid scratching the rash, wear loose-fitting clothes, and to try to keep the affected area clean in order to prevent a secondary bacterial infection of the skin. The rash should be covered to decrease the risk of transmissibility should you come into contact with susceptible individuals.' "
What is the duration of a shingles outbreak?,"'The duration of an acute shingles outbreak may vary, but typically it will last anywhere between two to four weeks. In some individuals, it may last longer.' "
What are complications of shingles?,"'Though shingles often resolves without any major problems, there are several potential complications that can arise from shingles.'   Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN): This is the most common complication of shingles. PHN is characterized by persistent pain and discomfort in the area affected by shingles. The pain can last for months to several years after the rash has cleared up. This complication is thought to occur because of damage to the affected nerves. The pain can sometimes be severe and difficult to control, and the likelihood of developing postherpetic neuralgia increases with age. This chronic post-herpetic pain can sometimes lead to depression and disability. In people 60 years of age and older with shingles, postherpetic neuralgia will develop in approximately 15%-25% of cases. It rarely occurs in people under 40 years of age. Timely treatment with antiviral medication during a shingles outbreak may help reduce the incidence of developing postherpetic neuralgia. If postherpetic neuralgia develops, there are various treatment options available including topical creams such as capsaicin (Zostrix), topical anesthetic lidocaine patches (Lidoderm), antiseizure medications such as gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), tricyclic antidepressant medications, and opioid pain medications. Intrathecal glucocorticoid injections may be useful for select patients with postherpetic neuralgia who do not respond to conventional medications and treatment measures."
What are complications of shingles? (Part 2)," Ramsay Hunt syndrome: If shingles affects the nerves of the face, this uncommon complication can lead to facial muscle paralysis, and the characteristic rash can affect the ear and the ear canal, and rarely the mouth. Symptoms may include ear pain, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and dizziness. Though most people recover fully with treatment, some individuals may have permanent facial weakness and/or hearing loss. Bacterial skin infection: A secondary bacterial infection of the skin blisters can sometimes develop, leading to cellulitis or impetigo. These skin infections may be characterized by increasing redness, tenderness, and warmth in and around the area of the rash. Most of these bacterial skin infections are caused by either Staphylococcus aureus or group A Streptococcus bacteria. These bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics."
What are complications of shingles? (Part 3)," Eye involvement: Shingles can sometimes affect the eye, a condition termed herpes zoster ophthalmicus. In certain cases, it can lead to blindness. Individuals with a rash involving the eye, forehead, or nose should have a careful eye evaluation performed by a doctor, as prompt medical treatment may be necessary. Encephalitis: Rarely, individuals with shingles may develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). This condition can be life-threatening if severe, especially in people with an impaired immune system. Disseminated herpes zoster: This serious and potentially life-threatening condition occurs most commonly in people with an impaired immune system. It is rare in individuals who are otherwise healthy. With disseminated herpes zoster, the varicella zoster virus becomes more widespread. In addition to causing a more widespread rash, the virus can also spread to other organs of the body, including the brain, lung, and liver."
What can be done for recurrent shingles?,"'Though most people will experience only one episode of shingles during their lifetime, recurrence can occur in certain individuals. In order to help prevent recurrent episodes of shingles, individuals with no contraindications can receive the zoster vaccine (Shingrix), which can prevent recurrent episodes of shingles. Otherwise, people who do experience a recurrent case of shingles should see their doctor as soon as the rash appears to promptly receive antiviral medication.' "
What is the prognosis of shingles?,"'Generally speaking, shingles typically resolves within two to four weeks in most individuals. The prognosis is excellent for younger and healthy individuals who develop shingles, with very few experiencing any complications. However, in older individuals and in those with compromised immune systems, the prognosis is more guarded, as complications and more severe outbreaks of shingles occur more commonly in these groups.''Approximately 1%-4% of people who develop shingles require hospitalization for complications, and about 30% of those hospitalized have impaired immune systems. In the U.S., it is estimated that there are approximately 96 deaths per year directly related to the varicella zoster virus, the vast majority of which occur in the elderly and in those who are immunocompromised.' "
Is it possible to prevent shingles with a vaccine?,"'In October 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Shingrix, a non-live vaccine to prevent shingles. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) subsequently endorsed Shingrix as the preferred vaccine for the ''prevention'' of herpes zoster and its related complications in healthy adults 50 years of age and older. Shingrix is also recommended for adults who previously received the current ''shingles vaccine'' ''Zostavax'', which was approved by the FDA in 2006. Shingrix, a two-dose vaccine, was found to prevent shingles in more than 90% of patients who received it in ''clinical trials''. By preventing shingles, Shingrix also decreases the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia. Not only does Shingrix provide superior efficacy across all age groups, but it is also felt to confer longer lasting immunity than Zostavax, which has experienced temporary vaccine shortages due to supply issues. Shingrix is expected to be widely available to U.S. consumers in early 2018. During clinical trials, the most common side effects associated with Shingrix included pain, swelling, and redness at the site of injection, ''headache'', muscle aches, fever, chills, and ''upset stomach''.''Research funded and conducted by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) on shingles and the varicella zoster virus is ongoing to better understand the behavior of this virus. Several other organizations are also involved in research to understand, treat, and prevent varicella zoster virus reactivation.'

Who should get the shingles vaccine?,"'At this time, Shingrix is recommended for healthy adults who are 50 years of age or older. Individuals should receive the vaccine whether or not they recall having had chickenpox, as data shows that more than 99% of Americans over 40 years of age have had chickenpox, even if they do not remember having had it. Shingrix is also recommended for individuals who have already received the Zostavax vaccine, as Shingrix has demonstrated superior efficacy and longer lasting protection.''Shingrix is not indicated for the prevention of primary varicella (chickenpox) infection. The CDC recommends the varicella vaccine for healthy people who do not have evidence of immunity to varicella, including children, adolescents, and adults.' "
What is Ramsay Hunt syndrome? What causes it?," Ramsay Hunt syndrome (also termed Hunt's Syndrome and herpes zoster oticus) is a herpes zoster virus infection of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. It is caused by reactivation of herpes zoster virus that has previously caused chickenpox in the patient. Ramsay Hunt syndrome results in paralysis of the facial muscles on the same side of the face as the infection. So, the virus infects the facial nerve that normally controls the muscles on one side of the face. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is typically associated with a red rash and blisters (inflamed vesicles or tiny water-filled sacks in the skin) in or around the ear and eardrum and sometimes on the roof of the mouth or tongue."
What are the signs and symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome?,"'The classic symptom that clinically distinguishes Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a red painful ''rash'' associated with blisters in the ears and facial paralysis (for example, ''eyelid'' or mouth) on one side of the face. Other symptoms are:\xa0'   ear pain, hearing loss, dizziness (or vertigo), dry eye, and changes in taste sensation may also occur."
How do medical professionals diagnose Ramsay Hunt syndrome?,"'Diagnosis of the syndrome is most often made by observing the symptoms described above (red painful rash with ear and or mouth blisters and one-sided facial paralysis). Also, a ''PCR'' test (''polymerase chain reaction'') can be performed on the fluid from the blisters to demonstrate the viral genetic material, but this test is not done routinely.' "
Is Ramsay Hunt syndrome contagious?,"'The syndrome is not ''contagious''; however, the herpes zoster virus that can be found in the blisters of Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be transmitted to other people and cause ''chickenpox'' in those who are unvaccinated against chickenpox and who have never had chickenpox. Individuals with Ramsay Hunt syndrome should avoid contact with newborns, ''pregnant'' women, immunodepressed individuals, and people with no history of chickenpox, at least until all the blisters change to scabs.' "
How does Ramsay Hunt syndrome compare with Bell's palsy?,"""Bell's palsy also is a result of injury to the facial nerve by a viral infection, but the suspected viral cause of Bell's palsy has not been identified. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the ""'Varicella'' virus (Herpes zoster) that also causes chickenpox and ''shingles'' (a painful, ''blister'""-producing Herpes zoster reinfection that usually occurs on one side of the body). There is no red rash associated with Bell's palsy as there is with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Additionally, Ramsay Hunt syndrome is commonly more painful than Bell's palsy. However, both can cause eyelid and mouth paralysis on one side of the face.""'Dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclona is a rare degenerative disease of the nerves characterized by ''epilepsy'', ''muscle spasms'', and gradually increasing ''tremors'"". Like Bell's palsy, this disease complex mimics many symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Some investigators term the disease complex Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2."" "
What are treatments for Ramsay Hunt syndrome? Is it possible to prevent it?,"'Treatment consists of antiviral agents (for example, ''acyclovir'', ''valacyclovir'' or ''famciclovir'') for about one week, steroids (''prednisone''), and ''pain'' medications. Best results are reported when treatment protocols are started within three days after symptoms appear. Early treatment usually results in a better prognosis (see below). For children, the varicella ''vaccine'' can reduce the chance of getting chickenpox from which the syndrome comes (reactivation of the virus). However, once a person gets chickenpox, the person is susceptible to reactivation of the virus and thus can develop ''shingles'' and/or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Fortunately, there is another vaccine, ''Zostavax'', which is helpful in preventing viral reactivation. Consequently, ''shingles'' and Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be either prevented or their symptoms reduced if the vaccine is administered. Usually, this vaccine is given to individuals that have had chickenpox as children and are now age 60 or older. The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'') suggests the vaccine be routinely given to individuals aged 60 or older, as about 90% of the population has been exposed to chickenpox and about 20% of people that had chickenpox are likely to get ''shingles'' without the vaccine.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome?,"""The prognosis for Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not as good as that for Bell's palsy. There is good clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with steroids, pain medications, and antiviral agents (like acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir) improve recovery and lessen the extreme facial discomfort. However, infrequent complications can develop, such as synkinesis (inappropriate nerve responses such as blinking or tear formation while trying to talk), eye damage, or rarely, viral spread to other nerves causing many other problems (for example, pain, ""'confusion'', ''weakness''). ''Postherpetic neuralgia'' (pain due to nerve ''fiber'' damage by the virus) may also develop and persist for months to years.'  "
Facts you should know about heterochromia iridis," Heterochromia iridis is an uncommon condition in which the two eyes are different in color from each other. Heterochromia iridis may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Hereditary heterochromia iridis may be associated with other abnormalities of the eyes or body. Acquired heterochromia is usually due to an eye disease. If the condition is acquired, treatment may be directed at the underlying cause. Colored contact lenses may be used for cosmetic reasons. Most cases of heterochromia iridis are mild and do not have associated problems."
What is heterochromia iridis?,"'Heterochromia iridis is a condition in which the ''iris'' in one eye has a different color than the ''iris'' of the other eye. The iris is the tissue of the eye that surrounds the pupil and imparts a color, whether green, blue, brown, hazel, grey, or other, to the eye. Heterochromia iridis is to be differentiated from heterochromia (difference in color) iridum (within the iris of one eye).''Iris color is the result of the pigment that is present in the iris. Brown eyes have large amounts of ''melanin'' pigment deposits, and blue eyes have a lack of ''melanin''. Although eye color is ''inherited'', the inheritance pattern is complex, with interaction of more than one gene. These genes interact to provide the full constellation of colors. Other genes may determine the pattern and placement of pigment in the iris, thereby accounting for solid brown as opposed to rays of color. Normally, the two irises of an individual are of the same color. In heterochromia, the affected eye may be hyperpigmented (darker or hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (lighter or hypochromic). Eye color is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin within the iris tissues.'  "
How rare is heterochromia iridis?,"'Heterochromia can be present at birth (congenital) or acquired. The incidence of congenital heterochromia iridis is approximately six out of a 1,000, although in most of these cases, it is hardly noticeable and unassociated with any other abnormality.' "
What are heterochromia iridis symptoms and signs?,"'The appearance of different coloration between the two eyes is usually the only symptom or sign. Many times the difference is so slight that it is only noticed under certain lighting conditions or in close-up photographs. If inflammation or ''trauma'' is the cause, other signs or symptoms may be present. Heterochromia iridis is termed complete when the entire iris in one eye is different in color than that of the other eye. Segmental heterochromia involves only a radial or piece-of-pie-shaped area of one iris. In central heterochromia, there is an inner ring of the iris that is different in color from the rest of the iris. The term heterochromia iridum can be used when the heterochromia is incomplete, as in segmental or central heterochromia.' "
What are risk factors for heterochromia iridis?,"'Familial genetic abnormalities, ''ocular'' trauma, and inflammation are all risk factors for the development of heterochromia iridis. The use of prostaglandin analogue eyedrops for ''glaucoma'' or to stimulate eyelash growth is a modifiable risk factor.' "
What causes heterochromia iridis?,"'Heterochromia is classified primarily by its time of onset as either genetic (congenital, present at or shortly after birth) or acquired. Most cases of heterochromia are hereditary, and these may be associated with a congenital syndrome. Other cases are acquired and caused by a disease or due to an injury. Sometimes one eye may change color following certain diseases or injuries. Heterochromia present at or shortly after birth is usually hereditary or due to intrauterine disease or injury. The genetics of eye color determination involves at least eight different genes, with ''inherited'' eye color being based on various combinations of gene expression. Congenital heterochromia may be familial and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Environmental or acquired factors can alter these inherited traits. An infant with heterochromia should be examined by both a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist for other possible problems. If another disorder is suspected, diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or chromosome studies, may be done to confirm the diagnosis.''Most cases of heterochromia at birth are genetic and unassociated with any other ''ocular'' or systemic abnormality. This is simply called congenital heterochromia iridis. The lighter eye usually shows some loss of iris and therefore is regarded as the affected eye. The lighter iris may be differently colored throughout or only in part.''Congenital syndromes'' which may be characterized by heterochromia iridis include:''Acquired conditions or diseases'' that may present with heterochromia iridis include:'   Waardenburg syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic condition that can cause hearing loss and changes in coloring of the hair, skin, and eyes. ""Piebaldism"" is similar to Waardenburg syndrome but is unassociated with deafness. People with this condition have patches of depigmented skin on their head and trunk, as well as on their eyebrows, eyelids, eyelashes, and hair. Affected people sometimes have heterochromia iridis. Congenital ""Horner's syndrome"" is not a genetic syndrome, but a group of findings due to birth injury or intrauterine brain injury involving the sympathetic nervous system innervation to one eye. On the affected side, the pupil is small, the lid is drooping, and the iris is lighter. It is not associated with hearing loss or additional pigmentation anomalies. Sturge-Weber syndrome, a syndrome characterized by a port-wine stain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve on the face and tumors known as angiomas of the brain and choroid. Neurofibromatosis type 1, also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is a disorder in which there are tumors of nerve cells together with disorders of melanin, causing abnormalities of skin (and eye) pigmentation. Lisch nodules are usually present in the iris. These are clear yellow to brown dome-shaped elevations on the iris and, although they are usually present in both eyes, may be more apparent in one eye. Tuberous sclerosis, also known as Bourneville disease, causes nonmalignant tumors in various organs including the eyes. Hirschsprung disease, a bowel disorder, may be associated with iris heterochromia due to reduction is iris pigmentation. Incontinentia pigmenti, also known as Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome, affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails, and central nervous system. In this condition, the iris may be darker in the affected eye. Parry-Romberg syndrome, or progressive hemifacial atrophy, is a condition that causes the breakdown of the skin and soft tissues of half of the face. The inflammation of iritis or anterior uveitis of any cause, including tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and herpes simplex, may cause loss of iris pigment in the affected eye. Fuchs' heterochromic cyclitis is a condition characterized by a low-grade, asymptomatic uveitis in which the iris in the affected eye becomes hypochromic and has a washed-out, somewhat moth-eaten appearance. Posner-Schlossman syndrome, or glaucomatocyclitic crisis, may cause a lighter iris with repeated attacks. Pigment dispersion syndrome is a condition characterized by loss of pigmentation from the posterior iris surface. This pigment is dispersed throughout the interior of the eye and deposited on various intraocular structures, including the anterior surface of the iris, causing it to darken. This condition also causes pigmentary glaucoma. Trauma, either blunt or penetrating, may cause unilateral lightening of the iris through atrophy of the iris. Prostaglandin analogue eyedrops (Xalatan, Lumigan, Travatan, and others), frequently used for the treatment of glaucoma, may cause darkening of the iris, especially in people with light-colored irises. This occurs from the stimulation of melanin production. This type of medication is also sometimes used for cosmetic purposes (Latisse) to darken and thicken the eyelashes. Retained iron-containing intraocular foreign body may cause siderosis (iron deposition within the eye) resulting in a darker iris. Blood in the anterior chamber (hyphema) of long duration from trauma can lead to iron deposition in the iris from the breakdown of blood products. Ocular melanosis, or nevus of Ota, is a condition characterized by increased pigmentation of the eye and surrounding tissue. Iris ectropion syndrome is a condition in which the back of the iris, which is always dark and full of melanin pigment, turns onto the front of the iris through the pupillary space. Benign tumors of the iris, iris cysts, and iris abscesses can cause darkening or lightening of the iris. Malignant melanoma of the iris or metastatic tumors of the iris. Neovascular changes of the iris (rubeosis iridis) resulting from diabetes mellitus or following central retinal vein occlusion. Acquired Horner syndrome from neuroblastoma or injury/disease affecting the sympathetic nervous system in the neck. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that may manifest in childhood with recurrent infections, peripheral neuropathy, and color changes in the skin and eye. Clouding of the cornea or color changes in the cornea from a multitude of conditions may cause the iris to falsely appear to be different in color. Conditions such as corneal scars, the very common condition of arcus senilis, or the rare condition of Wilson disease can give the appearance of iris color differences."
How do health care professionals diagnose heterochromia iridis?,"'Heterochromia iris is usually noted by the parent of a baby or in acquired cases, by the patient or a family member. Diagnosis can be confirmed through slit lamp examination by an ophthalmologist.' "
Is there a treatment for heterochromia iridis?,"'If the heterochromia is secondary to an underlying cause such as inflammation, treatment should be directed at the underlying condition. In situations in which there is a major cosmetic impairment, a tinted contact ''lens'' may be used to darken the lighter appearing eye or lighten the darker appearing eye. Two differing colored ''contact lenses'' may also be used to arrive at an average color.' "
What is the prognosis of heterochromia iridis?,"'The vast majority of people with heterochromia iridis have an excellent prognosis and have no visual complaints. Most cases are very mild, nonprogressive, and unassociated with any other illness or eye disease. In patients with associated ocular or systemic problems, treatment of the underlying abnormality is often successful in preventing visual loss.' "
"What is hand, foot, and mouth (HFMD) disease?","'Hand, foot, and mouth disease (''HFMD'') is a viral infection characterized by ''fever'' and a typical rash most frequently seen on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and inside the mouth. It should not be confused with foot (hoof) and mouth disease that affects cattle, sheep, and swine.\xa0' "
"What are the early symptoms and signs of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'HFMD is most commonly an illness of the summer and fall seasons.'   Initial symptoms of a low-grade fever (101 F-102 F) and malaise are followed within 1 or 2 days by a characteristic skin rash. Small (2 mm-3 mm) red spots that quickly develop into small blisters (vesicles) appear on the palms, soles, and oral cavity.The gums, tongue, and inner cheek are most commonly involved in the mouth.The foot lesions may also involve the lower calf region and rarely may appear on the buttocks.Oral lesions are commonly associated with a sore throat, uncomfortable eating and drinking, and as a result, a diminished appetite. It is very rare for an infected child to become dehydrated due to oral discomfort. The gums, tongue, and inner cheek are most commonly involved in the mouth. The foot lesions may also involve the lower calf region and rarely may appear on the buttocks. Oral lesions are commonly associated with a sore throat, uncomfortable eating and drinking, and as a result, a diminished appetite. It is very rare for an infected child to become dehydrated due to oral discomfort. It is estimated that approximately 50% of those infected with this enterovirus never develop symptoms. Symptoms are much more common in infants, toddlers, and young children. Older children, teens, and adults are more likely to incur no symptoms."
"What causes hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'HFMD is one of several infectious diseases caused by different members of the ''enterovirus'' family of ''viruses''. The most common cause is Coxsackievirus A16; less frequently enterovirus 71 is the infectious agent. The clinical manifestations of routine HFMD are the same regardless of the responsible virus. However, patients infected with enterovirus 71 are more likely to experience rare complications (for example, viral meningitis or ''cardiac muscle'' involvement).'  "
"Is hand, foot, and mouth disease contagious? How does is it spread?","'HFMD is spread person to person by direct contact with the infecting virus (either Coxsackievirus A16 or less commonly enterovirus 71). These viruses are most commonly found in the nasal and throat regions but also in the ''blister'' fluid or ''stool'' of infected individuals. The virus can survive on inanimate surfaces such as desktops, faucets, etc. It can then be transferred by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your nose, mouth, or eyes before washing your hands. Likewise, changing diapers from an infected infant without wearing gloves or hand-washing can transmit disease. Water contaminated with the virus can also transmit the infection. Women who are infected shortly prior to delivery may pass on the infection to their infant. The baby will generally have a mild illness but should be monitored closely since in rare cases they could develop a more severe infection or experience complications. Infected individuals are most ''contagious'' during the first week of their illness. HFMD cannot be contracted from pets or animals.'""The viruses that cause HFMD may remain in the person's respiratory or intestinal tract for several weeks to months after all symptoms have resolved. It is possible, therefore, to transmit the infection even though the formerly ill individual has completely recovered. Some individuals (most commonly adults) may exhibit no symptoms or signs during their infection but may unwittingly transmit the illness to those (commonly infants and children) who are not immune."" "
"What is the contagious period for hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Once exposed to the virus, those who develop symptoms and signs will do so within 1-3 days. They are most contagious during the first week of the illness. However, the virus may continue to be shed for one to three weeks in respiratory secretions (saliva and/or nasal mucous) and in the ''stool'' for two to eight weeks after the primary infection.' "
"What is the incubation period for hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'HFMD is moderately contagious and spreads from person to person. It cannot be spread by animals. Usually, the virus is passed via oral secretions (nasal discharge and saliva, etc.) or via stool. There is a short 1- to 3-day incubation period between exposure and development of initial symptoms (fever and malaise). A person is most contagious during the first week of illness.' "
"Can adults get hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'An adult who was never exposed to the viruses that cause HFMD as a child could develop the characteristic symptoms and physical signs (vesicular rash with the characteristic distribution) if infected by the virus. Interestingly, the majority of adults exposed to enteroviruses will remain without symptoms. Unfortunately, an infected person is still contagious even though he lacks objective physical findings.' "
"Where does hand, foot, and mouth disease usually occur?","'In the temperate northern hemisphere, summer and fall are the most frequent seasons for community epidemics of HFMD. The illness is year-round in the tropics. While anyone exposed to the viral causes of HFMD may develop disease, not everyone infected will develop symptoms and signs.' "
"How long does hand, foot, and mouth disease last?","'The total duration of illness from HFMD is approximately 5-7 days. One to three days after viral invasion of the patient, the first symptoms become evident. These include fever, reduced appetite, ''sore throat'', and a general sense of feeling ill (malaise). One to two days later, the characteristic painful ''mouth sores'' develop. The final stage of the illness is manifested by small, tender red spots which progress to blisters in the mouth, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and less frequently on the arms and legs, as well as the buttock and genital areas. ' "
"What is the course of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'The illness is characteristically self-limited and is usually resolved within a week, particularly when due to its most common cause, Coxsackievirus A16. In those outbreaks due to enterovirus 71, the illness may be more severe with complications such as infection of the ''heart'' muscle and/or viral meningitis and ''encephalitis'' and paralytic disease. As a rule, HFMD is generally a mild and self-limited illness.' "
"What are the risk factors for hand, foot and mouth disease?","'Risk factors for developing HFMD include' summer and fall seasons, toddler age range, high-risk exposure location (such as daycare and preschool) and close contact (for example, family home) locations, ineffective hygiene -- infrequent soap and water hand-washing or not wearing disposable gloves when changing stool-containing diapers, and a compromised immune system."
"What tests diagnose hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Usually, the diagnosis of HFMD is made on a combination of clinical history and characteristic physical findings. Laboratory confirmation is rarely necessary unless severe complications develop.' "
"What is the treatment for hand, foot, and mouth disease?",'Treatment of HFMD is directed toward symptomatic relief of fever and sore throat. Antibiotics are not indicated in the treatment of this viral disease. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been tried as a therapy for severely ill patients or immunocompromised older patients with variable success.'  
"How does hand, foot, and mouth disease affect pregnancy and the baby?","'Commonly, HFMD is an illness of children less than 10 years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. Information regarding fetal exposure to HFMD during ''pregnancy'' is limited. No solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or ''congenital defects''. However, should a baby be born to a mother with active HFMD symptoms and signs, the risk of ''neonatal'' infection is high. While such newborns often have a mild illness, a ''newborn'' infant is highly vulnerable and may develop an overwhelming and potentially fatal infection involving vital organs such as ''liver'', heart, and brain, which could be fatal.' "
"When can children with hand, foot, and mouth disease return to school?",'Children may return to school once without fever for 24 hours (usually day three or four of the disease).' 
"What are complications of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Complications of HFMD are relatively rare. The more common cause of HFMD (Coxsackievirus A16) is less likely to cause complications when compared with enterovirus-71.''Complications include the following:' ""Aseptic"" (also called ""viral"") meningitis (rare): Symptoms of meningitis are moderate-severe headache, discomfort when bending the head forward (classically tested by trying to touch the chin to the chest), and nausea and vomiting. Meningitis is an infection of the tissues and spinal fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. The diagnosis is confirmed by a lumbar puncture (also known as a ""spinal tap""). Depending upon severity of the patient's symptoms, they may need to be hospitalized. Encephalitis (brain infection): Encephalitis is much less common but more ominous when compared with meningitis and requires hospitalization for close monitoring. Other rare neurologic complications include paralysis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and cerebellar ataxia. Transient and permanent impairment can both occur. Occasionally, the virus may infect the heart muscle fibers and thus compromise the heart's blood-pumping capabilities. Young infants may very rarely become dehydrated due to refusal to take oral fluids as a consequence of mouth pain. In very rare circumstances, the skin vesicles may develop a secondary bacterial infection. A short course of antibiotics are used to treat the secondary infection."
"What is the prognosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease?","""The prognosis for routine HFMD is excellent. A patient's symptoms are bothersome but not debilitating. Medications designed to reduce fever and/or ""'pain'' relievers are helpful, such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' or ''Motrin''). Young children often find that cool/soft foods (ice cream, smoothies, etc.) provide some pain relief and are psychologically helpful as ""special treats."" An individual assessment is required for those unique individuals who develop complications (such as meningitis). As would be anticipated, those with an immunocompromised status are more likely to develop either a more serious infection or an illness of a more intense nature than those with a normally functioning immune system.' "
"Can you prevent hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'There is no ''vaccine'"" to prevent HFMD. Routine hygiene (soap and water washing of the hands) is a primary strategy to limit transmission of the virus. Cleaning a child's toys (especially those which would be placed into the mouth or drooled upon) is important. Avoidance of direct saliva exposure (kissing, sharing eating utensils, etc.) is also very helpful to limit transmission. Since transmission of the virus is also possible via stool, wearing disposable gloves during changing of diapers (especially in a preschool or day care setting) is also beneficial."" "
"Why haven't we heard more about hand, foot, and mouth disease?","'Recognition of hand, foot, and mouth disease is relatively recent (when contrasted with ''mumps'', ''measles'', and ''chickenpox'', for example). HFMD was first reported in 1956 in Australia. By the early 1960s, it had emerged as a common childhood illness around the world.' "
"What is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'Hand, foot, and mouth disease'' are caused by ''viruses'' called enteroviruses. Many different types of these ''viruses'' can cause the disease, but in the U.S., the most common cause is Coxsackievirus A16. The disease is called ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' because a few days after the individual develops symptoms of a ''fever'', reduced appetite, ''sore throat'', and feeling weak, painful sores can develop on the palms of the hands, on soles of the ''feet'', and in the ''mouth''. Some individuals may also develop sores on the knees, elbows, buttocks, and genital area. The sores can ''blister'' and ulcerate. The disease is common and usually affects infants and children under 5 years of age (although it is possible for adults to get the disease).'  "
"Is hand, foot, and mouth disease contagious?","'Hand, foot, and mouth disease'' is highly ''contagious''. It is easily spread by nose and throat secretions (nasal ''mucus'', saliva, kissing, for example). For children, is common to transmit the disease by the fecal-oral route. In addition, these viruses can be transmitted in contaminated droplets developed during ''sneezing'' or ''coughing'' and if the droplets land on objects, uninfected people can be contaminated if they pick up the object and then put their hands in their mouth or touch their face. A person may be ''contagious'' before symptoms develop and is most contagious during the first week of illness. However, some individuals can be contagious for weeks after symptoms and signs remit. Some people, especially adults, develop no symptoms but still can be contagious.' "
"What is the incubation period for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?",'The incubation period (time from initial exposure to development of symptoms) for ''HFMD'' ranges from about three to six days. ''Fever'' is usually the first or early symptom.' 
"How long is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) contagious?",'Individuals with ''HFMD'' can be contagious during the incubation period (about three to six days) before symptoms develop and may remain contagious for days or weeks after the symptoms and signs abate. Even people with mild or no symptoms and signs during infection can be contagious. People are most contagious during the first week after symptoms and signs develop.' 
"How do I know someone has hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'In general, HFMD is diagnosed by the characteristic symptoms and signs of sores on the hands, ''feet'"", and mouth, along with patient's history, age, and probability of association with a child or other person with the disease. If the patient has a severe case of HFMD, throat and ""'stool'' samples for viral cultures can be used to identify the viral strain that is causing the disease. This test may diagnose the disease definitively and provide physicians with evidence of an outbreak in their area.' "
"How is hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) transmitted?","'HFMD is spread by nose and throat secretions, from the ''blisters'' or ulcers, and by feces. In addition, kissing, mucosal contact, and touching objects like toys or other items that have had contact with infected body fluids may spread HFMD. Occasionally, some individuals may get the disease from droplets that are spread in the air. Child care businesses often have outbreaks of this disease. In small wading pools that are inadequately chlorinated, children may transmit the disease to others (both children and adults) usually by fecal contamination of the pool water.' "
"How will I know someone is cured of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'After symptoms develop for HFMD, it takes about five to seven days with the symptoms to resolve. Although the individual is cured of HFMD when symptoms and signs stop, the individual may still shed viruses for a week or so. There are many viruses that cause HFMD. Resolution of one infection may not protect against subsequent different viral types that can cause HFMD; consequently, a person can get the disease again. However, as children get older, they are less likely to get HFMD.' "
"When should I contact medical caregiver about hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)?","'For most children and adults, HFMD is a self-limiting disease that resolves with no therapy and does not require treatment by a medical ''caregiver''. However, if symptoms and signs become severe and especially if the individual becomes dehydrated (poor fluid intake, dry mucous membranes, and little or no urination) and/or is not acting normally, a medical ''caregiver'' should be contacted urgently or the individual should be seen at an emergency department.''Although there is no evidence that HFMD in a ''pregnant'' woman affects the fetus, the disease may be transferred to the neonate if the woman has HFMD at delivery. ''Pregnant'' women should contact their ''OB/GYN'' physician if they suspect they have HFMD during ''pregnancy''.'  "
What is hemoglobin?,"'Hemoglobin is the protein molecule in ''red blood cells'' that carries oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.""'Hemoglobin is made up of four protein molecules (globulin chains) that are connected together. The normal adult hemoglobin (abbreviated Hgb or Hb) molecule contains two alpha-globulin chains and two beta-globulin chains. In fetuses and infants, beta chains are not common and the hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two gamma chains. As the infant grows, the gamma chains are gradually replaced by beta chains, forming the adult hemoglobin structure.''Each globulin chain contains an important iron-containing porphyrin compound termed heme. Embedded within the heme compound is an iron atom that is vital in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide in our blood. The iron contained in hemoglobin is also responsible for the red color of blood.''Hemoglobin also plays an important role in maintaining the shape of the red blood cells. In their natural shape, red blood cells are round with narrow centers resembling a donut without a hole in the middle. Abnormal hemoglobin structure can, therefore, disrupt the shape of red blood cells and impede their function and flow through blood vessels.' "
How is hemoglobin measured?,"'Hemoglobin is usually measured as a part of the routine ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') test from a blood sample.''Several methods exist for measuring hemoglobin, most of which are done currently by automated machines designed to perform different tests on blood. Within the machine, the red blood cells are broken down to get the hemoglobin into a solution. The free hemoglobin is exposed to a chemical containing cyanide that binds tightly with the hemoglobin molecule to form cyanomethemoglobin. By shining a light through the solution and measuring how much light is absorbed (specifically at a wavelength of 540 nanometers), the amount of hemoglobin can be determined.' "
What are normal hemoglobin values?,"'The hemoglobin level is expressed as the amount of hemoglobin in grams (gm) per deciliter (dL) of whole blood, a deciliter being 100 milliliters.''The normal ranges for hemoglobin depend on the age and, beginning in adolescence, the gender of the person. The normal ranges are:''All of these values may vary slightly between laboratories. Some laboratories do not differentiate between adult and ""after middle age"" hemoglobin values. ''Pregnant'' females are advised to avoid both high and low hemoglobin levels to avoid increasing risks of stillbirths (high hemoglobin – above the normal range) and premature birth or low-birth-weight baby (low hemoglobin – below the normal range).' Newborns: 17 to 22 gm/dL One (1) week of age: 15 to 20 gm/dL One (1) month of age: 11 to 15 gm/dL Children: 11 to 13 gm/dL Adult males: 14 to 18 gm/dL Adult women: 12 to 16 gm/dL Men after middle age: 12.4 to 14.9 gm/dL Women after middle age: 11.7 to 13.8 gm/dL"
What does a low hemoglobin level mean?,"'A ''low hemoglobin level'' is referred to as ''anemia'' or low red blood count. A lower than normal number of red blood cells is referred to as ''anemia'' and hemoglobin levels reflect this number. There are many reasons (causes) for anemia.''Some of the more common causes of anemia are:' loss of blood (traumatic injury, surgery, bleeding, colon cancer, or stomach ulcer), nutritional deficiency (iron, vitamin B12, folate), bone marrow problems (replacement of bone marrow by cancer), suppression by red blood cell synthesis bychemotherapy drugs, kidney failure, and abnormal hemoglobin structure (sickle cell anemia or thalassemia)."
What does a high hemoglobin level mean?,"'Higher than normal hemoglobin levels can be seen in people living at high altitudes and in people who smoke. ''Dehydration'' produces a falsely high hemoglobin measurement that disappears when proper fluid balance is restored.''Some other infrequent causes are high hemoglobin levels are:' advanced lung disease (for example, emphysema); certain tumors; a disorder of the bone marrow known as polycythemia rubra vera, and; abuse of the drug erythropoietin (Epogen) by athletes for blood doping purposes (increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body by chemically raising the production of red blood cells)."
What is sickle cell disease?,"'Sickle cell disease'' is a genetic condition in which the quality of hemoglobin is defective. This condition can cause abnormal hemoglobin that can result in abnormally-shaped (sickled) red blood cells (see illustration). These abnormal red blood cells cannot easily pass through small blood vessels leading to inadequate oxygen for the tissues of the body.''Sickle cells also have a shorter life span than normal red blood cells (10 to 20 days compared to 120 days). This rapid turnover may result in inadequate time to replace the red blood cells and may result in anemia.''In ''sickle cell anemia'', one defective hemoglobin gene is ''inherited'' from each parent. If only one gene is inherited from one parent, then the condition is milder and referred to as sickle cell trait.''Symptoms of sickle cell anemia vary depending on its severity. Patients with sickle cell trait may experience mild, if any, symptoms at all. In sickle cell disease, symptoms are more significant, especially in episodes of acute crisis. These symptoms can include:' generalized body aches and pain, chest pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, ulceration of skin, fatigue, strokes, blindness, and delayed growth and puberty."
What is thalassemia?,"""Thalassemia is a group of hereditary conditions with quantitative hemoglobin deficiency. The body's failure to make globulin molecules will lead to a compensatory mechanism to make other less compatible globulin molecules. The different types of thalassemia are defined based on what type of globulin molecule is deficient. The severity of these conditions depends on the type of deficient globulin chain, the number of deficient globulins, and the severity of the underproduction. Mild disease may only present as mild anemia whereas severe deficiency may not be compatible with life."" "
What is the hemoglobin A1c test?,"'Hemoglobin A1c'' or glycosylated hemoglobin is a rough indication of blood ''sugar'' control in people with ''diabetes mellitus'' over the preceding 3 months. As more glucose (blood ''sugar'') circulates in the blood on a daily basis, more glucose is bound to the circulating hemoglobin. Normal hemoglobin A1c levels range between 4% to 5.9%. As this number reaches 6% or greater, it signifies poorer ''diabetes'' control.''A hemoglobin A1c of 6% roughly correlates with an average blood sugar level of 135 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliters) over the previous 3 months. Each 1% increase in hemoglobin A1c above 6% represents an average blood sugar of approximately 35 mg/dL over 135 mg/dL. For example, a hemoglobin A1c measurement of 7% corresponds to an average blood sugar level of 170 mg/dL in the previous 3 months.' "
How can a person increase his or her hemoglobin level?,"'There are a number of ways to increase hemoglobin levels. In general, low hemoglobin levels that need to be increased are caused by three circumstances: decreased red blood cell production (for example, altered bone marrow hemoglobin production, ''iron deficiency''), increased red blood cell destruction (for example, ''liver disease''), and by blood loss (for example, ''trauma'' from a gunshot or knife ''wound''). Addressing these underlying causes of low hemoglobin levels initially determines what method to use to increase hemoglobin levels.''Methods to increase hemoglobin levels are varied and their use depends on the underlying problems. Some of the ways to increase hemoglobin include:''Individuals should not take iron ''supplements'' or other treatments for low hemoglobin levels without first discussing such treatments with their physician as side effects from these treatments and/or excess iron intake may cause additional problems. Also, iron ''supplements'' should be kept away from children as iron poisoning in young children can be fatal.' transfusing red blood cells receiving erythropoietin (a hormone used to stimulate red blood cell production in individuals with decreased red blood cell production or increased red cell destruction) taking iron supplements increasing the intake of iron-rich foods (eggs, spinach, artichokes, beans, lean meats, and seafood) and foods rich in cofactors (such as vitamin B6, folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin C) important for maintaining normal hemoglobin levels. Such foods include fish, vegetables, nuts, cereals, peas, and citrus fruits."
What is a hiatal hernia (definition)?,'The ''esophagus'' connects the throat to the stomach. It passes through the chest and enters the abdomen through a hole in the ''diaphragm'' called the esophageal hiatus. The term hiatal ''hernia'' describes a condition where the upper part of the stomach that normally is located just below the diaphragm in the abdomen pushes or protrudes through the esophageal hiatus to rest within the chest ''cavity''.'  
What does a hiatal hernia feel like (symptoms and signs)?,"'Hiatal hernias do not cause\xa0symptoms, and most are found incidentally when a person has a ''chest X-ray'' or abdominal ''X-rays'', including;''Unfortunately, the esophagus does not have a similar protective lining. Instead, it relies on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a band of muscle located at the junction of the stomach and esophagus, and the muscle of the diaphragm surrounding the esophagus to act as a valve to prevent acid from refluxing from the stomach into the esophagus.''Moreover, to the esophageal sphincter (LES), the normal location of the stomach and esophageal junction within the abdominal ''cavity'' is important in keeping acid where it belongs. There is increased pressure within the abdominal cavity compared to the chest cavity, particularly during inspiration which would normally cause the acid and contents from the stomach to reflux back into the esophagus, but the combination of pressure exerted within the lower mostly is from the esophageal sphincter (LES), and the muscle of the diaphragm create a zone of higher pressure that keeps stomach acid in the stomach.''In the situation of a sliding hiatal hernia, the gasatroesophageal\xa0and esophagus junction moves above the diaphragm and into the chest, and the portion of the higher-pressure zone due to the diaphragm is lost. Acid is allowed to reflux back into the esophagus causing inflammation of the lining of the esophagus.\xa0''The ''symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') include''People of any age can get a hiatal hernia\xa0from infants to the elderly. Fortunately, it is very rare.''Usually, people with a paraesophageal sphincter\xa0have no symptoms of reflux because the gastroeophageal esophagus\xa0junction remains below the diaphragm, but if the hernia is large, the way the stomach rotates into the chest, there is the possibility of volvulus of the stomach in which the stomach twists upon itself. Fortunately, paraesophageal hernias are relatively uncommon.''Rarely, gastric volvulus of the stomach in which an abnormal rotation of the stomach more than 180 degrees is a surgical emergency and causes difficulty with'

Rarely, some people with a hiatal hernia, it may reflux acid droplets into the back of their throat. This acid can be inhaled or aspirated into the lung causingcoughing spasms,asthma, orrepeated lung infections including pneumonia and bronchitis. coughing spasms, asthma, or repeated lung infections including pneumonia and bronchitis. painful swallowing, chest pain, and vomiting."
What causes a hiatal hernia? What does it look like (pictures)?,"'Normally, the space\xa0where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm is sealed by the phrenoesophageal membrane, (a thin membrane of tissue connecting the esophagus with the diaphragm) where the esophagus passes through the diaphragm.\xa0 Thus, the chest cavity and abdominal cavity are separated from each other. Because the muscles of the esophagus tighten and the esophagus shortens with each swallow, essentially squeezing food into the stomach, this membrane needs to be elastic to allow the esophagus to move up and down.''Normal physiology allows the gastroeophageal junction, where the esophagus and stomach meet, to move back and forth within the hiatus. However; at rest the gastroeophageal junction should be located below the diaphragm and in the abdominal cavity. It is important to remember that these distances are very short.''Over time, the phrenoesophageal membrane may weaken, and a part of the stomach may herniate through the membrane.\xa0 It may remain above the diaphragm permanently or move back and forth across the diaphragm.''Hiatal hernias are common, and in the majority of cases the cause is unknown.\xa0They may be present at birth or develop later in life.' Pregnancy: Theoretically, decreased abdominal muscle tone and increased pressure within the abdominal cavity could lead to the development of a hiatal hernia. Thus, people who are obese and women who are pregnant may be at an increased risk for developing a hiatal hernia although this has not been demonstrated. Constipation and vomiting: People who have repetitive vomiting or those who have constipation and strain to have a bowel movement, increase the intra-abdominal pressure when they strain, and this may weaken the phrenoesophageal membrane. The membrane also may weaken and lose its elasticity as a part of aging. Ascites: Ascites is an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity, which is often seen in people with liver failure, also may be associated with the development of a hiatal hernia."
What are the types of hiatal hernias?,"'There are three types of hiatal hernias.'   Sling hiatal hernia: A sliding hiatal hernia is the most common type of hiatal hernia is a sliding hiatal hernia.A sliding hiatal hernia accounts for 95% of all hiatal hernias. In a sliding hernia, a portion of the stomach slides upward through the diaphragm and into the chest such that the junction of the esophagus and stomach (gastro- esophageal junction) lies in the chest.A sliding hernia is present during inspiration when the diaphragm contracts and descends toward the abdominal cavity and when the esophagus shortens during swallowing, but at rest it is not present. A sliding hiatal hernia accounts for 95% of all hiatal hernias.  In a sliding hernia, a portion of the stomach slides upward through the diaphragm and into the chest such that the junction of the esophagus and stomach (gastro- esophageal junction) lies in the chest. A sliding hernia is present during inspiration when the diaphragm contracts and descends toward the abdominal cavity and when the esophagus shortens during swallowing, but at rest it is not present. Paraesophageal hernia: A paraesophageal hernia accounts for only 5% of hiatal hernias, the gap in the the diaphragm through which the hernia occurs, phrenoesophageal membrane is larger, and a portion of the stomach herniates into the chest alongside the esophagus and stays there, but the junction between the stomach and the esophagus remains below the diaphragm. Paraesophageal and sliding: In a combination of events, should the defect in the diaphragm become larger, the junction between the stomach and the esophagus can herniate through the diaphragm into the chest causing a hernia that is both paraesophageal and sliding."
What procedures and tests diagnose hiatal hernias?," X-rays, EDG, and CT scan: Most often, a hiatal hernia is found incidentally with gastrointestinal X-rays, EGD, and sometimes CT scan, since by itself, it causes no symptoms. Only when there are associated symptoms of GERD will that usually need treatment. With symptoms of GERD, it is likely that a hiatal hernia is present since most people with GERD have hiatal hernias. Barium swallow or upper GI series: Often, the diagnosis of a hiatal hernia is confirmed by a barium swallow or upper GI series, where a radiologist uses fluoroscopy to observe in real time as the swallowed barium outlines the esophagus, stomach and upper part of the small intestine. In addition to seeing the anatomy, the radiologist also can comment upon the movement of the muscles that work to propel the barium (and presumably) food through the esophagus into the stomach and beyond. Endoscopy: Endoscopy is a procedure performed under sedation by a gastroenterologist to look at the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. A hiatal hernia may be diagnosed easily in this manner and more importantly, the physician may be able to see complications of GERD from the reflux of acid. Endoscopy is used to diagnose scarring with strictures (narrowing of the esophagus) and precancerous conditions like Barrett's esophagus. Biopsies or small tissue samples may be taken and examined under a microscope."
What is the treatment for hiatal hernias?,"'The treatment for hiatal hernia is really treatment for GERD and minimizing ''acid reflux''. This includes'

   decreasing acid secretion in the stomach, avoiding substances that are irritating to the stomach lining, and mechanical means to keep the remaining acid in the stomach where it belongs."
What medications treat hiatal hernias?,"'Proton pump inhibitor (''PPIs'') medications are commonly used to decrease acid production, which include'   omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and esomeprazole (Nexium)."
When is surgery for a hiatal hernia necessary?,"'Most often, the surgery is done as a minimally invasive procedure using a laparoscope. While there are different techniques, the results are similar and the best option is usually the one the surgeon feels most comfortable performing in a specific situation.''Proton pump inhibitor medications:'' With the development of proton pump inhibitor medications, medical therapy has decreased the necessity of surgery for sliding hiatal hernias, and it is often only recommended for people who have failed aggressive drug treatment or who have developed complications of GERD include\xa0''Paraesophageal hernias:'' People with paraesophageal hernias often have no symptoms, and surgery is required only if the hernias become trapped in the chest and become stuck in the diaphragmatic hiatus or rotate to cause a volvulus. While this is more commonly seen in older people, paraesophageal hernias also may occur from birth as a congenital condition in neonates and infants.'   strictures, ulcers, and bleeding or those with repeated pneumonia form aspiration."
"What diet changes help avoid hiatal hernia pain, symptoms, and triggers?","'Foods, ''drinks'', and home changes that treat ''hiatal hernia symptoms''\xa0include:''However, most people are generally aware of the foods that trigger heartburn symptoms and avoid them.'   Elevating the head of the bed when sleeping to allow gravity to prevent acid from refluxing into the esophagus. Eating small frequent meals may help instead of eating two or three larger meals a day. Some foods that that trigger hiatal symptoms should be avoided, and includespicy,greasy foods,onions,tomatoes, andcitrus fruits, spicy, greasy foods, onions, tomatoes, and citrus fruits,"
What are the complications of a hiatal hernia? Is it serious?,"'If treated, a hiatal hernia is appropriately and lifestyle changes are made, you can minimize the effects of a hiatal hernia.\xa0If left untreated, complications can cause a strangulated hiatal hernia, which symptoms include''Signs and symptoms of a hiatal hernia that needs to be treated right away'', include''Strangulated hernia is a medical emergency.

Why do we hiccup?,"'Hiccups (also spelled hiccough) are sudden, involuntary contractions (spasms) of the diaphragm muscle. When the muscle spasms, the vocal cords snap shut, producing the hiccup sound.''Hiccups are often rhythmic. They are usually just a temporary minor annoyance, but prolonged hiccups may signal a major medical problem. The longest recorded hiccup attack is six decades!''Women and men tend to get hiccups equally as often, but hiccups that last more than 48 hours are more common in men. Hiccups can even occur in a fetus while still in utero.''The medical term for hiccups is ''singultus'', which comes from the Latin word for “gasp” or “sob.”' "
What causes hiccups?,"'Most of the time, there is no obvious cause for hiccups. However, there are some common known causes of hiccups.''Some causes of hiccups include:''Some medications may also have hiccups as a side effect, for example:' Eating too quickly and swallowing air along with foods. Eating too much (fatty or spicy foods, in particular) or drinking too much (carbonated beverages or alcohol) can distend the stomach and cause irritation of the diaphragm, which can cause hiccups. Any disease or disorder that irritates the nerves that control the diaphragm (such as liver disease, pneumonia, or other lung disorders). Abdominal surgery can also irritate the nerves that control the diaphragm, causing hiccups. Strokes or brain tumors involving the brain stem, and some chronic medical disorders (such as renal failure) have also been reported to cause hiccups. Noxious fumes can also trigger hiccups. Sudden changes in temperature Fear or excitement Medications for acid reflux Most benzodiazepines, including diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) Levodopa, nicotine, and ondansetron (Zofran)"
How can hiccups in infants and babies be stopped?,"'As in adults, hiccups in newborns, infants, and ''babies'' are common and generally of no concern. If hiccups occur during feeding, stop feeding until the hiccups go away. Usually the hiccups will ""go away"" in an infant or baby. You may try changing the position of the infant or baby; try to get your baby to ''burp''; or calming him/her down to cure the hiccups. Sometimes resuming feeding will stop the hiccups. If your baby frequently hiccups during feedings, feed your baby when he or she is already relaxed, and is not overly hungry yet.'""If your child's hiccups worsen or they seem to upset him, contact your pediatrician."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of hiccups?,"'Sudden, forceful movement of the diaphragm, that causes the hiccup sound, is the only symptom of hiccups.'  "
When should I contact my doctor for hiccups?,"'Most cases of hiccups resolve themselves in a short time, and rarely are a medical emergency. See your doctor if hiccups last more than 3 hours, or if they disturb your eating or sleeping habits.''Seek medical attention if hiccups are associated with: ''abdominal pain'', ''fever'', ''shortness of breath'', ''vomiting'', ''coughing up blood'', or feeling as if your throat is going to close up.'  "
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of hiccups? Which types of doctors treat hiccups?,"'Most of us know what a hiccup feels like and how to recognize it. In a medical setting, the diagnosis of hiccups is based on physical evaluation. Blood tests or ''X-rays'' are usually not necessary unless your hiccups are a symptom of an associated medical condition.''Hiccups generally go away on their own and do not require medical treatment, however, if hiccups last more than three hours or disturb eating or sleeping, you may see your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internist, or a child’s pediatrician.''There may be many different specialists who treat hiccups depending on the underlying cause, for example:' If the cause is a stroke or other neurological disorder, you may see a neurologist, a specialist in the nervous system and brain. If the cause is acid reflux, you may see a gastroenterologist, a specialist in disorders of the digestive system. If the cause is lung disease or pneumonia, you may see a pulmonologist, a specialist in disorders of the respiratory tract."
"How can I stop, get rid of, and cure hiccups?","'There are numerous home cures for hiccups. You can try these methods at home to get rid of hiccups:''Methods that cause the body to retain carbon dioxide, which is thought to relax and stop the spasms of the diaphragm, which cause the hiccups:''Techniques that stimulate the nasopharynx and the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the stomach, and can decrease hiccuping:'   Hold your breath Drink a glass of water quickly Have someone frighten you Pull hard on your tongue Bite on a lemon Gargle with water Drink from the far side of a glass Use smelling salts Place one-half teaspoon of dry sugar on the back of your tongue. (This process can be repeated three times at 2-minute intervals. Use corn syrup, not sugar, for young children.)"
Is there medical treatment for hiccups?,"'Most hiccups will stop on their own. Home remedies are generally sufficient to resolve hiccuping.''For persistent hiccups (lasting more than three hours), treatment varies, and you may need to contact your doctor.''A health-care professional may prescribe medications for severe, chronic hiccups. Chlorpromazine (Thorazine) is usually the first-line medication prescribed for hiccups. Other medications used to treat hiccups include haloperidol (Haldol) and metoclopramide (Reglan).''Some muscle relaxants, ''sedatives'', analgesics, and even ''stimulants'' have also been reported to help alleviate hiccup symptoms.''Phrenic nerve surgery (the nerve that controls the diaphragm) is a treatment of last resort. This treatment rarely is performed, and phrenic nerve surgery is used only in individuals with long-term hiccups that do not respond to other treatments.' A ""hiccup bout"" is an episode of hiccups that lasts up to 48 hours ""Persistent hiccups"" continue more than 48 hours, up to 1 month ""Intractable hiccups"" last longer than 1 month"
Are there any complications of hiccups?,"'Because most cases of hiccups resolve themselves either spontaneously or with self-administered treatment, complications are extremely rare.''In severe and persistent cases, where hiccups disturb eating and sleeping patterns, ''weight loss'', or ''sleep'' disturbances may occur.''Rarely, cardiac arrhythmias and ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'' and GER) have been noted in severe cases of hiccups.'  "
Is it possible to prevent hiccups?,"'Hiccups cannot always be prevented. Avoiding overeating, eating too quickly, or drinking too much can help prevent hiccups.' "
What is cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'Cholescintigraphy is a test done by nuclear medicine physicians to diagnose obstruction of the bile ducts (for example, by a gallstone or a ''tumor''), disease of the gallbladder, and bile leaks. It sometimes is referred to as a HIDA scan or a gallbladder scan.' "
How is cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) done?,"'For cholescintigraphy, a radioactive chemical is injected intravenously into the patient. The test chemical is removed from the blood by the ''liver'' and secreted into the bile which is produced by the liver. The test chemical then disperses everywhere that the bile goes-into the bile ducts, the gallbladder, and the intestine. A camera that senses radioactivity (like a Geiger counter) is then placed over the patient\'s abdomen and a ""picture"" of the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder and surrounding areas is obtained which corresponds to where the radioactive chemical has traveled within the bile-filled liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder. Cholescintigraphy takes approximately two hours.' "
How are the results of cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan) used?,"'There are various patterns of radioactivity that can be seen following the injection of the radioactive chemical, and each has a different meaning. If the test chemical is not detected in the liver, a diseased liver is probably indicated. If the chemical is absorbed by the liver but not secreted into the bile ducts, there probably is a complete obstruction of the bile ducts exiting the liver. When the test chemical fails to appear in the gallbladder, but is detected in the intestine, there probably is an obstruction of the cystic duct leading to and from the gallbladder. (Obstruction is most commonly caused by ''gallstones'' and, less commonly, by tumors. Parasites, and ''blood clots'' also may obstruct infrequently.) Finally, if the chemical appears outside the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, or intestine, there probably is a bile leak from the bile ducts or gallbladder.''Cholescintigraphy is most commonly used to diagnose problems with the gallbladder when other more commonly-performed tests, particularly ''ultrasonography'', are normal or non-diagnostic. Cholescintigraphy can be modified with the addition of an intravenous injection of cholecystokinin, the hormone that is normally released by the body after a meal. This hormone causes the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its bile into the intestine. Reduced contraction of the gallbladder following cholecystokinin (i.e., reduced emptying of the radioactivity from the gallbladder) may mean that there is disease of the gallbladder itself, particularly inflammation or scarring of the wall.' "
What are the limitations of cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'Nonvisualization (the failure of the gallbladder to appear on a cholescintigraphy scan) of the gallbladder occurs because of disease of the gallbladder, particularly ''gallstones'"". However, nonvisualization does not necessarily mean that the obstruction is the cause of the patient's problem. For example, patients with ""'gallstones'"" often have a nonvisualizing gallbladder due to obstruction of the cystic duct, but the obstruction causes no symptoms. Thus, cholescintigraphy is helpful only if the patient's problem is likely-based on the history and physical examination-to be due to disease of the gallbladder or bile ducts.""""With the use of cholecystokinin, poor contraction of the gallbladder can be seen in some normal individuals. Therefore, reduced contraction does not always mean that the gallbladder is diseased. Again, cholescintigraphy with cholecystokinin is helpful only if the patient's problem is likely-based on the history and physical examination-to be due to disease of the gallbladder or bile ducts.""""Another limitation of cholescintigraphy is that this test does not work when the patient's serum ""'bilirubin'' is greater than 4 mg/dl.' "
What are the side effects of cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'There are few side effects to cholescintigraphy. Reactions to the radioactive chemical and cholecystokinin are rare.  The amount of radioactivity that patients are exposed to is small.  The radioactive compound is eliminated in the ''stool'', and the radioactivity deteriorates rapidly within hours.'  "
What alternatives are there to cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)?,"'Other common means of evaluating the gallbladder and bile ducts include ultrasonography and ''computerized tomography'' (CT or CAT scan). Cholangiography, either percutaneous (through the skin) or endoscopic (''ERCP'') (inserted down the throat), is a radiological procedure in which dye is injected into the gallbladder and bile ducts and then ''X-rays'' are taken. Newer procedures include endoscopic ultrasonography and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') cholangiography. Oral cholecystography in which X-rays are taken of the gallbladder following ingestion of a dye that is concentrated in the gallbladder, is currently rarely done.' "
What is hidradenitis suppurativa?,"'Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects hair follicles in the armpits and groin but occasionally may involve the buttocks and ''scalp''. The lesions often first appear in ''puberty'' but may begin at any age. The lesions appear as tender, red abscesses that may drain. Severe hidradenitis suppurativa can involve larger areas of skin, producing multiple draining sinuses with scarring.' "
What causes and risk factors of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?,"'Although as many as 40% of patients with HS have a family history of this condition, the precise genetic defect is poorly understood. Health researchers have found a defect in the gamma-secretase Notch signaling pathway in a few patients, but this basic cell regulatory pathway appears mutated only in a minority of those with HS. Patients with HS tend to be ''obese'' and frequently smoke. There is microscopic evidence that inflammation in the hair follicles is the seat of the problem and not the apocrine sweat glands as was originally believed. Ultimately, the precise cause is unknown.''The risk factors for hidradenitis suppurativa are:' Obesity, high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), diabetes, acne, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and depression."
What are hidradenitis suppurativa symptoms and signs?,"  Patients with the skin condition develop recurrent boil-like lesions in their armpits and groin (areas with sweat glands). Individual lesions may join to produce long draining sinus tracts that are tender and continually produce foul-smelling pus drainage. When healing occurs, it often leaves multiple unsightly scarring. Less commonly, lesions can involve the lower abdomen and the tissues under the breasts."
What types of physicians treat hidradenitis suppurativa?,'Dermatologist are well equipped to care for patients with this condition although they may require surgical support if removal of significant portions of the armpits and groin are required for control.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose hidradenitis suppurativa?,"'A patient with recurrent abscesses in the armpit, groin, or buttocks may well have HS. The condition may vary from mild to quite severe cases. Infections produced by bacteria or fungi need to be excluded because they often are quite curable with antibiotics, whereas HS is not. Doctors may check patients for immune deficiency diseases.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for hidradenitis suppurativa?,"'Since this is a chronic recurrent condition, there are many treatment options depending on the severity.''Since this is a chronic and difficult condition, doctors have proposed various other options, but most lack compelling evidence of efficacy. Physicians recommend ''finasteride'' (''Proscar''), a drug used to treat ''benign prostatic hypertrophy'', as an option to treat HS in certain patients with resistant disease. In view of its cost and safety profile, it seem a reasonable alternative in patients who are unresponsive to conventional measures. There is anecdotal evidence that an oral retinoid, ''acitretin'', can be of benefit.''The FDA recently approved a new injectable medication, ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), for moderate to severe HS. ''Humira'' is one of a class of medications called ''tumor'' necrosis factor inhibitors, which intercept a chemical messenger of inflammation.''Occasionally, it may be necessary to resort to surgery to control and treat HS. It may be necessary for physicians to surgically open persistent chronic fistulous tracts to facilitate healing. Rarely, extensive removal of significant portions of axillary (armpit) or inguinal tissue may be required, followed by skin grafting.'  For mild disease with infrequent lesions, doctors recommend that patients use topical antibiotics, lose weight, stop smoking, and avoid tight underwear. For more severe involvement, it may be necessary to add an oral antibiotic, such as doxycycline."
What is the prognosis of hidradenitis suppurativa?,"'Since HS is a chronic, recurrent condition, a cure is unlikely, but with the advent of new ''drugs'' that are effective modulators of inflammation, it is reasonable to expect safe and effective control of this difficult condition.' "
Is it possible to prevent hidradenitis suppurativa?,"'Currently, there is no known method of ''prevention'' of HS.' "
What is hyperkalemia?,"'Hyperkalemia is a common diagnosis. Fortunately, most patients who are diagnosed have mild hyperkalemia (which is usually well tolerated). However, any condition causing even mild hyperkalemia should be treated to prevent progression into more severe hyperkalemia. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood (severe hyperkalemia) can lead to ''cardiac arrest'' and death. When not recognized and treated properly, severe hyperkalemia results in a high mortality rate.''Technically, hyperkalemia means an abnormally elevated level of potassium in the blood. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Potassium levels between 5.1 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L reflect mild hyperkalemia. Potassium levels of 6.1 mEq/L to 7.0 mEq/L are moderate hyperkalemia, and levels above 7 mEq/L are severe hyperkalemia.'  "
How does hyperkalemia affect the body?,"'Potassium is critical for the normal functioning of the muscles, ''heart'', and nerves. It plays an important role in controlling activity of smooth muscle (such as the muscle found in the digestive tract) and skeletal muscle (muscles of the extremities and torso), as well as the muscles of the heart. It is also important for normal transmission of electrical signals throughout the nervous system within the body.''Normal blood levels of potassium are critical for maintaining normal heart electrical rhythm. Both low blood potassium levels (''hypokalemia'') and high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can lead to ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''The most important clinical effect of hyperkalemia is related to electrical rhythm of the heart. While mild hyperkalemia probably has a limited effect on the heart, moderate hyperkalemia can produce ''EKG'' changes (EKG is a reading of the electrical activity of the heart muscles), and severe hyperkalemia can cause suppression of electrical activity of the heart and can cause the heart to stop beating.''Another important effect of hyperkalemia is interference with functioning of the skeletal muscles. Hyperkalemic periodic ''paralysis'' is a rare ''inherited'' disorder in which patients can develop sudden onset of hyperkalemia, which in turn causes muscle paralysis. The reason for the muscle paralysis is not clearly understood, but it is probably due to hyperkalemia suppressing the electrical activity of the muscle.' "
What are the symptoms of hyperkalemia?,"'Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic, meaning that it causes no symptoms. Sometimes, patients with hyperkalemia report vague symptoms including:''More serious symptoms of hyperkalemia include slow heartbeat and weak pulse. Severe hyperkalemia can result in fatal cardiac standstill (heart stoppage). Generally, a slowly rising potassium level (such as with chronic ''kidney failure'') is better tolerated than an abrupt rise in potassium levels. Unless the rise in potassium has been very rapid, symptoms of hyperkalemia are usually not apparent until potassium levels are very high (typically 7.0 mEq/l or higher).''Symptoms may also be present that reflect the underlying medical conditions that are causing the hyperkalemia.'   nausea, fatigue, muscle weakness, or tingling sensations."
What causes hyperkalemia?,"'The major causes of hyperkalemia are kidney dysfunction, diseases of the adrenal gland, potassium shifting out of cells into the blood circulation, and medications.' "
Hyperkalemia and kidney dysfunction,"'The kidneys normally excrete potassium so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. These include:''Furthermore, patients with kidney dysfunctions are especially sensitive to medications that can increase blood potassium levels. For example, patients with kidney dysfunctions can develop worsening hyperkalemia when given salt substitutes that contain potassium, potassium ''supplements'' (either orally or intravenously), or medications that can increase blood potassium levels. Examples of medications that can increase blood potassium levels include:' acute and chronic renal failure, glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, transplant rejection, and obstructive diseases of the urinary tract, such as urolithiasis (stones in the urinary tract). ACE inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and potassium-sparing diuretics."
Hyperkalemia and diseases of the adrenal gland,"""Adrenal glands are small glands located adjacent to the kidneys, and are important in secreting hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain sodium and fluid while excreting potassium in the urine. Therefore diseases of the adrenal gland, such as Addison's disease, that lead to decreased aldosterone secretion can decrease kidney excretion of potassium, resulting in body retention of potassium, and hence hyperkalemia."" "
Hyperkalemia and potassium shifts,"'Potassium can move out of and into cells. Our total body potassium stores are approximately 50 mEq/kg of body weight. At any given time, about 98% of the total potassium in the body is located inside of cells (intracellular), with only 2% located outside of cells (in the blood circulation and in the extracellular tissue). The blood tests for measurement of potassium levels measure only the potassium that is outside of the cells. Therefore, conditions that can cause potassium to move out of the cells into the blood circulation can increase the blood potassium levels even though the total amount of potassium in the body has not changed.''One example of potassium shift causing hyperkalemia is diabetic ''ketoacidosis''. ''Insulin'' is vital to patients with ''type 1 diabetes''. Without insulin, patients with ''type 1 diabetes'' can develop severely elevated blood glucose levels. Lack of insulin also causes the breakdown of fat cells, with the release of ketones into the blood, turning the blood acidic (hence the term ketoacidosis). The acidosis and high glucose levels in the blood work together to cause fluid and potassium to move out of the cells into the blood circulation. Patients with ''diabetes'' often also have diminished kidney capacity to excrete potassium into urine. The combination of potassium shift out of cells and diminished urine potassium excretion causes hyperkalemia.''Another cause of hyperkalemia is tissue destruction, dying cells release potassium into the blood circulation. Examples of tissue destruction causing hyperkalemia include:' trauma, burns, surgery, hemolysis (disintegration of red blood cells), massive lysis of tumor cells, and rhabdomyolysis (a condition involving destruction of muscle cells that is sometimes associated with muscle injury, alcoholism, or drug abuse)."
Hyperkalemia and medications,"'Potassium ''supplements'', salt substitutes that contain potassium and other medications can cause hyperkalemia.''In normal individuals, healthy kidneys can adapt to excessive oral intake of potassium by increasing urine excretion of potassium, thus preventing the development of hyperkalemia. However, taking in too much potassium (through foods, supplements, or salt substitutes that contain potassium) can cause hyperkalemia if there is kidney dysfunction or if the patient is taking medications that decrease urine potassium excretion such as ACE inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics.''Examples of medications that decrease urine potassium excretion include:''Even though mild hyperkalemia is common with these medications, severe hyperkalemia usually does not occur unless these medications are given to patients with kidney dysfunction.'   ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics such as:spironolactone (Aldactone),triamterene (Dyrenium), andtrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). spironolactone (Aldactone), triamterene (Dyrenium), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)."
How is hyperkalemia diagnosed?,"'Blood is withdrawn from a vein (like other blood tests). The potassium concentration of the blood is determined in the laboratory. If hyperkalemia is suspected, an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'' or EKG) is often performed, since the ECG may show changes typical for hyperkalemia in moderate to severe cases. The ECG will also be able to identify cardiac arrhythmias that result from hyperkalemia.'  "
How is hyperkalemia treated?,"'Treatment of hyperkalemia must be individualized based upon the underlying cause of the hyperkalemia, the severity of symptoms or appearance of ECG changes, and the overall health status of the patient. Mild hyperkalemia is usually treated without hospitalization especially if the patient is otherwise healthy, the ECG is normal, and there are no other associated conditions such as acidosis and worsening kidney function. Emergency treatment is necessary if hyperkalemia is severe and has caused changes in the ECG. Severe hyperkalemia is best treated in the hospital, oftentimes in the intensive care unit, under continuous heart rhythm monitoring.''Treatment of hyperkalemia may include any of the following measures, either singly or in combination:''Treatment of hyperkalemia also includes treatment of any underlying causes (for example, ''kidney disease'', adrenal disease, tissue destruction) of hyperkalemia.'   A diet low in potassium (for mild cases). Discontinue medications that increase blood potassium levels. Intravenous administration of glucose and insulin, which promotes movement of potassium from the extracellular space back into the cells. Intravenous calcium to temporarily protect the heart and muscles from the effects of hyperkalemia. Sodium bicarbonate administration to counteract acidosis and to promote movement of potassium from the extracellular space back into the cells. Diuretic administration to decrease the total potassium stores through increasing potassium excretion in the urine. It is important to note that most diuretics increase kidney excretion of potassium. Only the potassium-sparing diuretics mentioned above decrease kidney excretion of potassium. Medications that stimulate beta-2 adrenergic receptors, such as albuterol and epinephrine, have also been used to drive potassium back into cells. Medications known as cation-exchange resins, which bind potassium and lead to its excretion via the gastrointestinal tract. Dialysis, particularly if other measures have failed or if renal failure is present."
What is high blood pressure? What is normal blood pressure?," High blood pressure (hypertension) is defined as high pressure (tension) in the arteries, which are the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers:The systolic blood pressure (the top number) equals the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts.The diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes. The systolic blood pressure (the top number) equals the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts. The diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology released new guidelines for high blood pressure.Blood pressure between 120/80 and 129/80 is elevated blood pressure, and a blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. Blood pressure between 120/80 and 129/80 is elevated blood pressure, and a blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. The American Academy of Cardiology defines blood pressure ranges as:Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg, and hypertension stage 2 is 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg or higher. Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg, and hypertension stage 2 is 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg or higher. Complications of high blood pressure include heart disease, kidney (renal) disease, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), eye damage, and stroke (brain damage). Hypertension is a major public health problem. With the new guidelines for defining high blood presure, The American Heart Association estimates high blood pressure affects nearly half of all adults (46%) in the United States."
What do blood pressure readings mean? (blood pressure readings chart) ,"'Blood pressure readings can vary in a single person throughout the day depending on the situation. Factors such as ''stress'', ''anxiety'', foods are eaten (''caffeine'' or salt intake), ''smoking'' or ''exercise'' can cause pressure to rise.''The American Heart Association defines normal blood pressure as less than 120/80. Elevated blood pressure ranges between 120/80 and 129/80, and high blood pressure is 130/80 and higher. In ''pregnancy'', normal blood pressure should be below 120/80.''If your blood pressure reaches into the high range, you should see your doctor about lifestyle changes, and possibly medication especially if you have other risk factors, such as ''diabetes'' or ''heart disease''.''High blood pressure (for example, 180/110 or higher) may indicate an emergency situation. If this high blood pressure is associated with ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', ''headache'', ''dizziness'', or back or ''abdominal pain'', seek medical care immediately. If you are experiencing no associated symptoms with a high blood pressure reading such as this, re-check it again within a few minutes and contact your doctor or go to an emergency room if it is still high.''If your blood pressure is lower than about 100/60 you may have ''low blood pressure'', depending on the associated symptoms.

What is high blood pressure? What is normal blood pressure?," High blood pressure (hypertension) is defined as high pressure (tension) in the arteries, which are the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Blood pressure readings are given as two numbers:The systolic blood pressure (the top number) equals the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts.The diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes. The systolic blood pressure (the top number) equals the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts. The diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology released new guidelines for high blood pressure.Blood pressure between 120/80 and 129/80 is elevated blood pressure, and a blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. Blood pressure between 120/80 and 129/80 is elevated blood pressure, and a blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. The American Academy of Cardiology defines blood pressure ranges as:Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg, and hypertension stage 2 is 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg or higher. Hypertension stage 1 is 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg, and hypertension stage 2 is 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg or higher. Complications of high blood pressure include heart disease, kidney (renal) disease, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), eye damage, and stroke (brain damage). Hypertension is a major public health problem. With the new guidelines for defining high blood presure, The American Heart Association estimates high blood pressure affects nearly half of all adults (46%) in the United States."
What do blood pressure readings mean? (blood pressure readings chart) ,"'Blood pressure readings can vary in a single person throughout the day depending on the situation. Factors such as ''stress'', ''anxiety'', foods are eaten (''caffeine'' or salt intake), ''smoking'' or ''exercise'' can cause pressure to rise.''The American Heart Association defines normal blood pressure as less than 120/80. Elevated blood pressure ranges between 120/80 and 129/80, and high blood pressure is 130/80 and higher. In ''pregnancy'', normal blood pressure should be below 120/80.''If your blood pressure reaches into the high range, you should see your doctor about lifestyle changes, and possibly medication especially if you have other risk factors, such as ''diabetes'' or ''heart disease''.''High blood pressure (for example, 180/110 or higher) may indicate an emergency situation. If this high blood pressure is associated with ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', ''headache'', ''dizziness'', or back or ''abdominal pain'', seek medical care immediately. If you are experiencing no associated symptoms with a high blood pressure reading such as this, re-check it again within a few minutes and contact your doctor or go to an emergency room if it is still high.''If your blood pressure is lower than about 100/60 you may have ''low blood pressure'', depending on the associated symptoms. If you are unsure, check with your doctor.'  "

What is high blood pressure (hypertension)?,"'High blood pressure'' or ''hypertension'', means high pressure (tension) in the arteries. Arteries are vessels that carry blood from the pumping ''heart'' to all the tissues and organs of the body. ''High blood pressure'' does not mean excessive emotional tension, although emotional tension and ''stress'' can temporarily increase ''blood pressure''.''The American Academy of Cardiology defines blood pressure ranges as:''The top number, which is the systolic blood pressure, corresponds to the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and pumps blood into the arteries. The bottom number, the diastolic pressure, represents the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes after the contraction. The diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure to which the arteries are exposed.''An elevation of the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure increases the risk of developing heart (cardiac) disease, kidney (renal) disease, ''hardening of the arteries'' (''atherosclerosis'' or ''arteriosclerosis''), eye damage, and ''stroke'' (''brain damage''). These complications of hypertension are often referred to as end-organ damage because damage to these organs is the end result of chronic (long duration) ''high blood pressure''. For that reason, the diagnosis of ''high blood pressure'' is important so efforts can be made to normalize blood pressure and prevent complications.''It was previously thought that rises in diastolic blood pressure were a more important risk factor than systolic elevations, but it is now known that in people 50 years of age and older systolic hypertension represents a greater risk.''The American Heart Association estimates high blood pressure affects approximately one in three adults in the U.S. High blood pressure also is estimated to affect about two million U.S. ''teens'' and children, and the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' reports that many are under-diagnosed. Hypertension is clearly a major public health problem.'   Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg. Blood pressure between 120-129/80 is elevated blood pressure Blood pressure of 130/80 or above is considered high. Hypertension stage 1: 130-139 or 80-89 mm Hg. Hypertension stage 2: 140 or higher, or 90 mm Hg. or higher."
How can high blood pressure be lowered naturally?,"'Lifestyle modifications refer to certain specific recommendations for changes in habits, ''diet'' and ''exercise'"". These modifications can lower the blood pressure as well as improve a patient's response to blood pressure medications."" "
Alcohol,"'People who drink ''alcohol'' excessively (over two ''drinks'' per day*) have a one and a half to two times increase in the prevalence of hypertension. The association between alcohol and high blood pressure is particularly noticeable when alcohol intake exceeds five drinks per day. The connection is a dose-related phenomenon. In other words, the more alcohol consumed, the stronger is the link with hypertension.''*The National Institute on ''Alcohol Abuse'' and ''Alcoholism'' considers a standard drink to be 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits. Each contains roughly the same amount of absolute alcohol -- approximately one-half ounce or 12 grams.' "
Smoking,"'Although ''smoking'' increases the risk of vascular complications (for example, ''heart disease'' and ''stroke'') in people who already have hypertension, it is not associated with an increase in the development of hypertension. But ''cigarette smoking'' can repeatedly produce an immediate, temporary rise in the blood pressure of 5 to10 mm Hg. Steady ''smokers'' however, may have a lower blood pressure than nonsmokers. The reason for this is that ''nicotine'' in cigarettes causes a decrease in appetite, which leads to ''weight loss''. This, in turn, lowers blood pressure.'  "
Coffee and caffeinated beverages,"'In one study, the ''caffeine'' consumed in 5 cups of coffee daily caused a mild increase in blood pressure in elderly people who already had hypertension, but not in those who had normal blood pressures. The combination of ''smoking'' and drinking coffee in persons with high blood pressure may increase the blood pressure more than coffee alone. Limiting ''caffeine'' intake and ''cigarette smoking'' in hypertensive individuals may be of some benefit in controlling high blood pressure.''The American Heart Association states that there is no consistent evidence that daily consumption of 1 to 2 cups of coffee (or its equivalent) increases blood pressure to any significant degree in people who do not already have high blood pressure.''However, a study reported in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association ''in 2005 found that while coffee consumption was not associated with an increased risk of hypertension, consumption of sugared or ''diet'' cola did cause modest increases in blood pressure, though no recommendations on cola consumption were made.''Energy drinks often contain high levels of caffeine. The American Heart Association points to research which suggests people with high blood pressure or ''heart disease'' should avoid energy drinks because they could affect their blood pressure.'  "
Salt,"'The American Heart Association recommends that consumption of dietary salt be less than 6 grams of salt per day in the general population and less than 4 grams for people with hypertension. To achieve a diet containing less than 4 grams of salt, salt is not added to food or when cooking. The amount of natural salt in the diet can be reasonably estimated from the labeling information provided with most purchased foods. Note: Some salt substitutes contain sodium, the substance in salt that increases blood pressure!' "
Other dietary considerations,"'It is beneficial to add potassium to the diet. Studies show that people who consume more potassium have lower blood pressures. Good sources of potassium include:''Along with lowering salt in the diet, a balanced eating plan that also reduces ''cholesterol'' intake and fatty foods is recommended. The TLC Diet (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes) often is recommended to lower blood cholesterol.''Some ''supplements'', such as ''garlic'' and ''flaxseed'' have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure. Some small-scale studies have shown ''Coenzyme Q10'' (CoQ10) may lower blood pressure, but further studies are needed. Garlic may react with some prescription medications such as blood thinners, so consult a physician before taking any ''supplements''. Other home remedies, such as calcium, magnesium, and ''fish oil'' have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure, but patients should consult with their physician before taking any supplements.'  bananas, melons, oranges, spinach and zucchini."
Obesity,"'Being ''overweight'' can increase the risk for high blood pressure. ''Obesity'' is common among hypertensive patients, and its prevalence, especially in ''aging'' patients, can contribute to hypertension in several ways. In ''obese'' people the heart has to pump more blood to supply the excess tissue. The increased cardiac output can then raise the blood pressure. In addition, obese hypertensive individuals have a greater ''stiffness'' (resistance) in their peripheral arteries throughout the body. ''Insulin resistance'' and the ''metabolic syndrome'', which are associated with hypertension, also occur more frequently in the obese. Finally, obesity may be associated with a tendency for the kidneys to retain salt. ''Weight loss'' may help reverse obesity-related problems and may lower blood pressure. Losing as little as 10 to 20 pounds can help lower blood pressure and the risk of ''heart disease''.''The American Journal of Clinical ''Nutrition'' '""reported in 2005 that waist size, a measure of central body obesity, was a better predictor of a person's blood pressure than body mass index (""'BMI''), a measure of overall obesity. Men should strive for a waist size of 35 inches or under and women 33 inches or under.''Some very obese people have a syndrome called ''sleep apnea'', which is characterized by periodic interruption of normal ''breathing'' during ''sleep''. ''Sleep apnea'' may contribute to the development of hypertension in this subgroup of obese individuals. Repeated episodes of apnea cause a lack of oxygen (''hypoxia''), causing the adrenal gland to release adrenaline and related substances which cause a rise in the blood pressure.' "
Exercise and stress reduction,"'A regular ''exercise'' program may help lower blood pressure over the long term. Activities such as jogging, bicycle riding, power ''walking'', or ''swimming'' for 30 to 45 minutes daily may lower blood pressure by as much as 5 to15 mm Hg. There also appears to be a relationship between the amount of exercise and the degree to which the blood pressure is lowered. So the more one exercises (up to a point), the more they lower their blood pressure. This beneficial response occurs only with aerobic (vigorous and sustained) exercise programs. Any exercise program should be recommended or approved by a physician.''Stress'' reduction can also help lower blood pressure. Stress can be limited by determining priorities, using time management skills, saying ""no,"" living by values, setting realistic goals, and improving self-esteem. Relaxation methods to reduce stress include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, mental imagery relaxation, relaxing to music, ''yoga'', meditation, and biofeedback.''It is important for patients to keep logs of their blood pressure through the day. Physicians may have patients chart their blood pressure in a daily log to see if stressful factors during the day cause blood pressure to go up.''Patients should be sure to get adequate ''sleep'' in order to relax their minds and bodies. Naps may be necessary.' "
What is the medical treatment for high blood pressure?,"'Goals of treatment''High blood pressure usually is present for years before its complications develop. Ideally, hypertension is treated early before it damages critical organs in the body. Increased public awareness and screening programs to detect early, uncomplicated hypertension are keys to successful treatment. Successful early treatment of high blood pressure can significantly decrease the risk of ''stroke'', ''heart attack'', and ''kidney failure''.''The goal for patients with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is to attain a blood pressure of 134/80 mm Hg. Although lifestyle changes in prehypertensive patients are appropriate, it is not well established that treatment with medication of patients with ''prehypertension'' is beneficial.' "
Starting treatment for high blood pressure,"'Blood pressure persistently higher than 134/80 mm Hg usually is treated with lifestyle modifications and medication. These circumstances include borderline diastolic pressures in association with end-organ damage, systolic hypertension, or factors that increase the risk of ''cardiovascular disease'', such as age over 65 years, African American descent, ''smoking'', hyperlipemia (elevated blood ''fats''), or ''diabetes''.''Any one of several classes of medications may be started, except the alpha blocker medications, which are used only in combination with another antihypertensive medication in specific medical situations. (See the next section for a more detailed discussion of each of the several classes of antihypertensive medications.)''In some situations, certain classes of antihypertensive ''drugs'' are preferable to others as the first-line (preferred first-choice) drugs. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocking (ARB) drugs are the drugs of choice in patients with ''heart failure'', chronic ''kidney failure'' (in diabetics or nondiabetics), or heart attack (''myocardial infarction'') that weakens the heart muscle (systolic dysfunction). Also, ''beta blockers'' are sometimes the preferred treatment in hypertensive patients with a resting tachycardia (racing heart beat when resting) or an acute (rapid onset) heart attack.''Patients with hypertension may sometimes have a co-existing second medical condition. In such cases, a particular class of antihypertensive medication or combination of drugs may be chosen as the first-line approach. The idea in these cases is to control the hypertension while also benefiting the second condition. For example, beta blockers may treat chronic ''anxiety'' or ''migraine headache'' as well as hypertension. Also, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB drug can be used to treat certain diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies) and certain kidney diseases where reduction in ''protein in the urine'' would be beneficial.''In other situations, certain classes of antihypertensive medications should not be used. Dihydropyridine ''calcium channel blockers'' used alone may cause problems for patients with chronic ''renal disease'' by increasing ''proteinuria''. However, an ACE inhibitor will blunt this effect. The non-dihydropyridine type of calcium channel blockers should not be used in patients with heart failure. However, these drugs may be beneficial in treating certain arrhythmias. Some drugs, such as ''minoxidil'', may be relegated to second- or third-line choices for treatment. ''Clonidine'' is an excellent drug but has side effects such as ''fatigue'', sleepiness, and ''dry mouth'' making it a second- or third-line choice. See the section below on ''pregnancy'' for the antihypertensive drugs that are used in ''pregnant'' women.' "
Treatment with combinations of drugs for high blood pressure,"'The use of combination drug therapy for hypertension is common. At times, using smaller amounts of one or more drugs in combination can minimize side effects while maximizing the anti-hypertensive effect. For example, diuretics, which also can be used alone, are more often used in a low dose in combination with another class of antihypertensive medications. This way, the diuretic has fewer side effects while improving the blood pressure-lowering effect of the other drug. Diuretics also are added to other antihypertensive medications when a patient with hypertension has fluid retention and swelling (''edema'').''A useful combination is that of a beta blocker with an alpha blocker in patients with high blood pressure and enlargement of the ''prostate gland'' in order to treat both conditions simultaneously. Caution is necessary when combining two drugs that both lower the heart rate. For example, patients receiving a combination of a beta blocker to a non-dihydropyridine ''calcium channel blocker'' (for example, ''diltiazem'' [''Cardizem'', Dilacor, ''Tiazac''] or ''verapamil'' [''Calan'', ''Verelan'', ''Isoptin'', ''Covera-HS'']) need to be monitored carefully to avoid an excessively slow heart rate (bradycardia). Combining alpha and beta blockers such as ''carvedilol'' (''Coreg'') and ''labetalol'' (''Normodyne'', ''Trandate'') is useful for cardiomyopathies and for hypertension patients.' "
Emergency treatment for high blood pressure,"'In a hospital setting, injectable drugs may be used for emergency treatment of hypertension. The most commonly used are sodium nitroprusside (Nipride), labetalol (Normodyne), and ''nicardipine'' (''Cardene''). Emergency medical therapy is needed for patients with severe (''malignant'') hypertension and in patients with short duration (acute) ''congestive heart failure'', ''dissecting aneurysm'' (dilation or widening) of the ''aorta'', ''stroke'', and toxemia of pregnancy (see below).' "
Treatment during pregnancy,"'Pregnant women may develop hypertension or may have it before ''conception''. These patients have an increased risk of developing ''preeclampsia'' or ''eclampsia'' (toxemia of pregnancy). These conditions usually develop during the last 3 months (''third trimester'') of pregnancy. In ''preeclampsia'', which can occur with or without pre-existing hypertension, affected women have hypertension, protein loss in the urine (proteinuria), and swelling (edema). In ''eclampsia'', ''seizures'' also occur and the hypertension requires emergency treatment. The baby must be delivered quickly as part of the treatment of the mother. The main goal of treating the high blood pressure in toxemia is to keep the diastolic pressure below 105 mm Hg in order to prevent a ''brain hemorrhage'' or ''seizures'' in the mother.''Hypertension that develops before the 20th week of pregnancy almost always is due to pre-existing hypertension and not toxemia. High blood pressure that occurs only during pregnancy, called gestational hypertension, may start late in the pregnancy. Women with gestational hypertension do not have proteinuria, edema, or convulsions, and there appears to be no ill effects on the mother or fetus. This form of hypertension resolves shortly after delivery, although it may recur with subsequent ''pregnancies''.''The use of medications for hypertension during pregnancy is controversial. The risk of untreated mild to moderate hypertension to the fetus or mother during pregnancy probably is not very great. Lowering the blood pressure too much can interfere with the flow of blood to the placenta and impair fetal growth. Not all mild or moderate hypertension during pregnancy needs to be treated with medication. If it is treated, the blood pressure should be reduced slowly and not to very low levels.''Antihypertensive agents used during pregnancy need to be safe for normal ''fetal development''. Beta blockers, ''hydralazine'' (a vasodilator), labetalol (Normodyne, Trandate), alpha-''methyldopa'' (''Aldomet''), and more recently, calcium channel blockers have been approved as suitable medications for hypertension during pregnancy. Some antihypertensive medications are not recommended (contraindicated) during pregnancy. These include ''ACE inhibitors'', ARB drugs, and diuretics. ACE inhibitors may aggravate a diminished blood supply to the uterus (uterine ischemia) and cause kidney dysfunction in the fetus. ARB drugs may lead to death of the fetus. Diuretics can cause depletion of blood volume and impair placental blood flow and fetal growth.' "
Which medications are used to treat high blood pressure?,"'The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs both affect the renin-angiotensin hormonal system which helps regulate blood pressure. ACE inhibitors act by blocking (inhibiting) an enzyme that converts the inactive form of angiotensin in the blood to its active form. The active form of angiotensin constricts or narrows the arteries, but the inactive form cannot. With an ACE inhibitor as a single drug treatment (monotherapy), 50 to 60 percent of Caucasians usually achieve good blood pressure control. African American patients also may respond, but they may require higher doses and frequently do best when an ACE inhibitor is combined with a diuretic. (See the discussion of diurectics that follows.)''As an added benefit, ACE inhibitors may reduce an ''enlarged heart'' (left ventricular hypertrophy) in patients with hypertension. These drugs also appear to slow the deterioration of kidney function in patients with hypertension and protein in the urine (proteinuria). They have been particularly useful in slowing the progression of kidney dysfunction in hypertensive patients with ''kidney disease'' resulting from ''type 1 diabetes'' (''insulin''-dependent). ACE inhibitors usually are the first-line drugs to treat high blood pressure in patients who also have congestive heart failure, chronic kidney failure, and heart attack (myocardial infarction) that weakens the heart muscle (systolic dysfunction). ARB drugs currently are recommended for first-line kidney protection in ''diabetic nephropathy'' (kidney disease).''Patients treated with ACE inhibitors who also have kidney disease should be monitored for further deterioration in kidney function and high serum potassium. These drugs may be used to reduce the loss of potassium in people who are being treated with diuretics that cause patients to lose potassium. ACE inhibitors have few side effects, but the most common is a ''chronic cough''. Occasionally, there may be fluid retention (edema). The ACE inhibitors include:''For patients who develop a chronic ''cough'' on an ACE inhibitor, an ARB drug is a good substitute. ARB drugs work by blocking the angiotensin receptor (binder) on the arteries to which activated angiotensin must bind to have its effects. As a result, the angiotensin is not able to work on the artery. (Angiotensin is a hormone that constricts the arteries.) ARB drugs appear to have many of the same advantages as the ACE inhibitors but without the associated ''cough''; however, edema still may occur. They are also suitable as first-line agents to treat hypertension.''ARB drugs include:''In patients who have hypertension in addition to certain second diseases, a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB drug may be effective in controlling the hypertension and also benefiting the second disease. This combination of drugs can treat hypertension and reduce the loss of protein in the urine (proteinuria) in certain kidney diseases and perhaps help strengthen the heart muscle in certain diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies). Both the ACE inhibitors and the ARB drugs are not to be used (contraindicated) in pregnant women.

Beta blockers,"""The sympathetic nervous system is a part of the nervous system that helps to regulate certain involuntary (autonomic) functions in the body such as the function of the heart and blood vessels. The nerves of the sympathetic nervous system extend throughout the body and exert their effects by releasing chemicals that travel to nearby cells in the body. The released chemicals bind to receptors (molecules) on the surface of the nearby cells and stimulate or inhibit the function of the cells. In the heart and blood vessels, the receptors for the sympathetic nervous system that are most important are the beta receptors. When stimulated, beta-receptors in the heart increase the heart rate and the strength of heart contractions (pumping action). Beta-blocking drugs acting on the heart slow the heart rate and reduce the force of the heart's contraction.""'Stimulation of beta-receptors in the smooth muscle of the peripheral arteries and in the airways of the lung causes these muscles to relax. Beta blockers cause contraction of the smooth muscle of the peripheral arteries and thereby decrease blood flow to body tissues. As a result, the patient may experience coolness in the hands and ''feet''. In response to the beta blockers, the airways are squeezed (constricted) by the contracting smooth muscle; this squeezing (impingement) on the ''airway'' causes ''wheezing'', especially in individuals with a tendency for ''asthma''.''Beta blockers remain useful medications in treating hypertension, especially in patients with a fast heartbeat while resting (tachycardia), cardiac ''chest pain'' (''angina''), or a recent heart attack (myocardial infarction). Beta blockers appear to improve long-term survival when given to patients who have had a heart attack. Whether beta blockers can prevent heart problems (are cardioprotective) in patients with hypertension any more than other antihypertensive medications is uncertain. Beta blockers may be considered for treatment of hypertension because they also may treat co-existing medical problems, such as chronic ''anxiety'' or ''migraine'' ''headaches''. Common side effects of these drugs include ''depression'', ''fatigue'', ''nightmares'', sexual ''impotence'' in males, and increased wheezing in people with ''asthma''.''The beta blockers include:' atenolol (Tenormin), propranolol (Inderal), metoprolol (Toprol), nadolol (Corgard), betaxolol (Kerlone), acebutolol (Sectral), pindolol (Visken), carvedilol (Coreg) penbutolol (Levatol), and bisoprolol (Zebeta)."
Diuretics,"'Diuretics are among the oldest known medications for treating hypertension. They work in the tiny tubes (tubules) of the kidneys to promote the removal of salt from the body. Water also may be removed along with the salt. Diuretics may be used as single drug treatment (monotherapy) for hypertension. More frequently low doses of diuretics are used in combination with other antihypertensive medications to enhance the effect of the other medications.''The diuretic ''hydrochlorothiazide'' (''HydroDIURIL'') works in the far end (distal) part of the kidney tubules to increase the amount of salt that is removed from the body in the urine. In a low dose of 12.5 to 25 mg per day, this diuretic may improve the blood pressure-lowering effects of other antihypertensive drugs, and the low doses also can prevent the fluid retention (edema) associated with ACE and ARB drugs. The idea is to treat the hypertension without causing adverse effects sometimes seen with higher doses of hydrochlorothiazide. These side effects include potassium depletion and elevated levels of triglyceride (fat), uric acid, and glucose (''sugar'') in the blood.'""Occasionally, when salt retention causing accumulation of water and swelling (edema) is a major problem, the more potent 'loop' diuretics may be used in combination with other antihypertensive medications. The loop diuretics are so called because they work in the loop segment of the kidney tubules to eliminate salt.""'The most commonly used diuretics to treat hypertension include hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL) and ''chlorthalidone'', the loop diuretics ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') and ''torsemide'' (''Demadex''), the combination of ''triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide'' (Dyazide), and ''metolazone'' (''Zaroxolyn''). For individuals who are ''allergic'' to sulfa drugs, ''ethacrynic acid'', a loop diuretic, is a good option. Diuretics generally should not be used in pregnant women. (See the preceding section on pregnancy.)' "
Calcium channel blockers (CCBs),"""Calcium channel blockers inhibit the movement of calcium into the muscle cells of the heart and arteries. Calcium is needed for these muscles to contract. Calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure by decreasing the force of the heart's pumping action and relaxing the muscle cells in the walls of the arteries.""'Three major types of calcium channel blockers are used. One type is the dihydropyridines, which do not slow the heart rate or cause other abnormal heart rates or rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias). These drugs include ''amlodipine'' (''Norvasc''), sustained release ''nifedipine'' (''Procardia'' XL, Adalat CC), ''felodipine'' (''Plendil''), and ''nisoldipine'' (''Sular'').''The other two types of calcium channel blockers are referred to as the non-dihydropyridine agents. One type is verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin, and Verelan) and the other is diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, Dilacor, and Diltia). The non-dihydropyridines can cause slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia). The non-dihydropyridines are not recommended in congestive heart failure. Both the dihydropyridines and the non-dihydropyridines are very useful when used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.''Many of the calcium channel blockers come in a short-acting form and a long-acting (sustained release) form. The short-acting forms of the calcium channel blockers may have adverse long-term consequences, such as ''strokes'' or ''heart attacks''. These effects are due to the wide fluctuations in the blood pressure and heart rate that occur during treatment resulting from the rapid onset and short duration of the short-acting compounds. When the calcium channel blockers are used in sustained release preparations less fluctuation occurs. The sustained release forms of calcium channel blockers are probably safer for long-term use. The main side effects of these drugs include ''constipation'', swelling (edema), and a slow heart rate (only with the non-dihydropyridine types).' "
Alpha blockers,"'Alpha blockers lower blood pressure by blocking alpha-receptors in the smooth muscle of peripheral arteries throughout the tissues of the body. The alpha-receptors are part of the sympathetic nervous system, as are the beta-receptors. The alpha-receptors, however, serve to constrict the peripheral arteries and the alpha-blockers cause the peripheral arteries to widen (dilate) and lower the blood pressure.''Evidence suggests using alpha blockers alone as a first-line drug choice for hypertension may actually increase the risk of heart-related problems, such as ''heart attacks'' or strokes. Alpha blockers should not be used as the initial drug for the treatment of high blood pressure. Examples of alpha blockers include ''terazosin'' (''Hytrin''), ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''), and doxazosin (''Cardura'').''Alpha blockers are particularly useful in patients with enlargement of the prostate gland because these drugs reduce the problems associated with urinating. The alpha-receptors, however, serve to constrict the peripheral arteries and the alpha blockers cause the peripheral arteries to widen (dilate) and lower the blood pressure. ''Tamsulosin'' (''Flomax'') or ''alfuzosin'' (''Uroxatral'') are alpha blockers that work well in combination with other antihypertensive medications.' "
Clonidine,"'Clonidine (''Catapres'') is an antihypertensive drug that works centrally. That is, it works in a control center for the sympathetic nervous system in the brain. The drug is referred to as a central alpha agonist because it stimulates alpha-receptors in the brain. The result of this central stimulation is to decrease the sympathetic nervous system outflow and to decrease the stiffness (resistance) of the peripheral arteries. Clonidine lowers the blood pressure by relaxing (dilating or widening) the peripheral arteries throughout the body. This drug is useful as a second- or third-tier choice for ''lowering blood pressure'' when other antihypertensive medications have failed. It also may be useful on an as-needed basis to control or smooth out fluctuations in the blood pressure. This drug tends to cause dryness of the mouth and ''fatigue'' so some patients do not tolerate it. Clonidine comes in an oral form or as a sustained release skin patch.' "
Minoxidil,"'Minoxidil is the most potent of the drugs that lower blood pressure by dilating the peripheral arteries. This drug does not work through the peripheral sympathetic nervous system as do the alpha and beta blocker drugs, or through the control center in the brain, as does clonidine. Rather, it is a muscle relaxant that works directly on the smooth muscle of the peripheral arteries throughout the body. Minoxidil is used for patients who have not responded to other medications. It must be combined with a beta blocker or clonidine to prevent an increase in the heart rate and with a diuretic to prevent retention of fluid (swelling). Minoxidil may also increase hair growth.' "
Renin inhibitors,"'Aliskiren (Tekturna) is in a class of antihypertensive drugs called renin inhibitors. Renin is an enzyme in the chain of blood pressure regulating hormones referred to as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) hormonal system.''The first step in the chain is the production of renin in the kidneys when the kidneys detect lower blood pressure. The renin stimulates the formation of a protein called angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the ''lungs'', the same ACE targeted by ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin II is the most powerful constrictor of blood vessels known. This effect of constricting blood vessels tends to elevate the blood pressure. Angiotensin II also causes the secretion of an additional blood pressure elevating hormone in the adrenal glands called aldosterone, which helps the body retain sodium.''Aliskiren inhibits the effects of renin and angiotensin so that blood pressure does not go up.''Aliskiren should not be combined with ARB or ACE drugs in patients with ''diabetes'' because of the risk of renal impairment, ''hypotension'', and ''hyperkalemia''.' "
Aldosterone blockers,"'Eplerenone'' (''Inspra'') is an aldosterone receptor blocker. It is used to treat congestive heart failure after a heart attack and also is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). Aldosterone blockers promote lower blood pressure by increasing the elimination of salt from the body.''Common side effects include ''headache'', ''dizziness'', ''diarrhea'', ''stomach pain'', ''nausea'', and cough or ''flu-like symptoms'' (such as ''fever'', ''chills'', and unusual ''tiredness'').' "
Combining agents,"'Combining medications in lower doses often can reduce blood pressure more effectively with fewer side effects.''Exforge'' is a combination of amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker and valsartan, an ARB.''According to the manufacturer, by using these two drugs in combination, Exforge works to block substances in the body that can cause blood vessels to narrow and can help blood vessels relax so that blood pressure is lower.''Studies have shown that taking Exforge increases the likelihood of reducing blood pressure more than either drug taken individually.' "
"What about the patient's compliance with
medication regimens?","'When uncomplicated hypertension has not caused symptoms, as often happens, some patients tend to forget about their medications. Patients also tend to fail to take their medications as prescribed (noncompliance or nonadherence) if they cause side effects. These quality of life issues are very important, especially with regard to compliance with prescribed blood pressure medications. Certain antihypertensive medications may cause such side effects as fatigue and sexual ''impotence'"" which can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life and compliance with treatment. More resistant cases of hypertension that require higher doses of medication may cause more adverse effects, and therefore, less compliance.""'In dosing schedules that require taking medication two to four times a day (split dose), some patients will remember to take their medicine only some of the time. In contrast, medications that can be given once daily tend to be remembered more regularly.''Expensive blood pressure medications, especially if insurance does not cover the costs, may also reduce compliance. People attempt to save money by skipping doses of the prescribed medication. The least expensive medication regimes use generic drugs, which are readily available for some of the diuretics and beta blockers. Lifestyle changes such as losing weight, reducing dietary sodium, decreasing consumption of alcohol, and exercising regularly, reduce the need for some medications.' "
"Is alternative medicine used to treat
high blood pressure?","'Alternative medicine, also called integrative or complementary medicine, features the use of nontraditional (at least in the Western world) techniques for treatment. For example, self-relaxation approaches to the therapy of hypertension include yoga, biofeedback, and meditation. These techniques can be effective in lowering blood pressure, at least temporarily. In order to produce sustained reductions in the blood pressure these techniques may require hours of diligent adherence daily. They are generally practical only for a few highly motivated individuals with hypertension. ''Acupuncture'' has not yet been established as a standard or proven therapy for hypertension in the Western world.''Certain herbal remedies have blood pressure-lowering components that may well be effective in treating hypertension. Most herbal remedies are available as food supplements and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them as drugs. Therefore, herbal treatments for hypertension have not yet been adequately evaluated in scientifically controlled ''clinical trials'' for effectiveness and safety. In particular, their long-term side effects are unknown. A major problem with most herbal treatments is that their contents are not standardized. The ways in which herbal treatments work to lower blood pressure are not known. For all of these reasons, herbal remedies usually are not recommended for the treatment of hypertension.''As mentioned previously, some supplements, such as garlic and flaxseed have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure. Some small-scale studies have shown that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may lower blood pressure, but further studies are needed. Other home remedies, such as calcium, magnesium, and fish oil have been shown in studies to lower blood pressure. Patients should consult their physicians before taking any supplement or home remedy.'  "
What are the complications of high blood pressure?,"'High blood pressure (hypertension) increases the risk of developing heart (cardiac) disease, kidney (renal) disease, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis), aneurysms, eye damage, and stroke (brain damage).''These complications of hypertension often are referred to as end-organ damage. Because of this damage, the diagnosis of high blood pressure is important so efforts can be made to normalize blood pressure and prevent complications.''People with high blood pressure have an increased stiffness, or resistance, in the arteries throughout the tissues of the body. This increased resistance causes the heart muscle to work harder to pump the blood through the arteries. The increased workload can put a strain on the heart, which can lead to heart abnormalities that are usually first seen as an ''enlarged heart'' muscle. Heart enlargement may be a forerunner of heart failure, coronary (heart) artery disease, and abnormal heart rate or rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias). Proper treatment of the high blood pressure and its complications can reverse some of these heart abnormalities.''Blood and urine tests may be helpful in detecting kidney abnormalities in people with high blood pressure. (Kidney damage can be either the cause or the result of hypertension.) Measuring the serum ''creatinine'' in the blood can assess how well the kidneys are functioning. An elevated level of serum creatinine indicates damage to the kidneys. In addition, the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) may reflect chronic kidney damage from hypertension, even if kidney function (as represented by the blood creatinine level) is normal. African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension are at a higher risk than Caucasians for most end-organ damage and, particularly, kidney damage.''Uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension) can cause strokes, which can lead to brain or neurological damage. The strokes are usually due to a hemorrhage (leaking blood) or a ''blood clot'"" (thrombosis) of the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain. The patient's symptoms and signs (findings on physical examination) are evaluated to assess the neurological damage. A stroke can cause ""'weakness'', tingling, or ''paralysis'' of the arms or legs and difficulties with speech or vision. Multiple small strokes can lead to ''dementia'' (impaired intellectual capacity). The best ''prevention'' for this complication of hypertension or, for that matter, for any of the complications, is control of the blood pressure. Recent studies have also suggested the ''ARBs'' may offer an additional protective effect against strokes above and beyond control of blood pressure.' "
Can high blood pressure be prevented?,"'High blood pressure can sometimes be prevented if individuals follow a healthy lifestyle and:''Maintain a healthy weight.'' Being overweight can make a person two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure.''Get regular exercise.'' Physically active people have up to a 50% lower risk of getting high blood pressure than people who are not active.''Reduce salt intake.'' Less than 4 grams per day is the goal.''Drink alcohol in moderation, or not at all.'' Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure. If a person drinks alcohol, they should limit it to no more than two drinks a day.''Reduce stress.'' Stress can raise blood pressure.' "
What's new in high blood pressure?,"'A novel approach to hypertension treatment has been found by studying a hormone that controls insect growth. Butterfly researchers identified and characterized epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in a critical pathway in the breakdown of anti-inflammatory arachidonate metabolites called EETs, or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Other researchers found that inhibiting the breakdown of EETs reduced blood pressure in rodents. This newly discovered enzyme also reduced vascular inflammation and end-organ damage, the long-term effects of high blood pressure.''The oral form of the enzyme developed in this study, currently in clinical trials, reduced the most common type of high blood pressure in middle-aged individuals. Pharmaceutical companies in several countries have initiated programs using this enzyme to treat high blood pressure, inflammation, ''diabetes'', ''pain'', and other disorders.''A surgical procedure also is being tested in other countries to lower high blood pressure. The procedure involves disrupting the nerves to the kidney. A large trial of this did not demonstrate benefit in lowering blood pressure.' "
1) What Is Cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol'' is a waxy, fat-like substance that occurs naturally in all parts of the body and is made by the ''liver''. Cholesterol also is present in foods we eat. People need cholesterol for the body to function normally. Cholesterol is present in the cell walls or membranes everywhere in the body, including the brain, nerves, muscles, skin, liver, ''intestines'', and ''heart''.'  "
2) Why Should I Be Concerned About Cholesterol?,"'Too much cholesterol in your body means that you have an increased risk of getting cardiovascular diseases such as ''heart disease''. If you have too much cholesterol in your body, the cholesterol can build up on the walls of the arteries that carry blood to your heart. This buildup, which occurs over time, causes less blood and oxygen to get to your heart. This can cause ''chest pain'' and ''heart attacks''.' "
"3) What's the Difference between ""Good"" and ""Bad"" Cholesterol?","'HDL'' (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol is known as good cholesterol. HDL takes the bad cholesterol out of your blood and keeps it from building up in your arteries. LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol is known as bad cholesterol because it can build up on the walls of your arteries and increase your chances of getting ''cardiovascular disease''. When being tested for ''high cholesterol'', you want a high HDL number and a low LDL number.' "
4) How Much Cholesterol Is Too Much?,"'Doctors recommend your cholesterol stay below 200. Here is the breakdown:''HDL (good) cholesterol protects against ''heart disease'', so for HDL, higher numbers are better. A level less than 40 is low and is considered a major risk factor because it increases your risk for developing ''heart disease''. HDL levels of 60 or more help to lower your risk for heart disease.''Triglyceride levels'' that are borderline high (150-199) or high (200 or more) may require treatment in some people.' "
"5) Can I Lower My Risk for Heart Disease 
If I Lower My Cholesterol?",'Your risk for heart disease is lower when you have low total cholesterol and low LDL.' 
6) What Makes My Cholesterol Levels Go Up?,"'Eating foods such as meats, whole milk dairy products, egg yolks, and some kinds of fish can make your ''cholesterol levels'' go up. Being ''overweight'' can make your bad cholesterol go up and your good cholesterol go down. Also, after women go through ''menopause'', their bad cholesterol levels tend to go up.' "
"7) What Can I 
Do To Lower My Cholesterol Levels?","'You can lower your cholesterol levels by making changes to your lifestyle. Here are some tips.' Eat foods with less fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Take off the skin and fat from meat, poultry and fish. Broil, bake, roast, or poach instead of frying foods. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables everyday. Eat lots of cereals, breads, rice, and pasta made from whole grains, such as whole wheat bread or spaghetti. Get lots of exercise everyday. Talk to your doctor about what are the safest and best ways for you to exercise. Lose weight if you are overweight. Stop smoking. Take your high blood cholesterol medication as prescribed by your doctor."
8) What Medications Are Used to Treat High Cholesterol?,'Cholesterol-lowering ''drugs'' include:''Cholesterol-lowering medicine is most effective when combined with a low-cholesterol ''diet''.' Statins Niacin Bile-acid resins Fibric acid derivatives
"9) If a Product's Package Reads ""Low Cholesterol,"" Does 
That Mean That The Product Is Low in Fat and Safe To Eat? ","'Not necessarily. Numerous foods marked ""low cholesterol"" can contain oils that may be high in saturated ''fats'', which are not considered healthy. In addition, unsaturated fats like vegetable oil also can be high in calories. The total amount of fat in your ''diet'' should be kept to about 20-30 percent of your daily intake.' "
10) At What Age Should People Begin Having Their Cholesterol Checked?,"'It is important to have your cholesterol level checked when you are young, since clogging of the arteries (atherosclerosis) is a gradual process that takes many years. Total cholesterol should be measured at least every five years starting at age 20.'""Note: If you have high cholesterol and your doctor has told you there may be an underlying genetic cause, you may want to have your children, under age 20, get their cholesterol levels tested. Talk to your children's health care providers about cholesterol testing.""'Reviewed by the doctors in the Department of Preventive Cardiology and Rehabilitation at The Cleveland Clinic Heart Center.''SOURCE: American Heart Association''Edited by Cynthia Dennison Haines, MD on November 01, 2005''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005''©2005-2007 WebMD, Inc.

What is troponin?,"'Troponin is a protein found in the body, most specifically in heart muscle cells. There are three main types of cardiac troponin proteins: I, T, and C.''In a heart attack, blood flow through the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply the heart) is limited or blocked. The heart muscle cells are starved of oxygen, and they start to die. The troponin proteins within those cells spill into the bloodstream and are biomarkers that can indicate cardiac injury. Blood tests for troponin I and T have been developed to measure the levels of troponin proteins when doctors suspect damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack.' "
What is the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test?,"'Since the first use of troponin testing, several generations of more refined and more reliable tests have been developed and used to help diagnose heart attack more rapidly and accurately.''The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test (hs-cTnT) is the latest generation of the cardiac enzyme testing that allows for detection of very low levels of troponin T, helping to diagnose ''heart attacks'' more quickly. If the test is negative, it can also help “rule out” heart damage from ''coronary artery disease'' (CAD).' "
 How does the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test work? What are normal levels of troponin in the blood? How does the test work?,"'When a doctor suspect that a person is having a heart attack or heart muscle damage, they will order a blood test to check for troponin (along with other standard diagnostic tests for patients with ''chest pain'' such as ''EKG'', ''chest X-ray'', ''complete blood count'', and blood chemistries). An elevated level of troponin T on the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test indicates heart muscle damage or a heart attack.''The high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test can detect very small levels of troponin T in the bloodstream. The normal range (value) for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T test (hs-cTnT) is 14 ng/l. This cutoff for the “normal” level of troponin T was determined by looking at several studies of patients who were “apparently healthy” (no heart complaints) and had this level of troponin T in the bloodstream as a baseline. Thus, when the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T test detects levels above 14 ng/l, heart damage or heart attack is likely. As the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T test becomes more widely used, further refinement in the cutoff levels for normal troponin T is expected based on patient’s age, sex, underlying medical conditions, and ethnicity.' "
What happens if your troponin levels are too high (elevated)?,"'If your troponin levels are being measured this means doctors are performing the test to diagnose heart problems that you have.''If troponin levels are high (elevated above normal) and the EKG indicates an acute heart attack, you may have cardiac intervention such as a catheterization with ''angioplasty'' and possibly ''stents'', or an evaluation for ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (''CABG'') surgery may be required.''If troponin levels are high and your EKG does not indicate an acute heart attack, the doctor will perform more testing to figure out the reason for your elevated troponin levels. This may include:'   Cardiac catheterization Stents Cardiac echocardiograms Stress testing CT (CAT) scan"
What diseases can troponin tests help diagnose?,"'The main use of testing troponin levels is to help rapidly diagnose ''acute myocardial infarction'' (MI), or heart attack. Troponin is a protein very specific for the heart muscle, and when a heart attack occurs, troponin levels in the blood begin to rise within 2 to 4 hours of onset, and continue to be elevated for about 2 weeks. Troponin testing is what doctors refer to as “cardiac enzymes,” and they are frequently measured by a blood test when patients complain of ''chest pain'' or symptoms that could indicate heart problems.''Troponin levels can also be used to help diagnose other heart-related conditions, such as:' Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) Stable angina Congestive heart failure (CHF) Cardiomyopathy"
What other diseases or conditions cause elevated troponin levels?,"'Even though the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T test is highly indicative of heart muscle damage or heart attack, there are a few other medical conditions that can cause slight elevations in troponin levels, for example:' Renal (kidney) failure Chronic heart failure Sepsis (severe blood infection) Pulmonary embolism Myocarditis Aortic dissection Cardiotoxic chemotherapy Blunt chest trauma Strenuous exercise (such as endurance athletes)"
How can you prevent high levels of troponin?,"'Chest ''pain'' is a serious symptom that could indicate a heart attack and time is of the essence to get prompt treatment. If you have chest ''pain'' or suspect you are having a heart attack call 911 immediately.'  A heart-healthy lifestyle with a nutritious low-fat diet and regular exercise is the best way to prevent heart disease and heart attack. In addition to diet and exercise, maintain a healthy weight, don’t smoke, limit alcohol intake, practice stress reduction, manage blood pressure and diabetes, and take any medications as directed. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors for heart disease such as family history, other medical conditions, and cholesterol levels."
LDL and HDL: What are triglycerides?,"'Triglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.''The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with ''cholesterol'' to form chylomicrons. This is the source of energy for cells in the body. Fat cells and ''liver'' cells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.''Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease''. Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty ''liver disease'' and pancreatitis.''Certain diseases and conditions may cause elevated triglyceride blood levels, for example:''Alcohol'' consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase ''HDL'' (the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of ''heart disease''. ''However, it is not recommended that people start to drink alcohol to obtain these effects.' Poorly-controlled diabetes Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver or other liver diseases Hypothyroidism Some medications (for example, beta blockers, diuretics, birth control pills)"
How are triglyceride levels measured?,"'Triglyceride levels in the blood are measured by a simple blood test. Often, triglycerides are measured as part of a lipoprotein panel (''lipid'' panel) in which triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) are measured at the same time.''Fasting for 8-12 hours before the test is required. Fat levels in the blood are affected by recent eating and ''digestion''. Falsely elevated results may occur if the blood test is done just after eating.' "
What are normal triglyceride levels? What do elevated triglyceride levels mean?,'Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and ''cholesterol levels'' are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk.' Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. Extremely high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
What causes low triglyceride levels?,"'Returning triglyceride levels to normal may decrease the risk of ''heart'' attack, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease. Controlling high triglycerides and ''high cholesterol'' is a lifelong challenge. A healthy lifestyle includes eating well, exercising routinely, ''smoking cessation'', and ''weight loss''. This may be all that is needed, but some people additionally require medications to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Your health-care professional will help make decisions with you to decide what treatment combination is most appropriate.' "
Changes in diet to lower triglycerides,"'The following dietary changes may be helpful in lowering triglycerides.''Switch to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of trans or saturated fats. The best sources of these fats are olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, lake trout, sardines, herring, and albacore tuna. Learning to interpret food labels will help you understand the kinds of fat in the food you buy and consume.'   Decreasing your intake of sugar: If you have a sweet tooth, try to set limits on how often and how much sugar you consume. You can cut your intake in half to begin with, and continue cutting back from there. Remember to read the labels to check for sugar content in both food and beverages. Changing from white to brown: If you eat white rice, bread, and pasta, switch to whole wheat products. It may take a little while to get used to the difference in taste, but it's worth the effort for the benefits to your health. A variety of whole-wheat products are available so experiment until you find the one that you like best. Switching fats: Limit or avoid foods with saturated and trans fats. These include fried foods, lard, butter, whole milk, ice cream, commercial baked goods, meats, and cheese. Read the nutrition labels to determine whether these unhealthy fats are present."
What is bursitis?,"'A bursa is a closed fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. ""Bursae"" is the plural form of ""bursa."" The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. When a bursa becomes inflamed, the condition is known as ""bursitis.""' "
What is hip bursitis?,"'There are two major bursae of the hip, the trochanteric bursa and the ischial bursa. These are located adjacent to the edges of the femur (thighbone) and pelvic bone, respectively. Inflammation of either can be associated with ''stiffness'' and pain around the hip joint. The trochanteric bursa is located on the side of the hip. It is separated significantly from the actual hip joint by tissue and bone. Bursitis is not ''arthritis'' and, therefore, is not a cause of true ''joint pain''.'  "
What causes hip bursitis?,"'Most commonly, bursitis is a noninfectious condition (''aseptic bursitis'') caused by inflammation that results from local soft-tissue ''trauma'' or strain injury. On rare occasions, the hip bursa can become infected with bacteria. This condition is called septic bursitis. Although uncommon, the hip bursa can become inflamed by crystals that deposit there from ''gout'' or ''pseudogout'', or from calcinosis as a result of ''scleroderma''.' "
What are risk factors for hip bursitis?,"'Risk factors for hip bursitis include activities that could strain the hip area, including going up and down stairs, repetitive activities such as stair-climber exercising, etc.' "
What are hip bursitis symptoms and signs?,"'Bursitis of the hip is the most common cause of ''hip pain''.''Trochanteric bursitis frequently causes pain and tenderness of the outer hip and thigh, making it difficult for those affected to lie on the involved side, frequently causing difficult ''sleep''. Trochanteric bursitis also causes a dull, burning pain on the outer hip and thigh that is often made worse with excessive ''walking'', ''exercise'', or stair climbing. ''Iliotibial band'' syndrome can sometimes mimic or be associated with trochanteric bursitis.''Ischial bursitis''The ischial bursa is located in the upper buttock area. Ischial bursitis can cause dull pain in this area that is most noticeable when climbing uphill. The pain sometimes occurs after prolonged sitting on hard surfaces, hence the names ""weaver\'s bottom"" and ""tailor\'s bottom.""'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose hip bursitis?,"'The diagnosis of bursitis of the hip is usually based on clinical evaluation. A health care professional diagnoses hip bursitis in the clinic upon reviewing the history of the location of the hip pain and specific areas of tenderness of the outside of the hip. This can be further confirmed when a local injection of anesthetic relieves the pain. Patients frequently notice pain in the outer hip with stair climbing or descending and tenderness of the hip when lying on the affected side at night. The doctor can localize the tender areas to the location of the bursae of the hip. Occasionally, X-ray of the hip are used to rule out other conditions of the bone and joints, such as arthritis. Sometimes X-ray testing can highlight areas of calcium deposits in an inflamed bursa. These areas of calcification indicate a past history of inflammation of the bursa.' "
What types of doctors treat hip bursitis?,"'Doctors who treat hip bursitis include internists, general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, ''rheumatologists'', physical-medicine doctors, and orthopedic surgeons.' "
What are the treatments and home remedies for hip bursitis?,"""The treatment of any bursitis depends on whether or not it involves infection. Noninfectious or aseptic hip bursitis can be treated with home remedies that include ice compresses, rest, and anti-inflammatory and pain medications. Occasionally, it requires aspiration of the bursa fluid. This procedure involves removal of the fluid with a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. It can be performed in the doctor's office. Sometimes the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further analysis. Frequently, there is inadequate fluid accumulation for aspiration. Noninfectious hip bursitis can be treated with an injection of cortisone medication, often with an anesthetic, into the swollen bursa. ""'Cortisone injection'' is typically rapidly effective. Recovery time is usually within days. This is sometimes performed at the same time as the aspiration procedure. Home remedies include ''over-the-counter'' medications like ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'').''Patients with hip bursitis can often benefit by weight reduction, stretching exercises, and wearing proper footwear for ''exercise'' activities. Sometimes physical therapy programs guided by a physical therapist can be helpful. Generally, patients should avoid hills and stairs and direct pressure on the affected hip (''sleep'' on the other side), when possible, while symptoms are present. People with hip bursitis should also avoid exercising on inclined surfaces and stairs, especially ''running'' hills, until symptoms have resolved. Other exercises to avoid until the hip inflammation has subsided include Stairmaster and similar exercises.''Infectious (septic) bursitis (rare in the hip) requires even further evaluation and treatment by a doctor. This is unusual in the hip bursa but does occur. The bursa fluid can be examined in the laboratory to identify the precise bacteria causing the infection. Septic bursitis requires antibiotic therapy, often intravenously. Repeated aspiration of the infected fluid may be required. Surgical drainage and removal of the infected bursa sac (bursectomy) may also be necessary.'  "
What is the prognosis for hip bursitis? Is it possible to prevent hip bursitis?,"'Usually, hip bursitis responds completely with conservative treatments. Either oral or injectable anti-inflammatory medications frequently resolve the symptoms within a week. Treatment by a physical therapist can expedite recovery in resistant hip bursitis. Infectious bursitis must be cured with antibiotic treatment, often together with surgical drainage.''Hip bursitis can often be prevented by stretching prior to exercising and by wearing proper footwear for activities. ''Yoga'' can be helpful. Avoiding hills and stairs can minimize the risk of hip bursitis.'  "
What is the anatomy of the hip?,"'The hip joint is where the ball of the thigh bone (femur) joins the pelvis at a socket called the acetabulum. There is cartilage covering both the bone of the femur and the acetabulum of the pelvis in the hip joint. A joint lining tissue, called synovium, surrounds the hip joint. The synovium tissue produces fluid that lubricates the joint and provides nutrients to the cartilage of the joint. The ligaments around the hip joint attach the femur bone to the bony pelvis. There are a number of muscles and tendons that glide around the hip joint. Tiny fluid-filled sacs, called bursae, provide gliding surfaces for muscles and tendons around the hip joint. Major arteries and veins pass the front of the hip joint. The largest nerve of the body, the ''sciatic nerve'', passes behind the hip joint.''The hip joint is one the large joints of the body and serves in locomotion as the thigh moves forward and backward. The hip joint also rotates when sitting and with changes of direction when ''walking''.' "
What are causes and risk factors for hip pain?,"'There are many causes of hip ''joint pain''. Some ''hip pain'' is temporary, while other hip ''pain'' can be long-standing or chronic. Causes of hip ''pain'' include ''arthritis'', inflammatory and noninflammatory ''arthritis'', ''fracture'', sprain, ''infectious arthritis'' (''septic arthritis''), ''avascular necrosis'', ''Gaucher'""'s disease, ""'sciatica'', muscle strain, ''iliotibial band'' syndrome (''IT band syndrome''), and ''hematoma''.'  "
What symptoms and signs may be associated with hip pain?,"'Symptoms associated with hip pain depend on the cause. Symptoms include''Symptoms vary in intensity from mild to severe. Hip pain can be a cause of disability.'   limping, joint pain, groin pain, loss of motion of the hip, warmth, swelling over the hip, tenderness of the hip, difficulty sleeping on the hip."
How do health care professionals diagnose hip pain?,"'Health care professionals diagnose hip pain with a history and physical examination. Physical examination maneuvers, such as internally and externally rotating the hip, can be used to detect pain-aggravating positions. Tenderness can be elicited by palpating over inflamed areas. Straight leg raising can detect signs of ''sciatica''. A health care professional may use imaging studies, including ''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', and ''MRI'' scans, to further define the causes of hip pain. Sometimes, nuclear medicine bone scans are used to image inflamed or ''fractured bone''.' "
What are treatments and medications for hip pain?,"'The treatment of hip pain depends on the precise cause of the pain. Treatments can include rest, non-weight-bearing, ''cold'' application, and anti-inflammatory medications. For local inflammation, sometimes injection of cortisone medication (steroids) is used to quiet the inflammation. If infection is present, antibiotics are used. ''Fractures'' can require treatment with surgical repairs, including pinning, plates and screws, and total joint replacement. For severe arthritis, total joint replacement is performed when possible.'  "
What types of specialists treat hip pain?,"'General medicine physicians, including general practitioners, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', and sports medicine specialists treat hip pain. Often physical therapists and rehabilitation physicians are involved in the care of hip pain.' "
Are there any home remedies for hip pain?,"'Home remedies for hip pain include rest, non-weight-bearing, cold application, and anti-inflammatory medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'' and ''Advil''), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), and pain medications such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'').' "
What is the prognosis of hip pain?,'The prognosis of hip pain depends on the cause and the response to treatment. Most mild strain injuries have a good outlook and resolve rapidly in response to home remedies.' 
Is it possible to prevent hip pain?,'Hip pain can be prevented by avoiding injury to the hip joint. This includes sports injury. Sometimes proper conditioning prior to a sports event can prevent injury.' 
Facts you should know about total hip replacement," The prostheses for a total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) can be inserted into the pelvis and femur with or without cement. The options are customized for each patient by the orthopedic surgeon. Chronic pain and impairment of daily function of patients with severe hip arthritis are reasons for considering treatment with total hip replacement. Complications and risks of total hip replacement surgery have been identified. Preoperative banking of the blood of patients planning total hip replacement is considered when possible. This blood can be used for transfusion if needed (autologous transfusion). Physical therapy is an essential part of rehabilitation after a total hip replacement. Patients with artificial joints are generally recommended to take antibiotics before, during, and after any elective invasive procedures (including dental work)."
What is a total hip replacement?,"'A total hip replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased cartilage and bone of the hip joint is surgically replaced with artificial materials. The normal hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is a ""cup-shaped"" component of the pelvis called the acetabulum. The ball is the head of the thighbone (femur). Total hip joint replacement involves surgical removal of the diseased ball and socket and replacing them with a metal (or ceramic) ball and stem inserted into the femur bone and an artificial ''plastic'' (or ceramic) cup socket. The metallic artificial ball and stem are referred to as the ""femoral prosthesis"" and the plastic cup socket is the ""acetabular prosthesis."" Upon inserting the prosthesis into the central core of the femur, it is fixed with a bony cement called methylmethacrylate. Alternatively, a ""cementless"" prosthesis is used that has microscopic pores which allow bony ingrowth from the normal femur into the prosthesis stem. This ""cementless"" hip is felt to have a longer duration and is considered especially for younger patients. Total hip replacement is also referred to as total hip arthroplasty.'  "
Who is a candidate for total hip replacement?,"'Total hip replacements are performed most commonly because of progressively worsening of severe ''arthritis'' in the hip joint. The most common type of arthritis leading to total hip replacement is ''degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') of the hip joint. This type of arthritis is generally seen with ''aging'', congenital abnormality of the hip joint, or prior ''trauma'' to the hip joint. Other conditions leading to total hip replacement include bony ''fractures'' of the hip joint, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and death (''aseptic necrosis'', or ''avascular necrosis'') of the hip bone. Hip bone necrosis can be caused by ''fracture'' of the hip, ''drugs'' (such as chronic use of ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''), ''alcoholism'', and systemic diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').''The progressively intense ''chronic pain'', together with impairment of daily function including ''walking'', climbing stairs, and even arising from a sitting position, eventually become reasons to consider a total hip replacement. Because replaced hip joints can fail with time, whether and when to perform total hip replacement are not easy decisions, especially in younger patients. Replacement is generally considered after ''pain'' becomes so severe that it impedes normal function despite use of anti-inflammatory and/or ''pain'' medications. A total hip joint replacement is usually an elective procedure, which means that it is an option selected among other alternatives and can be scheduled on a routine basis. It is a decision that is made with an understanding of the potential risks and benefits. A thorough understanding of both the procedure and anticipated outcome is an important part of the decision-making process with the orthopedic surgeon.'  "
What are total hip replacement complications?,"'The risks of total hip replacement include ''blood clots'' in the lower extremities that can travel to the ''lungs'' (''pulmonary embolism''). Severe cases of ''pulmonary embolism'' are rare but can cause respiratory failure and death. Other problems include difficulty with urination, local skin or joint infection, ''fracture'' of the bone during and after surgery, scarring, limitation of motion of the hip, dislocation of the hip replacement, and loosening of the prosthesis that eventually leads to prosthesis failure. Because total hip joint replacement requires anesthesia, the usual risks of anesthesia apply and include ''heart'' arrhythmias, ''stroke'', ''liver'' toxicity, and ''pneumonia''.' "
What preparation is needed for the procedure?,"'The preoperative evaluation generally includes a review of all medications being taken by the patient. Anti-inflammatory medications, including ''aspirin'', are often discontinued one week prior to surgery because of the effect of these medications on platelet function and blood clotting. Other preoperative evaluations include complete blood counts, ''electrolytes'' (potassium, sodium, chloride), blood tests for kidney and liver functions, ''urinalysis'', ''chest X-ray'', ''EKG'', and a physical examination. Your physician will determine which of these tests are required, based on your age and medical conditions. Any indications of infection, severe heart or lung disease, or active metabolic disturbances such as uncontrolled ''diabetes'' may postpone or defer total hip joint surgery.''If the condition of the hip allows it, some doctors will recommend a preoperative ''exercise'' program to build muscle and increase flexibility. This can help with recovery.''Total hip joint replacement can involve blood loss. Patients planning to undergo total hip replacement often will donate their own (autologous) blood to be stored for transfusion during the surgery. Should ''blood transfusion'' be required, the patient will have the advantage of having his or her own blood available, thus minimizing the risks related to blood transfusions.' "
What will recovery be like for the patient after surgery?,"'A total hip joint replacement takes approximately two to four hours of surgical time. The preparation prior to surgery may take up additional time. After surgery, the patient is taken to a recovery room for immediate observation that generally lasts between one to four hours. The lower extremities will be closely observed for both adequate sensation and circulation. If unusual symptoms of numbness or tingling are noted by the patient, recovery room nurses are available and should be notified by the patient. Upon stabilization, the patient is transferred to a hospital room.'""During the immediate recovery period, patients are given intravenous fluids. Intravenous fluids are important to maintain a patient's electrolytes and replace any fluids lost during surgery. Using the same IV, antibiotics might be administered as well as pain medication. Patients also will notice tubes draining fluid from the surgical ""'wound'' site. The amount and character of the drainage is important to the doctor and can be monitored closely by the nurse in attendance. A dressing is applied in the operating room and will remain in place for two to four days to be later changed by the attending surgeon and staff.''Pain-control medications are commonly given through a patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) pump whereby patients can actually administer their own dose of medications on demand. Pain medications occasionally can cause ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Antinausea medications may then be given.''Measures are taken to prevent blood clots in the lower extremities. Patients are placed in elastic hose (TEDs) after surgery. Compression stockings are often added, which help by forcing blood circulation in the legs. Patients are encouraged to actively ''exercise'' the lower extremities in order to mobilize venous blood in the lower extremities to prevent blood clots. Medications are often given to thin the blood in order to further prevent blood clots.''Patients may also experience difficulty with urination. This difficulty can be a side effect of medications given for pain. As a result, catheters are often placed into the bladder to allow normal passage of urine.''Immediately after surgery, patients are encouraged to frequently perform deep ''breathing'' and ''coughing'' in order to avoid lung ''congestion'' and the collapse of tiny airways in the lungs. Patients are also given a ""blow bottle,"" whereby active blowing against resistance maintains the opening of the breathing passages.' "
What is involved in the rehabilitation process after total hip joint replacement?,"'After total hip joint replacement surgery, patients often start physical therapy immediately! On the first day after surgery, it is common to begin some minor physical therapy while sitting in a chair. Eventually, rehabilitation incorporates stepping, walking, and climbing. Initially, supportive devices such as a walker or crutches are used. Pain is monitored while exercise takes place. Some degree of discomfort is normal. It is often very gratifying for the patient to notice, even early on, substantial relief from the preoperative pain for which the total hip replacement was performed.''Physical therapy is extremely important in the overall outcome of any joint replacement surgery. The goals of physical therapy are to prevent contractures, improve patient education, and strengthen muscles around the hip joint through controlled exercises. Contractures that can cause limitation of joint motion result from scarring of the tissues around the joint. Contractures do not permit full range of motion and therefore impede mobility of the replaced joint. Patients are instructed not to strain the hip joint with heavy lifting or other unusual activities at home. Specific techniques of body posturing, sitting, and using an elevated toilet seat can be extremely helpful. Patients are instructed not to cross the operated lower extremity across the midline of the body (not crossing the leg over the other leg) because of the risk of dislocating the replaced joint. They are discouraged from bending at the waist and are instructed to use a pillow between the legs when lying on the non-operated side in order to prevent the operated lower extremity from crossing over the midline. Patients are given home exercise programs to strengthen the muscles around the buttock and thigh. Most patients attend outpatient physical therapy for a period of time while incorporating home exercises regularly into their daily living.''Occupational therapists are also part of the rehabilitation process. These therapists review precautions with the patients related to everyday activities. They also educate the patients about the adaptive equipment that is available and the proper ways to do their ""ADLs"" or activities of daily living.'  "
What other postoperative instructions are given to patients with total hip joint replacements?,"'Patients will continue to use supportive devices as monitored and recommended by the therapist and attending physician. Medications are likely to be given to further prevent blood clots in the legs. These include ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') or aspirin medications. Occasionally, ''heparin'' (''enoxaparin'' [''Lovenox'']) can be given by self-injection at home. A doctor will determine how long a patient needs to take this medication. Additional medications are given for pain, ''sleep'', and occasionally for muscle relaxation.'""Gradually, patients become more confident and less dependent on supportive devices. Patients are instructed to look for signs of infection, including swelling, warmth, redness, or increased pain in or around the surgical site. The patient should notify the doctor's office immediately if these changes are noted or if there is injury to the hip. The wound site will be inspected regularly by the attending physician. The ""'sutures'', which are usually staples, are removed several weeks after the operation.' "
What is the prognosis of total hip joint replacement?,"'Patient education is important to ensure longevity of the replaced hip. Strenuous exercises such as ''running'' or contact sports are discouraged, since these activities can reinjure the replaced hip. ''Swimming'' is ideal in improving muscle strength and promoting mobility and endurance.''Patients should be aware and notify any caregivers that they have an artificial joint. Antibiotics are recommended during any invasive procedures, whether surgical, urological, gastroenterological, or dental. Infections elsewhere in the body should also be treated to prevent seeding of infection into the joint. This is important because bacteria can pass through the bloodstream from these sites and cause infection of the hip prosthesis.''Measurements of metallic substances that can erode away from the metal portions of hip replacements can indicate toxicity or wear of the prostheses. With high levels of cobalt measured in blood of these patients, it is suggested that an ''MRI'' of the hip be performed to be certain an abnormal growth of tissue (pseudotumor) is not present.''Hip joint replacement surgery is one of the most successful joint surgeries performed today. In well-selected patients, who are appropriate candidates for total hip replacements, the procedure lasts at least 15 years in most patients. Long-term results have been improving impressively with new devices and techniques. The future will provide newer techniques which will further improve patient outcomes, mobility, and lessen the potential for complications.'  "
What is Hirschsprung disease?,'Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital (present at birth) disease of the large intestine or colon. It is one type of birth defect. People with the disease do not have the nerve cells in the intestine required to expel stools from the body normally.'  
How many newborns have Hirschsprung disease?,"'Hirschsprung disease occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 newborns. Children with ''Down syndrome'' and other medical problems, such as ''congenital heart defects'', are at much greater risk. For example, about one in 100 children with ''Down syndrome'' also has Hirschsprung disease.''Hirschsprung disease is congenital, or present at birth; however, symptoms may or may not be obvious at birth. If you have a child with Hirschsprung disease, your chances of having more children with Hirschsprung disease are greater than people who don’t have a child with Hirschsprung disease. Also, if a parent has Hirschsprung disease, the chance of their child having Hirschsprung disease is higher. Talk with your doctor to learn more.' "
Signs and symptoms of Hirschsprung disease in newborns,"'An early symptom in some newborns is failure to have a first bowel movement within 48 hours after birth. Other symptoms may include'   Green or brown vomit Explosive stools after a doctor inserts a finger into the newborn’s rectum Swelling of the abdomen Diarrhea, often with blood Failure to pass their first bowel movement (meconium) Constipation Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain or distension Diarrhea Aganglionic megacolon Intestinal obstruction Weight loss Adducted thumb Failure to thrive in infancy Sepsis Enterocolitis"
Signs and symptoms in toddlers and older children,"'Symptoms of Hirschsprung disease in toddlers and older children may include' Not being able to pass stools without enemas or suppositories. An enema involves flushing liquid into the child’s anus using a special wash bottle. A suppository is a pill Placed into the child’s rectum. Swelling of the abdomen. Diarrhea, often with blood. Slow growth. Intellectual disability"
What causes Hirschsprung disease? Is it inherited?,"""Before birth, a child's nerve cells normally grow along the ""'intestines'' in the direction of the anus. With Hirschsprung disease, the nerve cells stop growing too soon. Why the nerve cells stop growing is unclear. Some Hirschsprung disease is ''inherited'', meaning it is passed from parent to child through genes. Hirschsprung disease is not caused by anything a mother did while ''pregnant''.''Isolated Hirschsprung disease can result from mutations in one of several genes, including the RET (most common), EDNRB, and EDN3 genes. However, the genetics of this condition are complex and are not yet completely understood. While a mutation in a single gene sometimes causes the condition, mutations in multiple genes may be required in some cases. The genetic cause of the condition is unknown in approximately half of affected individuals.' "
How is Hirschsprung disease diagnosed?,"'Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging, and the diagnosis for Hirschsprung disease is based on''If your doctor suspects Hirschsprung disease, he or she may refer your child to a pediatric gastroenterologist—a doctor who specializes in ''digestive diseases'' in children—for additional evaluation.' A physical exam A medical and family history Symptoms Test results"
Surgery for Hirschsprung disease,"'Hirschsprung disease is a life-threatening illness, and treatment requires surgery. ''Children who have surgery for Hirschsprung disease most often feel better after surgery. If growth was slow because of Hirschsprung disease, growth typically improves after surgery.''For treatment, a pediatric surgeon will perform a pull-through procedure or an ostomy surgery. During either procedure, the surgeon may remove all or part of the colon, called a colectomy.''During a'' pull-through procedure'', a surgeon removes the part of the large intestine that is missing nerve cells and connects the healthy part to the anus. A surgeon most often does a pull-through procedure soon after diagnosis.''Ostomy surgery'' is a surgical procedure that reroutes the normal movement of the ''stool'' out of the body when a part of the bowel is removed. Creating an ostomy means bringing part of the intestine through the abdominal wall so that ''stool'' can leave the body without passing through the anus. The opening in the abdomen through which stool leaves the body is called a ''stoma''. A removable external collection pouch, called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance, is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect the stool. The child or ''caregiver'' will need to empty the pouch several times each day.''Although most children with Hirschsprung disease do not need ostomy surgery, a child sick from Hirschsprung disease may need ostomy surgery to get better before undergoing the pull-through procedure. This gives the inflamed areas of the intestine time to heal. In most cases, an ostomy is temporary and the child will have a second surgery to close the ostomy and reattach the intestine. However, sometimes children with Hirschsprung disease have a permanent ostomy, especially if a long segment of the bowel is missing nerve cells or the child has repeated episodes of bowel inflammation, which health care providers call enterocolitis.''Ostomy surgeries include the following:' Ileostomy surgery is when the surgeon connects the small intestine to the stoma. Colostomy surgery is when the surgeon connects part of the large intestine to the stoma."
What can I expect as my newborn or child recovers from surgery?,"'After surgery, your child will need time to adjust to the new structure of his or her large intestine.''Typically, these problems improve over time with guidance from your child’s doctors. Most children eventually have normal bowel movements.''Infants will feel better after ostomy surgery because they will be able to pass ''gas'' and stool easily.'   narrowing of the anus constipation diarrhea leaking stool from the anus delayed toilet training enterocolitis"
What is histoplasmosis?,"'Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by an infection with a fungus known as ''Histoplasma capsulatum'', which is common in the environment, most frequently in association with bird or bat droppings. Some people also refer to the disease as ""cave disease."" The infection can cause a lung disease similar to ''pneumonia'' in some people. In some cases, the infection spreads throughout the body, known as disseminated disease. Disseminated histoplasmosis is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with ''HIV/AIDS'', those receiving ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'', or people taking immune-suppressant medications for chronic conditions or transplants. Spread to other organs in immunosuppressed people may involve the ''liver'', spleen, brain, joints, eyes, and bone marrow.' "
What causes histoplasmosis?,"'The causative organism is a fungus, ''Histoplasma capsulatum''. The fungus is associated with bird or bat droppings in the environment, especially in caves. When one inhales the microscopic fungal spores, some people develop an illness similar to ''pneumonia''. Not everyone who inhales the spores develops the illness. The spores may become airborne in demolition projects in areas that contain bat or bird droppings. The airborne spores can travel hundreds of ''feet''. Estimates indicate that around 250,000 people are infected each year in the U.S.''Histoplasma capsulatum'' exists throughout the world, but it is most commonly located in North and Central America. Within the U.S., it is particularly common in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. In areas where the fungus is common (endemic areas), between 50%-80% of people will show an antibody response to the organism, meaning that they have been exposed to the fungus at some point in their life.' "
What are risk factors for histoplasmosis?,"'Anyone may develop histoplasmosis. However, the illness is more likely to occur in infants, young children, and the elderly. Risk factors for developing severe or widespread disease include having a suppressed immune function or chronic lung disease. The soil may also become contaminated with the fungus, so those who work with soil, such as landscapers and farmers, are at greater risk. Also at risk are workers performing demolition work in areas that contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Histoplasmosis is not ''contagious'' or spread from person to person.' "
What are histoplasmosis symptoms and signs?,"'As mentioned before, not everyone who inhales the fungal spores becomes sick. When illness does occur, the signs and symptoms appear anywhere from three to 17 days after exposure. The symptoms of pulmonary histoplasmosis are similar to those of pneumonia and include ''flu-like symptoms'' such as ''fever'', ''chills'', sweats, a dry ''cough'', malaise, and chest pains. Some affected people also experience ''joint pains''.''If the disease progresses without treatment, those affected may develop ''weight loss'', ''shortness of breath'', and ''fatigue''. ''Ocular'' (eye) involvement in disseminated disease can cause ''loss of vision''. If the infection spreads to the central nervous system, severe symptoms including ''seizures'', ''headaches'', and ''confusion'' may develop.'  "
How do physicians diagnose histoplasmosis?,"'The symptoms and signs of histoplasmosis are not specific enough to establish the diagnosis. The diagnosis rests upon demonstrating the fungus or an immune response to the fungus. Some of the many diagnostic laboratory tests available include the following:''Chest ''X-rays'' in people with acute histoplasmosis are usually normal. However, physicians may notice so-called coin lesions or histoplasmomas in the chest X-rays of people with healed histoplasmosis. These are round accumulations of ''scar tissue''. Calcification of ''lymph nodes'' around the bronchi may be evidence of prior healed infections. Depending on the severity and stage of the disease, infiltrates or other changes may be apparent on X-rays.''CT scans'' are useful to identify areas of spread in disseminated histoplasmosis.'   Cultures of body fluids or tissues to identify the fungus Detection of surface markers of Histoplasma in a urine test Blood tests to measure antibody response to Histoplasma Microscopic examination of samples of infected tissues"
What is the treatment for histoplasmosis?,"'Mild cases of histoplasmosis that are limited to the ''lungs'' will resolve without specific treatment in about a month. Severe infections or disseminated cases of histoplasmosis require treatment with antifungal medications. ''Itraconazole'' (''Sporanox'', Onmel), ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''), and amphotericin B (''Ambisome'', ''Amphotec''; drug of choice for severe disease) are antifungal ''drugs'' that treat histoplasmosis. A person may need to continue treatment for a period of several months.'  "
What is the prognosis of histoplasmosis?,"'People with mild symptoms of histoplasmosis usually resolve the disease on their own without treatment. In more severe cases, the prognosis is good for those who receive appropriate treatment. Certain people will experience relapsing infections (chronic histoplasmosis) and may need long-term therapy with antifungal drugs. Chronic pulmonary histoplasmosis has a mortality (death) rate of up to 50% if untreated (and 28% with treatment). Disseminated histoplasmosis has a poor prognosis when untreated.' "
Is it possible to prevent histoplasmosis?,"'There is no vaccine against histoplasmosis. In areas where the fungus is common, it may not be possible to prevent infection. Avoiding areas with bird and bat droppings may provide some protection. Wearing a respirator facemask can provide protection for workers in contaminated areas. Spraying soil with water before working the soil may help prevent release of spores into the air. Having had histoplasmosis in the past can offer some protection against severe disease if you become reinfected.''There are no commercially available tests to test for histoplasmosis in the environment, and people do not routinely carry out testing of soil and other environmental areas. Properly cleaning up bird or bat droppings, however, may help reduce the risk of contracting the infection.' "
HIV vs. AIDS: Epidemic History and Drug Discovery,"'The history of the ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (HIV) and ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS'') dates back to 1981, when gay men with symptoms and signs of a disease that now are considered typical of ''AIDS'' were first described in Los Angeles and New York. The men had an unusual type of lung infection (''pneumonia'') called Pneumocystis carinii (now known as Pneumocystis jiroveci) ''pneumonia'"" (PCP) and rare skin tumors called Kaposi's sarcomas.""'The patients were noted to have a severe reduction in a type of cell in the blood (CD4 cells) that is an important part of the immune system. These cells, often referred to as T cells, help the body fight infections. Shortly thereafter, this disease was recognized throughout the United States, Western Europe, and Africa. In 1983, researchers in the United States and France described the virus that causes ''AIDS'', now known as HIV, belonging to the group of ''viruses'' called retroviruses.''While HIV infection is required to develop ''AIDS'', the actual definition of AIDS is the development of a low CD4 cell count (<200 cells/mm3) or any one of a long list of complications of HIV infection ranging from a variety of so-called ""opportunistic infections,"" ''cancers'', neurologic symptoms, and wasting syndromes.' "
What tests are used in the diagnosis of HIV?,"'The test that for decades had been most commonly used for diagnosing infection with HIV was referred to as an ''ELISA''. If the ''ELISA'' blood test found HIV antibodies, the results needed to be confirmed, typically by a test called a Western blot. Recently, tests have become available to look for these same antibodies in saliva, some providing results within one to 20 minutes of testing. As a result, the FDA has approved home HIV antibody testing that is self-administered using saliva. Antibodies to HIV typically develop within several weeks of infection. During this interval, patients have virus in their body but will test negative by the standard antibody test, the so-called ""window period.""''In order to decrease the number of people that are unaware of their HIV infection status, in 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' recommended that all people between 13 and 64 years of age be provided ''HIV testing'' whenever they encounter the health care system for any reason. In addition, resources are available to facilitate people finding local ''HIV testing'' centers (https://gettested.cdc.gov/).' "
How is HIV spread (transmitted)?,"'In people infected with HIV, the virus appears in the blood and genital fluids. HIV spreads from person to person when genital fluids are exchanged during sex, through sharing needles for intravenous recreational drugs, or from mother to child in ''pregnancy'', ''labor'', or ''breastfeeding''.''Sexual transmission is possible in vaginal, anal and oral sex between partners of any gender. Abstinence is the only sure way to prevent transmission, but safer sex practices like ''condoms'' and dental dams can help reduce the risk. Exposure to infected blood through transfusion or in the course of duty as a paramedic or other first responder is another transmission pathway. Transfusions in the U.S. are screened for HIV, so the risk of contracting it through donated blood is low in that country.''People who are infected with HIV can drastically reduce the risk of transmission to their sex partner by sticking to treatment and monitoring; if the viral levels are undetectable in the lab, the chances of transmission are low. This is also a strategy for long-term partners of people with HIV – Pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) refers to antiviral drugs administered to non-infected individuals at high risk of infection, such as the HIV-free partners of people with HIV.' "
What laboratory tests are used to monitor HIV-infected people?,"'Two blood tests are routinely used to monitor HIV-infected people. One of these tests, which counts the number of CD4 cells, assesses the status of the immune system. The other test, which determines the so-called viral load, directly measures the amount of virus in the blood (viral load).''Drug-resistance testing also has become a key tool in the management of HIV-infected individuals. Clearly, resistance testing is now routinely used in individuals experiencing poor responses to HIV therapy or treatment failure.' "
What is the initial therapy for HIV?,"'In the United States, guidelines for using antiviral therapy have been developed and are updated on a regular basis by an expert panel assembled by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) panel, and others. The DHHS guidelines are available at https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/. The most recent IAS-USA guidelines were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in the summer of 2018.''Antiviral treatment options have primarily included combinations of two nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs, often referred to as ""nucs,"" and a third drug, typically being a boosted ''protease inhibitors'' (''PI''), a nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) often called ""non-nucs,"" and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) such as RAL (''raltegravir''), EVG (elvitegravir), DTG (dolutegravir) or bictegravir (BIC). Many of these drugs are available in fixed-dose combinations[TA1] .''The following are the different drug types currently used in treatment regimens for HIV:' nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) protease inhibitors (PI) fusion inhibitors CCR5 antagonists integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), and entry inhibitors single-tablet regimens."
Monitoring antiviral therapy,"""The goals of antiviral therapy are to enhance immunity and delay or prevent clinical advancement to symptomatic disease without inducing important side effects or selecting for drug-resistant virus. Currently, the best marker of a drug's activity is a decrease in the viral load."" "
What are the risks of missing doses or stopping antiviral therapy?,"'It is strongly advised that individuals on an antiviral regimen not miss any doses of their medications. Unfortunately, life is such that doses often are missed. Reasons for missing doses range from just forgetting to take the medication, leaving town without the medication, or because of a medical emergency, such as the need for urgent surgery. For example, after an ''appendectomy'' for acute ''appendicitis'', a patient may not be able to take oral medication for up to several days. When a dose is missed, the patient should contact his or her physician without delay to discuss the course of action. The options in this situation are to take the missed doses immediately or simply resume the drugs with the next scheduled dose.''Although every missed dose increases the chance that the virus will develop resistance to the drugs, a single missed dose should not be cause for alarm. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to learn from the experience and determine why it happened, if it is likely to happen again, and what can be done to minimize missing future doses. Furthermore, if a patient cannot resume medication for a limited time, such as in a medical emergency, there still is no cause for alarm. In this circumstance, the patient should work with their HIV provider to restart therapy as soon as is feasible. Stopping antivirals is associated with some risks of developing ''drug resistance'', and those who wish to stop therapy for any one of a number of reasons should discuss this with their health care professional in advance to establish the best strategy for safely accomplishing this.' "
What is the future for HIV-infected individuals with regards to treatment simplification and cure research?,"'Trends continue toward simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence and decrease side effects. In addition, the availability of multiple new drugs in new classes has made it possible to suppress viral load to undetectable levels even in many of the most treatment-experienced patients. Moreover, many are virologically suppressed taking a single well-tolerated pill per day. Another major advance could emerge with the availability of every one to two month injections of long-acting therapies.''With great success in treatment, the field has increasingly considered strategies that may someday allow patients to control viral replication without the use of antiretrovirals. This could be in the form of a true cure with complete eradication of HIV from the body or a functional cure where the virus persists but is unable to replicated, a situation analogous to what happens when patients are on effective antiretroviral therapy. Research is in the very earliest stages with regard to development of strategies for viral eradication. Studies to control viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy are actively being pursued, although thus far with limited success. One strategy has been to use immune-based therapies to boost the natural immune response to HIV and allow for complete or partial control. Another area of research is to purge infected cells, so-called ""latent reservoir,"" with various agents to facilitate eradication from the body. While research in these areas is under way, it has met with limited success.''The report of the so-called ""Berlin patient"" has stimulated a great deal of interest in cure research. This HIV-infected man had ''leukemia'', which was treated with a ''bone marrow transplant''. His health care providers were able to identify a tissue-matched donor who happened to be one of the rare individuals who carried a genetic defect resulting in the lack of CCR5 on the surface of their cells. CCR5 is required for certain types of HIV to enter the cells, and these unique individuals are relatively resistant to infection. After the ''bone marrow transplant'', the patient was able to stop antiretroviral therapy and for years has not had detectable HIV in his body. It is worth noting that this individual experienced far more than the engraftment of unique bone marrow. He underwent intensive ''chemotherapy'' and ''radiation'' treatment to destroy most immune cells in the body, as well as ''graft-versus-host disease'', which could have also further destroyed residual HIV-infected cells.''Together these events could have markedly reduced the reservoir of virus that persists in the body of all infected individuals, which could have facilitated the purported ""cure"" or set the stage for the ultimate success associated with the engraftment of the unique bone marrow. There was recently excitement about two individuals who underwent so-called ""stem cell transplants"" but without the unique donor that was used by the Berlin patient. While virus remained at very low levels in these individuals while on therapy, at three and eight months after treatment interruption, HIV came back.'""Consequently, the experience with the Berlin patient has not yet been replicated and, even if it is, will not be an option for most people. First, bone marrow transplants are associated with very high risk of illness and death, and second, very few patients who need a bone marrow transplant for any reason are likely to find a tissue-matched donor who carries this rare genetic mutation. However, research is pursuing the potential role each part of this individual's treatment may have had on the successful control of HIV off therapy, as well as working on ways to genetically engineer an individual's own blood CD4 cells or ""'stem cells'' to not have the CCR5 molecule. While this research is in the very early stages of development, it certainly provides hope for the future of research related to HIV eradication and/or cure.' "
How does HIV infect the body?,"'HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'') is spread through contact with genital fluids or blood of an infected person. The spread of ''HIV'' can occur when these secretions come in contact with tissues such as those lining the vagina, anal area, mouth, eyes (the ''mucus'' membranes), or with a break in the skin, such as from a cut or puncture by a needle.''During all stages of infection, billions of ''HIV'' particles (copies) are produced every day and circulate in the blood. This production of virus is associated with a decline (at an inconsistent rate) in the number of CD4 cells in the blood over the ensuing years.''CD4 cells are vital cells of the immune system, and their levels fall as the severity of the ''HIV'' infection increases. ''AIDS'' (''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'') is the end result of unchecked ''HIV'' infection. In ''AIDS'', the immune system collapses, opening the way for opportunistic infections and ''cancers'' to kill the patient.''Although the precise mechanism by which ''HIV'"" infection results in CD4 cell decline is not known, it probably results from a direct effect of the virus on the cell as well as the body's attempt to clear these infected cells from the system. In addition to virus in the blood, there is also virus throughout the body, especially in the ""'lymph nodes'', brain, and genital secretions.''HIV is present to variable degrees in the blood and genital secretions of virtually all untreated individuals infected with HIV, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms.' "
What are the most common ways HIV spreads?,"'The most common ways in which HIV is spreading throughout the world include sexual contact, IV ''drug abuse'' (through sharing needles), and by mother-to-child transmission during ''pregnancy'', ''labor'' (the delivery process), or ''breastfeeding''.' "
Sexual transmission of HIV,"'Sexual transmission of HIV has been described from men to men, men to women, women to men, and women to women through vaginal, anal, and oral sex. The best way to avoid sexual transmission is abstinence from sex until it is certain that both partners in a monogamous relationship are not HIV infected. Because the HIV antibody test can take weeks to turn positive after infection occurs, both partners would need to test negative for at least 12 and up to 24 weeks after their last potential exposure to HIV.''The next best method is the use of latex barriers. This involves placing a ''condom'' on the penis as soon as an erection is achieved in order to avoid exposure to pre-ejaculatory and ejaculatory fluids that contain infectious HIV. For oral sex, ''condoms'' should be used for fellatio (oral contact with the penis) and latex barriers (dental dams) for cunnilingus (oral contact with the vaginal area). A dental dam is any piece of latex that prevents vaginal secretions from coming in direct contact with the mouth. Although such dams occasionally can be purchased, they are most often created by cutting a square piece of latex from a ''condom''.''Recent data has convincingly demonstrated that once a person has virologic suppression in blood after least six months of treatment, their likelihood of transmitting HIV to an uninfected partner, even without ''condoms'', is virtually zero if they continue treatment.' "
HIV spread through infected blood,"'The spread of HIV by exposure to infected blood usually results from sharing needles, as in those used for illicit opioid ''drugs''. HIV also can be spread by sharing needles for ''anabolic steroids'' to increase muscle, tattooing, and body piercing.''To prevent the spread of HIV, as well as other diseases, including ''hepatitis'', needles should never be shared. At the beginning of the HIV epidemic, many individuals acquired HIV infection from blood transfusions or blood products, such as those used for hemophiliacs. Currently, however, because blood is tested for both antibodies to HIV and the actual virus before transfusion, the risk of acquiring HIV from a ''blood transfusion'' in the United States is extremely small and is considered insignificant.' "
Can you get HIV from kissing?,"'There is little evidence that HIV can be transferred by casual exposure, as might occur in a household setting. For example, unless there are open sores or blood in the mouth, kissing is generally considered not to be a risk factor for transmitting HIV. This is because saliva, in contrast to genital secretions, has been shown to contain very little HIV.''Still, theoretical risks are associated with the sharing of toothbrushes and shaving razors because they can cause bleeding, and blood can contain large amounts of HIV. Consequently, these items should not be shared with infected people.''Similarly, without sexual exposure or direct contact with blood, there is little if any risk of HIV contagion in the workplace or classroom.' "
Reducing HIV transmission risk,"""Risk factors for acquiring HIV infection include increased amounts of virus in fluids and/or breaks in the skin or mucous membranes which also contain these fluids. This relates to the viral load in the infected person's blood and genital fluids. If the viral load is high, the risk of transmitting HIV is also high. Conversely, those on effective antiretroviral therapy are less likely to transmit the virus to their partners. In fact, recent data has demonstrated that if a person's plasma viral load is consistently undetectable for at least six months of therapy, the risk of transmitting HIV to their partner is essentially zero, leading to the phrase that “undetectable equals untransmittable.”""'The presence of other ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (for example, ''herpes'' and ''syphilis'') or traumatic sexual activities that damage the mucous membranes also increase the risk of acquiring HIV.''Another risk factor for HIV acquisition by a man is the presence of foreskin. This has most convincingly been demonstrated in high-risk heterosexual men in developing countries where the risk declines after adult male ''circumcision''.' "
Does exposure to blood or genital fluid of an HIV-infected person guarantee I’ll get infected?,"'The risk of HIV transmission occurring after any potential exposure to bodily fluids is poorly defined.''The highest risk sexual activity, however, is thought to be receptive anal intercourse without a condom when the partner is not on antiretroviral therapy. In this case, the risk of infection may be as high as 3%-5% for each exposure. The risk is probably less for receptive vaginal intercourse without a condom and even less for oral sex without a latex barrier.''Despite the fact that no single sexual exposure carries a high risk of contagion, HIV infection can occur after even one sexual event. Thus, people must always be diligent in protecting themselves from potential infection.' "
Is there an HIV vaccine?,"'Historically, the greatest successes in preventing viral illnesses have been the result of the development of preventative ''vaccines''. Unfortunately, decades of research to develop an HIV ''vaccine'' has led to little hope for success. In 2007, a major setback in this area occurred when the STEP study investigating a promising ''vaccine'' candidate was prematurely stopped due to the lack of evidence that it produced any protection from HIV infection.''In contrast, a glimmer of hope did emerge with the report in 2009 of the results of the RV 144 Thai HIV vaccine trial, which demonstrated borderline effectiveness in the more than 16,000 recipients. While this vaccine demonstrated only limited evidence of protection, research is under way to further explore what can be learned for future vaccine development from this modest success.' "
Biological and pharmaceutical HIV prevention strategies,"'Early advances in preventing HIV transmission resulted from educational programs describing how transmission occurs and providing barrier protection for those exposed to genital secretions and new needles or bleach to those exposed to blood by sharing needles. Despite these efforts, new infections in both the developed and developing worlds have continued at high rates. In light of the limited ability of counseling and testing to curb the spread of the HIV pandemic, many researchers have moved toward other biologic strategies for preventing HIV that do not rely solely on people changing their behavior. It is in this area where there has been some success.''During the last 10 years, there were several large studies showing that male ''circumcision'' along with behavioral counseling reduced the risk of heterosexual men acquiring HIV infection. This provides a novel ''prevention'' strategy for at-risk, HIV-uninfected heterosexual men.''Another major advance on the ''prevention'' front came from the HPTN 052 study in which HIV-infected individuals with CD4 cells between 350 cells/mm3 and 550 cells/mm3 who also had uninfected partners were randomly assigned to initiate antiviral therapy or wait until their CD4 cells declined to less than 250 cells/mm3 or they developed symptoms consistent with disease progression. All enrolled individuals were aggressively counseled about continued ''safe sex'' practices, provided condoms, and were monitored for sexual activities. The study ultimately showed that those treated early were more than 96% less likely to transmit to their partner than those who had antiviral treatment deferred. Subsequent cohort studies have shown that those who are virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy for at least six months have essentially no risk of transmitting to uninfected partners, even when not using condoms.' "
PrEP for uninfected individuals at risk for HIV,"'As opposed to treating infected people to protect their uninfected partners, another approach is to provide antiviral treatment to uninfected individuals, so-called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The first success in this research arena came from the CAPRISA 004 study, which showed that vaginal administration before and after intercourse of a gel containing the antiretroviral agent ''tenofovir'' reduced the risk of transmission of both HIV and ''herpes'' simplex virus to heterosexual women. Other studies are under way to confirm the results of this study as well as to determine whether the results are any different if the agent is administered daily rather than simply around the time of intercourse. One such study was not be able to show that once-daily ''tenofovir'' vaginal gel demonstrated protection from infection compared to placebo gel. The reasons for this finding are not completely known, but it does appear that adherence with the therapy was very poor.''In 2010, the iPrEx study reported the results of the first large study testing the effectiveness of PrEP using orally administered therapy, as opposed to topical agents as in the vaginal PrEP studies. In this study, HIV-uninfected men who had sex with men who took TDF/FTC (tenofovir/Emtricitobine) once daily along with a comprehensive program to promote safe-sex practices and early treatment of ''sexually transmitted diseases'' experienced a markedly reduced risk of acquiring HIV compared with those receiving similar prevention practice without TDF/FTC. There are several other studies that have shown that once daily TDF or TDF/FTC have been effective for PrEP in heterosexual men, women, and intravenous drug users. Nevertheless, there are other studies of high-risk HIV-uninfected women that have shown no benefit, with convincing data in both studies demonstrating extremely low levels of treatment adherence with study medications. Based upon the data available, the United States FDA has approved TDF/FTC for use in high-risk HIV-uninfected individuals. When this therapy is utilized, it is clear that people need to be extensively counseled regarding the importance of continued use of condoms as well as diligent screening for HIV infection, acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases, as well as treatment adherence. Treated individuals also need to be made aware of potential side effects of treatment, including gastrointestinal symptoms, kidney damage, and decreases in ''bone mineral density''.''Several novel strategies are being pursued to overcome the difficulty in getting people to adhere to PrEP. This includes studies to see whether treatment can be given less than daily, for example, around risk-taking activities. Other options include long-acting formulations, such as a vaginal ring impregnated with antiviral agents or long-acting intramuscular injections of CAB (cabotegravir), described above under new treatments that could be administered every few months.' "
Emergency antiviral treatment immediately after exposure (PEP),"'A final prevention strategy of last resort is the use of antiretrovirals as post-exposure prophylaxis, so-called ""PEP,"" to prevent infection after a potential exposure to HIV-containing blood or genital secretions.''Animal studies and some human experience suggest that PEP may be effective in preventing HIV transmission, and it is based upon these limited data that current recommendations have been developed for health care workers and people in the community exposed to potentially infectious material. Current guidelines suggest that those experiencing a needle stick or who are sexually exposed to genital secretions of an HIV-infected person should take antiretrovirals for four weeks.''Those individuals considering this type of preventative treatment, however, must be aware that post-exposure treatment cannot be relied upon to prevent HIV infection. Moreover, such treatment is not always available at the time it is most needed and is probably best restricted to unusual and unexpected exposures, such as a broken condom during intercourse. If PEP is to be initiated, it should occur within hours of exposure and certainly within the first several days. Updated guidelines are published and available at https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/.' "
What are the tests for HIV/AIDS?,"'HIV/AIDS'' diagnosis, monitoring and therapy have come a long way from the days when a diagnosis was a death sentence. Crucial parts of the effective treatment regimens developed in the last 40 years are consistent monitoring of the viral load (the amount of virus in the blood), and the immune cell count, which function as biological markers of the disease’s progression.''The sexually-transmitted ''human immunodeficiency virus'' hijacks your cells to produce more of itself. Left unchecked, the virus overwhelms your immune system, making it less effective and bringing it closer to collapse. This progression of the disease leads to ''AIDS'', or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. (So, all people with ''AIDS'' have an ''HIV'' infection, but not all people with ''HIV'' infection have ''AIDS'').''In ''AIDS'', opportunistic bacterial, viral and ''fungal infections'', and a variety of ''cancers'' start attacking the nearly defenseless body.''Treatment with anti-viral therapy has vastly improved since the global ''HIV/AIDS'' epidemic first started. Many with an ''HIV'' diagnosis can now live long and productive lives relatively free of serious symptoms. Still, no one has figured out a cure for ''HIV'', and people who have it need to have some kind of antiviral therapy for the rest of their lives.''Testing of the blood and saliva from the initial diagnosis and throughout the patient’s life is important. Knowing if you have ''HIV'' is crucial so that treatments can begin to protect your immune system and to protect your sexual partners. It is also important for your doctors to order periodic screening to monitor your immune cell count and your viral load to tell how you are responding to treatment.''These tests also show your treatment team whether the specific ''viruses'' in your body have developed an immunity to your drug regimen, alerting your doctor that it’s time to change up your treatment plan.' "
What are the tests to diagnose HIV?,"'In 1985, a blood test became available that measures antibodies to ''HIV'"" that are the body's immune response to the HIV. The test that for decades had been most commonly used for diagnosing infection with HIV was referred to as an ""'ELISA''. If the ''ELISA'' found HIV antibodies, the results needed to be confirmed, typically by a test called a Western blot.''Newer tests look for these same antibodies in saliva. Some provide results within one to 20 minutes of testing. As a result, the FDA has approved home HIV antibody testing that is self-administered using saliva. Antibodies to HIV typically develop within several weeks of infection. During this interval, patients have virus in their body but will test negative by the standard antibody test, the so-called ""window period.''In this setting, the diagnosis can be made if a test is used that actually detects the presence of virus in the blood rather than the antibodies, such as tests for HIV RNA or p24 antigen. Several tests are now approved that measure both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, shrinking the duration of that early window period in which the infection is difficult to detect. In fact, federal guidelines currently recommend that HIV screening tests be performed with these assays and, if they are positive, that a confirmatory antibody test be performed that will determine if the patient has HIV-1, the most common form of HIV circulating around the world, or HIV-2, a related virus that occurs most frequently in Western Africa. If the confirmatory antibody test is negative, then there remains the possibility that the original test detected viral p24 antigen and not antibodies, and therefore infection still is likely. Therefore, the recommendations are that if the confirmatory antibody test is negative a test for HIV RNA test for the presence of virus, should be performed. If the antibody is negative and the viral test is positive, the patient is diagnosed with acute or ''primary HIV infection'' and will develop a positive antibody test over the ensuing weeks.''Although the tests for detecting HIV infection continue to improve, they still require people to volunteer for testing. It is estimated that approximately 15% of those infected with HIV in the United States are unaware of their infection because they have never been tested. In order to decrease the number that are unaware of their HIV infection status, in 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' recommended that all people between 13 and 64 years of age be provided ''HIV testing'' whenever they encounter the health care system for any reason. In addition, resources are available to facilitate people finding local ''HIV testing'' centers (https://gettested.cdc.gov/).' "
What tests do doctors use to monitor HIV?,"'Two blood tests are routinely used to monitor HIV-infected people. One of these tests, which counts the number of CD4 cells, assesses the status of the immune system. The other test, which determines the so-called viral load, directly measures the amount of virus in the blood.''A severe reduction in a type of cell in the blood (CD4 cells) marks the progression from HIV into full-blown ''AIDS''. Your CD4 cells compose an important part of the immune system. These cells, often referred to as T cells, help the body fight infections.''In individuals not infected with HIV, the CD4 count in the blood is normally above 400 cells per mm3 of blood. People generally do not become at risk for HIV-specific complications until their CD4 cells are fewer than 200 cells per mm3. At this level of CD4 cells, the immune system does not function adequately and is considered severely suppressed. A declining number of CD4 cells means that HIV disease is advancing. Thus, a low CD4 cell count signals that the person is at risk for one of the many opportunistic infections that occur in individuals who are immunosuppressed. In addition, the actual CD4 cell count indicates which specific therapies should be initiated to prevent those infections.''The viral load actually measures the amount of virus in the blood and may partially predict whether or not the CD4 cells will decline in the coming months. In other words, those people with high viral loads are more likely to experience a decline in CD4 cells and progression of disease than those with lower viral loads.''In addition, the viral load is a vital tool for monitoring the effectiveness of new therapies and determining when ''drugs'' are and are not working. Thus, the viral load will decrease within weeks of initiating an effective antiviral regimen. If a combination of ''drugs'' is very potent, the number of HIV copies in the blood will decrease by as much as hundredfold, such as from 100,000 to 1,000 copies per mL of blood in the first two weeks and gradually decrease even further during the ensuing 12-24 weeks.''The ultimate goal is to get viral loads to below the limits of detection by standard assays, usually less than 20 to 50 copies per mL of blood. When viral loads are reduced to these low levels, it is believed that the viral suppression will persist for many years as long as the patient consistently takes their medications.' "
What is drug resistance testing?,"'Drug-resistance testing also has become a key tool in the management of HIV-infected individuals. Resistance testing is now routinely used in individuals experiencing poor responses to HIV therapy or treatment failure.''In general, a poor response to initial treatment would include individuals who fail to experience a decline in viral load of approximately hundredfold in the first weeks, have a viral load of greater than 500 copies per mL by week 12, or have levels greater than 50 copies per mL by week 24. Treatment failure would generally be defined as an increase in viral load after an initial decline in a person who is believed to be consistently taking his or her medications.''Because drug-resistant ''viruses'' can be transmitted, guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/) and International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) have suggested that resistance testing be performed in individuals who have never been on therapy to determine if they might have acquired HIV that is resistant to drugs.'""The goals of antiviral therapy are to enhance immunity and delay or prevent clinical advancement to symptomatic disease without inducing important side effects or selecting for drug-resistant virus. Currently, the best marker of a drug's activity is a decrease in the viral load.""""Ideally, prior to initiating treatment, the viral load and the CD4 cell count should be checked and the viral load test then repeated after approximately four weeks of treatment. If the patient is beginning a regimen that includes two to three drugs for which the patient's virus does not appear to be resistant, it is expected that the amount of virus should decrease by at least a hundredfold during this interval.""'The ultimate goal is for the viral load to decrease to undetectable levels which should occur by approximately 12-24 weeks. There are some individuals that despite taking all of their medications correctly will suppress their viral load to less than 200 copies/mL but not consistently undetectable levels. It is not completely known how to optimally manage this situation but many experts would continue to monitor on current therapy as long as viral load remains below 200 copies/mL.''Those who are not having an appropriate response to therapy need to be questioned to make sure that they are taking their medications correctly, and if not, why. If the viral load is not going to undetectable levels and the patient is taking the medications correctly, then it is likely that there is a resistant virus to some of the medications. Drug-resistance testing then should be performed and the patient managed as described in the next section.'""Once the patient's viral load is suppressed, they can often have viral load and CD4 cell counts performed less frequently (for example, every three to four months and in select cases every six months or possibly even less).""""There are currently two main types of resistance tests available in the clinic: one that is called a genotype and the other a phenotype assay. The former looks for mutations in the virus and the latter the actual amount of drug it takes to block infection by the patient's virus.""'The genotype test is very helpful in those being screened for the presence of resistant virus prior to initiating treatment and those experiencing viral rebound on one of their first treatment regimens. The phenotype test is particularly useful in those who are highly treatment experienced and have substantial amounts of ''drug resistance'"", especially to the protease class. The information derived from these tests, along with a tropism test will ultimately tell the provider which of the many approved drugs are likely to be fully active against the specific patient's virus.""'Using this information, the goal is to include at least two and at times preferably three fully active drugs in the next regimen in order to optimize the chances of suppressing the viral load to undetectable levels. It is often useful to seek expert consultation in managing those with multidrug resistant virus.' "
What happens if the viral load increases while on HIV therapy?,"'If the patient does suppress their virus to undetectable levels on antiviral therapy but then develops detectable virus, several things should be considered. First, it must be established that the patient is taking the medications correctly. If they are missing doses, then every effort must be made to understand why this is happening and correct the situation, if possible.''If poor adherence is a result of drug side effects, efforts should be directed toward managing the side effects or changing to a better-tolerated regimen. If poor adherence is occurring because of the medication schedule of dosing, new strategies should be discussed such as placing medications in a pillbox, associating the dosing with certain daily activities such as tooth brushing, or possibly changing the regimen. Finally, if the reason for poor adherence is ''depression'', ''substance abuse'', or another personal issue, these issues need to be addressed and managed.''It is important to remember that sometimes, for reasons not entirely understood, the viral load can briefly increase. Unexpected increases, therefore, require repeated testing of the viral load before any clinical decisions are made. If, however, the viral load is continually detected despite proper adherence to the prescribed therapy, serious consideration must be given to the possibility that the virus has become resistant to one or more of the medications being given, especially if viral load is greater than 200 copies/mL.'""There is now an abundance of data showing that the use of drug-resistance tests can improve the response to a follow-up regimen. Testing can be used to determine if an individual's HIV has become resistant to one or more of the prescribed drugs."" "
How long does a person with HIV live?,"'With early diagnosis and proper treatment, people with ''HIV'' can live a healthy and long life. There is no generalized definitive period for which a person with ''HIV'' can live. In the case of untreated ''HIV'' infection, the overall mortality rate is more than 90%. The average time from infection to death is 8 to 10 years. This may, however, vary from person to person. Many factors that affect survival include:''In the early days, the life expectancy and quality of life were drastically reduced in people with HIV. They would progress to ''AIDS'' within 10 years after which they would hardly live for more than two years.\xa0\xa0''With the advances in diagnosis and treatment, people with HIV infection can be diagnosed and put on an excellent treatment regimen before their immunity declines significantly. They are thus also protected from various opportunistic infections (infections that occur in a person with a weak immune system) and ''cancers''. Moreover, there are good tests available to monitor how well the infection is controlled. This enables timely change in treatment if one treatment regimen does not work well for a person. With the increasing use of ART (anti-retroviral therapy) and the introduction of better antiviral regimens, survival with HIV infection has increased over time. The survival, however, is generally not yet equivalent to that in uninfected individuals.' Genes Mental health Drug or alcohol abuse Superinfection with another HIV strain Nutrition Age Treatment"
Can HIV be cured by natural remedies?,'There is no cure for HIV. It cannot be treated or managed without proper medical therapy. It is important to seek healthcare as soon as a person is exposed to a potential risk of HIV infection. This will facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. It can be dangerous to seek nonscientific and unapproved treatment approaches. This will cause the management more difficult and may even lead to fatal complications.' 
Can HIV be cured?, 
What is the last stage of HIV infection?,"'Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (''AIDS'"") is the final and most severe stage of HIV infection.\xa0 Because HIV has severely damaged the immune system, the body can't fight off opportunistic infections."" If ART is not given, HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer. In some people, however, it may advance faster.  In this stage, HIV reduces CD4 cell counts to very low levels (less than 200 units) which severely damages the immune system. The week immune system cannot fight even those bacteria, viruses, and fungi which are unable to cause disease in other healthy people (opportunistic infections). Opportunistic infections are infections and infection-related cancers that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in people with healthy immune systems.  Once a person progresses to AIDS, they have a high viral load and can transmit HIV to others very easily.  In the absence of treatment, people with AIDS typically survive for about three years."
What drugs treat HIV/AIDS?,"'Though the original ''HIV/AIDS'' pandemic that started in the 1980s killed millions, multiple ''drugs'' regimens have since made ''HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'') a chronic illness rather than an immediately terminal one.''HIV/AIDS'' is an incurable disease primarily transmitted through sexual contact. ''HIV'' attacks the body by harnessing its cells to produce more copies of the virus. Once the amount of virus reaches a certain level, it overwhelms the immune system, leading to full-blown ''AIDS'' (''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome''). In this condition, the infected person typically dies from one of a variety of opportunistic infections or ''cancers'' that attack their nearly defenseless body.''Antiretroviral drugs, the main category of drugs used for treatment of ''HIV'', can block the virus from reproducing itself through targeting different chemicals the virus needs to make copies or perform other functions necessary its life cycle. The drug families used to treat HIV are classified based on what part of the virus’ reproductive process they target.''Nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), for example, block reverse transcriptase. This is an enzyme the virus needs to infect white blood cells. Less reverse transcriptase means fewer newly infected cells. ''Protease inhibitors'', on the other hand, block protease. Protease is crucial for HIV to make copies of itself, so less protease means the virus’ ability to colonize more cells is diminished. These and other drugs are prescribed in combination to attack the virus from various angles, which ideally leads to a more effective treatment with less ''drug resistance'' than single-drug treatment.''The ultimate goal of treatment is getting the viral load (the number of copies of the HIV in a person’s body) down below detectable levels. Periodic blood testing is an important part of therapy; as long as those viral load and antibody levels are below a proscribed range, people with HIV can stave off ''AIDS'' and other serious symptoms. This therapy also offers some protection to the infected person’s sex partner or partners.''People with HIV should note, however, that even when their infections are undetectable through lab tests, the viral load will rebound if they quit therapy or start missing doses. Some infections may also develop resistance to a particular drug cocktail, forcing treatment teams to come up with new regimens to beat back the resurgence of virus in the body.''The following are the different drug types currently used in treatment regimens for HIV:''Antiviral treatment options have primarily included combinations of two NRTIs, often referred to as ""nucs,"" and a third drug, typically being a boosted ''protease inhibitor'', a NNRTI, often called ""non-nucs,"" and integrase strand transfer inhibitors such as RAL, EVG, DTG, or BIC. Many of these drugs are available in fixed-dose combinations as well as increasing numbers of drugs as single-tablet regimens.''This article will describe each family of drugs currently available for standard treatment and control of HIV infections.' nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) protease inhibitors fusion inhibitors CCR5 antagonists integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and entry inhibitors"
What are nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)?,"""NRTIs block an enzyme of the human immunodeficiency virus called reverse transcriptase that allows HIV to infect human cells, particularly CD4 cells or lymphocytes. Reverse transcriptase converts HIV genetic material, which is RNA, into human genetic material, which is DNA. The human-like DNA of HIV then becomes part of the infected person's own cells, allowing the cell to produce RNA copies of the HIV that can then go on to attack other not yet infected cells. Thus, blocking reverse transcriptase prevents HIV from taking over (infecting) human cells.""'In general, most antiviral regimens for HIV disease contain a backbone of at least two NRTIs. The NRTIs include ''zidovudine'' (''Retrovir'', ZDV), ''stavudine'' (''Zerit'', d4T), ''didanosine'' (''Videx'', ddI), ''zalcitabine'' (HIVID, ddC), ''lamivudine'' (''Epivir'', 3TC), ''emtricitabine'' (''Emtriva'', FTC), ''abacavir'' (''Ziagen'', ABC), ''tenofovir'' disoproxil fumarate (''Viread'', TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy, TAF). The latter drug is a new formulation of tenofovir that is now part of multiple fixed-dose combinations. This form of tenofovir has been shown to be equally effective as TDF but with less renal and bone toxicity. The NRTIs FTC and 3TC are highly related compounds and, although data is somewhat limited, most experts agree that they probably can be used interchangeably. That said, many combinations of NRTIs can be used together, with current guidelines generally recommending the fixed-dose combination of TDF with FTC (''Truvada''), or TAF with FTC (Descovy), both of which are also available as part of single tablet regimens. An alternative regimen uses the fixed-dose combination of ABC/3TC (''Epzicom'') alone or combined as a single tablet regimen with DTG (Triumeq). ABC has been associated with severe ''allergic'' reactions in approximately 5% of patients. Recent studies have shown that a blood test (HLA-B*5701) can be performed to determine who is at risk for this reaction so that the drug can be avoided in these individuals and be used in others with greater confidence that there will not be such a reaction. In fact, when available, it is now the standard of care to perform this test prior to initiation of ABC. The main side effects associated with TDF are reduced kidney function and ''bone density''.''The following are available fixed-dose combination pills of NRTIs:''These are standard doses for average-sized adults, and dosing may vary depending upon the weight of a patient. Certain combinations of drugs in this class should generally be avoided, including d4T with ZDV or ddI, 3TC with FTC, and TDF with ddI.''The new formulation of tenofovir (TAF) is available as combination pills only, including EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (Genvoya, 150/150/200/10 mg), FTC/TAF (Descovy, 200/25 mg), TAF/FTC/RPV (Complera, 25/200/25 mg), BIC/FTC/TAF (25/200/25 mg), and ''darunavir'' (DRV)/Cobicistat (COBI)/FTC/TAF (800/150/200/10 mg). The new formulation of tenofovir results in lower plasma levels and higher intracellular concentrations of the active drug. Data demonstrate that compared to TDF-containing regimens this form is equally effective with less adverse effects on ''bone mineral density'' and possibly on the kidneys.' ZDV/3TC (300 mg/150 mg) as Combivir; one twice per day ZDV/3TC/ABC (300 mg/150 mg/300 mg) as Trizivir; one twice per day ABC/3TC (600 mg/300 mg) as Epzicom; one per day TDF/FTC (300 mg/200 mg) as Truvada; one per day TAF/FTC (25 mg/200 mg) as Descovy; one per day"
What are nonnucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)?,"'Like NRTIs, NNRTIs block the reverse transcriptase enzyme, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected.''NNRTIs include ''nevirapine'' (NVP), ''delavirdine'' (DLV), ''efavirenz'' (EFV), etravirine (ETR), rilpivirine (RPV), and doravirine (DOR). ETR was developed specifically to be an option for patients who have developed resistance to the earlier drugs in the class. NVP, DLV, EFV, RPV, and DOR are typically used with two NRTIs, and ETR is primarily being used as part of regimens for those with a history of different types of treatment to which they have developed resistance.''For people without a history of drug resistance, there are now three effective fixed-dose combination pills that include TDF, plus FTC with either EFV (''Sustiva'') or RPV (Complera), or plus 3TC with DOR, all of which are available as a single pill that can be taken once per day. There is also a formulation of TAF plus FTC with RPV (Odefsey). The combination with RPV (Complera) was shown to be very effective and well tolerated but not as good at suppressing the viral load as the combination with EFV (Atripla), particularly amongst those who started therapy with higher viral loads and lower CD4 cell counts (for example, >100,000 copies/mL and <200 cells/mm''3'', respectively). It is currently recommended only for those that have viral load levels of <100,000 copies/mL and CD4 cell counts greater than 200 cells/mm''3''.' "
What are protease inhibitors?,"'PIs'' block the action of an HIV enzyme called protease that allows HIV to produce infectious copies of itself within HIV-infected human cells. Thus, blocking protease prevents HIV in already-infected cells from producing HIV that can infect other, not yet infected cells.''PIs include''Each of these drugs has been shown to effectively reduce the viral load when used in combination with other active drugs.''LPV/r comes coformulated as Kaletra while all other RTV-containing regimens require taking RTV along with the other ''PI''. In the case of TPV, RTV must be given as 200 mg with each dose of TPV twice per day. In contrast, ATV can be given without RTV at a dose of two 200 mg capsules once daily or 300 mg with 100 mg RTV once daily. The latter should always be used in PI-experienced subjects and when used in combination with TDF or NNRTIs which can reduce the drug levels of ATV. Similarly, FPV is also used differently in PI-naïve and experienced individuals. In treatment-naïve individuals, it can be given as two 700 mg tablets twice daily or two 700 mg tablets (1,400 mg total) with either 100 or 200 mg RTV, all once daily. In treatment-experienced patients, or when used with NNRTIs, it should be given as one 700 mg tablet with 100 mg RTV, both twice daily. The most recently approved of the PIs is DRV, which was initially used exclusively in treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant virus. In this setting, it is given as 600 mg with 100 mg RTV, both given twice daily. More recently, DRV was approved for those who have never been treated before given at a dose of 800 mg once daily with 100 mg of RTV once daily.''Although RTV is approved for treatment of HIV-infected patients at a dose of 600 mg twice daily, it is virtually never used at this dose because of severe side effects. Because of this, it is not included in the above table. However, PIs are frequently dosed with low doses of RTV. RTV delays the clearance of the other drugs from the system, making them easier to take and more effective. The dose of RTV varies depending upon which drugs it is being taken with and how it is being administered. The only PI that is not substantially affected by RTV is NFV. Another recently approved boosting agent is COBI which has no anti-HIV activity but can be given with once daily ATV or DRV as an alternative to RTV for pharmacologic boosting. There are also fixed-dose combinations of each, for example, ATV 300 mg combined with COBI 150 mg (Evotaz) and DRV 800 mg combined with COBI 150 mg (Prezcobix). A single-tablet formulation is now also available with DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF (800/150/200/10 mg) once daily.' saquinavir (Invirase and Fortovase, SQV), which comes as the hard gel capsule Invirase (INV), ritonavir (Norvir, RTV), indinavir (Crixivan, IDV), nelfinavir (Viracept, NFV), fosamprenavir (Lexiva, FPV), lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, LPV/r), atazanavir (Reyataz, ATV), and tipranavir (Aptivus, TPV), darunavir (Prezista, DRV)."
What are fusion inhibitors?,"'A fusion inhibitor blocks an early step in the viral life cycle. Enfuvirtide (''Fuzeon'', T-20) attaches to the envelope surrounding the virus and prevents it from entering the CD4 cells. This prevents the infection of CD4 cells by HIV. T-20 is the first approved drug in this class. It is given as a twice-daily subcutaneous injection (90 mg). It is used primarily in individuals who have developed resistance to other classes of drugs in order to create a new potent combination. Like all other antivirals, it is most useful in those taking other active drugs at the same time in order to optimize the chance of getting viral loads to undetectable levels and to prevent the development of drug resistance.' "
What is a CCR5 antagonist?,"'The only available drug in this class is called ''maraviroc'' (''Selzentry'', MVC), which is now approved for use in combination therapy in treatment-experienced and naïve patients who do not have detectable CXCR4-using virus as determined by a tropism assay. This is a unique drug in a new class that blocks viral entry by interacting with the CCR5 molecule on the surface of the CD4 cell. It is known that HIV first binds to the CD4 molecule on the surface of CD4 cells and then connects with the CCR5 or CXCR4 molecule. Only after this second step is the virus able to enter the cell. The CCR5 antagonist prevents ''viruses'' that use CCR5 from getting into the cell. What is unique about this drug compared to others is that 20%-50% of patients have viruses that are able to use the CXCR4 receptor. In these cases, CCR5 antagonists do not appear to be active at suppressing virus. Therefore, in order to know if the drug will work for a given patient, a new test needs to be performed, the so-called tropism assays. This test will tell the provider and patient whether there is virus that uses CXCR4, in which case the patient would not be a candidate for MVC, or if they only have viruses that use CCR5, in which case MVC should be an active drug. Without tropism results, it is impossible to know whether MVC will be an active drug for a given patient.''MVC is typically dosed at either 300 mg or 150 mg twice daily, depending upon what other drugs it is given with. If the patient is taking any RTV, then they would usually receive the 150 mg dose. If RTV is not being used as part of the regimen, they would generally receive the 300 mg dose and sometimes even higher if it is being used with drugs like ETR. HIV providers are aware that whenever using any anti-HIV medications attention must be given to possible ''drug interactions''.' "
What is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor?,"'The first available drug in this class was RAL, which is very potent at suppressing HIV in all patients who have never been on this drug or others in the class. It was initially approved for treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant virus. It is also now approved for those starting therapy for the first time. The approved dose of RAL is 400 mg twice daily with a newer formulation that can be given to those starting therapy for the first time or stably suppressed on RAL twice daily that can be given as two 600 mg tablets once daily. As noted above, a second drug in this class, EVG, is approved for use as first-line therapy as part of the fixed-dose combination pill of TDF/FTC/COBI/EVG and more recently TAF/FTC/COBI/EVG as a stand-alone drug for use in treatment-experienced patients combining it with a ritonavir-boosted PI. This drug is well tolerated and given as one pill per day, but unlike RAL it does need to be taken with food and it has interactions with other drugs since it must be used with RTV or COBI, so it must be used with caution in those on multiple medications. Another InSTI, DTG is currently recommended for those starting therapy for the first time with either TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC and is available as a fixed-dose combination of ABC/3TC/DTG that can be given as a single pill per day. This drug has a limited number of drug-drug interactions and is generally well tolerated with resistance rarely emerging in those experience virologic failure. It is also frequently active in those who have developed InSTI resistance to RAL and EVG, although it often needs to be given in this setting at a dose of 50 mg twice daily. The most recently approved InSTI is called bictegravir (BIC) that has few drug-drug interactions, is potent, well-tolerated, and can be given with or without food. It is only available as a single-tablet regimen as BIC/FTC/TAF. Thus far, data suggests that selection of drug resistance in those starting therapy with this regimen is extremely rare.''Two large studies recently demonstrated that in those with viral loads less than 500,000 copies/mL a regimen of DTG plus 3TC was as effective in suppressing viral after one year as the traditional regimen of DTG with two NRTIs. This regimen will likely soon be available as a single-tablet regimen for initial therapy in those without chronic ''hepatitis B'', no underlying drug resistance, and viral loads less than 500,000 copies/mL.''There are now 10 approved combination pills that allow for a full regimen to be taken as a single pill once per day, so called single tablet regimens. This includes the following NRTI plus third drug combinations:' TDF/FTC/EFV (300/200/600 mg) as Atripla TDF/FTC/RPV (300/200/25 mg) as Complera TAF/FTC/RPV (25/200/25 mg) as Odefsey TDF/FTC/EVG/COBI (300/200/150/150 mg) as Stribild TAF/FTC/EVG/COBI (25/200/150/150 mg) as Genvoya ABC/3TC/DTG (600/300/50 mg) as Triumeq BIC/FTC/TAF (50/200/10) as Biktarvy DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF (800/150/200/10) as Symtuza DOR/3TC/TDF (100/300/300) as Delstrigo DTG/RPV (50/25) as Juluca, which is only approved for those stably suppressed on an alternative regimen with no history of drug resistance"
What is an entry inhibitor?,"'A monoclonal antibody called ibalizumab (Trogarzo) binds the CD4 molecule (a receptor for HIV on cells), which prevents viral entry into the cell. Medical professionals administer the drug as an intravenous infusion of 2,000 mg once, then two weeks later at 2,000 mg again, followed by 800 mg every two weeks. It is appropriate for heavily treatment-experienced patients with multidrug resistant virus who need new therapeutic options in order to achieve an undetectable viral load.' "
"What 
HIV drugs are in development?","'There are many drugs currently in development that may simplify therapy and provide important options for those who have developed extensive drug resistance. Drugs that show promise in early ''clinical trials'' are often made available by the manufacturer to certain individuals with approval of the FDA. In particular, these drugs are used in individuals who are no longer responding or able to tolerate currently available agents. The next drugs likely to be approved for use will be long-acting injectable formulation of RPV in development along with a long-acting new InSTI called cabotegravir (CAB). An early stage study showed that the combination of short-acting RPV and CAB was able to maintain virologic suppression in those with a suppressed viral load. A follow-up study showed maintenance of suppression with the long-acting regimen given intramuscularly once monthly and every other month. There are three large studies under way to definitively address safety and efficacy of this regimen given either monthly or every other month.' "
What is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"'HIV is short for ''human immunodeficiency virus''. This virus causes the ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' or ''AIDS'"". HIV is a complicated virus. It reproduces primarily in specialized cells of the body's immune system called CD4 lymphocytes. During HIV replication, the CD4 cells are destroyed. As more and more cells die, the body loses the ability to fight many infections. If the number of CD4 cells in the bloodstream falls below 200 per cubic millimeter, or if some other special health conditions occur, the person is defined as having ""'AIDS''. These special health conditions include infections and ''cancers'' that take advantage of the suppressed immune system. Regardless of the CD4 count, people with HIV infection carry the virus and can spread it to others through unprotected sex or contact with blood or some other body fluids.''Undiagnosed HIV infection is responsible for continued transmission, even in up to one-third of transmissions in the U.S. Of 1.2 million estimated cases in individuals over 13 years of age as of December 2012 (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] estimates), about 15% of them are likely to be unaware of their infection. Thus, an HIV test is important to diagnose those who are newly infected, to identify previously unrecognized infections, and to relieve the minds of those who are not infected. HIV testing also reduces the risk of transmission during ''pregnancy'', blood transfusions, and tissue transplantation.''The CDC recommends a routine HIV test for adolescent and adult patients aged 13 to 64 in all health care settings, of all women during ''pregnancy'', and the newborns of HIV-positive women. Thus, HIV testing is now part of routine medical practice, similar to tests that screen for other diseases. In 2006, the CDC recommended eliminating written HIV-specific consent for testing in health care facilities in order to reduce unwarranted stigma and encourage screening. HIV test consent is included with general medical consent forms, and patients are informed that HIV testing will be performed as routine unless they decline (opt-out screening). As of January 2015, all states but Nebraska had adopted routine opt-out HIV testing.''People who are at high risk for acquiring HIV should undergo annual HIV testing. Sometimes, health care professionals request or require testing as part of evaluation and treatment for other conditions, such as women undergoing treatment with assisted reproductive technologies for ''infertility'' or treatment of ''viral hepatitis''. There is increasing concern that not enough people are being tested. Events such as National HIV Testing Day have raised awareness and increased participation in testing.''In some cases, HIV testing may be required by law. This occurs for blood used for transfusions, organ donors, and military personnel. States may select additional populations for mandatory testing, such as prisoners or newborns.' "
What are the different types of HIV testing?,"'There are three main types of HIV tests: antibody tests, RNA (viral load) tests, and a combination test that detects both antibodies and viral protein called p24 (antibody-antigen test, or HIV Ab-Ag test). All tests are designed to detect HIV-1, which is the type of HIV in the United States. Some antibody tests and the combination test can also detect HIV-2 infections, which are usually limited to West Africa. No test is perfect; tests may be falsely positive or falsely negative or impossible to interpret (indeterminate, see below).'""Positive test results are reportable to the health department in all 50 states and include the patient's name. This information is then reported to the CDC (without names) so that the epidemiology and infection spread rates can be monitored. The names sent to the state remain confidential and will not be reported to employers, family members, or other such people. Some states allow ""'anonymous testing'"" in which the patient's name is not recorded.""'HIV antibody tests'': HIV possesses many unique proteins on its surface and inside the virus itself. When someone is infected with HIV, their body produces proteins designed to tag the virus for elimination by the immune system. These proteins are called antibodies, and they are directed against the unique proteins of HIV. Unfortunately, these HIV antibodies do not eliminate the virus, but their presence serves as a marker to show that someone is infected with HIV. HIV antibody tests are the most commonly used tests to determine if someone has HIV.''Antibody testing is usually done on a blood sample, often using an enzyme-linked assay called an ''ELISA'"" or EIA. In this test, a person's serum is allowed to react with virus proteins that have been produced in the laboratory. If the person has been infected with HIV, the antibodies in the serum will bind to the HIV proteins, and the extent of this binding can be measured. Negative EIA results are usually available in a day or so.""""There are some rapid HIV testing kits on the market that can be used in a health care professional's office or other points of care. Most of these kits still require blood to be drawn, although it can be done using a simple ""'finger stick'' in some cases.''Home-testing is also possible and may be more convenient for some individuals. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System was the first home testing kit approved by the U.S. FDA in 1996. The test involves pricking a finger, adding a drop of blood to a test strip, and mailing the sample to a laboratory. Users received results by phone using an anonymous code. Home Access Corporation discontinued sales in December 2018. The OraQuick In-Home HIV test kit was FDA-approved in 2013. As of 2019, it is the only home HIV test that is FDA-approved in the U.S. It is sold online or in drug stores. The advantage of OraQuick is that it tests for antibodies in saliva (oral fluid) instead of blood, and users can read the results within 20-40 minutes at home. Users obtain their oral fluid by swabbing their gums.''Both blood and saliva testing are 99.9% accurate at predicting that there is no HIV in the sample. But because levels of HIV are higher in blood than saliva, the saliva test is slightly more likely to miss HIV in saliva (91.7% accurate) than in blood (99.7% accurate). Thus, OraQuick might miss HIV virus (false-negative test) in about one in 10 people, especially if performed soon after infection. A person who strongly suspects a recent HIV infection should get a more sensitive blood test performed by a lab. (See HIV antibody-antigen [Ab-Ag] test.)'""Because there is a small chance that a person's antibodies will falsely attach to the non-HIV proteins during the test, a second, more specific test is done on all initially positive antibody tests. This second test is called the Western blot test. In this test, the HIV proteins are separated by size and electric charge and the person's serum is layered on the test strip. If the test is positive, a series of bands are detected that indicate specific binding of the person's antibody to specific HIV virus proteins. This test is only done to follow up an initially positive screening test. It is not as helpful when performed on its own.""'HIV RNA tests'"": The HIV RNA is different than all human RNA, and tests have been developed to detect HIV RNA in a person's blood. Because this test can be used to estimate the amount of circulating HIV in the blood, it is often referred to as an HIV viral load. This uses a type of test called a ""'polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR''). These tests are important for ''newborn'' screening of HIV-positive mothers since maternal antibody may cross the placenta and be present in the ''newborn''. These tests may also be helpful in detecting HIV infection in the first four weeks following exposure, before antibodies have had time to develop. However, they are costly and are not routinely used to screen for infection.''HIV antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) test'': The HIV Ab-Ag test detects antibodies directed against HIV-1 or HIV-2, as well as a protein called p24, which forms part of the core of the virus (an antigen of the virus). This is important because it takes weeks for antibodies to form after the initial infection, even though the virus (and the p24 protein) is present in the blood. Thus, Ab-Ag testing may allow for earlier detection of HIV infections. Preliminary studies suggest that diagnosis could be made an average of one week earlier using the Ab-Ag test, compared to antibody testing alone. The test uses a reaction known as ""chemiluminescence"" to detect antibodies and p24 protein antigen. In other words, if either the antibody or the antigen is present, the test reaction emits light that registers on a detector. There is only one currently approved antibody-antigen test, the Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo assay. If this test is positive, it is recommended it be repeated. Tests that remain positive are confirmed with Western blot as described above.' "
How long does it take to get results back from an HIV test?,"""Results from antibody tests that are sent to a laboratory usually take one to three days to return, but this varies depending on the test, the laboratory, and whether it is a home test kit. If the test is positive, results may be delayed while the laboratory does a Western blot to be sure that HIV antibody is present. Western blot tests take only one day to perform, but some laboratories may not run the test every day. Results from rapid tests done in the health care professional's office or at other points of care are usually available in 15-20 minutes. If the rapid test is positive, it is still necessary to send blood to a laboratory for a Western blot to confirm that the rapid test result is correct. Home tests are mailed to a laboratory, and results return in one to two weeks, depending on the manufacturer's instructions. RNA testing results usually take a few days to a week depending on the lab."" "
Is counseling offered with HIV testing?,"'Each state establishes requirements for HIV counseling. Most states have supported an opt out testing program in which people are recommended to have HIV testing but may opt out if they choose. Such programs should include counseling about HIV, including prevention of infection, the meaning of the HIV test, and the need for appropriate follow-up. Opt-out programs have resulted in earlier diagnosis of many people with HIV.''HIV testing may sometimes be done if a health care worker or first responder (police officer, fireman, emergency medical technician, etc.) has significant exposure to the blood or body fluid from an identifiable person. In this situation, testing without consent is available in most states. All blood and plasma donors, some prisoners, and some military personnel are tested for HIV.' "
How accurate is an HIV test? What is the window period for an HIV test?,"""The current testing protocols are highly accurate but not perfect. The probability of a false result on the test depends on the test and on the person's risk factors for getting infected. The lower the risk of getting HIV, the higher the probability of a false- positive result.""'Falsely negative tests occur in people who are truly infected with HIV but have negative tests. Among 1,000 people who are truly infected, rapid tests will be falsely negative in zero to six people, depending on the test. Negative antibody tests in people infected with HIV may occur because antibody concentrations are low or because antibodies have not yet developed. On average, antibodies take about four weeks to reach detectable levels after initial infection, and falsely negative tests may occur during this so-called HIV window period. Individuals with negative tests and who had high risk for HIV exposure should be retested in two to three months.''Falsely positive tests occur when uninfected people have positive results. Among 1,000 people who do not have disease, rapid tests will be falsely positive in zero to nine people, depending on the test. This is the main reason for not relying on a single positive test for diagnosis. As discussed above, all positive initial tests must be confirmed with a follow-up test (Western blot). When both tests are positive, the likelihood of a person being HIV infected is >99%. Sometimes, the Western blot may be indeterminate, meaning that it is neither positive nor negative. In these cases, the tests are usually repeated at a later date or an RNA test is done.' "
Is HIV testing necessary for pregnant women?,"'HIV testing is critically important for ''pregnant'' women. HIV testing is recommended at the beginning of each pregnancy during ''prenatal care''. If any HIV risk factors are present or there is a high incidence of HIV in the population, testing should be repeated in the ''third trimester''. There have been enormous advances in the treatment of HIV-infected pregnant women. With proper management, the probability of transmitting the virus to the fetus is less than 2%. Without proper management, the risk of transmission is as high as 33%. Because undiagnosed HIV is so common, it is necessary to test all pregnant women. It is strongly recommended that all children born to women with HIV also be tested.' "
"Where can 
people find free HIV testing locations?","'The CDC maintains a list of HIV testing locations for people who want to find out whether they have contracted the virus. This National HIV and ''STD'' Testing Resource can be accessed at ''http://www.hivtest.org''. This site includes the ability to search for free testing locations as well as locations that provide rapid tests. Some clinics only provide HIV testing. However, ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') clinics routinely provide HIV testing along with testing for diseases like ''chlamydia'', ''gonorrhea'', ''syphilis'', and ''herpes''.' "
Where can people find more information about HIV testing?,"'There are several resources for people interested about the facts of HIV testing.''The CDC web site is also an excellent source of information: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/testing.html.' The national HIV, STD, and hepatitis testing site Get Tested helps visitors find free, fast, and confidential testing."
What are causes and risk factors for HIV and AIDS?,"'The cause for HIV infection is the human immunodeficiency virus; it is spread by person-to-person contact mainly by body fluids during unprotected sex and/or the use of needles contaminated with the human immunodeficiency virus. Other less frequent ways HIV is transmitted are through contaminated blood or tissue during a transfusion or transplant, to a fetus by an infected mother, or to an infant via ''breast milk'' from an infected mother.'""The cause of AIDS is infection by human immunodeficiency viruses that eventually damage the person's immune system so severely that the person develops additional medical problems like opportunistic infections or cancers.""'The risk factors for HIV and AIDS include''However, AIDS has an additional risk factor; it is increased in people who do not treat HIV infection or live in areas where there is an epidemic or endemic presence of HIV infections without good treatment centers available (for example, in sub-Saharan Africa).' unprotected sexual contact, using contaminated needles, mother-to-child transmission, having a large number of sexual partners, a history of sexually transmitted diseases, and receipt of blood transfusions before 1985 in the U.S."
What are the signs and symptoms of HIV and AIDS?,"'The initial infection by a human immunodeficiency virus strain may or may not produce symptoms. Acute HIV infections may cause ''flu-like symptoms'' about two to four weeks after infection. HIV infections may produce ''flu-like'' illness with ''fever'', ''weakness'', and a generalized ''rash''. ''Enlarged lymph nodes'"" commonly occur and are often the first indication of HIV infection. There are no specific physical findings for HIV infections; the patient's history is important because if they have had exposure to any risk factors as described above, the doctor will probably do some additional tests for HIV infection, which are listed below.""'AIDS signs and symptoms may include all of the above because these patients are infected first with human immunodeficiency virus. However, AIDS signs and symptoms are more severe and can result in recurrent life-threatening infections with opportunistic viruses and bacteria and/or cancers with worsening symptoms if the patient has additional medical problems like ''diabetes''. In addition, patients can develop AIDS-associated ''dementia'', ''encephalopathy'', and a wasting syndrome (severe ''weight loss'' and ''diarrhea'').' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose HIV and AIDS?,"'Screening tests are recommended for patients who are at risk for developing HIV and AIDS.''Antibody tests were traditionally used to diagnose HIV. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (''ELISA'') blood test was used for screening for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus as evidence of infection. Another blood test, the Western blot assay, was then used to confirm HIV infections.''There are also ''newer combined HIV tests'"" that can detect HIV infection up to 20 days earlier than antibody screening tests. These are called combined antigen/antibody tests that look for the presence of a protein called p24 that's part of the virus that shows up two to four weeks after infection, as well as HIV antibodies. These combined tests are now recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).""'Another type of diagnostic test, the nucleic acid test (NAT), identifies the genetic material of the human immunodeficiency virus. The NAT can detect HIV infection about seven to 28 days after infection with HIV, but these tests are very expensive and not used for routine HIV screening.''If a person is diagnosed with an HIV infection, health care providers suggest the patient be screened for additional infectious diseases (for example, ''syphilis'', ''cytomegalovirus'', tuberculosis, and others) and/or other diseases that might indicate AIDS.''The diagnosis of AIDS is more complex than HIV diagnosis. One major blood test for the diagnosis of AIDS is the CD4 T-cell count. Human immunodeficiency viruses can destroy an immune cell type termed CD4 cells, a T-cell type in our immune system. When an HIV-infected patient has a CD-4 cell count of <200/µl, they are considered to have AIDS; when CD4 counts reach these low levels, patients often show one or more of the symptoms or signs (sometimes termed as an AIDS-defining illness) for AIDS listed above.' "
What are treatments and medications for HIV and AIDS?,"""Treatments and medications are best managed by an infectious disease consultant who will design a treatment program for the individual's problems. In general, all patients with a history of AIDS with a low CD4 count should be treated with antiviral ""'drugs''. You and your physicians should discuss treatment and/or medication options that will best fit your circumstances.' "
What is the prognosis of HIV and AIDS?,"'In patients with untreated human immunodeficiency virus infections, the overall prognosis is poor, with life span ranging about eight to 10 years after initial infection. Once the infection has progressed and the diagnosis of AIDS occurs, the survival time is about two years in untreated patients. However, remarkable progress has taken place since HIV infections became common worldwide; treatment with antiviral drug therapy has increased survival times. In addition, aggressive antiviral therapy can delay the onset of AIDS for many years. Consequently, treated individuals have a much better chance for a relatively ''longer life'' span and better prognosis if they undergo and adhere to therapeutic protocols. Individuals with HIV can live a long time; however, their life spans average somewhat less than normal. Future treatments may allow an HIV-infected person to live a normal life span.' "
Is it possible to prevent HIV and AIDS?,"'It is possible to prevent HIV and AIDS by avoiding all of the risk factors that result in transmission of the virus. For example, drug users should never share needles. Medical personnel need to follow disease-control methods for disposal of medical instruments and needles. ''Safe sex'' practices with sexual partners who have HIV infection are some of the methods to prevent both HIV and AIDS.''According to the CDC, there is no ''vaccine'' currently available to prevent HIV and/or AIDS. However, research is going on to develop a vaccine; a vaccine trial termed HVTN 072 is currently under way to determine if an experimental vaccine regimen can safely prevent HIV infection among South-African adults. Positive results from this trial would be an important step forward in prevention of HIV and AIDS.' "
What are hives (urticaria) and angioedema? What do hives look like?,"'Hives (medically known as urticaria) appear on the skin as wheals that are red, very ''itchy'', smoothly elevated areas of skin often with a blanched center. They appear in varying shapes and sizes, from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter anywhere on the body.''It is estimated that 20% of all people will develop urticaria at some point in their lives. Hives are more common in women than in men. One hallmark of hives are their tendency to change size rapidly and to move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours. An individual ''hive'' usually lasts no longer than 24 hours. An outbreak that looks impressive, even alarming, first thing in the morning can be completely gone by noon, only to be back in full force later in the day. Very few skin diseases occur and then resolve so rapidly. Therefore, even if you have no evidence of hives to show the doctor when you get to the office for examination, the diagnosis can be established based upon the accurate recounting of your symptoms and signs. Because hives fluctuate so much and so fast, it is helpful to bring along a photograph of what the outbreak looked like at its most severe point.''Swelling deeper in the skin that may accompany hives is called ''angioedema''. This swelling of the hands and ''feet'', as well as the face (lips or eyelids), can be as dramatic as it is brief.'  "
What causes hives and angioedema? Are hives contagious? Does stress cause hives?,"'Hives appear when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells, which are normally found in the skin. Histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels, leading to swelling in the skin.''Hives are very common and are not considered ''contagious''. Although annoying, hives usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious. Some hives may be caused by an\xa0''allergic reaction''\xa0to such things as foods, infections by different organisms, medications, food coloring, preservatives and ''insect stings'' or bites, and chemicals; but in the majority of cases, no specific cause is ever found. Although people may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives, maneuvers like changing ''diet'', soap, detergent, and ''makeup'' are rarely helpful in preventing hives unless there is an excellent temporal relationship. Since hives most often are produced by an immune mechanism, the condition is not contagious. If an infectious disease were the cause of hives in a particular person then it is possible, but not likely, that an infected contact could develop hives.''Having hives may cause ''stress'', but ''stress'' by itself does not cause hives.' "
What are the different kinds of hives?,"""Hives fall into two categories on the basis of the time they have been present: acute urticaria (ordinary hives, which resolve after six to eight weeks) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (that continues longer than six to eight weeks). Since hives are so common and acute urticaria, by definition, resolves spontaneously, physicians do not generally expend much time or expense to evaluate the cause of hives of less than eight weeks' duration."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of ordinary hives?,"'Symptoms of ordinary hives flare up suddenly and usually for no specific reason. Welts appear, often in several places. The welts may be skin-colored, pink, or red, and they flare, ''itch'', cause swelling, and go away in a matter of a few minutes to hours, only to appear elsewhere. This sequence may go on from days to weeks. Most episodes of hives last less than six weeks. Although that cutoff point is arbitrary, cases of hives that last more than six weeks are often called chronic hives.'  "
What are the risk factors and causes of ordinary hives?,"'As noted above, many cases of ordinary hives are ""idiopathic,"" meaning no cause is known. Others may be triggered by ''allergic'' reactions or viral infections. A few may be caused by medications, usually when they have been taken for the first time a few weeks before. (It is less likely for ''drugs'' taken continuously for long periods to cause hives but certainly not impossible.) When a medication is implicated as a cause of hives, the drug must be stopped, since testing is rarely available to confirm the cause. In most cases, drug-induced hives will go away in a few days. If a drug is stopped and the hives do not go away, this is a strong indication that the medication was not the cause of the hives.''Some medications, like morphine, ''codeine'', ''aspirin'', and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'', such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'']), cause the body to release histamine and produce urticaria through nonallergic mechanisms. People with urticaria should avoid these medications.''Despite the reputation of hives being an ""allergic"" condition, there is often no obvious connection to any provoking substance. In this situation, random ''allergy'' testing is not usually helpful. If you know what is causing your hives, then avoiding the cause, if possible.' "
What are the causes of chronic hives?,"'Chronic hives (defined as lasting six weeks or more) can last from months to years. The evaluation of this condition is difficult, and ''allergy'' testing and other laboratory tests are only occasionally useful in such cases. The accurate evaluation of this condition requires the patient to give his or her physician precise information regarding their complete medical history, personal habits, and oral intake. Occasionally, it may be necessary to limit specific foods or drugs (potential allergens) for a time to observe any affect upon the skin condition. Certain systemic diseases and infections, including parasitic infestations, may occasionally present in the skin as hives. If an inciting cause can be determined, then specific treatments for that condition ought to be effective, or in the case of ''food allergies'' or ''drug allergy'', strict avoidance would be necessary. There are additionally rare forms of chronic urticaria that are produced when the patient makes antibodies against molecules on the surface of their own mast cells. There are tests available to identify this type of hives.''Physical urticaria (for example, heat hives) is a type of chronic urticaria produced by physical stimuli. Common environmental provocations such as sunlight (solar urticaria), water, cold, heat, ''exercise'', and pressure occasionally induce hives. Dermatographism, which literally means ""skin writing,"" is a common cause of physical urticaria. This is an exaggerated form of what happens to anyone when their skin is scratched or rubbed; a red welt appears at the site of the scratch. In dermatographism, raised, itchy red welts with adjacent flares appear wherever the skin is scratched or where belts and other articles of clothing rub against the skin, causing mast cells to leak histamine.''Another common form of physically induced hives is called cholinergic urticaria. This produces hundreds of small, itchy ''bumps''. These occur within 15 minutes of ''exercise'' or physical exertion and are usually gone before a doctor can examine them. This form of hives happens more often in young people.' "
Are there conditions or other causes that mimic hives?,"'There are other ''rashes'' that may look like hives, but the fact that they remain stable and do not resolve within 24 hours is helpful in distinguishing them from hives. Such ''rashes'' may need to have a small specimen of skin removed and examined under the microscope (biopsy) to accurately determine the nature of the skin disease.''If hives are making it difficult to ''sleep'', then it may be necessary to see a physician. This would be especially important if you are taking nonprescription antihistamines. If your hives last longer than two months, it is also likely you will benefit from visiting a physician.' "
What specialists treat hives?,'Some family physicians or internists may feel comfortable caring for patients with chronic urticaria. Most dermatologists and allergists are able to care for patients with urticaria.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose and evaluate chronic urticaria?,"'Blood tests, including a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR, a marker of inflammation), are all that is typically recommended for evaluation.' "
What are hives treatment options and home remedies?,"'The goal of treating most cases of ordinary acute urticaria is to relieve symptoms while the condition goes away by itself. The most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines, which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. The main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness.''Many antihistamines are available without prescription, such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), taken in doses of 25 milligrams, and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), taken in a dose of 4 milligrams. These can be taken up to three times a day, but because these medications can cause drowsiness, they are often taken at bedtime. Those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration.''Loratadine'' (''Claritin'', 10 milligrams) and ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra'') are antihistamines available over the counter that are less likely to cause drowsiness (non-sedating). Also approved for ''over-the-counter'' use is ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax, ''Vistaril''), which causes drowsiness, and its breakdown product, ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec'', 10 milligrams), which is less sedating.''Antihistamines that require a prescription include ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''), which tends to cause drowsiness. A prescription ''antihistamine'' that causes little sedation is levocetirizine (Xyzal). Sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called H2 blockers, such as ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac'') and ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''). This antihistamine list is not exhaustive. Physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response.''Oral steroids (''prednisone'', [''Medrol'']) can help severe cases of hives in the short term, but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. Other treatments have been used for urticaria as well, including ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ultraviolet ''radiation'', antifungal antibiotics, agents that suppress the immune system, and ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (''amitriptyline'' [''Elavil'', ''Endep''], ''nortriptyline'' [''Pamelor'', Aventyl], ''doxepin'' [Sinequan, Adapin]). Evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. In ordinary cases, they are rarely needed. A new treatment now indicated for chronic urticaria is the monthly subcutaneous injection of a monoclonal antibody, ''omalizumab'' (''Xolair''), directed against the IgE receptor on human mast cells.''Topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. They include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce ''itching''. Some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor, menthol, diphenhydramine, and ''pramoxine''. Many of these topical preparations require no prescription. Cortisone-containing creams (steroids), even strong ones requiring a prescription, are not very helpful in controlling the ''itch'' of hives.''Applying cool compresses may help soothe the itch of an urticarial\xa0''rash''.'  "
What is the prognosis of hives?,"'To know exactly what kind of hives one has, or to learn more about research into the immune basis of hives or about rarer forms of this condition, consult a physician. It is important, however, to keep in mind that most cases of urticaria are annoying, not serious, and almost always temporary.' "
Are hives (urticaria) contagious?,"'Hives'' are a particular ''rash'"" that's characterized by ""'itchy'', raised, whitish or pinkish welts on the skin. They may occur on one area of the body, such as the stomach or arms, or occur all over the body. Hives ''rash'' is triggered by the release of histamine in the skin and is caused by an ''allergic'' response. A wide variety of foods, medicines, conditions, and chemicals can cause hives, including foods (such as strawberries and seafood), ''drugs'' (such as ''penicillin'' and sulfa), and infections (viral, bacterial, and parasites). Frequently, the agent that triggers a hives rash is not detected. Hives are also known as ''urticaria''.''Hives themselves are not ''contagious'' unless they contain agents such as ''viruses'' that can be transmitted from an infected individual to another. The vast majority of hives are not contagious. Hives occur more frequently in children and in females. In general, hives decrease and disappear within about 24-48 hours if the affected individual is no longer exposed to the allergic agent. If hives last longer than days or weeks, they may be termed chronic ''urticaria''.'  "
How long will it be before someone knows if he or she is going to get hives?,"""Because hives are response to a large number of different triggering agents, most people don't know if they're going to get hives until they encounter the agent. Sometimes hives occur rapidly within a few minutes to hours after contacting the triggering agent. Other times hives may take longer to develop. About 70% of patients who develop hives initially do not know when they encountered the triggering agent. Often the triggering agent is not identified. Some patients know immediately if they're going to get hives if they inadvertently contact the triggering agent that has caused them to develop hives in the past. ""'Pregnant'' women are at increased risk of developing hives.' "
When will someone no longer get hives?,"'Hives are not contagious but result from an agent that is not normally in the body that triggers an allergic response. Individuals who become desensitized to substances that used to trigger hives will no longer get them. This may occur as the patient gets older or by desensitization procedures by a specialty physician (immunologist or dermatologist). Alternatively, individuals who know their triggers will no longer get hives if they avoid them (for example, avoiding foods or medicines that are known to cause hives in a particular individual).' "
How do hives spread?,"'Hives are not contagious and are not spread from person to person. For an individual affected by hives, the rash can occur in localized areas or over many areas such as the chest, back, and extremities. For some individuals, the stronger the allergic response, the more quickly and widespread over the body hives may be. ''Antihistamines'' such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') or ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax) may prevent or reduce spread of hives an individual. Epinephrine may be used in treating severe hives.' "
What specialists treat hives?,"'Most patients who develop hives will need no medical treatment. Although pediatricians and primary care physicians can treat hives, sometimes some specialists are needed. Specialists who often treat hives are emergency-medicine specialists, dermatologists, and ''allergy'' and immunology specialists.' "
Are there home remedies for hives?,"'If your hives are mild and you need no emergency care, there are things that can help reduce symptoms of hives. To possibly prevent or at least reduce the symptoms associated with hives, you can do the following:' Cool the area that has hives with a cool shower, wet towels, or a fan. Wear loose, light clothing to decrease any irritation of the skin. Do not scratch or irritate the area. Avoid any known triggers of hives. For some patients, topical lotions may soothe the skin."
When should someone seek medical care for hives?,"'If hives become widespread and the person develops any ''wheezing'', throat tightening, ''difficulty swallowing'', and/or ''shortness of breath'"", the individual or the individual's parents should immediately seek emergency care. Such individuals may require injected epinephrine (""'EpiPen'') to prevent ''airway'' compromise. Patients who have chronic urticaria should contact their doctors for an evaluation.'  "
What is hoarseness?,"'Hoarseness is an abnormal change in the voice caused by a variety of conditions. The voice may have changes in pitch and volume, ranging from a deep, harsh voice to a weak, raspy voice. '  "
What causes hoarseness?,"'Hoarseness is generally caused by irritation of, or injury to, the vocal cords. The larynx (also referred to as the voice box), is the portion of the respiratory (''breathing'') tract containing the vocal cords. The cartilaginous outer wall of the larynx is commonly referred to as the ""Adams apple."" The vocal cords are two bands of muscle that form a ""V"" inside the larynx. When we sing or speak, the vocal cords vibrate and produce sound.''Hoarseness can be caused by a number of conditions. The most common cause of hoarseness is acute ''laryngitis'' (inflammation of the vocal cords) caused most often by an ''upper respiratory tract infection'' (usually viral), and less commonly from overuse or misuse of the voice (such as from yelling or singing).''Other causes of hoarseness include:'   benign vocal cord nodules, cysts or polyps, vocal cord paralysis gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), allergies, inhalation of respiratory tract irritants, smoking, thyroid problems, trauma to the larynx/vocal cords, neurological conditions (such as Parkinson's disease and strokes), and cancer of the larynx."
What are the signs and symptoms of hoarseness?,"'Hoarseness typically gives the voice a raspy and harsh quality, though it may also cause a change in the pitch or volume of the voice. The rapidity of onset and any associated symptoms will depend on the underlying cause leading to hoarseness.'  "
How are the causes of hoarseness diagnosed?,"'A health care professional will ask the patient questions about their hoarseness and any other associated symptoms. A physical exam will focus on the head and neck. Often times, a diagnosis can be made based on this initial assessment. In some instances, a long lighted flexible tube (fiberoptic scope) will be inserted into the throat to directly visualize the vocal cords if no other cause is initially identified. Individuals with hoarseness that lasts longer than 2 to 3 weeks should have a consultation with an otolaryngologist in order to exclude any serious causes of hoarseness.' "
What is the treatment for hoarseness?,"'The treatment for hoarseness depends on the underlying cause, for example: '   Acute laryngitis caused by an upper respiratory tract infection will 
usually improve on its own as the infection clears the body. Conservative 
treatment with cough 
suppressants and humidified air can be helpful.  Voice rest is also recommended
in order to avoid further irritation or injury to the vocal cords.  Antibiotics 
are not indicated for most cases of acute laryngitis.  Smoking cessation is 
suggested for those individuals that smoke. Individuals with hoarseness caused by vocal overuse or misuse should adhere 
to voice rest, as serious injury (such as vocal cord hemorrhage can occur to the vocal cords if the voice is 
strenuously used during episodes of acute laryngitis.  Medications for gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) or 
allergies can treat hoarseness if either of these is found to be the underlying 
cause.  In some instances, surgery may be necessary for benign nodules or polyps, trauma to the 
larynx/vocal cords and for cancer of the larynx. "
How is hoarseness prevented?,"'Hoarseness can be prevented in some instances, for example: ' Avoid situations that require 
excessive strenuous voice use, and if a person needs to project their voice, use a microphone 
	if possible. Voice therapists or singing teachers may be helpful in 
certain cases to assist individuals with vocal training and voice modification. Smoking cessation can prevent hoarseness or the 
development of cancer of the larynx.  Individuals with hoarseness caused 
by gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) can benefit from medications and dietary 
modification (such as avoiding alcohol,
	caffeine, and spicy foods).

Facts you should know about Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL),"""Both Hodgkin's disease (sometimes referred to as """"Hodgkin's lymphoma"""") and non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'' are ''cancers'"" that originate in a type of white blood cell known as a lymphocyte, an important component of the body's immune system."" Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is more common than Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Physicians distinguish the lymphomas by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are absent in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are giant cells present in the lymph fluid that are "
How are Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) different?,"""Both of these malignancies may cause similar symptoms, but the conditions themselves are different. The distinction between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is made upon examination of the ""'cancer'' cells (from a biopsy or aspiration of the ''tumor'"" tissue). The type of abnormal cells identified in the sample determines whether lymphoma is classified as Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."" "
What are the statistics on Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""""Hodgkin's lymphoma"" Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is much more common than Hodgkin's disease. In the United States, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the sixth most common cancer among males and females. Furthermore, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been steadily increasing over the last decades. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is actually a heterogeneous group of over 30 types of cancers with differences in the microscopic appearance and biological characterization of the malignant lymphocytes. The different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also have differences in their biologic behavior (such as the tendency to grow aggressively) that affect a patient's overall outlook (prognosis). The specific type of NHL also affects treatment planning. Hodgkin's disease is much less common than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and accounts for only about 1% of all cancers in the U.S. The incidence of this cancer has actually been declining in recent years, in contrast to the increases in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease is confirmed by visualizing tissue samples using a microscope. When a biopsy from cancer contains a certain type of cell termed a Reed-Sternberg cell, the lymphoma is classified as Hodgkin's disease."
What are the risk factors for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?," Both Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can occur in people of any age, but the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma increases with age, with most patients being diagnosed in their 60s. Hodgkin's disease occurs most commonly in two distinct age groups:younger people between 15 and 40 years of age (most commonly in the age range of 20 to 30) andpeople who are 55 or older at the time of diagnosis. younger people between 15 and 40 years of age (most commonly in the age range of 20 to 30) and people who are 55 or older at the time of diagnosis."
What are the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"'The symptoms of both types of lymphoma include'   painless swelling of involved lymph nodes, and further symptoms are dependent upon the location and extent (spread) of cancer. Hodgkin's lymphomas are more likely to begin in lymph nodes in the upper body (such as in the neck, underarms, or chest), but both types of lymphoma can be found anywhere in the body. Both types of lymphoma may also be associated with general symptoms of weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, although there are many other causes for these nonspecific symptoms."
What are the treatments for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"'The prognosis and treatment of all lymphomas is highly dependent upon the exact type and characterization of malignant lymphocytes; the growth characteristics and location of a particular tumor; the extent to which the tumor has already spread at the time of diagnosis; and the age and overall health status of the patient. Both ''radiation therapy'' and various ''chemotherapy'' ''drugs'"" have been used with success in the treatment of both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Newer treatments are developing for certain types of lymphomas including treatments using biologic medications -- such as antibodies that target certain lymphocytes called B cells, and stem cell transplantation.""  "
What are the prognoses for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"""Hodgkin's disease survival rates""""Non-Hodgkin's disease survival rates""  Hodgkin's disease is one of the most curable types of cancer, with 5-year survival rates that have steadily increased to about 88% from 2004 to 2010. This rate is even higher (about 94%) in people under age 45 at the time of diagnosis. The prognosis for NHL varies according to the specific type of lymphoma and the extent of the spread of the disease (stage). The 5-year survival rate overall for all patients with NHL was about 72% from 2004 to 2010."
What is the lymph system?,"""The lymph (lymphatic) system helps the body fight infections and other diseases. It's made up of tissue and organs:"" Lymph vessels: The lymph system has a network of lymph vessels. Lymph vessels branch into all the tissues of the body. Lymph: Lymph vessels carry clear fluid (lymph). Lymph contains white blood cells, especially lymphocytes such as B cells and T cells. Lymph nodes: Lymph vessels are connected to small, round organs called lymph nodes. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, armpits, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymph nodes store white blood cells. They trap and remove harmful substances that may be in lymph. Other parts of the lymph system: Other parts of the lymph system include the tonsils, thymus, and spleen. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body including the stomach, skin, and small intestine."
What is Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Hodgkin lymphoma starts in the lymph system, usually in a lymph node. The disease may be found because of a swollen lymph node in the neck, chest, or other areas.''The disease begins when a lymphocyte (almost always a B cell) becomes abnormal. The abnormal cell divides to make copies of itself. The copies keep dividing, making more abnormal cells that build up.''When white blood cells collect around the abnormal cells, the lymph node that contains abnormal cells becomes swollen. Abnormal cells may spread through the lymph vessels or blood vessels to other parts of the body.'""Although normal cells die when they get old or damaged, abnormal cells don't die. Also unlike normal cells, abnormal cells can't help the body fight infections.""  "
What are the types of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'In 2013, more than 9,000 Americans will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. About 4,000 of these people will be children, teens, and adults younger than 35 years old.''Classical type''Most people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma have the classical type. In 2013, about 8,550 Americans will be diagnosed with this type.''In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal cell is called a Reed-Sternberg cell. See photo of the large cell below.''Other abnormal cells may also be found in people with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are called Hodgkin cells. They are larger than normal lymphocytes but smaller than Reed-Sternberg cells.''Rare type''In 2013, about 450 Americans will be diagnosed with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. In this rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal cell is called a lymphocyte-predominant cell, and the treatment options are different.' "
How is the staging determined for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'After you learn that you have Hodgkin lymphoma, you may need other tests to help with making decisions about treatment. Staging tests can show the stage (extent) of disease, such as whether lymphoma cells are found in more than one group of lymph nodes.''Lymphoma cells usually spread from one group of lymph nodes to the next. For example, Hodgkin lymphoma that starts in lymph nodes in the neck may spread first to lymph nodes above the collarbones, and then to lymph nodes under the arms and within the chest.''In time, lymphoma cells can invade blood vessels and spread to almost any other part of the body. For example, they can spread to the ''liver'', ''lungs'', bone, and bone marrow.''Staging tests may include:''Other staging tests may include biopsies of lymph nodes or other tissue.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about testing'   CT scan: Your doctor may order a CT scan of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. An x-ray machine linked to a computer will take a series of detailed pictures of these areas. You'll receive contrast material by mouth and by injection into a blood vessel in your arm or hand. The contrast material makes swollen lymph nodes and other abnormal areas easier to see. The pictures can show whether Hodgkin lymphoma has spread. PET scan: Your doctor may use a PET scan to find Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread. You'll receive an injection of a small amount of radioactive sugar. A machine makes computerized pictures of cells in your body that have taken up the radioactive sugar.  Because lymphoma cells take up sugar faster than do normal cells, areas with lymphoma cells look brighter on the pictures. Bone marrow biopsy: To check for lymphoma cells in the bone marrow, your doctor will use a thick needle to remove a small sample of bone and bone marrow from your hipbone or another large bone. Local anesthesia can help control pain. What type of Hodgkin lymphoma do I have? How do I get a copy of the report from the pathologist? Has the lymphoma spread? Was it found on both sides of the diaphragm?"
What are the stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'The stage of Hodgkin lymphoma depends mainly on:''Stages of Hodgkin lymphoma''Doctors describe the stages of Hodgkin lymphoma using the Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Stage I is early-stage ''cancer'', and Stage IV is advanced cancer, such as Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread to the liver.''Stage I''Lymphoma cells are in one lymph node group (such as the lymph nodes in the neck or armpit). Very rarely, Hodgkin lymphoma may start somewhere in the body other than a lymph node and lymphoma cells are found in only that one part.''Stage II''Lymphoma cells are in at least two lymph node groups, but both groups are on the same side of the diaphragm. Or, lymphoma cells are in one part of a tissue or an organ and the lymph nodes near that organ on the same side of the diaphragm.

Chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'Most people with Hodgkin lymphoma are treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses ''drugs'' to kill lymphoma cells.''Many drugs are used for Hodgkin lymphoma. Usually, the drugs are given through a thin needle directly into a vein (intravenously). Some are given by mouth.'""You'll probably receive a combination of drugs in a clinic, at the doctor's office, or at home. Some people need to stay in the hospital during treatment.""'The side effects depend mainly on which drugs are given and how much. Chemotherapy kills fast-growing Hodgkin lymphoma cells, but the drugs can also harm normal cells that divide rapidly:''Ask your health care team whether the chemotherapy used for Hodgkin lymphoma could make you unable to have children. The ''fertility'' of adults may be harmed by the drugs, but most children treated for Hodgkin lymphoma seem to have normal fertility when they grow up. If you want to have a child someday after treatment, you may choose to store sperm or eggs before treatment starts.''Some of the drugs used for Hodgkin lymphoma can cause ''heart disease'' or cancer later on. See the Follow-up Care section for information about checkups after treatment.''The NCI booklet Chemotherapy and You has helpful ideas for coping with chemotherapy side effects.' Blood cells: When drugs lower the levels of healthy blood cells, you're more likely to get infections, bruise or bleed easily, and feel very weak and tired. Your health care team will check for low levels of blood cells. If your levels are low, your health care team may stop the chemotherapy for a while or reduce the dose of the drug. Cells in hair roots: Chemotherapy may cause hair loss. If you lose your hair, it will grow back after treatment, but the color and texture may be changed. Cells that line the digestive tract: Chemotherapy can cause a poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or mouth blisters. Your health care team can give you medicines and suggest other ways to help with these problems."
Targeted therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'People with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma may be treated with a targeted therapy. The drug binds to lymphoma cells, and the body destroys them.''People receive targeted therapy directly into a vein through a thin needle. The drug may cause ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', night sweats, or tingling hands or ''feet''. Side effects usually go away after treatment ends.''You may want to read the NCI fact sheet Targeted Cancer Therapies to learn more about this type of treatment.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about chemotherapy or targeted therapy' Which drug or drugs do you suggest for me?

How will we know the treatment is working? Will there be lasting side effects?"
Radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'Many people with classical or lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma receive radiation therapy after chemotherapy. Some people with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma receive radiation therapy without chemotherapy. Radiation therapy can destroy lymphoma cells, shrink tumors, and help control pain.'""Radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma is usually given by a large machine outside the body. This kind of radiation therapy won't make you radioactive. While you're lying on a treatment table, the machine will aim high-energy rays that you can't see or feel at the areas affected by the Hodgkin lymphoma. Each treatment session usually lasts less than 30 minutes. You'll probably go to a hospital or clinic for radiation therapy 5 days a week for several weeks.""'Side effects may develop during radiation therapy or years later. Side effects depend mainly on how much radiation is given and on what part of your body receives treatment. For example, radiation to your chest and neck may cause a ''cough'' or ''shortness of breath''.'""It's common for skin in the treated area to become red, dry, and ""'itchy''. Check with your doctor before using lotion or cream in that area. After treatment is over, your skin will slowly return to normal.'""You're likely to become tired during radiation therapy, especially in the later weeks of treatment. Although getting enough rest is important, most people say they feel better when they ""'exercise'' every day. Try to go for a short walk, do gentle stretching exercises, or do ''yoga''.''It may help to know that, in most cases, the side effects of radiation therapy are not permanent. However, you may want to ask your doctor about the chance of possible long-term effects. After treatment is over, some people have an increased chance of developing a second cancer, such as breast or ''lung cancer''. Also, radiation therapy aimed at the chest may cause ''heart'' or ''thyroid disease''.''Women who have radiation therapy aimed at the pelvis may have ''hot flashes'' and ''vaginal dryness'', and their menstrual periods may stop. Menstrual periods are more likely to return for younger women.''Radiation therapy aimed at the pelvis can make both women and men unable to have children.

Stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin's lymphoma,"'Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma receive a stem cell transplant. A transplant of blood-forming ''stem cells'' allows you to be treated with high doses of chemotherapy. The high doses destroy both lymphoma cells and healthy blood cells in the bone marrow.'""Stem cell transplants take place in the hospital. You may need to stay in the hospital for several weeks. After you receive high-dose chemotherapy to kill lymphoma cells, you'll receive healthy stem cells through a flexible tube placed in a large vein in your neck or chest area. New, healthy blood cells will develop from the transplanted stem cells. The healthy blood cells will replace the abnormal ones that were destroyed by treatment.""'Healthy stem cells may come from you, or they may come from a family member or another donor. If the healthy stem cells will come from you, then stem cells will be removed from your body before you receive high-dose chemotherapy. The stem cells may be treated to kill any lymphoma cells that may be present, and the healthy stem cells are then frozen and stored until the stem cell transplant takes place.''You may want to read the NCI fact sheet Bone Marrow Transplantation and ''Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation''. It tells about the types of transplants and their side effects.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about stem cell transplants' How long will I be in the hospital? Will I need special care? How will I be protected from germs? What care will I need when I leave the hospital? What are the risks and side effects? What can we do about them? How will we know if the treatment is working? What is my chance of a full recovery? How long will that take?"
Nutrition during cancer treatment,"'Eating well is important before, during, and after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. You need the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.'""Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, mouth blisters, and other side effects of treatment can make it hard for you to eat.""'Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to help you meet your ''nutrition'' needs. Also, the NCI booklet Eating Hints has many useful ''recipes'' and lists of foods that can help with side effects.' "
What is the follow-up care after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"""After treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, you'll need regular checkups, such as every 3 or 4 months for the first year and less often after that.""'Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems between checkups, contact your doctor.''Hodgkin lymphoma may come back after treatment.Your doctor will check for the return of lymphoma. Checkups also help detect health problems that can result from cancer treatment, such as ''heart disease'', thyroid disease, or cancer.''Checkups may include a physical exam, blood tests, chest ''x-rays'', ''CT scans'', or other tests.''You may find it helpful to read the NCI booklet Facing Forward: Life After Cancer Treatment. You may also want to read the NCI fact sheet Follow-up Care After Cancer Treatment.' "
What other support is available for cancer patients?,"""Learning that you have Hodgkin lymphoma can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that a diagnosis of cancer can bring.""'Concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills are common. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing your daily activities.'""Here's where you can go for support:""'For tips on coping, you may want to read the NCI booklet Taking Time: Support for People With Cancer.' Doctors, nurses, and other members of your health care team can answer questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Social workers, counselors, or members of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or concerns. Often, social workers can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support. Support groups can also help. In these groups, people with Hodgkin lymphoma or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group.

What is the lymph system?,"""The lymph (lymphatic) system helps the body fight infections and other diseases. It's made up of tissue and organs:"" Lymph vessels: The lymph system has a network of lymph vessels. Lymph vessels branch into all the tissues of the body. Lymph: Lymph vessels carry clear fluid (lymph). Lymph contains white blood cells, especially lymphocytes such as B cells and T cells. Lymph nodes: Lymph vessels are connected to small, round organs called lymph nodes. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, armpits, chest, abdomen, and groin. Lymph nodes store white blood cells. They trap and remove harmful substances that may be in lymph. Other parts of the lymph system: Other parts of the lymph system include the tonsils, thymus, and spleen. Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body including the stomach, skin, and small intestine."
What is Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'Hodgkin lymphoma starts in the lymph system, usually in a lymph node. The disease may be found because of a swollen lymph node in the neck, chest, or other areas.''The disease begins when a lymphocyte (almost always a B cell) becomes abnormal. The abnormal cell divides to make copies of itself. The copies keep dividing, making more abnormal cells that build up.''When white blood cells collect around the abnormal cells, the lymph node that contains abnormal cells becomes swollen. Abnormal cells may spread through the lymph vessels or blood vessels to other parts of the body.'""Although normal cells die when they get old or damaged, abnormal cells don't die. Also unlike normal cells, abnormal cells can't help the body fight infections.""  "
What are the types of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'In 2013, more than 9,000 Americans will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. About 4,000 of these people will be children, teens, and adults younger than 35 years old.''Classical type''Most people diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma have the classical type. In 2013, about 8,550 Americans will be diagnosed with this type.''In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal cell is called a Reed-Sternberg cell. See photo of the large cell below.''Other abnormal cells may also be found in people with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are called Hodgkin cells. They are larger than normal lymphocytes but smaller than Reed-Sternberg cells.''Rare type''In 2013, about 450 Americans will be diagnosed with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. In this rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma, the abnormal cell is called a lymphocyte-predominant cell, and the treatment options are different.' "
How is the staging determined for Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'After you learn that you have Hodgkin lymphoma, you may need other tests to help with making decisions about treatment. Staging tests can show the stage (extent) of disease, such as whether lymphoma cells are found in more than one group of lymph nodes.''Lymphoma cells usually spread from one group of lymph nodes to the next. For example, Hodgkin lymphoma that starts in lymph nodes in the neck may spread first to lymph nodes above the collarbones, and then to lymph nodes under the arms and within the chest.''In time, lymphoma cells can invade blood vessels and spread to almost any other part of the body. For example, they can spread to the ''liver'', ''lungs'', bone, and bone marrow.''Staging tests may include:''Other staging tests may include biopsies of lymph nodes or other tissue.''Questions you may want to ask your doctor about testing'   CT scan: Your doctor may order a CT scan of your neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. An x-ray machine linked to a computer will take a series of detailed pictures of these areas. You'll receive contrast material by mouth and by injection into a blood vessel in your arm or hand. The contrast material makes swollen lymph nodes and other abnormal areas easier to see. The pictures can show whether Hodgkin lymphoma has spread. PET scan: Your doctor may use a PET scan to find Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread. You'll receive an injection of a small amount of radioactive sugar. A machine makes computerized pictures of cells in your body that have taken up the radioactive sugar.  Because lymphoma cells take up sugar faster than do normal cells, areas with lymphoma cells look brighter on the pictures. Bone marrow biopsy: To check for lymphoma cells in the bone marrow, your doctor will use a thick needle to remove a small sample of bone and bone marrow from your hipbone or another large bone. Local anesthesia can help control pain. What type of Hodgkin lymphoma do I have? How do I get a copy of the report from the pathologist? Has the lymphoma spread? Was it found on both sides of the diaphragm?"
What are the stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma?,"'The stage of Hodgkin lymphoma depends mainly on:''Stages of Hodgkin lymphoma''Doctors describe the stages of Hodgkin lymphoma using the Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Stage I is early-stage ''cancer'', and Stage IV is advanced cancer, such as Hodgkin lymphoma that has spread to the liver.''Stage I''Lymphoma cells are in one lymph node group (such as the lymph nodes in the neck or armpit). Very rarely, Hodgkin lymphoma may start somewhere in the body other than a lymph node and lymphoma cells are found in only that one part.''Stage II''Lymphoma cells are in at least two lymph node groups, but both groups are on the same side of the diaphragm. Or, lymphoma cells are in one part of a tissue or an organ and the lymph nodes near that organ on the same side of the diaphragm. Lymphoma cells may be in other lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm.''Stage III''Lymphoma cells are in lymph nodes on both sides of the diaphragm. Lymphoma cells may also be found in one part of a tissue or an organ near these lymph node groups or in the spleen.''Stage IV''Lymphoma cells are found in several parts of at least one organ or tissue.

Facts you should know about Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL),"""Both Hodgkin's disease (sometimes referred to as """"Hodgkin's lymphoma"""") and non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'' are ''cancers'"" that originate in a type of white blood cell known as a lymphocyte, an important component of the body's immune system."" Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is more common than Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Physicians distinguish the lymphomas by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are absent in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are giant cells present in the lymph fluid that are "
How are Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) different?,"""Both of these malignancies may cause similar symptoms, but the conditions themselves are different. The distinction between Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is made upon examination of the ""'cancer'' cells (from a biopsy or aspiration of the ''tumor'"" tissue). The type of abnormal cells identified in the sample determines whether lymphoma is classified as Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."" "
What are the statistics on Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma""""Hodgkin's lymphoma"" Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is much more common than Hodgkin's disease. In the United States, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the sixth most common cancer among males and females. Furthermore, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been steadily increasing over the last decades. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is actually a heterogeneous group of over 30 types of cancers with differences in the microscopic appearance and biological characterization of the malignant lymphocytes. The different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma also have differences in their biologic behavior (such as the tendency to grow aggressively) that affect a patient's overall outlook (prognosis). The specific type of NHL also affects treatment planning. Hodgkin's disease is much less common than non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and accounts for only about 1% of all cancers in the U.S. The incidence of this cancer has actually been declining in recent years, in contrast to the increases in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease is confirmed by visualizing tissue samples using a microscope. When a biopsy from cancer contains a certain type of cell termed a Reed-Sternberg cell, the lymphoma is classified as Hodgkin's disease."
What are the risk factors for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?," Both Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can occur in people of any age, but the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma increases with age, with most patients being diagnosed in their 60s. Hodgkin's disease occurs most commonly in two distinct age groups:younger people between 15 and 40 years of age (most commonly in the age range of 20 to 30) andpeople who are 55 or older at the time of diagnosis. younger people between 15 and 40 years of age (most commonly in the age range of 20 to 30) and people who are 55 or older at the time of diagnosis."
What are the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"'The symptoms of both types of lymphoma include'   painless swelling of involved lymph nodes, and further symptoms are dependent upon the location and extent (spread) of cancer. Hodgkin's lymphomas are more likely to begin in lymph nodes in the upper body (such as in the neck, underarms, or chest), but both types of lymphoma can be found anywhere in the body. Both types of lymphoma may also be associated with general symptoms of weight loss, fevers, and night sweats, although there are many other causes for these nonspecific symptoms."
What are the treatments for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"'The prognosis and treatment of all lymphomas is highly dependent upon the exact type and characterization of malignant lymphocytes; the growth characteristics and location of a particular tumor; the extent to which the tumor has already spread at the time of diagnosis; and the age and overall health status of the patient. Both ''radiation therapy'' and various ''chemotherapy'' ''drugs'"" have been used with success in the treatment of both Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Newer treatments are developing for certain types of lymphomas including treatments using biologic medications -- such as antibodies that target certain lymphocytes called B cells, and stem cell transplantation.""

What are the prognoses for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)?,"""Hodgkin's disease survival rates""""Non-Hodgkin's disease survival rates""  Hodgkin's disease is one of the most curable types of cancer, with 5-year survival rates that have steadily increased to about 88% from 2004 to 2010. This rate is even higher (about 94%) in people under age 45 at the time of diagnosis. The prognosis for NHL varies according to the specific type of lymphoma and the extent of the spread of the disease (stage). The 5-year survival rate overall for all patients with NHL was about 72% from 2004 to 2010."

Set realistic goals for yourself. Pace yourself. Do not take on more responsibilities than you can handle. Make a list and prioritize the important activities. This can help make holiday tasks more manageable. Be realistic about what you can and cannot do. Do not put all your energy into just one day (for example, Thanksgiving Day, New Year's Eve). The holiday cheer can be spread from one holiday event to the next. Live ""in the moment"" and enjoy the present. Look to the future with optimism. Don't set yourself up for disappointment and sadness by comparing today with the ""good old days"" of the past. If you are lonely, try volunteering some of your time to help others. Find holiday activities that are free, such as looking at holiday decorations, going window shopping without buying, and watching the winter weather, whether it's a snowflake or a raindrop. Limit your consumption of alcohol, since excessive drinking will only increase your feelings of depression. Try something new. Celebrate the holidays in a new way. Spend time with supportive and caring people. Reach out and make new friends. Make time to contact a long lost friend or relative and spread some holiday cheer. Make time for yourself! Let others share the responsibilities of holiday tasks. Keep track of your holiday spending. Overspending can lead to depression when the bills arrive after the holidays are over.

Pregnancy Test Facts,"'*''Pregnancy'' test facts medically edited by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD' Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone in a woman's blood or urine: hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is produced when an egg implanted in the uterus. There are two types of pregnancy tests, one uses blood and the other uses urine (home tests); a quantitative blood test detects hCG earlier than a qualitative blood or urine test. Most home pregnancy tests detect hCG in a urine stream when, after a few minutes, a line or symbol appears if the test is positive (indicating pregnancy); most urine pregnancy test instructions urge a second test in a few days no matter what were the first results; follow package instructions – if a control indicator does not appear, the test result should not be trusted. Home tests are accurate, some better (more sensitive in showing early pregnancy) than others. Home pregnancy tests may test positive on the first day of a missed period, but almost all detect pregnancy 1 week after a missed period. Call your doctor for an appointment if you test positive for pregnancy with a home test. It is possible to be pregnant and have a negative home pregnancy test; that is why you should wait about a week to repeat the test. Most medicines and other compounds (alcohol, drugs) do not interfere with pregnancy tests; however, any drug containing hCG (some fertility drugs) may give false test results. Any questions or problems with pregnancy tests should be discussed with your doctor."
How do pregnancy tests work?,"'All pregnancy tests work by detecting a certain hormone in the urine or blood that is only there when a woman is pregnant. This hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (kohr-ee-ON-ihk goh-NAD-uh-TROH-puhn), or hCG. It is also called the pregnancy hormone.''hCG is made when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. This usually happens about six days after the egg and sperm merge. But studies show that in up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until much later, after the first day of the missed period. The amount of hCG rapidly builds up in your body with each passing day you are pregnant. '  "
Are there different types of pregnancy tests?,"""Yes. There are two types of pregnancy tests. One tests the blood for the pregnancy hormone, hCG. You need to see a doctor to have a blood test. The other checks the urine for the hCG hormone. You can do a urine test at a doctor's office or at home with a home pregnancy test (HPT).""""These days, many women first use an HPT to find out if they are pregnant. HPTs are inexpensive, private, and easy to use. HPTs also are highly accurate if used correctly and at the right time. HPTs will be able to tell if you're pregnant about one week after a missed period.  ""'Doctors use two types of blood tests to check for pregnancy. Blood tests can pick up hCG earlier in a pregnancy than urine tests can. Blood tests can tell if you are pregnant about six to eight days after you ovulate (or release an egg from an ovary). A quantitative blood test (or the beta hCG test) measures the exact amount of hCG in your blood. So it can find even tiny amounts of hCG. This makes it very accurate. A qualitative hCG blood test just checks to see if the pregnancy hormone is present or not. So this test gives a yes or no answer. The qualitative hCG blood test is about as accurate as a urine test.'  "
How do you do a home pregnancy test?,"'There are many different types of home pregnancy tests (HPTs). Most drugstores sell HPTs over the counter. They are inexpensive. But the cost depends on the brand and how many tests come in the box.''Most HPTs work in a similar way. Many instruct the user to hold a stick in the urine stream. Others involve collecting urine in a cup and then dipping the stick into it. At least one brand tells the woman to collect urine in a cup and then use a dropper to put a few drops of the urine into a special container. Then the woman needs to wait a few minutes. Different brands instruct the woman to wait different amounts of time. Once the time has passed, the user should inspect the ""result window."" If a line or plus symbol appears, you are pregnant. It does not matter how faint the line is. A line, whether bold or faint, means the result is positive. New digital tests show the words ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant.""''Most tests also have a ""control indicator"" in the result window. This line or symbol shows whether the test is working properly. If the control indicator does not appear, the test is not working properly. You should not rely on any results from a HPT that may be faulty.'""Most brands tell users to repeat the test in a few days, no matter what the results. One negative result (especially soon after a missed period) does not always mean you're not pregnant. All HPTs come with written instructions. Most tests also have toll-free phone numbers to call in case of questions about use or results."" "
How accurate are home pregnancy tests?,"'Home pregnancy tests (HPTs) can be quite accurate. But the accuracy depends on:' How you use them: Be sure to check the expiration date and follow the instructions. Wait ten minutes after taking the test to check the results window. Research suggests that waiting 10 minutes will give the most accurate result. When you use them: The amount of hCG or pregnancy hormone in your urine increases with time. So, the earlier after a missed period you take the test, the harder it is to spot the hCG. Many HPTs claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always detect the low levels of hCG usually present this early in pregnancy. And when they do, the results are often very faint. Most HPTs can accurately detect pregnancy one week after a missed period. Also, testing your urine first thing in the morning may boost the accuracy. Who uses them: Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle. Plus, the fertilized egg can implant in a woman's uterus at different times. hCG only is produced once implantation occurs. In up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until after the first day of a missed period. So, HPTs will be accurate as soon as one day after a missed period for some women but not for others. The brand of test: Some HPTs are more sensitive than others. So, some tests are better than others at spotting hCG early on."
How soon after a missed period can I take a home pregnancy test and get an accurate result?,"'Many home pregnancy tests (HPTs) claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always spot pregnancy that early. And when they do, the results are often so faint they are misunderstood. If you can wait one week after your missed period, most HPTs will give you an accurate answer. Ask your doctor for a more sensitive test if you need to know earlier.'  "
My home pregnancy test says I am pregnant. What should I do next?,"'If a home pregnancy test is positive and shows that you are pregnant, you should call your doctor right away. Your doctor can use a more sensitive test along with a ''pelvic exam'"" to tell for sure if you're pregnant. Seeing your doctor early on in your pregnancy will help you and your baby stay healthy.""

My home pregnancy test says I'm not pregnant. Might I still be pregnant?,"'Yes. So, most home pregnancy tests (HPTs) suggest women take the test again in a few days or a week if the result is negative.'""Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle. Plus, the fertilized egg can implant in a woman's uterus at different times. So, the accuracy of HPT results varies from woman to woman. Other things can also affect the accuracy. Sometimes women get false negative results when they test too early in the pregnancy. This means that the test says you are not pregnant when you are. Other times, problems with the pregnancy can affect the amount of hCG in the urine.""'If your HPT is negative, test yourself again in a few days or one week. If you keep getting a negative result but think you are pregnant, talk with your doctor right away.' "
Can anything affect home pregnancy test results?,"'Most medicines should not affect the results of a home pregnancy test (HPT). This includes ''over-the-counter'' and prescription medicines, including ''birth control pills'"" and antibiotics. Only medicines that have the pregnancy hormone hCG in them can give a false positive test result. A false positive is when a test says you are pregnant when you're not. Sometimes medicines containing hCG are used to treat ""'infertility'' (not being able to get pregnant).''Alcohol and illegal drugs do not affect HPT results. But do not use these substances if you are trying to become pregnant or are sexually active and could become pregnant.' "
What is diabetes?,"'\tDiabetes mellitus is a condition in which the body produces no insulin (''type 1 diabetes'') or insufficient insulin (''type 2 diabetes''). Insulin is a chemical (hormone) produced and secreted by the pancreas. Insulin is essential for all parts of the body to properly store and use nutrients (glucose, proteins, and fat). Insulin helps the nutrients to enter the cells of the body. Insulin allows cells to transfer sugar (glucose) from the blood into cells, and this glucose is used to generate the energy necessary to fuel cellular activities. When insulin is absent or ineffective, cells import inadequate amounts of glucose, a starvation process that causes the ''liver'' to release more glucose into the blood in an attempt to feed other tissues. Since this additional glucose still cannot enter the cells, glucose levels in the blood rise. As this glucose-rich blood is filtered by the kidneys, excess sugar enters the urine, accompanied by extra water. High levels of sugar in the blood and urine cause the symptoms and signs of diabetes, such as ''frequent urination'' and excessive ''thirst''.' "
What is the treatment for diabetes?,"'\tThe appropriate treatment for an individual depends on the type of diabetes and its severity. The goal of therapy is to control blood glucose levels, in order to prevent the immediate signs and symptoms of high blood glucose levels (''hyperglycemia''), as well as prevent the long-term complications of ''type 2 diabetes''.''\tType 2 diabetes is managed with a combination of exercise, ''diet'' and medication. It is first treated with weight reduction, diabetic ''diet'', and exercise. When these measures fail to control the elevated blood sugars, oral medications are used. If oral medications are still insufficient, insulin therapy, or other newer injectable therapies are considered.''''Type 1 diabetes'' mellitus requires insulin in addition to exercise, and a diabetic diet.' "
Exercise therapy for diabetes,"'\tRegular ''aerobic exercise'' improves blood circulation and lowers blood glucose levels. Exercise also strengthens the ''heart'' and helps maintain an ideal body weight. The chosen aerobic exercise should use large muscle groups. ''Running'', ''walking'', biking, and ''swimming'"" are excellent activities for most people. The frequency, type, and duration of exercise depend on the individual's age, treatment goals, and physical ability. An exercise program should be designed with the guidance of a health care professional.""'\tExercise usually decreases the blood glucose levels. If blood glucose is low or normal, exercise may cause ''hypoglycemia'' (''low blood glucose'') due to the utilization of glucose by the active muscles. Therefore, food intake and insulin doses should be adjusted based on the intensity and duration of the anticipated exercise.'  "
Diet therapy for diabetes,"'\tProper ''nutrition'' is critical to the management of all forms of diabetes. Some people with type 2 diabetes can control their disease with diet and exercise alone. The right nutrition can help control blood glucose levels, reduce blood ''cholesterol'', maintain optimal body weight, and delay the complications of diabetes. Like exercise, diet therapy is tailored for each person. A successful diet should ideally consider the person’s ethnic background, financial situation, and lifestyle. It also should be simple, since it may be more difficult to follow diet plans with complex rules or food exchanges.''\tPeople with diabetes are often advised to use alternative (artificial) sweeteners. Sweeteners are either nutritive or non - nutritive. Nutritive sweeteners, such as ''sorbitol'' and fructose, provide calories but may not raise blood glucose levels as much as regular sugar. Non-nutritive sweeteners - such as ''sucralose'', ''saccharin'', and ''aspartame'' - do not contain significant calories. Both types of sweeteners are acceptable, but the caloric content of the nutritive sweeteners should be considered when calculating the daily intake of calories. In addition, large quantities of sorbitol can cause ''diarrhea'', and fructose contributes to some diabetic complications.' "
Diabetes and drug therapy,"""\tMedications to treat diabetes are available only by prescription. Insulin must be given by injection or infusion beneath the skin. Oral medications are available that increase the release of insulin from the pancreas and/or increase the responsiveness of the body's cells to the insulin naturally produced by patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes have stopped making insulin and thus must take insulin.""  "
How is diabetic treatment monitored at home?,"'\tThe goal of diabetic therapy is to control blood glucose levels and prevent diabetic complications. Glucose levels are lowered into a normal range, if possible, but it is important not to reduce the levels to abnormally low levels that can cause ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' such as ''sweating'', increased heart rate, and even ''loss of consciousness''. Therefore, it is necessary not only to treat the diabetes, but also to monitor the effects of treatment on blood glucose levels to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment of diabetes.''\tThere are two types of tests for blood glucose monitoring in the home. The first type uses a reagent strip, and the second type uses a reagent strip and a glucose meter.''\tGlucose and ketones also can be measured in the urine. Ketoacidosis is a serious but preventable complication caused by inadequate treatment of diabetes. This condition can be identified by testing urine for ketones.'  "
Blood glucose reagent strips,"'\tReagent strips are saturated with glucose oxidase, an enzyme that interacts with glucose. When a drop of blood is placed on the strip, the glucose oxidase chemically reacts with the blood glucose. The resultant reaction changes the color of the strip. The higher the glucose level, the greater the reaction, so the more dramatic the color change. The blood glucose level can be determined by comparing the color of the strip with a color chart. For accurate results, test strips should be stored at room temperature and away from moisture. To protect the strips from moisture, bottles should be closed after use.''\tThe disadvantage of reagent strips alone is that they do not give an exact glucose measurement. They are accurate enough, however, to alert patients to seriously high or low levels of glucose. Examples of reagent strips available over–the–counter (OTC) are Chemstrip bG® and Glucostix®. To determine a more accurate blood glucose level, the reagent strip must be combined with a blood glucose meter. (See below.)' "
Blood glucose meters,"""\tSelf-monitoring of blood glucose is the most important tool available to a patient for determining their glycemic control. This test is simple to perform. It involves taking a small lancet to poke a finger. Usually, this testing is performed just off to the side of the finger's tip, although some meters do allow testing at other sites, such as the forearm. Then, a small quantity of blood is placed on a testing strip that has been inserted into a meter that reports the glucose value.""'The meter determines the blood glucose level by measuring the chemical reaction on the reagent strip. Results obtained using a glucose meter are more accurate than those obtained without the meter (that is, with reagent strips alone). However, the results using a home meter vary as much as 20% from the more accurate measurements in a hospital or clinical laboratory. Fortunately, portable meters are accurate enough for home monitoring and self-adjustment of insulin doses at home.''\tIt is important to know that reagent strips are calibrated for specific meters. Many meters need to be calibrated each time a new box of test strips is used. Inappropriate calibration will lead to errors in glucose readings. Using incompatible strips and meters will give unreliable glucose readings.''\tErrors can also be caused when:''The main advantage of self-monitoring blood glucose is its immediate feedback. The immediacy of the result allows the individual to make decisions in terms of insulin, diet, and exercise that immediately improve glucose control. This, in turn, gives people more control over their diabetes and allows them to adapt their ''diabetes treatment'' plan to their lifestyle. Providing regular results to a health care professional allows for more frequent and therapeutic adjustments of medications. This improves symptoms and diabetic control, especially in the outpatient setting.''\tThe main disadvantages of the self-monitoring of blood glucose are cost, discomfort, and inconvenience (such as interrupting one\'s usual activities to do it). In addition, some patients experience a feeling of frustration at seeing high blood glucose results when they expected lower readings. \tOne could say, ""The thing about blood testing is that I know what my sugar is, and the bad thing about glucose testing is that I know what my sugar is.""''\tThe information obtained from self-monitoring blood glucose is valuable to all people with diabetes, even those controlled with diet and exercise, and those who require oral medication. Many physicians routinely give all their patients with diabetes a glucose meter, along with an individualized testing schedule. This \tschedule ranges from once daily up to six times each day, depending on patient needs. Introducing the self-monitoring of blood glucose \tis effective, in conjunction with diet education.''\tMany meters are available on the market and differ in attributes. They vary in the amount of blood used, speed to display results, font size of the display, ability to store readings in memory, and capability to download data. Some meters no longer require calibration. Newer meters function as a portable digital assistant (PDA) for health, allowing patients to enter other laboratory values, dates, and results of health visits. Newer meters may also store the strips right in the meter, thereby allowing the patient to avoid handling the strips. They may also allow for a patient to flag readings \ttaken after eating vs. before a meal. Examples of glucose meters available ''over-the-counter'' are Accu-Chek III®, Glucometer Elite XL®®, and One Touch Ultra.''\tSoftware programs and mobile applications are also available that can help people with diabetes manage their glycemic control. Depending upon the program, users can store and chart glucose levels, lab values, doctor visits, or other health parameters.' 
		meters are improperly calibrated; 
		the meter is dirty; 
		the battery in the meter is dead; 
		reagent strips are stored improperly; 
		the reagent strips have expired; 
		not enough blood is applied to the reagent strip; 
		blood is not left on the reagent strip long enough, or is left too long, before reading; 
		the test is performed under the wrong conditions of temperature and humidity; or 
		patients are dehydrated."
Urine glucose tests,"'\tThe role for testing urinary glucose at home has faded with universal blood \tglucose monitoring by fingerstick. Those few patients who choose to test urinary glucose must realize its limitations. Urinary glucose only estimates blood glucose values roughly, and it provides no information at all unless there is glucose in the urine. Glucose appears in the urine when the blood glucose level is over 180 mg/dL, well above the target for most patients. Below that level, urinary glucose is usually negative.'""\tUrinary glucose levels should not be confused with checking urinary microalbumin and \trelated protein levels. Urinary glucose levels should not be confused with checking urinary microalbumin and related protein levels. Performed in the doctor's office at least annually, these tests provide necessary information about kidney function the basis for determining whether certain medications should be added to the treatment plan to protect kidney function.""'\tUrinary glucose tests also do not indicate the current blood glucose level, but rather the glucose level during the period of time between the collection of the urine and the previous urination. In many patients, the level of blood glucose must be very high in order for glucose to appear in the urine. Therefore, the urine may be free of glucose, despite unacceptably high blood levels of glucose. Thus, results from urine glucose tests should not be used to adjust insulin doses.''\tThere are two types of urine glucose tests. Both types rely on a chemical reaction that produces a color change. These tests use either tablets or strips. Generally, the test strip or tablet is placed in urine. The resulting color change is matched against a color chart provided by the manufacturer, which shows the different colors produced by different levels of glucose.''\tThe first type, called the ''copper reduction test'"", uses cupric sulfate (for example, Clinitest). In the presence of glucose, cupric sulfate (which is blue) changes to cuprous oxide (green to orange). The reaction should be observed closely and the manufacturer's instructions closely followed. The copper reduction tests can react with substances other than glucose in the urine, leading to false positive results. This means the test erroneously shows glucose when it is not present. Examples of these other substances include ""'aspirin'', ''penicillin'', ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid), ''vitamin C'', and cephalosporin-type antibiotics. Tablets and solutions utilizing copper reduction may damage the skin and are poisonous if ingested. They should be handled carefully and kept out of the reach of children.''\tThe second type of urine glucose test, called the ''glucose oxidase test'', uses the chemical toluidine and the enzyme glucose oxidase (for example, Clinistix). Glucose oxidase converts the glucose in urine to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The interaction of the hydrogen peroxide with the toluidine causes a change in color. False negative results (meaning the test shows no glucose when glucose really is present) may occur in patients taking vitamin C, aspirin, ''iron supplements'', levodopa (''Sinemet''), and \t''tetracycline''-type antibiotics. Glucose oxidase tests are more convenient to use and less expensive than copper reduction tests. The strips should be kept away from moisture.' "
Tests for urinary ketones,"'\tKetone testing is an important part of monitoring type 1 diabetes. It is a tool that is often also used in ''pregnancies'' that are complicated by diabetes (called ''gestational diabetes'').''\tKetones form when one fasts (for example, while sleeping overnight) or when there is a profound lack of insulin. When the body produces insufficient insulin, its cells cannot adequately remove glucose from the blood, and the level of glucose in the blood rises. Responding to what appears to be a lack of glucose, cells release hormones to stimulate the body to produce larger amounts of glucose. Rising blood glucose level causes more urination and ''dehydration''. Due to low insulin action, the liver produces ketones, which are acids released into the blood. The presence of ketones signals a condition in diabetic patients called diabetic ketoacidosis (or DKA). Ketoacidosis always signifies that the cells are not receiving enough insulin.''\tSevere DKA is a medical emergency, since it can result in loss of consciousness and even death. About 0.1% of those with DKA die as a result of it. There is a correlation between high blood glucose levels, ''dehydration'', and ketones. The higher the glucose level, the more likely that ketones will be made. Therefore, diabetic patients with any blood glucose level over 240 mg/dL should test promptly for urinary ketones. Patients with type 1 diabetes should also test for ketones during any acute illness and during severe ''stress''. Also, urinary ketones should be checked if any symptoms of DKA occur (such as ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', or increased thirst).''\tKetones can normally be found in the urine. For example, after an overnight fast, ketones can be seen in up to 30% of people without diabetes. However, these levels of ketone production are usually below the threshold of measurement by the ketone test strips. The strips can give falsely positive results when patients are on ''drugs'' such as ''captopril'' (''Capoten''). Falsely negative readings may be seen when test strips are old, exposed to air, or if the urine is very acidic (for example, after drinking a lot of orange juice, which is also high in vitamin C).''\tThese tests are based on the color change that occurs when ketones react with sodium nitroprusside or similar compounds. The tests are performed in a manner similar to that of urinary glucose testing. Different tests detect the three types of ketones (named acetoacetic acid, acetone, and ß-hydroxybutyric acid). For example, Acetest only detects acetoacetic acid and acetone, but not ß-hydroxybutyric acid. Ketostix detects only acetoacetic acid, which can produce false-negative results if only acetone and ß-hydroxybutyric acid are present in the urine. Ketone tests are supplied as strips or tablets.''\tThe American Diabetes Association advises that ketone testing materials be available in the office setting and that physicians should prefer using blood ketone measurements over urine ketone measurements if possible. Home testing for blood ketones is also available, though not often used due to higher cost of the test strips.' "
Blood glucose,"""The American Diabetes Association has the set the recommendations for health care professionals on what they should be doing, and what should be available for the optimal care of patients with diabetes.  Among these recommendations are occasional monitoring of blood glucose either by fingerstick or through a venipuncture (for clinical laboratory testing).  Such assessment can be used to supplement the information obtained from the patient's home glucose monitoring, or to verify portable meter testing in the office.  Office testing allows the health care professional to see if the patient's results at home are accurate."" "
Continuous glucose sensors (CGMS),"'The Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Sensors (CGMS). The first generation of these devices functioned like a Holter monitor of the heart. Now, a small cannula is inserted into the superficial tissue of the abdomen (the subcutaneous tissue). The introducing needle is removed, leaving the sensor to be taped in place then connected to an external device about the size of a digital pager. This records glucose values at an interval of roughly 5 minutes over a 72-hour period. At the end of that period, the recorded glucose values are downloaded, and information is reviewed with a health care professional. Patients usually keep a log over the 72-hour period of how they feel, what they eat, and what their fingerstick readings are for comparison with the sensor data. These data are especially helpful for athletes, patients with unpredictably high or low blood sugar levels, and those who cannot find a pattern to their fingerstick glucose readings. The drawback to the original sensors was that the data were not available in a ""real time"" format. As a result, the patient would have to bring the device into the health care professional\'s office to download and review the data in conjunction with the logs they were keeping.''CGM systems have improved dramatically in the last few years. They represent useful tools for diabetic patients to gain insight into their patterns of glucose response and to tailor more individual treatment regimens. The newest generation sensors provide a real time glucose value to the patient. The implantable sensor communicates wirelessly with a pager-sized device that has a screen. The device is kept near the sensor to allow for transfer of data; however, it can be a few ''feet'' away and still receive transmitted information. Depending on the model, the screen displays the blood glucose reading, a thread of the readings over time, and a potential rate of change in the glucose values. These sensors can be programmed to ""beep"" if blood sugars are in a range that is selected as too high or too low. Some can provide a warning alert if the drop in blood sugar is occurring too quickly.''Recent developments have produced one new sensor designed to communicate directly with the ''insulin pump''. While the pump does not yet respond directly to information from the sensor, it does ""request"" a response from the person wearing the sensor if there is a need to adjust insulin, according to the sugar patterns which the sensor has been programmed to detect. The ultimate goal of this technology is to ""close the loop"" by continuously sensing what the body needs, then responding by providing the appropriate dose of insulin. While this technology needs further development, strides in this direction continue to be significant and encouraging. There is now one sensor that communicates with a pump to have it suspend insulin infusion for 2 hours, if there is a downward trend in blood glucose that could lead to hypoglycemia.' "
Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) testing,"'The ''hemoglobin A1c test'' (HbA1c) is crucial to monitor blood glucose control in patients with diabetes. In brief, ''hemoglobin'' A1c is the final product of several chemical reactions that occur in the bloodstream as ''red blood cells'' are exposed to glucose. A red blood cell typically lives for about three months, so the HbA1c reading provides a report card averaging blood sugar levels over the prior three months. Many different methods are available to determine the HbA1c level. Regardless, HbA1c level has been shown to predict the risk for developing complications of diabetes, much in the same way that ''cholesterol levels'' are predictive of ''heart disease''. The HbA1c test should be performed routinely at three-month intervals in patients with established diabetes. HbA1c can be tested when a new case of adult diabetes is suspected, although its use to diagnose borderline pediatric diabetes is still controversial.''To measure HbA1c, blood obtained in the usual way (from a vein) can be sent to a laboratory. Alternatively, many clinics specialized in diabetes care now have desktop HbA1c machines, which will read a simpler fingerstick blood sample within minutes. Several conditions can affect HbA1c measurements, and most relate to disorders of the red blood cells. For example, results may be falsely low if too few ''red cells'' are present (''anemia''). Falsely low readings can occur when red blood cells lose their proper shape (due to conditions like thalassemias, ''sickle cell disease'', or spherocytosis). HbA1c is invaluable as a tool to individualize patient care plans so that glycemic goals can be achieved.' "
What causes constipation?,"'A variety of factors can cause ''constipation''. The most common causes are:' Not drinking enough water Lack of fiber in the diet Lack of physical activity Poor bowel habits (ignoring or delaying the urge to defecate) Diabetes Hypothyroidism Pelvic floor dysfunction (weakness of the pelvic floor muscles) Medications (such as antidepressants, blood pressure medicines, iron supplements) Overuse of laxatives"
What are the seven home remedies for constipation?,"'Constipation is usually an easily treatable problem. A few changes in ''diet'', lifestyle, and making use of certain over the counter products can help relieve it.''Here are seven natural home remedies to relieve constipation.''Fiber, also known as roughage, is a plant-based nutrient. It promotes easy passage of stools in the bowel and adds bulk to the stools for easy expulsion.''It is recommended to have a daily intake of 25 grams. You can obtain the fiber from a variety of fruits and vegetables. Some of the rich sources of fibers are:''If you are no able to eat the fresh veggies and fruits, you can consider taking a fiber supplement such as psyllium (Metamucil) and methylcellulose (Citrucel). In general, these fiber ''supplements'' are safe and effective. They need to be taken in a glass of water one to three times daily.''Exercise'' helps in making the ''stool'' softer by decreasing the time it takes food to move through the ''large intestine''. This limits the amount of water absorbed from the ''stool'' into the body.''Exercising most times of the week is essential in maintaining bowel health. Exercises involving a knee to chest position may stimulate bowel movements.''Drink an adequate quantity of fluids, especially water and fruit juices. Drink 6- to 8-ounce glasses of water daily increases water content inside the gut. This helps soften stools and enhances bowel movements.''Drink warm water can increase bowel movements and relieve constipation.''Probiotics'' are live microbes that increase the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut and improve digestive health. These are available in the form of food (as in yogurt) and ''supplements''.''5. Prebiotics''Prebiotics act as a food source for your gut’s healthy bacteria. Natural sources of prebiotics include:''Examples of ''probiotics'' found in supplements are:''Go to the toilet whenever you feel the urge. Avoid delaying because keeping the stools for long in the bowel can make it hard and dry and cause difficulty in bowel movements.''Maintaining a regular eating schedule often stimulates bowel movements.''Avoid using laxatives frequently''Taking over the counter laxatives once in a while is OK. However, some strong laxatives make you habituated to it. One such example is ''Senna'' whose long-term use may damage the nerves that stimulate bowel movements.''All the measures above are generally suitable for everyone. However, ask your doctor if you can take probiotics or prebiotics and if yes, for how long.''Many people use alternative and complementary medicine to treat constipation. An Ayurvedic formulation, Triphala, is effective in treating constipation in various studies. Even castor oil is effective in relieving constipation. Another home remedy is taking carrom seeds daily. There are many such herbs and herbal formulations that have shown promising results in animal studies as well as in humans.

22 Home Remedies for Digestion,"'Some of the home remedies that may ease the symptoms of digestive problems and prevent ''indigestion'' include:' Eat small meals because consuming large meals at a time may cause a problem with the digestion of the food. Taking small meals at regular intervals may prevent the load on your gut and facilitate digestion. Do not lie down or sleep right after you eat. It is advised to take a slow walk for about 10 minutes after you eat to boost digestion. Cut down on processed foods, such as chips, cookies, and pastries, because they may be difficult to digest. Increase consumption of fruits and vegetables since they have a lot of fiber that aids adequate bowel movement and digestion. Chew your food well because digestion begins right inside the mouth. The enzymes that aid digestion is present in the saliva produced by the salivary glands. When you eat slowly and chew your food well these enzymes get adequate time to digest the food and send signals to the rest of the gut to prepare for the incoming food to be digested. Include some ginger in your diet. You may consume it as crushed ginger or as ginger tea. Drinking warm mint tea. Consume fennels to boost digestion. It can be taken as crushed fennel seeds boiled in water or chewed after meals. Boil some carrom seeds in water and consume the extract to boost digestion. Avoid foods that produce a lot of gas, such as beans, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli, especially at dinner time. Avoid spicy foods. Drinking some lemon juice or a pinch of baking soda in warm water may boost digestion. Consume foods like curd, buttermilk, and kefir since they contain good bacteria that facilitate digestion. Avoid foods and drinks that contain caffeine since it can stimulate your stomach to produce more acid causing dyspepsia. Avoid acidic foods, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits. Avoid alcohol since it can irritate the lining of your gut. Relax and unwind because stress can worsen and trigger indigestion. Avoid smoking since it can irritate the lining of the stomach. Have your last meal at least 3 hours before going to bed. Adequate sleep helps indigestion. You may sleep with the head elevated to prevent reflux. You may take OTC antacids to manage the symptoms. Avoid taking painkillers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) unless prescribed by your doctor."
What are two types of hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids''\xa0are enlarged, swollen veins in the lowest part of the rectum and anus. These veins bulge and get irritated, especially when the patient defecates, and cause bleeding. ''Hemorrhoids'' are also commonly called ''piles''. It is one of the most common causes of ''rectal bleeding''. ''Hemorrhoids'' occur in adults. It can cause significant ''pain'' and discomfort if left untreated.''There are two types of ''hemorrhoids'':''Hemorrhoids may go away on their own or with home remedies in a couple of weeks. If the hemorrhoids don’t improve or the symptoms worsen, it is advised to consult a doctor to seek medical treatment.' Internal hemorrhoids: They are present deep inside the rectum. They are usually not seen externally or felt and are painless. External hemorrhoids: They are present under the skin surrounding the anus. They are painful because of the painful, sensitive nerves surrounding the anus."
10 Home remedies for hemorrhoids," Sitz baths: A warm sitz bath can help relieve symptoms like pain, itching, inflammation, and reduce the risk of infection. It can be prepared at home by mixing one to two tablespoons of baking soda, Epsom salt, and apple cider vinegar in a bathtub. Some sitz bath kits contain potassium permanganate sachet to be added to 4-5 inches of warm water. It is recommended to sit in the solution for 15 to 20 minutes 2-3 times a day. Witch hazel: Applying witch hazel directly to the external hemorrhoids help provide relief from the symptom. Natural witch hazel is anti-inflammatory, an antioxidant, and astringent (a substance that causes cells/tissues to shrink). A small amount of pure witch hazel may be dabbed onto the hemorrhoids with a cotton ball. Coconut oil: Coconut is can reduce irritation, swelling, as well as soothe the affected area, and reduce itching. Aloe vera: Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory properties and helps heal wounds. It can reduce irritation, burning, itching, and swelling. It may be applied directly to the anus. The aloe vera may be refrigerated and applied cold to provide more relief. Additives and preservatives in some store-bought aloe Vera gels can worsen, hence the purity of the aloe vera is important. Ice packs: Applying ice packs to hemorrhoids can help reduce pain, irritation, burning, and swelling. Ice should not be placed directly over the affected area because it can cause tissue damage. Hence, ice should be wrapped in a towel or cold packs may be used as well. Ice packs may be placed for 15 minutes and repeated hourly. Over the counter medications: Over the counter painkillers (Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen), steroid creams, and hemorrhoid creams can provide symptomatic relief. Adequate hydration: Drinking plenty of liquid and being hydrated throughout the day softens the stools, prevents constipation, reduces pain, irritation, and discomfort while defecating (passing stools). Fiber-rich diet: A high-fiber diet softens the stools, prevents constipation, reduces pain, irritation, and discomfort while defecating. A fiber-rich diet also helps maintain digestive health. Fruits and vegetables are rich in fiber. Psyllium husk: Psyllium is a natural fiber supplement that may be consumed to help increase daily fiber intake to soften stools and reduce discomfort. Adding too much fiber too quickly can cause bloating or stomach cramping. So, it should be gradually increased. Wearing appropriate clothing: It is advised to wear loose-fitting, breathable, cotton clothing, and underwear. This helps in wound healing, reduces irritation, and prevents the worsening of inflammation."
How to soothe mosquito bites?,"'Mosquitoes are a big-time nuisance even though all mosquitoes do not spread diseases. Female mosquitoes usually bite animals and humans to suck a small amount of their blood. Mosquitoes require protein and iron from blood to produce eggs. After producing eggs, they lay their eggs in standing water. The eggs then undergo various stages to develop into adult mosquitoes. Mosquito bites appear as red, ''itchy'' ''rashes'', which resolves in a few days. A few mosquitoes act as a vector to spread diseases like:' Malaria West Nile virus Yellow fever Dengue fever Chikungunya virus Encephalitis (brain infection) Zika virus"
11 home remedies for mosquito bites,"'Cream and ointments can alleviate the aftereffects of mosquito bites. However, several home remedies may cure the ''itch'' and redness associated with mosquito bites.''Baking soda can soothe the ''itching'', stinging, and redness associated with mosquito bites. Apply the paste of baking soda by mixing one teaspoon of baking soda to three teaspoons of water. Baking soda is an ingredient in most over the counter creams. Nevertheless, the daily use of baking soda isn’t good for the skin.''The ''calamine lotion'' applied to the bites can immediately soothe the itches and reduce redness.''Arnica'' is a herb that has origins in Europe. It has been known to reduce inflammation and redness associated with mosquito bites. Mix one tablespoon of arnica tincture in half a liter of water, and apply it on the site to soothe ''itching'' and redness.''Honey has ''wound'' healing properties that may be useful in mosquito bites. Putting a drop of honey and spreading it on the affected site help to reduce inflammation and prevent infection. Besides, it soothes redness and itching due to mosquito bites.''Aloe vera is famous for its soothing effects. Aloe vera has shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that calm itchiness and redness associated with mosquito bites. Apply the natural aloe vera gel to the affected part and let it dry. For best results, apply two to three times a day.''Peppermint oil'' has anti-inflammatory properties due to its menthol constituent. Peppermint has been promoted to reduce itchiness and inflammation associated with mosquito bites, but there is little evidence to prove the same. Applying a drop of peppermint oil to the affected area may reduce inflammation.''Heat compress on the affected site may improve the symptoms of mosquito bites. Applying a hot water bag or a medical device that provides concentrated heat may be useful in the reduction of symptoms.''Basil oil has a component called eugenol, which is effective against itchiness and ''rashes''. You can crush a fresh basil leaf and apply it to bites. Eugenol has anti-inflammatory properties that help to alleviate the swelling.''Oatmeal has been used as a soothing agent to relieve ''itch'' and irritation associated with various ''insect bites''. Apply the oatmeal paste by mixing oatmeal with an equal amount of water, keep it for 10 minutes, then wipe the area clean.''The essential blue oil present in chamomile has anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Thus, it is helpful to soothe itchiness and redness. Mix two to three teaspoons of dried flowers per cup of water and use it as a compress on the affected site.''It is an antiseptic used to treat ''insect bites''. ''Tea tree oil'' 100% solution, can be applied to the mosquito bites.''However, if you observe the following severe symptoms, then immediately consult your doctor rather than waiting for results from home remedies:' Fever Headache Body aches Signs of infection"
15 home remedies for sore throat," Saltwater gargle: Take half to one teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water and rinse your mouth with the same. Avoid swallowing the salt or using excess salt, as it may dry out the throat membrane. Saltwater gargle cleanses the throat and releases the phlegm. Studies have found that salt water gargling can help in preventing upper respiratory tract infections. Honey: Mix honey with hot water or lemon juice and drink it to alleviate the symptoms of sore throat. Studies have shown that honey has some antibacterial properties that may ease sore throat due to infection. Still, it is necessary to consult a physician in case of bacterial infection. Honey has claimed to relieve cough, which can aggravate a sore throat. Avoid giving honey to toddlers below one year because it can introduce Clostridium botulinum spores, causing botulism. Lemon: Drinking lemon water helps to break the mucus and provides pain relief. Vitamin C is present abundantly in lemon and helps to boost immunity and fight off infection. Mix one teaspoon of lemon juice into a glass of warm water and drink for quick relief. Humidifier: Dry air, especially during winters, may cause sore throat. Hence, it is best to invest in a humidifier as it moistens the air and opens your sinuses. Tea: The different kinds of herbal teas that may provide instant relief include:Clove tea, green tea: Fight against infection and provides relief.Chamomile tea: Acts as a lubricant to relieve hoarse voice.Peppermint tea: Numbs your throat and relieves pain.Raspberry tea: Relieves pain and inflammation. Clove tea, green tea: Fight against infection and provides relief. Chamomile tea: Acts as a lubricant to relieve hoarse voice. Peppermint tea: Numbs your throat and relieves pain. Raspberry tea: Relieves pain and inflammation. Rest: It is essential to get sufficient sleep to recover from a sore throat. Sleep helps the body’s immune system to fight against infections. It is also necessary to give rest to your voice and avoid speaking too much for a few days. Hot beverages: Hot chicken soup or tea helps to loosen the sinus mucus, which allows for better drainage and decreased stuffiness. Warm drinks also provide sufficient hydration to the body. Cayenne peppers are high in capsaicin, which may help to fight inflammation and provide pain relief. Adding half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper with one cup of water and gargling with this water may be useful. Do not use cayenne pepper gargle if you have open sores in the mouth. Turmeric latte: Drinking a concoction of warm milk and a pinch of turmeric added to it relieves sore throat like no other. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action. Garlic: The allicin present in garlic has antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Studies have shown that eating raw garlic every day can boost immunity against the common cold and flu. You can add it to salsa or mince and it and add some olive oil or honey. Throat lozenges or hard candy: Throat lozenges and hard candies help to stimulate saliva production, thus keeping the throat moist and lubricated and relieving soreness from a dry throat. Marshmallow root: Marshmallow root can soothe the sore throat by coating the irritated tissues of the throat. You can take marshmallow root in the form of a tea. Fenugreek: Adding fenugreek seeds to your diet or taking fenugreek tea can boost your immunity to fight against bacterial infections, causing a sore throat. Pregnant women should avoid taking a high amount of fenugreek seeds. Drink plenty of fluids: Staying hydrated is the key to ease congestion, loosen mucus secretions, and keep the throat moist. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks because they cause dehydration. Warm compress: Keeping the throat warm may soothe the tender lymph nodes."

How will my doctor treat tonsillitis?,"'Your doctor will treat you/your child depending on the cause of your tonsillitis.''If the tonsillitis is caused due to bacterial infection such as a ''strep throat'', then''If you/your child are diagnosed with viral tonsillitis, then''If your doctor diagnoses an abscess in the ''tonsils'' (quinsy), you must see an ENT specialist/otolaryngologist for further evaluation and ''drainage of pus'' from ''tonsils''.''If your child has been suffering from frequent tonsillitis that has been\xa0 impacting their general health and causing school absenteeism or breathing problems such as ''snoring'' or difficulty in swallowing, your pediatrician or ENT specialist may advise surgical removal of the tonsils (''tonsillectomy''). This procedure usually does not require hospitalization and your child can go home after a few hours of observation.' Your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic, usually for 10 days. Complete the full course of antibiotics to avoid further complications such as an abscess or a heart condition such as rheumatic fever. After using antibiotics for 24 hours, you will most probably no longer be contagious. Antibiotics may not be given initially. Throat lozenges, sprays and gargles may be prescribed. You may only need acetaminophen for fever and pain and anti-allergy medications for redness. These are enough to relieve your symptoms. Avoid giving your child aspirin because it may cause fatal Reye’s syndrome."
What are the complications of a tonsillectomy?,'Complications with tonsillitis may be seen in young children. These include' Tonsillar abscess: Collection of pus in the tonsillar tissue Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess): Collection of pus around the tonsil Otitis media: Infection of the middle ear
What should you expect during the course of the disease?,"'Many people improve in the first day or two. Usually, 9 out of 10 people will be better in a week.\xa0' If you have a collection of pus around one tonsil, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic. Sometimes, you may need surgery to drain the pus. If you have been prescribed antibiotics, complete the whole course of antibiotics to avoid further complications and the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Children under the age of 7 years old may have large tonsils and their immune system is not fully developed to fight against infection. Therefore, your young child may have repeated bouts of tonsillitis. These episodes may become less frequent once your child grows older."
What is the fastest way to stop a toothache at home?,"'Toothache'' generally manifests as a sharp or shooting ''pain'', which may be so severe that it doesn’t allow an individual to eat, ''sleep'', or rest comfortably. Below are a few common home remedies for a ''toothache'':''More than all this, maintain good ''dental hygiene'' by brushing twice a day, rinsing the mouth after consuming anything, and regular flossing and rinsing with a mouthwash. In case you have sensitive teeth, try switching to ''toothpaste'' made for sensitivity. If home remedies do not help or if the pain gets worse, visit a dentist for proper management.' Ice pack: This is the easiest of the techniques to alleviate toothache. The ice may numb out the area and usually make an individual comfortable when kept near the affected tooth. Saltwater gargle: Heat a cup of water and dissolve a spoon of salt in it. Swish the lukewarm liquid in the mouth a couple of times. Repeat if necessary. It is a natural disinfectant. It may heal swelling, clean infections, as well as loosen food particles in your teeth Hydrogen peroxide rinse: Like the salt water rinse, hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria and helps reduce swelling and pain. This remedy is best used to heal bleeding gums or toothache caused by an infection. To use this remedy, mix in equal parts 3% hydrogen peroxide and water, and swish the solution in your mouth for 30 seconds, and then, spit it out. Cloves: They are an age-old solution to toothache. A few drops of clove oil can be extracted and rubbed into the affected area. Clove oil contains eugenol, which is a natural antiseptic. Teabags: The tannins contained within the teabags may bring some much-needed relief from toothache. Hold a wet, slightly warm tea bag against the affected tooth for a few minutes until the pain subsides. Teabags like peppermint tea contain menthol, which has numbing properties that can be used to cool and numb pain. Oils: Oils, such as tea tree, thyme, and peppermint, may help in reducing pain and numbness. Tea tree oil has antibacterial and antibiotic properties to keep infection at bay. Peppermint oil can also be used on its own to help alleviate toothache. Thyme oil is believed to have antibacterial as well as antioxidant properties, which may relieve toothache. Use a cotton bud to apply a few drops to the painful area and leave it there for a short while to allow the oil to act. Asafetida: Asafetida with lemon juice or oil is one of the common remedies. Mix asafetida spice with half a teaspoon of warm lemon juice or lemon oil and apply to the affected tooth every 20 minutes for 1 hour until the pain subsides. Garlic: Garlic has a lot of medicinal benefits and is being used for a few centuries. When crushed, garlic releases allicin, a natural antibacterial agent, which can kill harmful, plaque-causing bacteria and provide pain relief. Chew on a piece of raw garlic or apply crushed, raw garlic to the affected area to relieve pain and swelling. Fresh ginger: Wash and peel an inch of fresh ginger and start chewing it slowly around the affected area, allowing the ginger to ooze its juices. Keeping it for an hour or two may help in reducing pain and swelling. Onions: They are known to be highly effective against toothaches. Just cut a slice of onion and place it between the teeth and chew gently. The antimicrobial properties in the onion will get to work immediately. It also helps in reducing swelling around the tooth. Vanilla extract: Vanilla extract contains alcohol, which helps kill germs and numb the area around the affected tooth. Apply vanilla extract onto a cotton ball and hold it against the pained area for a short period for temporary pain relief. Turmeric: Turmeric is known for its healing properties. It is anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. Make a paste of turmeric powder with some water and apply it to the affected area. It can also be mixed with some honey instead of water and applied to the aching tooth. Lemon: They are rich in Vitamin C, which is great for the teeth. Simply cut a wedge of lime and place it between your teeth near the problem area. Suck the juice out well. Replace with a new wedge if necessary. Propolis: Propolis capsules help ward off colds, and they can also be used to help reduce tooth pain. Undo a capsule to release the powder and mix it into some warm water and use it as a mouthwash. Propolis is known as an antibacterial and it can also be useful for treating any gum problems that might be contributing to toothache. Guava leaf: They have antimicrobial properties that reduce swelling and pain. Fresh guava leaves may be washed and can be chewed directly or can be used as a mouthwash. Wheatgrass: Wheatgrass juice when used as a mouthwash may reduce swelling and infection. Wheatgrass is believed to have numerous other properties that make it a part of the natural remedies for tooth pain."
8 home remedies for yeast infections,"'Vitamin C'' boosts the immune system. A strong immune system can reduce the recurrence of infection. Vitamin C is rich in citric fruits, tomatoes, and may also be taken as ''supplements''. One should avoid local application of Vitamin C because it is acidic and sensitive to body tissue.''Hydrogen peroxide is an antiseptic but may not work against every species of yeast.''Adding hydrogen peroxide to a bath or diluting in water can help with yeast growing on the genitals.\xa0Diluting (half water and half hydrogen peroxide) and applying it to the affected area can help. Remember peroxide may cause sores on the skin if used improperly.''Probiotics'' can help restore the normal bacteria-yeast balance throughout the body. ''Probiotics'' are present in fermented foods like yogurt. Oral probiotics contain ''strains'' of the ''Lactobacillus acidophilus''\xa0bacteria that can restore the balance between the digestive tract and vaginal flora. Oral ''supplements'' can take about 10 days to show effects. Vaginal suppositories have quicker results.''Tea tree oil''\xa0is an essential oil that helps kill fungi, bacteria, and ''viruses''. Tea tree oil is extremely strong, hence it should be diluted with a carrier oil, such as jojoba or coconut oil, before applying to avoid irritation. A vaginal suppository\xa0containing tea tree oil should not be taken orally.''5. Apple cider vinegar:''Apple cider vinegar has many medicinal uses. Mixing half a cup of apple cider vinegar\xa0to a bathtub with warm water and soaking yourself for 20 minutes can help kill harmful bacteria and fungi, including yeast, due to the acidity of the vinegar. Apple cider vinegar can also be incorporated into the ''diet''.''Oregano oil made from wild oregano or\xa0Origanum vulgare contains thymol and carvacrol, which are powerful antifungals.\xa0Mixing 3-5 drops of essential oil per ounce of carrier oil like jojoba oil and applying it to the skin can help but should not be applied close to the vagina. It can also be inhaled through a diffuser.''Coconut oil has several health benefits, including antibacterial and antifungal properties. Pure, organic coconut oil can be applied directly to the affected area.''Garlic'' is effective against fungus and an effective\xa0Candida\xa0killer. Garlic may be added to the ''diet''. Applying garlic over the affected area should be avoided because it causes severe burning and ''pain''.' "
How to prevent yeast infections,"'The following tips can help reduce the number of episodes or prevent yeast infections:' Reducing the consumption of sugar and processed foods Wearing loose-fitting, breathable cotton underwear and clothes Avoiding wearing wet clothes or bathing suits for a long time Avoiding antibiotics unnecessarily without a prescription Eating a healthy, balanced diet Maintaining overall body hygiene"
When to call a doctor,"'Home remedies may or may not work to treat yeast infections. Some home remedies may provide relief within a few days while some may take up to a week or longer.''It is advised to consult with a doctor before resorting to home remedies. It is important to seek medical attention if the symptoms worsen, if new symptoms appear at any point during treatment, or if the symptoms do not resolve in 1-2 weeks. Individuals with ''diabetes'' should especially visit the doctor before experimenting at home.' "
What is the definition of homocysteine? What is it?,"'Homocysteine is an amino acid produced by the body by chemically altering adenosine. Amino acids are naturally made products, which are the building blocks of all the proteins in the body. Most labs report normal ranges of homocysteine as about 4-15 µml/L.''Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a ''genetic disorder'' called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced ''atherosclerosis'' in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "

The severe genetic form, homocystinuria, is rare (0.02%).'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria?,"'Homocystinuria has a constellation of signs and symptoms that include:'  Developmental delay Osteoporosis (thin bones) Visual abnormalities Formation of blood clots Advanced atherosclerosis or narrowing and hardening of blood vessels, a type of heart disease."
What are the more common causes of hyperhomocysteinemia?,"'More common causes of elevated homocysteine levels in the blood are milder genetic variations of homocystinuria. In these conditions, the mediator molecules malfunction and are less efficient because of a minor abnormality in their structure. They also lead to elevation of homocysteine levels (above 15 µmol/L), although much milder than in homocystinuria (above 100 µmol/L), by slowing down the breakdown of homocysteine.' "
How can homocysteine levels be lowered?,"'Eating cereals that are fortified with ''folic acid'', and to a lesser extent ''vitamins'' B6 and B12, can lower blood homocysteine levels. These ''supplements'' may even be beneficial in people with mild genetic hyperhomocysteinemia to lower their homocysteine levels. However, it is noteworthy that so far there is no compelling data to support the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia for ''prevention'' of ''heart disease'' or treatment of known ''heart disease'' or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with ''heart'' disease (atherosclerosis) or other diseases.'  "
Who should get tested for elevated homocysteine levels? How is it treated?,"'Currently, there are no official recommendations as to who should undergo testing for homocysteine blood levels. Before data that are more scientific become available from the currently ongoing studies, many experts do not recommend a screening test for blood homocysteine levels, even in patients with unexplained ''blood clot'' formation. In addition, the consensus recommendation is against treating elevated homocysteine levels with ''vitamins'' to prevent heart disease. Rarely, a few specialists may test for elevated homocysteine levels in patients with early onset of ''blood clot'' formation, ''heart attacks'', ''strokes'', or other symptoms related to atherosclerosis, especially if these patients do not have typical risk factors, such as ''smoking'' cigarettes, ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', or high LDL ''cholesterol levels'' and they suspect genetic causes''There is also no consensus as to the optimal dose of folic acid and other B vitamins for the treatment of elevated blood homocysteine levels.

Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What is a hookah?,"'A hookah is a water pipe used to smoke specially-made tobacco. The tobacco usually comes in different flavors, such as mint, cola, cherry, lemon-lime, coffee, ''chocolate'', coconut, apple, ''licorice'', and other fruity blends.''Hookahs vary in size, shape, and style. The set-up of a typical hookah water pipe includes a bowl for the coal and tobacco, an ashtray to catch the ashes, a hose with a mouthpiece to draw the smoke into and allow it to cool, and a water bowl to cool and humidify the tobacco smoke.''Hookah ''smoking'' is often a social activity in hookah bars, particularly with young adults, with users passing the same mouthpiece around the group.''While many believe hookah ''smoking'' to be safer than ''cigarette smoking'', it actually is just as dangerous to your health, if not more so.''Other names for hookah include shisha, narghi, bute, argileh, shisha, hubble-bubble, and goza.'  "
How many cigarettes equal an hour of hookah smoking? ,"'Hookah smoke that you inhale can contain 36 times more tar than ''cigarette'' smoke, 15 times the carbon monoxide, and 70% more ''nicotine'' than one cigarette.''Hookah ''smokers'' may absorb more toxins and ''cancer''-causing chemicals than cigarette ''smokers''. An hour of hookah ''tobacco smoking'' is equal to ''smoking'' 40 to 400 cigarettes, depending on frequency of puffing, the depth of ''inhalation'', and how long the hookah session lasts.' "
Are hookahs safer than smoking cigarettes?,"'Many people who use hookahs believe hookah ''smoking'' is safer than ''smoking'' cigarettes, thinking that the tobacco smoke is filtered through water making it cleaner. This is not true. Inhaled hookah smoke contains the same toxins as cigarette smoke such as tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, and other ''cancer''-causing chemicals.''Like ''cigarette smoking'', ''smoking'' hookah has been associated with health effects and problems such as ''lung cancer'', respiratory illness, low birth weight, and periodontal disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports a hookah smoking session can expose smokers to more smoke over a longer period of time than ''cigarette smoking'', exposing the users to possibly higher concentrations of the same toxins and carcinogens as cigarette smoke.'  "
Are hookahs addictive like cigarettes?,"'Many people think that hookah smoking is safer than ''cigarette smoking'"". It's not. Both hookah and cigarettes contain ""'nicotine'' from the tobacco, which is an addictive drug. Inhaling hookah smoke has the same addictive properties as inhaling cigarette smoke. Hookah is generally not used to get high.' "
Are hookah smoking and vaping the same thing?,"'A hookah is not the same thing as a vaping cigarette (e-cigarette, vape), which is a smaller, individual-use device that ''burns'' substances at high temperatures to make them into a vapor.' "
What are the health risks of hookah and cigarette smoking (including secondhand smoke)?,"'People who smoke hookahs and cigarette smokers are at risk for some of the same diseases and health problems, including:''If you feel you may be addicted to smoking hookahs or cigarettes, contact your doctor or other health care professional for advise on ''smoking cessation''.' Lung cancer Oral cancer Stomach cancer Esophageal cancer Bladder cancer Reduced lung function leading to chronic lung disease Heart disease Peripheral vascular disease Periodontal disease Decreased fertility Low birth weight babies Babies with respiratory disease Exposure to infection (from sharing the hookah mouthpiece) Carbon monoxide exposure (headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion) Secondhand smoke from hookahs can be a health risk for nonsmokers, just as is secondhand cigarette smoke."
Facts you should know about hormonal methods of birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'', meaning that she is physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology for ""''birth control''"" includes contraception, ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of birth control available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth-control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Types of hormonal methods of contraception,"'There are several different hormonal methods of birth control. The differences among them involve''The hormones can be estrogen and/or ''progesterone'', or preparations that contain a combination of these hormones. These hormones may be taken orally (taken by mouth), implanted into body tissue, injected under the skin, absorbed from a patch on the skin, or placed in the vagina. The mode of delivery determines whether the hormonal exposure is continuous or intermittent.'  the type of hormone, the amount of hormone, and the way the hormone enters a woman's body."
What are advantages and disadvantages of hormonal birth control methods?,"'Advantages of hormonal methods of birth control include that they are all highly effective and their effects are reversible. They do not rely on spontaneity and can be used in advance of sexual activity.''Disadvantages of hormonal methods for birth control include:' The necessity of taking medications continuously The cost of the medications Women must remember to take them regularly or use them exactly as prescribed A doctor’s visit and prescription are required. They do not protect a woman against STDs or sexually transmitted diseases Women must begin using hormonal contraceptives in advance before they become effective. For some women, hormonal preparations are associated with unpleasant side effects or increased health risks."
Oral hormones: The pill,"'The combination pill '""contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, a form of progesterone. When a woman uses the combination pill, the eggs in her ovaries do not mature and she does not ovulate. She doesn't become pregnant because no egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.""'The traditional combination pill comes in 21-day packs or 28-day packs depending on the manufacturer. The 21-pill pack has pills for 21 ""on"" days and no pills for the 7 ""off"" days that follow. The 28-pill pack has active pills for the first 21 ""on"" days and seven inactive (placebo) or reminder pills for the following 7 ""off"" days.''New preparations have been developed that allow for extended or continuous use of combination pills for months at a time. These products allow for a reduction in the number of menstrual periods a woman experiences.''The minipill'' only contains one hormone, progestin. Progestin thickens the cervical ''mucus'', making it more difficult for sperm to pass through the cervix. It also makes the lining of the uterus less receptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg. The progesterone-only pill is sometimes recommended for women who have medical reasons for which they must avoid taking estrogen hormones. (These reasons can include ''liver disease'', certain types of ''blood clots'' in the veins, ''breast cancer'', and ''uterine cancer''.) In addition, it is often recommended in ''nursing'' mothers because it has no adverse effects on ''breastfeeding''. Indeed, extended breastfeeding, as well as delay in the need for formula supplementation has been observed in breastfeeding users of the minipill.''The minipill is taken every day. There are no ""on"" or ""off"" days with the minipill.' "
What are the side effects of the pill?,"'Most side effects from the combination pill or the minipill decrease after two to three months of use. It is important to remember that because most side effects of oral contraceptives decrease in the first two to three months of use, women should try to avoid switching pills prior to an adequate trial. Trying to stick with any given product for two to three months may be necessary to really determine whether or not it will be tolerated over time. Switching too early to another brand may only needlessly subject the woman to the possibility of similar side effects starting all over again with the new pill.''There is no increased risk of ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to women who have taken the pill, but a woman should not use either type of pill if she is pregnant.''A woman who is breastfeeding should not use the combination pill because it can reduce the amount of her ''breast milk'' and the concentration of proteins and fat in her breast milk. Additionally, her breast milk will contain traces of the hormones from the pill. However, in contrast to the combination pill, the minipill is routinely used in lactating women.''Women who smoke and take the pill are at increased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. There is no increased risk of ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pill.''Blood clots in the legs (''DVT'') and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives are ''not'' recommended for:''Smokers'' over 35 years of age should not use oral contraceptives, nor should women with a significant ''liver'' disorder.''A woman should contact her healthcare professional immediately if she experiences any of these side effects while taking the pill:' Some women experience temporary symptoms of spotting or light vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and nausea during the first one to three months of taking the pill. Nausea can be helped if the pill is taken after a meal. While women sometimes fear weight gain with oral contraceptives, studies of the low-dose preparations demonstrate that there is no significant weight gain with oral contraception and no major difference in weight change comparing various contraception products. Negative mood changes, such as depression, and pigmented patches of skin on the face (melasma) may occur with oral-contraceptive use. Because the progesterone in women can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus, some women may experience loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Oral contraceptive-induced amenorrhea happens in about 1% of women in the first year of use. As long as the woman is properly taking her pills, amenorrhea is not harmful and it does not signal any loss of effectiveness of the pills. women with clotting tendencies (such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Leiden Factor 5), known coronary heart disease, stroke, unevaluated breast lumps, vaginal bleeding, or breast cancer. severe headache; leg cramps; change in vision, including blurred vision, vision loss, or flashing lights; abdominal pain; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or leg swelling or pain."
How is the pill taken?,"'No matter which type of birth-control pill a woman uses, she should take it every day at the same time in order to establish a routine. The woman needs to minimize the chance she will forget to take the pill, which is not an uncommon occurrence. This is especially critical in the case of the progestin-only pill (minipill). Forgetting to take the minipill, or taking it at varying times of the day, can significantly impair its effectiveness in contraception. This is due to the low dose of the minipill causing its effects to wear off rapidly if the pill is missed.' "
How long will it take before the pill prevents conception?," When a woman begins taking the pill, she may not be protected from pregnancy until she has been taking the pill for 10 consecutive days in a row. If a woman forgets to take a pill after she has started, she may be at risk for getting pregnant. If she only misses one pill, she should take it as soon as she remembers, even if it means taking two pills in the same day. If she misses two pills, she should take both of them as soon as she remembers, plus the pill for that day at her regular time. If she misses three pills, she should discontinue use of the pill for 4 more days to complete one week and then begin taking a new pack of birth control pills, whether she has a menstrual period or not. She must use an alternate form of birth control or abstain from sexual activity during the week that she stops taking her pills. If a woman continually forgets to take her pills, perhaps she should consider a different method of birth control."
What drugs or conditions reduce the effectiveness of the pill?,"'A woman should ask her healthcare professional about these matters and the necessity of using a backup method of birth control if any of these conditions exist.' The pill may partially lose its effectiveness if a woman vomits or has diarrhea for any reason. Some medications, including certain sedatives and some antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Research in this area is ongoing."
What are the benefits of taking the pill?,"""There are a number of benefits to taking the pill. Both the combination pill and the minipill can regularize a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' and reduce her menstrual flow and ''menstrual cramps''. There is evidence that the pill protects against ''cancer of the ovary'' and uterus as well as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) and ''iron deficiency anemia''.''The combination pill can reduce:''According to several studies, the combination pill confers no long-term risk of ''breast cancer'' for women at average risk. In addition, a woman who has taken the pill is less likely to develop ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''osteoporosis''.''Users of oral contraceptives have experienced significant decreases in excessive menstrual flow and in occurrence and severity of ''menstrual cramps''.' acne (although maximal acne reduction may take six months to occur), the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, noncancerous breast cysts, and ovarian cysts."
When will I start having periods again after I quit taking the pill?," A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within about 3 months of stopping the oral-contraceptive pill. However, the length of delay before a woman's period returns after stopping the pill varies from woman to woman. Oral contraceptives are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill does not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections."
Injection: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),"'Depot ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate  (DMPA) is a synthetic long-acting form of the hormone progesterone. DMPA is similar to the birth-control minipill in that it does not contain estrogen. Like other progesterone-based contraceptives, DMPA acts by preventing the release of the egg from the ovary (''ovulation'"") and by promoting thick cervical mucus that impedes the sperm's progress. Its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is close to 100%.""""DMPA must be injected by a health care professional every three months (12 weeks). It is administered as a deep muscle (intramuscular) injection. A lower-dose formulation of the drug that is injected beneath the skin (subcutaneously) is also available. The injection must be administered within the first 5 days of a woman's menstrual period. She is then protected from pregnancy within 24 hours of receiving the injection.""'A woman may stop having periods altogether after using DMPA for one year. After two years of use, 70% of women will have no menstrual bleeding. Menstrual periods stop because the DMPA causes the ovaries to go into a ""resting"" state. When the ovaries do not release an egg every month, the regular growth of the lining of the uterus does not occur and no uterine lining is shed during the subsequent menstrual cycle.'""A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within six to 18 months after she stops taking the injections. A woman can also become pregnant, usually within 12 to 18 months, once she stops using DMPA. If a new mother does not breastfeed her baby, she can resume the injections right after ""'childbirth''. Mothers who are breastfeeding can safely begin the injections six weeks after ''childbirth''. The injections do not reduce the flow of her breast milk, and no harmful effects on the baby have been noted.''The most common side effects of DMPA injections are irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstrual periods, and weight gain. Other side effects may include nervousness, ''dizziness'', stomach discomfort, ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', or breast tenderness. It is important that a woman realize that once she has been injected with DMPA, any side effects she may experience cannot be neutralized or eliminated. She has to tolerate these side effects until the medication wears off, typically three months later.''DMPA has also been shown to have a negative effect on ''bone mineral density'', especially with longer-term use; however, studies have shown that her previous ''bone density'' is usually restored when the drug is discontinued.''Women may be able to use DMPA when avoidance of estrogen is prudent for medical reasons (see oral contraceptives). A qualified health care provider should be able to help make the proper distinction. DMPA should not be used by women who have a history of breast ''cancer'', blood clots, ''liver disease'', unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ''stroke''. A woman on DMPA should contact her health care professional if she experiences a heavy menstrual flow, severe ''abdominal pain'', ''headaches'', or ''depression''.'""DMPA injections are over 99% effective if the injections are received according to the correct schedule. A woman using injection contraceptives has the advantage of being capable of becoming pregnant at a later time, if desired, simply by discontinuing use. DMPA does not increase a woman's risk of ""'cancer'', including breast ''cancer'', and greatly reduces her risk of developing uterine cancer.''Injectable hormonal contraceptives do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive patch: Ortho-Evra,"'An adhesive patch has been developed that provides hormonal contraception through the skin, which is known as a transdermal (through the skin) delivery system. The patch is about the size of a half-dollar and can be worn on the arm, abdomen, or buttocks. A woman wears the patch for a week and then replaces it with a new patch.''These patches are called Ortho-Evra (ethinyl ''estradiol''/norelgestromin patch-topical), and are similar to the pill in that they contain both estrogen and progesterone. Ortho-Evra should be just as effective in preventing pregnancy as the pill. Ortho-Evra is similar to the pill in that it suppresses ovulation and has the advantage of improved compliance and convenience due to weekly administration. A woman only needs to remember to replace the patch once a week instead of being required to remember taking a pill every day. However, some studies have shown that the contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of negative side effects, such as blood-clotting problems, than oral contraceptive pills.''Women who have medical reasons why oral contraceptives are not recommended (such as already having an underlying tendency toward blood clotting) may find that their prescribing physician also recommends against Ortho-Evra because of the similarity in the hormone ingredients of both types of contraceptives.'""It is important to ensure that the patch makes good contact with the skin. The patch could be a problem for those women who perspire heavily, swim, and/or take frequent showers because moisture can interfere with the patch's contact with the skin. Some women may also experience skin irritation at the site of the patch. Furthermore, contraceptive failure may be a risk in heavier women (those who weigh over 198 pounds, or 90 kilograms).""'As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, the patch will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive implants,"'A contraceptive implant known as Implanon is available in the U.S. Implanon provides contraception by the slow release of the progestin etonogestrel over a period of three years. Implanon is a thin rod that is inserted in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Protection from pregnancy occurs within 24 hours of insertion of the rod, and the failure rate is comparable with surgical sterilization (tubal ligations). One advantage of the Implanon rod is that fertility rapidly returns after removal of the rod.''A two-rod implant containing the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' (Jadelle) was approved by the FDA for 5 years of use, although it has not been marketed in the United States. Similarly, the Sino-Implant II contraceptive implant is similar to Jadelle, but is designed to remain in place for 4 years.''Preliminary studies of the product showed that it was generally well tolerated and effective in preventing pregnancy. However, these studies showed that irregular bleeding is a possible side effect of the product.''As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, Implanon will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Vaginal ring: NuvaRing,"'A ring-shaped device that contains the hormones estradiol and etonogestrel (a progestin) can be placed in the vagina. It remains in place for three weeks continuously, then it is removed for one week to allow for a menstrual period. It continuously releases low levels of the hormone into the bloodstream for the entire three weeks.'' There is currently one brand available in the U.S., ''NuvaRing'' (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol-vaginal ring). It is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, having the same high effectiveness as the other hormonal methods of contraception. The incidence of hormone-related side effects is similar to those seen with other hormonal contraceptive methods such as the pill and the patch. ''Vaginal discharge'' can sometimes occur as a side effect of the ring preparation.''NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
How effective are hormonal birth control methods?,"'Hormonal methods of birth control are some of the most effective forms of birth control available. When used properly, their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy can approach 99%-100%. With typical use of ''birth control pills'', effectiveness is estimated to be about 95%. With any form of hormonal contraception, precisely following instructions for proper use will increase its effectiveness.' "
What is menopause?,"'Menopause'"" is the stage in a woman's life when ""'menstruation'' stops and she can no longer bear children. During ''menopause'', the body produces less of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. After ''menopause'', the lower hormone levels cause the monthly menstrual periods to stop and gradually eliminate the possibility of ''becoming pregnant''. These fluctuations in hormone levels can also cause troublesome symptoms, such as hot flashes (a sudden sensation of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing, and often followed by ''sweating'') and ''sleep'' disturbance. Sometimes women experience other symptoms, such as ''vaginal dryness'' and ''mood changes''. ''While many women encounter little or no trouble during menopause, others endure moderate to severe discomfort. ' "
Does menopause cause bone loss?,"'The lower estrogen levels of menopause can lead to progressive bone loss that is especially rapid in the first five years after menopause. Some bone loss in both men and women is normal as people age. Lack of estrogen after menopause adds another strain on the bones in addition to the usual age-related bone loss. When bone loss is severe, a condition called ''osteoporosis'' weakens bones and renders them susceptible to breaking. ' "
What are estrogen therapy and hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Estrogen, in pill, patch, or gel form, is the single most effective therapy for suppressing hot flashes. ''The term estrogen therapy, or ET, refers to estrogen administered alone. Because ET alone can cause uterine cancer (endometrial cancer) (see below), a progestin is administered together with estrogen in women who have a uterus (those who have not undergone a ''hysterectomy'') to eliminate the increased risk. Thus, the term ''estrogen/progestin therapy'', or EPT, refers to a combination of estrogen and progestin therapy, as is given to a woman who still has a uterus. This method of prescribing hormones is also known as combination hormone therapy. ''The term hormone therapy (HT) is a more general term that is used to refer to either administration of estrogen alone (women who have had a hysterectomy), or combined ''estrogen/progestin'' therapy (women with a uterus).''All forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are FDA-approved for therapy of hot flashes are similarly effective in suppressing hot flashes. ' "
What are the side effects and risks of hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Women can experience side effects during hormone therapy; these can be divided into more minor side effects, and more serious side effects. The more minor side effects are more common than the serious side effects, and are generally perceived by women as ""annoying."" These symptoms include:''It is still controversial which of these side effects are due to the estrogen component as compared to the progesterone component. Therefore, if side effects persist for a few months, the doctor will often alter either the progesterone or the estrogen part of the hormone therapy (HT).''Contrary to common belief, recent research has confirmed that women who take commonly prescribed doses of hormone therapy (HT) are no more likely to gain weight than women not taking hormone therapy (HT). This is probably because menopause or ''aging'' itself is associated with ''weight gain'', regardless of whether or not a woman takes hormone therapy.''The more serious health concerns for women undergoing hormone therapy (HT) include:' headaches, nausea, breast pain. Hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of vein clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis ) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolus) by about 2 or 3 fold. However, it is important to remember that these conditions are extremely rare in healthy women. Thus, the true increase in risk for healthy women is minimal. Women with a personal or family history of these blood clots should review this issue when considering hormone therapy (HT). Uterine Cancer (endometrial cancer): Research shows that women who have their uterus and use estrogen alone are at risk for endometrial cancer. Today, however, most doctors prescribe the combination of estrogen and progestin. Progestin protects against endometrial cancer. . If there is a particular reason why a woman with a uterus cannot take some form of progesterone, her doctor will take a sample of tissue from her uterus (endometrial biopsy) to check for cancer annually while she is taking estrogen. Women without a uterus (women who have had a hysterectomy) have no risk of endometrial cancer. Breast cancer: Recent research indicates that hormone therapy (HT), and especially EPT, increases the risk of breast cancer, although the increase in risk is very small. For example, the Women's Health Initiative, a reliable large study of hormone therapy (HT) in menopausal women, predicted that there were approximately eight extra cases per 10,000 women who took hormone therapy (HT) for 1 year, compared to women taking a placebo pill. The increase in risk of breast cancer associated with hormone therapy (HT) likely increases with duration of use and is especially increased with five or more years of use. Heart disease: Even though hormone therapy (HT) lowers the bad LDL cholesterol and raises the good HDL cholesterol, hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of heart attacks in women who already have heart disease, as well as in women who do not have known heart disease. Hormone therapy (HT) does not prevent heart attack based on recent research from the Women's Health Initiative. Abnormal vaginal bleeding: Women on hormone therapy (HT) are more likely than other postmenopausal women to experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. What is called ""abnormal bleeding"" depends on the type of hormone therapy (HT). With cyclic therapy, in which monthly bleeding is expected, bleeding is abnormal if it occurs when it is not expected or is excessively heavy or long in duration. With daily continuous therapy, irregular bleeding can last for six months to a year, therefore, irregular bleeding that lasts for more than a year is considered abnormal. When abnormal bleeding occurs, a doctor usually takes a sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrial biopsy) to rule out an abnormality or cancer in the uterus. This procedure is usually done in the office. After the evaluation is done, if nothing is found to be wrong, hormone therapy (HT) doses will often be adjusted to minimize further abnormal bleeding. Stroke: Hormone therapy (HT) slightly increased the risk of stroke in women studied in the Women's Health Initiative. The WHI predicted that there were 8 extra strokes per 10,000 women taking hormone therapy (HT) for one year, compared to women taking a placebo (sugar pill). Because of the possibility of increased breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease risks, women who have no major menopause symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT). The effects of other types of hormone therapy (HT) (aside from the Women's Health Initiative types) on breast cancer risk are still unclear."
How is hormone therapy (HT) prescribed?,"""Doctors usually prescribe hormone therapy (HT) as a combination of estrogen and another\xa0 female hormone, progesterone. Synthetic progesterone compounds are referred to as progestins. Long term estrogen use without progesterone increases the risk of uterine cancer (endometrial cancer), whereas addition of progesterone counteracts this risk. Therefore estrogen without progestin is usually only recommended for women who have had their uterus removed (hysterectomy). Estrogen is available as pills, tablets, patches, creams, mist sprays, or vaginal preparations (vaginal rings, vaginal tablets, or vaginal cream). The choice of estrogen preparation recommended by the doctor depends on the women's symptoms. For instance, vaginal creams, vaginal tablets, and vaginal rings are used for vaginal dryness, while pills or patches are used to ease hot flashes. Estrogen pills are also useful for vaginal dryness and are sometimes used along with vaginal creams, tablets, or rings.""'Although progestin is usually taken in pill form, it is also available, together with estrogen, in patch form.'""Doctors may prescribe different schedules for taking hormone therapy (HT). Every woman's hormone therapy (HT) treatment and schedule should be individualized based on her particular situation. Below are some standard forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are used:""'Pills (Oral Therapy)''In order to avoid monthly vaginal bleeding, some women choose to take small doses of estrogen and progesterone together every day. This is called ''daily continuous therapy.'' Sometimes, daily continuous therapy can cause some irregular, unexpected vaginal bleeding for the first several months of treatment, especially in younger women entering menopause. For these women, and for some other women, planned cyclic bleeding is more acceptable. In these women, progesterone is usually added to estrogen for the first 12 calendar days of the month.''Patches and spray mists (Transdermal Therapy)''Hormone therapy (HT) skin patches are to be worn on a continuous basis. Newer patches need to be changed once or twice per week. Combination estrogen/progesterone patches are available for women who have not undergone hysterectomy to prevent ''cancer of the uterus''. Patches are as effective as oral hormone therapy (HT) for controlling hot flashes. Spray mists for ET are available as a transdermal spray used once daily.''Vaginal Tablets rings, and Creams''Estrogen vaginal tablets and creams are generally prescribed nightly for 2 weeks, and then reduced to twice per week as a long-term ""maintenance therapy."" There is a low level of absorption of estrogen into the body with the use of vaginal preparations as directed. Circulating blood levels of estrogen are slightly increased from vaginal estrogen use, and the long-term safety of vaginal estrogen rings, creams and tablets has not been clearly established (for example risk of uterine cancer, heart disease, or breast cancer). For this reason, occurrence of vaginal bleeding during any type of vaginal estrogen use should be promptly evaluated.''Vaginal estrogen rings are approved to treat genital dryness and irritation that can occur due to the lack of estrogen in women after menopause. A higher dose vaginal ring is available to treat hot flashes, so the hormone released from this higher dose ring clearly reaches sufficient levels to affect other parts of the body besides the genital area. The vaginal ring remains in place for 12 weeks, after which it can be changed by either the woman herself or her physician. The long-term safety of estrogen rings is not yet clear, but there is a low level of absorption of the hormone into the bloodstream with use of the vaginal estrogen ring.''Bioidentical hormone therapy''There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Who should take hormone therapy (HT)?," Women with hot flashes , especially when they are causing sleep disturbance, can consider hormone therapy (HT). Estrogen given short-term is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, and benefit of short-term (less than 5 years) use outweighs potential risks for most women. Because the risks outweigh the benefits of long-term hormone therapy (HT) for most women, women who are at risk of, or who have been diagnosed with, osteoporosis should talk to their doctors about non-estrogen medications such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), teriparatide (Forteo), and calcitonin (Miacalcin) in preventing and treating osteoporosis. Women with vaginal dryness or itching due to menopause can consider HT. Oral pills, skin patches, gel, or vaginal forms of estrogen can be used. Women who only have vaginal menopause symptoms and are not experiencing hot flashes should pick a vaginal form of estrogen, whereas women with both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms can use any form of ET. Sometimes, if a woman has both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms, both oral and vaginal forms of ET will be prescribed together, especially if vaginal symptoms do not improve with oral ET alone. It is recommended that women who do choose to take hormone therapy should take the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period possible."
Who should not take hormone therapy (HT)?," Contrary to common myth, women with high blood pressure that is controlled by medication can take hormone therapy (HT) because hormone therapy (HT) does not cause significant elevations in blood pressure. A major medical reason for not taking hormone therapy (HT) is a personal medical history of breast cancer or uterus cancer. Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding should have an evaluation prior to embarking on hormone therapy (HT) to exclude the presence of cancer of the uterus. Similarly, routine mammograms and breast examinations are important to exclude the presence of breast cancer. While hormone therapy (HT) may be used in women with migraines or liver disease, certain types of hormone therapy (HT) (often a patch or vaginal form) may be chosen to try to avoid aggravating these conditions. Women should not be taking hormone therapy (HT) to prevent heart disease, and should initiate hormone therapy (HT) only with caution if they already have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (such as past heart attack), as hormone therapy (HT) may be increase the risk of heart attacks. Women with a personal history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) should avoid hormone therapy (HT). Women with phosopholipid antibodies, including cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, should not take HT because of the added risk of blood clotting and thrombosis."
What medical checkups are advised for women on hormone therapy (HT)?,"'\tAll women receiving hormone therapy (HT) should undergo a medical checkup every year. At that time, the doctor or nurse will perform a breast exam and order a ''mammogram'' (a special X-ray picture of the breasts) to check for masses in the breasts that might possibly be cancer. At, or even prior to these check-ups, a woman should discuss her bleeding pattern with her physician to be sure it is within the expected pattern for her specific type of hormone therapy (HT). Other routine screening evaluations may also be performed at this annual check-up.' "
What if a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT)?,"'If a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT), there are other methods to deal with the symptoms of menopause. Although hormone therapy (HT) is by far superior to other medications in relieving hot flashes, other prescription non-hormonal medications can also reduce hot flashes. Likewise, personal lubrication products such as a water-soluble jelly (not petroleum jelly) can be applied to the vagina to reduce dryness.''A woman may also want to ask her doctor about non-hormonal prescription osteoporosis medications. These new treatments appear safe and effective in preventing ''fractures''.' "
What is menopause?,"'Menopause'"" is the stage in a woman's life when ""'menstruation'' stops and she can no longer bear children. During ''menopause'', the body produces less of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. After ''menopause'', the lower hormone levels cause the monthly menstrual periods to stop and gradually eliminate the possibility of ''becoming pregnant''. These fluctuations in hormone levels can also cause troublesome symptoms, such as hot flashes (a sudden sensation of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing, and often followed by ''sweating'') and ''sleep'' disturbance. Sometimes women experience other symptoms, such as ''vaginal dryness'' and ''mood changes''. ''While many women encounter little or no trouble during menopause, others endure moderate to severe discomfort. ' "
Does menopause cause bone loss?,"'The lower estrogen levels of menopause can lead to progressive bone loss that is especially rapid in the first five years after menopause. Some bone loss in both men and women is normal as people age. Lack of estrogen after menopause adds another strain on the bones in addition to the usual age-related bone loss. When bone loss is severe, a condition called ''osteoporosis'' weakens bones and renders them susceptible to breaking. ' "
What are estrogen therapy and hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Estrogen, in pill, patch, or gel form, is the single most effective therapy for suppressing hot flashes. ''The term estrogen therapy, or ET, refers to estrogen administered alone. Because ET alone can cause uterine cancer (endometrial cancer) (see below), a progestin is administered together with estrogen in women who have a uterus (those who have not undergone a ''hysterectomy'') to eliminate the increased risk. Thus, the term ''estrogen/progestin therapy'', or EPT, refers to a combination of estrogen and progestin therapy, as is given to a woman who still has a uterus. This method of prescribing hormones is also known as combination hormone therapy. ''The term hormone therapy (HT) is a more general term that is used to refer to either administration of estrogen alone (women who have had a hysterectomy), or combined ''estrogen/progestin'' therapy (women with a uterus).''All forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are FDA-approved for therapy of hot flashes are similarly effective in suppressing hot flashes. ' "
What are the side effects and risks of hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Women can experience side effects during hormone therapy; these can be divided into more minor side effects, and more serious side effects. The more minor side effects are more common than the serious side effects, and are generally perceived by women as ""annoying."" These symptoms include:''It is still controversial which of these side effects are due to the estrogen component as compared to the progesterone component. Therefore, if side effects persist for a few months, the doctor will often alter either the progesterone or the estrogen part of the hormone therapy (HT).''Contrary to common belief, recent research has confirmed that women who take commonly prescribed doses of hormone therapy (HT) are no more likely to gain weight than women not taking hormone therapy (HT). This is probably because menopause or ''aging'' itself is associated with ''weight gain'', regardless of whether or not a woman takes hormone therapy.''The more serious health concerns for women undergoing hormone therapy (HT) include:' headaches, nausea, breast pain. Hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of vein clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis ) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolus) by about 2 or 3 fold. However, it is important to remember that these conditions are extremely rare in healthy women. Thus, the true increase in risk for healthy women is minimal. Women with a personal or family history of these blood clots should review this issue when considering hormone therapy (HT). Uterine Cancer (endometrial cancer): Research shows that women who have their uterus and use estrogen alone are at risk for endometrial cancer. Today, however, most doctors prescribe the combination of estrogen and progestin. Progestin protects against endometrial cancer. . If there is a particular reason why a woman with a uterus cannot take some form of progesterone, her doctor will take a sample of tissue from her uterus (endometrial biopsy) to check for cancer annually while she is taking estrogen. Women without a uterus (women who have had a hysterectomy) have no risk of endometrial cancer. Breast cancer: Recent research indicates that hormone therapy (HT), and especially EPT, increases the risk of breast cancer, although the increase in risk is very small. For example, the Women's Health Initiative, a reliable large study of hormone therapy (HT) in menopausal women, predicted that there were approximately eight extra cases per 10,000 women who took hormone therapy (HT) for 1 year, compared to women taking a placebo pill. The increase in risk of breast cancer associated with hormone therapy (HT) likely increases with duration of use and is especially increased with five or more years of use. Heart disease: Even though hormone therapy (HT) lowers the bad LDL cholesterol and raises the good HDL cholesterol, hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of heart attacks in women who already have heart disease, as well as in women who do not have known heart disease. Hormone therapy (HT) does not prevent heart attack based on recent research from the Women's Health Initiative. Abnormal vaginal bleeding: Women on hormone therapy (HT) are more likely than other postmenopausal women to experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. What is called ""abnormal bleeding"" depends on the type of hormone therapy (HT). With cyclic therapy, in which monthly bleeding is expected, bleeding is abnormal if it occurs when it is not expected or is excessively heavy or long in duration. With daily continuous therapy, irregular bleeding can last for six months to a year, therefore, irregular bleeding that lasts for more than a year is considered abnormal. When abnormal bleeding occurs, a doctor usually takes a sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrial biopsy) to rule out an abnormality or cancer in the uterus. This procedure is usually done in the office. After the evaluation is done, if nothing is found to be wrong, hormone therapy (HT) doses will often be adjusted to minimize further abnormal bleeding. Stroke: Hormone therapy (HT) slightly increased the risk of stroke in women studied in the Women's Health Initiative. The WHI predicted that there were 8 extra strokes per 10,000 women taking hormone therapy (HT) for one year, compared to women taking a placebo (sugar pill). Because of the possibility of increased breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease risks, women who have no major menopause symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT). The effects of other types of hormone therapy (HT) (aside from the Women's Health Initiative types) on breast cancer risk are still unclear."
How is hormone therapy (HT) prescribed?,"""Doctors usually prescribe hormone therapy (HT) as a combination of estrogen and another\xa0 female hormone, progesterone. Synthetic progesterone compounds are referred to as progestins. Long term estrogen use without progesterone increases the risk of uterine cancer (endometrial cancer), whereas addition of progesterone counteracts this risk. Therefore estrogen without progestin is usually only recommended for women who have had their uterus removed (hysterectomy). Estrogen is available as pills, tablets, patches, creams, mist sprays, or vaginal preparations (vaginal rings, vaginal tablets, or vaginal cream). The choice of estrogen preparation recommended by the doctor depends on the women's symptoms. For instance, vaginal creams, vaginal tablets, and vaginal rings are used for vaginal dryness, while pills or patches are used to ease hot flashes. Estrogen pills are also useful for vaginal dryness and are sometimes used along with vaginal creams, tablets, or rings.""'Although progestin is usually taken in pill form, it is also available, together with estrogen, in patch form.'""Doctors may prescribe different schedules for taking hormone therapy (HT). Every woman's hormone therapy (HT) treatment and schedule should be individualized based on her particular situation. Below are some standard forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are used:""'Pills (Oral Therapy)''In order to avoid monthly vaginal bleeding, some women choose to take small doses of estrogen and progesterone together every day. This is called ''daily continuous therapy.'' Sometimes, daily continuous therapy can cause some irregular, unexpected vaginal bleeding for the first several months of treatment, especially in younger women entering menopause. For these women, and for some other women, planned cyclic bleeding is more acceptable. In these women, progesterone is usually added to estrogen for the first 12 calendar days of the month.''Patches and spray mists (Transdermal Therapy)''Hormone therapy (HT) skin patches are to be worn on a continuous basis. Newer patches need to be changed once or twice per week. Combination estrogen/progesterone patches are available for women who have not undergone hysterectomy to prevent ''cancer of the uterus''. Patches are as effective as oral hormone therapy (HT) for controlling hot flashes. Spray mists for ET are available as a transdermal spray used once daily.''Vaginal Tablets rings, and Creams''Estrogen vaginal tablets and creams are generally prescribed nightly for 2 weeks, and then reduced to twice per week as a long-term ""maintenance therapy."" There is a low level of absorption of estrogen into the body with the use of vaginal preparations as directed. Circulating blood levels of estrogen are slightly increased from vaginal estrogen use, and the long-term safety of vaginal estrogen rings, creams and tablets has not been clearly established (for example risk of uterine cancer, heart disease, or breast cancer). For this reason, occurrence of vaginal bleeding during any type of vaginal estrogen use should be promptly evaluated.''Vaginal estrogen rings are approved to treat genital dryness and irritation that can occur due to the lack of estrogen in women after menopause. A higher dose vaginal ring is available to treat hot flashes, so the hormone released from this higher dose ring clearly reaches sufficient levels to affect other parts of the body besides the genital area. The vaginal ring remains in place for 12 weeks, after which it can be changed by either the woman herself or her physician. The long-term safety of estrogen rings is not yet clear, but there is a low level of absorption of the hormone into the bloodstream with use of the vaginal estrogen ring.''Bioidentical hormone therapy''There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient.

What is hospice care?,"'Hospice is a field of medicine that focuses on the comprehensive care of patients with terminal illnesses. Hospice need not be a place but rather a service that offers support, resources, and assistance to terminally ill patients and their families.''The main goal of hospice is to provide a peaceful, symptom-free, and dignified transition to death for patients whose diseases are advanced beyond a cure. The hope for a cure shifts to hope for a life free of suffering. The focus becomes quality of life rather than its length.'""Hospice care is patient-centered medical care. A host of valuable services are offered to address every aspect of the patient's care as a whole. This is achieved by considering each individual's goals, values, beliefs, and rituals."" "
Why is hospice care important?,"'In many chronic and progressive conditions such as ''cancer'', ''heart disease'', or ''dementia'"", the natural disease process can ultimately reach an end stage. Most of the time, as a disease progresses to an advanced stage, its symptoms become more intolerable and difficult to control. As a result, an end-stage condition can significantly impair a person's functional status and quality of life.""""At this point, often there is no further cure or treatment to control the progression of the disease. Furthermore, aggressive treatment may only offer little benefit while posing significant risk and jeopardizing the patient's quality of life.""'In such late stages of diseases, hospice can offer help for patients and families. The use of the term ""nothing left to do,"" is generally to be avoided by health care professionals. There may be nothing with curative potential to do, but there is always something to do that helps with symptoms or improves quality of life. There are many aspects of a patient\'s well-being that can be addressed. Hospice can play a key role in managing physical symptoms of a disease (palliative care) and supporting patients and families emotionally and spiritually.''Hospice care promotes open discussions about ""the big picture"" with patients and their loved ones. The disease process, prognosis, and realities are often important parts of these discussions. More importantly, the patient\'s wishes, values, and beliefs are taken into account and become the cornerstone of the hospice plan of care.''Hospice and palliative care philosophy encourages these type of discussions with treating physicians early on in the course of a terminal disease. Patients can outline their preferences before they become too ill and incapable, thereby relieving some of the decision-making burden from family members. Advance care directives can be discussed and their completion facilitated in this setting.' "
What is the history of hospice?,"'Toward the end of the 19th century, hospices became designated places for the care of terminal patients in Ireland and England. The modern concept of hospice was later developed in England in 1967 by Dr. Cicely Saunders.'""St. Christopher's hospice was the first hospice under the direction of Dr. Saunders. The philosophy of end-of-life care and the practice of hospice have since spread to many other countries around the world.""'In the United States, hospice was originally run by volunteers who cared for dying patients. In the 1980s, Medicare authorized formal hospice care and Medicare hospice benefits became part of Medicare Part A. State-run insurances or Medicaid also offer hospice benefits, as do most private insurances.''Currently in the United States alone there are several thousands of hospice agencies. This branch of the medical field continues to grow as more people live longer with their chronic conditions. As a result, hospice can become a reasonable option for more patients during the disease progression.''In the early 1990s, hospice became an official medical subspecialty and physicians involved in the care of hospice patients could become board certified in hospice and palliative medicine.' "
What are the main goals of hospice care?,"""The end-of-life period is a sensitive part of everyone's life cycle. Psychosocial, financial, interpersonal, medical, and spiritual conflicts are all intertwined.""'The main goal of hospice care is to reduce potentially unavoidable physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering encountered by patients during the dying process.'""As a result, medical care during this period is very delicate and needs to be individually tailored. End-of-life care requires detailed attention to each person's wishes, beliefs, values, social situation, and personal characteristics.""'The complex care of hospice patients may include the following:' Managing evolving medical issues (infections, medication management, pressure ulcers, hydration, nutrition, physical stages of dying) Treating physical symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion, etc.) Counseling about the anxiety, uncertainty, grief, and fear associated with end of life and dying Rendering support to the patient, their families, and caregivers with the overwhelming physical and psychological stresses of a terminal illness Guiding patients and families through the difficult interpersonal and psychosocial issues and helping them with finding closure Paying attention to personal, religious, spiritual, and cultural values Assisting patients and families making their wishes known and also reaching financial closures (living will, trust, advance directive, funeral arrangements) Providing bereavement counseling to the mourning loved ones after the death of the patient"
What are some misconceptions about hospice care?,"'Many misconceptions about hospice care still exist in the mind of the public and health care professionals. For example, it is perceived that hospice is a physical location and it only treats ''pain'' in ''cancer'' patients.''The following are some of the true facts about hospice to clarify these misconceptions.' Hospice care can be provided in many settings. It need not be only a physical place where patients go to die. Hospice is not only for cancer patients. Hospice does not deal only with pain management. Hospice does not hasten or prolong death. Hospice does not discriminate based on age, gender, race, or religion. Hospice does not participate in or encourage active euthanasia. Hospice does permit patients to see their regular physician. Hospice does allow patients to go to hospital if they choose. Hospice can be revoked at any time by patients or their families. Hospice can be provided for children with terminal disease."
What kinds of services does hospice care provide?,"""Services provided under hospice depend on the patient's needs and medical condition. General services provided by hospice include""'Additional personnel, including dieticians, pharmacists, home health aids, and other therapists, can also be involved in the care of a patient under hospice.''Contribution from these team members is dictated by the needs and goals of the patient.''In regards to medications, hospice typically supplies medications that help with managing and controlling the symptoms of the underlying condition.''In addition, durable medical equipment and medical supplies are routinely provided and covered under hospice benefits. Wheelchairs, hospital beds, ''wound'' ''care supplies, oxygen tanks, nutritional ''supplements'', diapers, and urinary catheters are examples of some of the equipment often provided to patients by hospice.' routine medical assessment and evaluation by a physician, frequent nurse visits ranging between daily to weekly depending on patient's needs and condition, spiritual counseling, social worker evaluation, volunteer services."
Are hospice services available for children?,"'Most, but not all, hospices render care for pediatric patients with terminal illnesses. The care provided for children on hospice is generally even more delicate and complex because of''Hospices which provide pediatric care often use the expertise of counselors, therapists, and social workers trained in child psychology and communication.' challenges in communicating with children about their illness, children's perceptions about illness and death, difficulty assessing children's symptoms, unnatural and dramatic circumstance for parents, effects of a child's illness on other siblings and friends, uneasy social interactions with other children."
Can hospice care be offered at home?,"""Yes, because hospice is a service which can be provided in many different settings. Its location to deliver care is based on each individual's preference. In fact, the majority of patients on hospice stay at their home or their usual residence (nursing homes or long-term care facilities) as they did prior to going on hospice.""'Hospice care can be offered where the patient lives as long as the environment is safe, and the intensity of care does not overwhelm the patient and caregivers. Occasionally, a patient may need to be moved to a nursing facility or another health care setting if their home care becomes unachievable. This situation usually arises because of a need for higher level of personal care or uncontrolled symptoms requiring close monitoring by trained staff.' "
What are some medical conditions commonly referred to hospice?,"'Even though cancer remains one of the most common hospice diagnoses, many other terminal conditions are now very routinely referred to hospice.''Conditions other than cancer that are commonly referred to hospice are''In reality, no specific restrictions exist as to what conditions can be referred to hospice. Any disease that is deemed end stage is not reversible, and its further treatment poses more burden than benefit can be considered for referral to hospice.'   lung disease (chronic obstructive lung disease, COPD); heart disease, congestive heart failure; stroke; coma; advanced liver disease, cirrhosis; end-stage kidney disease; dementia (Alzheimer's or other types); advanced neurologic diseases (Parkinson's disease, ALS); human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS."
How is referral to hospice made?,"""Referral to hospice is considered when a physician believes the patient's life expectancy is less than six months if the disease runs its natural course. Clinical guidelines are available to help clinicians with these determinations.""""The option for hospice is then presented to the patient or their surrogate decision makers. If the patient's or their decision makers' goals and wishes are in line with hospice principles, then a formal referral can be made by the doctor.""""Hospice staff meet with the patient and family to discuss hospice services. They evaluate the patient's medical condition, functional level, living situation, religious beliefs, and social support system. They determine long-term goals, wishes, and expectations of the patient and family members.""'Once criteria for a terminal diagnosis are established and the patient and family consent to hospice care, a two-physician certification has to be signed certifying the terminal illness and appropriateness of hospice. The hospice certificate is typically signed by the referring physician and the hospice medical director.' "
How does hospice care work?,"""Hospice strives to optimize comfort and quality of the remaining life and to preserve patient's dignity. The patient agrees to forego further treatment aimed at curing their disease. A comprehensive care plan consistent with the patient's goals and wishes is established.""""Routine home visits from nurses, social workers, clergy, volunteers, caregivers, and home aids are provided. The frequency of these visits may vary considerably for each patient's individual situation. Hospice nurses visit the patient at least once or twice a week, but these visits can increase to as often as daily in a crisis situation. Other staff may also attend to the patient as frequently as the patient's care mandates.""""For patients living in assisted-living facilities or nursing homes, collaborative hospice services are coordinated with the facility's own staff.""'Hospice medical directors or other hospice contracted doctors are available to the hospice team by phone 24/7 to address any issues that may arise at any time with patients.'""The patient's personal physician or primary care physician can stay on as the attending physician if he or she chooses to. In these situations, the primary doctor can work in collaboration with the hospice team and the hospice medical director. If the primary care physician decides not to follow the patient on hospice, then the hospice medical director acts as the patient's primary care physician.""""Home visits by hospice doctors are sometimes necessary in cases of crisis or in situations where a physician's expertise is necessary in the care of the patient. Furthermore, since the beginning of 2011, Medicare has mandated more frequent doctor visits if a patient remains on hospice beyond six months. A face-to-face patient encounter is required every 60 days to justify continual hospice care.""'Medications for treating pain and other symptoms, as well as medical supplies and equipment, are part of the care provided by hospice for their patients.''Generally, therapies that are thought to be a cure for the underlying hospice condition are not offered. For example, a patient who has a terminal cancer as their hospice diagnosis may not receive any further ''chemotherapy'' and ''radiation'' for a curative purpose while on hospice. However, if such a therapy is offered to relieve an intractable symptom (for a palliative reason), some hospices may agree to cover these costs.' "
Who is part of the hospice team?,"'At the very core of every hospice there are four required components: medical doctors, nurses, social workers, and chaplains.''In addition to these core components, essentially all hospices benefit from involvement of other support staff who make irreplaceable contributions to patient care and are vital to survival of hospice organizations. Contributions of these team members vary between hospices and depend on the plan of care of the patients.''Hospice volunteers are an integral part of the hospice team. They assist patients with meal preparation, running errands, companionship, basic needs around the house, and other projects to help the patient and the family. Certified home health aides are another important part of hospice care. Home aides are usually employed by hospice and help patients and families with personal care such as assistance with bathing, feeding, and other basic needs.''Hospices often utilize other ancillary staff including''Less commonly, some hospices may utilize the expertise of acupuncturists, music therapists, ''massage'"" therapists, psychologists, or art therapists if these services are thought to improve the patient's symptoms or overall quality of life.""'Hospice patients are always (24 hours a day, seven days a week) under the care of the hospice medical directors through nurses and other hospice team members.'""An essential component of hospice care is the interdisciplinary team (or IDT) meeting which takes place every two weeks. During the IDT, each patient's progress, active issues, and overall plan of care are thoroughly reviewed by the hospice medical directors, nurses, social workers, volunteers, chaplain, and other ancillary staff who are involved in the patient's care.""'Because hospice care is centered around the patient as a whole, the recommendations and input from each team member in IDT contribute meaningfully to the overall plan of care.' nurse assistants and LVN (licensed vocational nurses), dieticians or nutritionists, speech, physical, occupational therapists, bereavement counselors, respiratory therapists, pharmacists."
What is respite care?,"""Respite care is a rest period provided for hospice patients' families or caregivers. In cases where a patient's ""'caregiver'' (either family or private caregiver) has an emergency or simply needs to rest temporarily from the burden of ''caregiving'' responsibilities, respite care can be arranged.''During respite care, a hospice patient can be moved for a period of up to five days to a nursing home while caregivers can take a brief time off. This period allows the family or the caregiver to address their own issues or simply take a much needed rest. After the respite period, the patient can return home.' "
Who is eligible for hospice care?,"'As a general guideline, hospice is recommended to a patient with an incurable terminal disease with a life expectancy of six months or less if the disease were to run its normal course.''Although this is the rule by which Medicare defines hospice eligibility, it is not always possible to predict whether an individual will live less than six months. Therefore, certain clinical criteria are in place for common hospice diagnoses. Physicians can use these guidelines to assess whether someone is a candidate for hospice referral.'""In addition to disease specific criteria, there are also other general guidelines for hospice eligibility. These guidelines are based on the patient's functional status and physical signs and symptoms which can indicate advanced stages of a disease regardless of the diagnosis.""'Even with these guidelines in place, many patients outlive the six-month period on hospice. If this happens, hospice can thoroughly reassess the overall condition of the patient and determine whether there are signs of ongoing clinical decline. They can then recertify the patient to remain on hospice if there is evidence of disease progression.'""Sometimes, the disease may stabilize, or the patient's condition may show evidence of improvement during hospice care. In these situations, hospice will terminate hospice care and the patient can resume their routine health-insurance benefits which they had prior to the hospice enrollment."" "
Who pays for hospice care?,'Medicare recipients are entitled to receive Medicare hospice benefits under Medicare Part A. Most state Medicaid programs also cover these services. The majority of private insurance carriers have hospice benefits as well.' 
How can people find and choose hospice care?,"'There are numerous choices for hospice care in every state, county, and city. The list of hospice companies for patients to choose from varies based on the location.''Although hospices typically offer the same basic requirements and focus on the comfort and quality of life, there is also some degree of flexibility and variation among different hospice agencies.''Your physicians or local hospitals may recommend a hospice for you. Most physicians are familiar with local hospice organizations and can refer patients or provide a list of what is available.''The following lists some general resources for people who are interested in more information about hospice in their local areas:'   Primary care physician, specialists, or hospital doctor (hospitalist) Local hospitals and urgent care centers Medical social workers Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities State health department Health insurance carrier Local home health agencies Phonebook The Internet"
What questions should people ask of hospice agencies?,"'Most people are concerned about the how the cost of hospice is covered. Medicare hospice benefit is a part of Medicare which would cover hospice care once a Medicare beneficiary is enrolled in hospice. Most other private insurance plans also carry their own hospice benefits.'""Many people want to know whether they should continue taking their regular medication while on hospice. This depends on the patient's goals, medical condition, prognosis, and the indication for these medications. In general, most medication can be continued as long as they do not interfere with patient's comfort and are not taken as a potential cure for the hospice qualifying condition. Most people prefer to take fewer pills. They can ask hospice which medications they can safely discontinue without an untoward reaction.""'Many people may have difficulty with having their loved ones die at home or simply are unable to provide the level of care that is needed. Hospice agencies often have relationships are local assisted-living facilities which can accommodate hospice patients, usually at an additional cost. Alternatively, sometimes Medicaid plans can cover some of the room and board cost at these rest homes.''Many patients and families are concerned whether they can receive treatment for infections such as ''pneumonia'' or urine infection. Hospices are flexible in terms of their approach to treating reversible infections. Most, but not all, offer diagnostic tests and antibiotics. It is important to address these concerns during the initial hospice evaluation.''Others want to know if they can still see their own regular physicians. As mentioned earlier, primary care doctors can continue to follow their patients on hospice and even make home visits.'""Hospitalizations are covered if someone's symptoms are out of control despite routine hospice care at home. Patients can also be hospitalized for conditions unrelated to the hospice diagnosis. For example, if a patient with cancer suffers a fall and has a ""'hip fracture'"", hospitalization may be required to fix the fracture. In this scenario, the patient's insurance usually covers the hospitalization in addition to the hospice benefits.""'7. Other than medication and equipments, what other services does hospice offer?''Ancillary services such as nutritionists, therapists, and home health aides provide valuable services for hospice patients. The degree to which every hospice utilizes these services varies widely. Sometimes these additional interventions are important to patients and their families. Thus, it is advisable to discuss the availability of these services with the hospice representatives.' "
Where can a person find more information about hospice care?,"""A good starting point for people to find out more information about hospice care is their primary care doctor's office or local clinics and hospitals.""'Other than the resources listed previously, one can also search the Internet for more information or refer to the following:' National Hospice and Palliative Care Organizationhttp://www.nhpco.org/templates/1/homepage.cfm The National Association for Home Care and Hospicehttp://www.nahc.org National Institute of Health (NIH)http://www.nih.gov Hospice Medicine Foundationhttp://www.hospicemedicinefoundation.org American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicinehttp://www.aahpm.org/index.html Medicare publications and web sitehttp://www.cms.gov State Medicaid publications"
Facts you should know about hot flashes,"   Hot flashes are feelings of warmth that spread over the body and last from 30 seconds to a few minutes. Hot flashes may be accompanied by redness of the skin, known as flushing, and excessive sweating. Hot flashes are a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition (perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause) in women, but may occasionally result from other medical conditions. About 70% of women will experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition. Hot flashes in men, young women, or during pregnancy may be due to medical conditions that interfere with the body’s ability regulate temperature. Hot flashes may be treated by hormone therapy or other medications if necessary. Natural home remedies for hot flashes have been proposed and may provide relief for some women; the effectiveness of other alternative treatments has not been adequately scientifically evaluated."
What are hot flashes?,"'A hot flash is a sensation of heat that begins in the head and neck regions. Hot flashes are a common symptom experienced by women prior to, and during the early stages of the menopausal transition. However, not all women approaching the ''menopause'' will develop hot flashes.' "
How long do hot flashes last?,"'Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes.'""The question of how long during a woman's lifetime that hot flashes last is a different one. Traditionally, it was believed that women only experienced hot flashes for a few years. More recent data suggest that many women may experience hot flashes for longer time periods. In a study from the University of Pennsylvania, the mean duration of hot flashes was 4.9 years, but up to a third of women continued to have hot flashes for up to 10 years. In the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN), women had hot flashes for an average of 7.4 years total and for an average of 4.5 years after the ""'last menstrual period''.' "
What causes hot flashes?,"'The complex hormonal changes that accompany the ''aging'' process, in particular the declining levels of estrogen as a woman approaches ''menopause'', are thought to be the underlying cause of hot flashes. A disorder in thermoregulation (methods the body uses to control and regulate body temperature) is responsible for the heat sensation, but the exact way in which the changing hormone levels affect thermoregulation is not fully understood.''Hot flashes are considered to be a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition. They also occur in men and in circumstances other than the ''perimenopause'' in women (such as young women or during pregnancy) as a result of certain uncommon medical conditions that affect the process of thermoregulation. For example, the ''carcinoid syndrome'', which results from a type of endocrine ''tumor'' that secretes large amounts of the hormone serotonin can cause hot flashes. Hot flashes can also develop as a side effect of some medications and sometimes occur with severe infections or ''cancers'' that may be associated with ''fevers'' and/or ''night sweats''.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of hot flashes?,"'The timing of the onset of hot flashes in women approaching menopause is variable.'   Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes. Redness of the skin, known as flushing, may accompany hot flashes. Excessive perspiration (sweating) can also occur; when hot flashes occur during sleep they may be accompanied by night sweats. Feelings of anxiety may accompany hot flashes. Occasionally, palpitations (feelings of a racing heart beat) may occur during hot flashes. While not all women will experience hot flashes, many normally menstruating women will begin experiencing hot flashes even several years prior to the cessation of menstrual periods. It is impossible to predict if a woman will experience hot flashes, and if she does, when they will begin. About 40% to 85% of women experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition."
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of hot flashes?,"'Hot flashes are a symptom, not a medical condition. Taking a thorough medical history, the health-care professional will usually be able to determine whether a woman is having hot flashes. The patient will be asked to describe the hot flashes, including how often and when they occur, and if there are other associated symptoms. A physical examination together with the medical history can help determine the cause of the hot flashes and direct further testing if necessary.''Blood tests may be performed if the diagnosis is unclear, either to measure hormone levels or to look for signs of other conditions (such as infection) that could be responsible for the hot flashes.' "
What are the treatments for hot flashes?,"'There are a variety of treatments for hot flashes such as:''Some of these have not been tested by clinical studies, nor are they approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'   hormone therapy, bioidentical hormone therapy, other drug treatments, complementary and alternative treatments, phytoestrogens, black cohosh, and alternative therapies."
Hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'Traditionally, hot flashes have been treated with either oral or transdermal (such as a patch) forms of estrogen. Hormone therapy (HT) or ''postmenopausal'' hormone therapy (PHT), formerly referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT''), consists of ''estrogens'' alone or a combination of estrogens and ''progesterone'' (progestin). All available prescription estrogen medications, whether oral or transdermal, are effective in reducing the frequency of hot flashes and their severity. Research indicates that these medications decrease the frequency of hot flashes.''However, long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women receiving combined hormone therapy with both estrogen and progesterone were halted when it was discovered that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive hormone therapy. Later studies of women taking estrogen therapy alone showed that estrogen was associated with an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for heart attack or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''More recently, it has been noted that the negative effects associated with hormone therapy were described in older women who were years beyond menopause, and some researchers have suggested that these negative outcomes might be lessened or prevented if hormone therapy was given to younger women (prior to or around the age of menopause) instead of women years beyond menopause.'""The decision in regard to starting or continuing hormone therapy, therefore, is an individual one in which the patient and doctor must take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. It is currently recommended that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time."" "
Bioidentical hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Other prescription drug treatments for hot flashes," The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications have been shown be effective in reducing menopausal hot flashes. These drugs are generally used in the treatment of depression and anxiety as well as other condition. Paroxetine (Brisdelle) is an SSRI approved to treat moderate to severe hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine (Catapres) is an anti-hypertensive drug that can relieve hot flashes in some women. Clonidine is taken either by pill or skin patch and decreases blood pressure. Side effects of clonidine can include dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, or difficulty sleeping. Gabapentin (Neurontin), a drug primarily used for the treatment of seizures, has also been effective in treating hot flashes. Megestrol acetate (Megace) is a progestin that is sometimes prescribed over a short-term to help relieve hot flashes, but this drug is not usually recommended as a first-line treatment for hot flashes. Serious side effects can occur if the medication is abruptly discontinued. Megestrol may have the side effect of weight gain. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) is another progestin drug and is administered by injection to treat hot flashes. It may lead to weight gain as well as bone loss."
What natural and home remedies treat hot flashes?,"'Some women report that ''exercise'' programs or relaxation methods have helped to control hot flashes, but controlled studies have failed to show a benefit of these practices in relieving the symptoms of hot flashes. Maintaining a cool ''sleep'' environment and the use of cotton bedclothes can help ease some of the discomfort associated with hot flashes and associated night sweats.''Many women turn to alternative therapies, including herbal products, ''vitamins'', plant estrogens, and other substances, for the treatment of hot flashes. Doctors can be reluctant to recommend alternative treatments because these nonprescription products are not regulated by the FDA (like prescription medications), and their ingredients and strength can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For products that are not regulated by the FDA, testing and proof of safety is not required for marketing of these products. Long-term, scientifically controlled studies for these products are either lacking or have not proved the safely and effectiveness of many of the so-called natural or alternative remedies.''Some alternative treatments, however, have been evaluated in well-designed ''clinical trials''. Alternative treatments that have been scientifically studied with some research include phytoestrogens (plant estrogens, isoflavones), black cohosh, and ''vitamin E''.'  "
Black cohosh for hot flashes,"'Black cohosh is an herbal preparation that is becoming more and more popular in the U.S., and the North American Menopause Society does support the short-term use of black cohosh for treating menopausal symptoms, for a period of up to six months (because of its relatively low incidence of side effects when used over the short-term).''Some studies have shown that black cohosh can reduce hot flashes, but most of the studies have not been considered to be rigorous enough in their design to firmly prove any benefit. There also have not been scientific studies done to establish the long-term benefits and safety of this product. Research is ongoing to further determine the effectiveness and safety of black cohosh.' "
Soy and other plant sources for menopause symptoms,"'Isoflavones are chemical compounds found in ''soy'' and other plants (such as chick peas and lentils) that are phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens. They have a chemical structure that is similar to the estrogens naturally produced by the body, but their effectiveness as an estrogen has been determined to be much lower than true estrogens.''Some studies have shown that these compounds may help relieve hot flashes and other ''symptoms of menopause''. In particular, women who have had ''breast cancer'' and do not want to take hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen sometimes use soy products for relief of menopausal symptoms. However, some phytoestrogens can actually have anti-estrogenic properties in certain situations, and the overall risks of these preparations have not yet been determined.''There is also a perception among many women that plant estrogens are ""natural"" and therefore safer than hormone therapy, but this has never been proven scientifically. Further research is needed to fully characterize the safety and potential risks of phytoestrogens.' "
"Other vitamins, herbs, and supplements","'There are many other ''supplements'' and substances that have been used as treatments for symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, including:''For more information, please read our ''Alternative Treatments for Hot Flashes'' article.''Scientific studies to prove the safety and effectiveness of these products in relieving hot flashes have not been adequately performed.' vitamin E, licorice, evening primrose oil, dong quai, chasteberry, and wild yam."
Which type of doctor treats hot flashes?,"'Many women will consult their gynecologist for the management of hot flashes associated with approaching menopause. Hot flashes are also treated by primary care providers, including internists and family practitioners. Hot flashes related to uncommon conditions, serious infections, or cancers are treated by the specialists treating the underlying condition.' "
Is it possible to prevent hot flashes?,"'While the development of hot flashes cannot be prevented, the treatment methods as described in the above section may be able to reduce their incidence and severity.' "
How are intrauterine devices fitted?,"'Inserting an ''intrauterine device'' (''IUD'') is a simple procedure that takes a few minutes. An IUD is a small, T-shaped device made from ''plastic'"" or\xa0 copper that is placed\xa0in a woman's womb to prevent ""'pregnancy''. An IUD is a reversible ''contraceptive'' that can provide contraceptive protection for up to 10 years.' Before an IUD is fitted, a doctor or nurse may examine the vagina. The doctor or nurse may test patients for any existing infections, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and may give antibiotics if needed. Having an IUD fitted can be uncomfortable. Hence, the doctor or nurse may give local anesthesia to patients to numb the pain. Having a coil fitted takes less than 10 minutes in the doctor’s clinic. A type of instrument called speculum is lubricated and inserted into the vagina, and the coil is inserted through the cervix (neck of the womb).  It can feel slightly uncomfortable and can cause some period-like pains afterward. However, painkillers can ease the cramps. Patients may also bleed for a few days after having an IUD fitted. Once an IUD has been fitted, it may need to be checked by a doctor after three to six weeks to make sure everything is fine."
How does an IUD work?,"""An intrauterine device (IUD) works by\xa0stopping a man's sperm from meeting an egg or it may also stop a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. The IUD sits in the womb and does not move from there. There are threads attached to the IUD that hang down into the vagina that assist with removal (which should not be pulled). The IUD starts working as soon as it is put in and stops working as soon as it is taken out. The advantages include"" It can be inserted easily by a trained doctor. It is effective immediately and it protects against pregnancy for 5 or 10 years, depending on the type. It is easy to use (nothing to remember after insertion). It can be easily removed. It's possible to get pregnant as soon as the IUD is removed. It works as soon as it's put in. There are no hormonal side effects such as acne, headaches or breast tenderness. Fertility returns immediately after it’s removed. It does not interrupt sex. The woman’s partner will not know about it. It's safe to use an IUD if a woman is breastfeeding. It's not affected by other medicines. The IUD is 99% effective, if used correctly, during the course of 5 years, Less than 1% women using the IUD may become pregnant."
What are disadvantages and risks of IUD?,"'Although these side effects are uncommon, an intrauterine device (IUD) has disadvantages that include''Risks' Periods may become heavier, longer or more painful, although this may improve after a few months. It does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so condoms are still recommended during intercourse. Rarely, an IUD can lead to pelvic infection if not treated. Most women who stop using an IUD do so because of vaginal bleeding and pain, although these side effects are uncommon. Damage to the womb: In rare cases, an IUD can make a hole in the womb when it's put in. This may be painful, but often, there are no symptoms. A woman who experiences extreme pain should notify the doctor immediately and may sometimes require a surgery to remove it.  Ectopic pregnancy: If an IUD fails and the patient becomes pregnant, there's also a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is the medical condition in which implantation of an embryo occurs outside the uterine cavity, most commonly in the fallopian tube. Rejection: Rarely, an IUD can be rejected (expelled) by the womb, or it can move (displacement). If this happens, it's usually soon after it's been fitted. Infections: Thrush and pelvic infections are sometimes associated with IUD fitting."
What are the different choices of IUD?,"'The common choices include''Copper coil (intrauterine device, IUD)''Hormonal coil' The copper coil does not have any hormones and works by preventing fertilization or implantation of the fertilized egg. The copper coil is effective immediately after insertion and can be inserted at any time in the menstrual cycle if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant. The copper coil is one of the first choices for an emergency contraception method. The patient may be asked to abstain from sex for 7days prior to and after the IUD is fitted. The woman may be asked to continue with her current contraception until 7 days after the IUD has been fitted. The main way this works is by thinning the lining of the womb and creating a thicker mucosal plug in the lower part of the womb to prevent sperm movement."
How are nasal polyps removed?,"'The surgical removal of ''nasal polyps'' is known as nasal polypectomy.\xa0''The procedure is mainly performed under local anesthesia or general anesthesia. The physician relieves ''congestion'' of the nose using oxymetazoline drops or pellets. The polyps are removed with the help of polyp forceps without injuring the surrounding tissue. Generally, polyps are removed from inside to the outside to prevent bleeding. Absorbable packing may be placed sideways to the nasal opening to absorb any blood.''In endoscopic surgery, the surgeon inserts a small tube with a tiny camera (an endoscope) into the nostrils and guides it into the sinus ''cavities''. A tiny instrument that is attached is used to remove polyps or other tissues that block the flow of fluids from the sinuses. Endoscopic surgery avoids the need to make an external incision on the face.''A ''corticosteroid'' nasal spray may prevent the recurrence of nasal polyps. The surgeon may also recommend the use of saline water rinse to encourage post-surgery healing for the next three days.' "
What are nasal polyps?,"'Nasal polyps are teardrop-like, clustered noncancerous growths that line the nasal passages and sinuses. They are mostly soft and painless and are usually associated with''Larger nasal polyps can lead to the following''Nasal polyps are mostly seen in adults. However, they can affect individuals of any age.''Conditions often associated with nasal polyps include' Asthma Recurring infection Allergies Drug sensitivity Immune disorders  Cystic fibrosis Breathing problems Anosmia (loss of sense of smell) Frequent infections Hyposmia (decreased sense of smell) Facial pain Headache Pain in the upper teeth Snoring Frequent nosebleeds Persistent stuffiness Postnasal drip Pressure feeling over the forehead or face Asthma Aspirin sensitivity Allergic fungal sinusitis (allergy to airborne fungi) Cystic fibrosis (a genetic disorder that results in production of thick, sticky fluids in the body) Churg-Strauss syndrome (a disease that causes inflammation of the blood vessels) Vitamin-D deficiency "
What is a nasal polypectomy?,'Nasal polypectomy is a surgical procedure to remove nasal polyps in the nasal passages. Nasal polyps affect 2% to 5% of the population. It is indicated for uncontrolled symptoms or symptoms that are not controlled by medications.''Nasal polypectomy should be avoided in patients with the following conditions' Heart disease Lung disease Bleeding disorders Poorly controlled diabetes Asthma Asymptomatic diseases
What are the complications of nasal polypectomy?,'The possible complications of nasal polypectomy include' Bleeding Local infection Eye problems Cerebrospinal fluid leaks (leakage of fluid present in the spinal cord and brain) Synechia (adhesion of body parts) Nasofrontal duct stenosis (obstruction in the passage connecting the sinus with the cavity of the nose) Mucocele (mucus-filled cyst that may appear in the oral cavity)
Can nasal polyps be prevented?,"'The following strategies may reduce your chances of developing nasal polyps' Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly. Avoid nose picking. This is one of the best ways to protect against bacterial and viral infections that can cause inflammation of the nasal passages and sinuses. Manage allergies and asthma: Always discuss your optimal medicine doses with your doctor and follow your medication schedule. Avoid nasal irritants: Allergens, tobacco smoke, chemical fumes, incense, dust and fine debris may make you prone to allergies. Try and stay away from those. Humidify your home: Use a humidifier to help moisten your breathing passages, improve the flow of mucus from your sinuses and help prevent blockages and inflammation. Clean the humidifier daily to prevent bacteria from growing."
What can cause a second-degree burn?,'A ''second-degree burn'' is commonly caused by:' Severe sunburn (usually in fair-skinned persons) Spilling of boiling water Exposure to a flash of flame (such as from ovens and stoves) Grabbing a falling curling iron by the heated end Chemicals such as bleaching agents and acids

How is a second-degree burn treated?,"'A second-degree burn is an emergency condition and needs medical attention. While you wait for the doctor, the following steps can be initiated:''Medical treatment depends on how severe the burn is and where it is located.' Allow the burn to cool by pouring cool water on it. But avoid using ice. Stay hydrated (drink plenty of water or electrolyte drinks). Cover the burn with a loose dressing. Avoid applying butter or oil immediately on the burnt skin. A doctor applies an antibiotic cream after cleaning the burn wound. If there are chances of the burn wound getting infected, the doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics or inject the same through your veins (intravenously). The doctor will administer intravenous fluids for rapid rehydration. Skin grafting may be needed in deeper second-degree burns. This means the burnt skin will be replenished with healthy skin (removed from another region of your body)."

Sleep requirements by age,"'Adequate quantity and quality of ''sleep'' are important for you to stay healthy, both mentally and physically. While for a blessed few dozing off is an easy affair, going to ''sleep'' can be a struggle for many. Not sleeping enough may interfere with your ability to focus on daily tasks, thus affecting your performance at work or school. It can also harm health in several ways. Long-term ''insomnia'' (inability to sleep) may lead to various medical conditions, such as ''high blood pressure'', ''obesity'', ''heart disease'' and mental disorders including ''anxiety'' and ''depression''. The amount of sleep needed may vary with age. In certain special situations, such as women in the first three months of ''pregnancy'', individuals may require more hours of sleep.

Which foods help you sleep faster?,"'Certain foods and ''drinks'' may help you get a good night’s sleep. These include''Apart from these foods and exercises, a proper sleep environment is paramount. The room where you sleep must be cool and dark with no disturbing noises. The bed must be firm and the pillow must provide proper support to the neck.' Foods rich in tryptophan: Tryptophan is a natural sleep-promoting substance. Tryptophan-rich foods include milk, bananas, nuts, honey, chicken, turkey and eggs. Complex carbs: Whole grains, in contrast to refined foods, help you sleep faster and better. Your bedtime snacks should preferably be popcorn, oatmeal and whole-wheat crackers. To enhance the taste, you can top any of these with nut butter. Fish: Fish is rich in vitamin B6. The vitamin is needed to make melatonin in the body. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate the sleep/wake cycle. A handful of nuts: Apart from being rich in healthy fats, nuts like almonds and walnuts contain melatonin. Eating them can help you sleep more soundly. Kale: This leafy green is high in calcium and puts the sleep hormones to work to ensure you enjoy a good slumber. Honey in warm beverages: Add some honey to warm beverages like chamomile or peppermint tea or just plain warm water. The concoction relaxes your mind. Honey lowers the level of orexin, a chemical found in the body that makes you more alert and facilitates falling asleep. Fruits: Fruits like tart cherries, bananas, pineapple and oranges reduce the oxidative stress in the body and give a boost to your sleep hormones, making you sleep faster and wake up less frequently at night. Having two kiwis before bed has been found to increase sleep duration by an hour over a month in people who chronically suffer from lack of sleep."

When do I need surgery for rectocele?,"'A rectocele does not heal on its own. It requires medical therapy and/or surgical treatment. If left untreated, it can worsen the existing symptoms and affect your quality of life greatly. However, not everyone will need immediate surgery. The reasons for which you need surgery for rectocele are:' The rectocele prolapse protrudes outside your vagina making defecation and sex uncomfortable. Apart from the rectum, other organs in the pelvic region, such as the vaginal wall or bladder, have also collapsed into the vagina."
What is an eye twitch?,"'A ''blepharospasm'' (''eye twitch'') is a harmless, involuntary spasm of the muscle of the eyelids, which may resolve on its own. Eye twitch causes the ''eyelid'' to blink every few seconds for a minute or two. Twitches are generally painless, however, if there’s a strong spasm, it causes the eyelid to shut completely and then reopen.''Twitches can be caused due to:' Fatigue Stress Smoking Caffeine Medication side effects Light sensitivity Lack of sleep Foreign particles in the eye Corneal irritation"
What is a twitching eye a sign of?,"'Eye twitching is generally painless and harmless and does not signify any serious medical conditions. However, persistent eye twitching can be a sign of more serious conditions like:' Blepharitis (inflamed eyelids) Dry eyes Light sensitivity Conjunctivitis or pink eye Very rarely, eye twitching can be a sign of a nerve or brain disorder like: Bell's palsy (a form of facial paralysis due to dysfunction of facial nerves) Dystonia (involuntary muscle contractions) Parkinson's disease (a brain disorder caused due to nerve cell damage) Tourette's syndrome (a nervous system disorder causing the person to make sudden movements) Certain medicines like antidepressant drugs and epilepsy medicines can cause the eyes to twitch"
What are the different types of eye twitches?,"'There are three types of eye twitches, which are:' Minor eyelid twitches: These are normal twitches commonly associated with fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, caffeine or alcohol; corneal or conjunctival irritation. Benign essential blepharospasm: This results in nonstop blinking or eye irritation. As the condition advances, it can result in blurry vision, light sensitivity and facial spasms. Benign essential blepharospasm is caused due to fatigue, stress and bright light or wind. Hemifacial spasm: This rare condition affects the muscles around the mouth and the eyelid. It generally affects only one side of the face."
When should an eye twitch be treated?,"'Seek medical attention in the following conditions:' Twitch that lasts for more than a week Eyelid closes completely Spasms of other facial muscles Redness, swelling or discharge from the eye Drooping of the upper eyelid"
How can I get my eye to stop twitching?,"'Twitches generally stop without any major effort. If it doesn’t go away, you might try these techniques to ease eye twitching''The physician might inject botulinum toxin (''botox'') to treat serious conditions like benign essential blepharospasm or hemifacial spasm. Botox is prescribed for temporary relief, and you should undergo repeated treatment for complete relief.''The physicians commonly prescribe medications like ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''), ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') or trihexyphenidyl\xa0hydrochloride (Artane,\xa0Trihexane, Tritane) to treat mild cases.''There are some alternative therapies, which include:' Get adequate rest Cut down alcohol, tobacco or caffeine Apply a  warm compress to your eyes Use artificial tears to keep the eye surfaces lubricated Biofeedback: This technique helps to control the involuntary muscle using relaxation exercises and methods. Acupuncture: Thin needles are inserted to the pressure points to relieve twitching Hypnosis Chiropractic measures: This technique involves hands-on spinal manipulation to heal twitching Diet management Tinted glasses or sunglasses As a last resort, the physician might perform a surgical myectomy, i.e., removal of muscle and nerve ending around your eyelid to relieve spasm."
Step 1: Boost your calcium levels,"'Why?''How?' Calcium forms the major component of strong bones. It has been found that Americans’ diets have insufficient daily calcium intake. Get your calcium and Vitamin D levels checked if you suspect your bones are weak. Postmenopausal women should make sure they get at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium from their daily diet. Consider taking calcium supplements, such as calcium carbonate or calcium citrate, if your diet fails to supply an adequate amount of calcium."
Step 2: Increase your Vitamin D levels,"'Why?''How?' Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium.  At a young age, our skin produces enough Vitamin D on exposure to the sun, but this capacity decreases with aging. Get your Vitamin D levels checked if reduced calcium levels are not improving even with an increase in your calcium intake. Spending time under the sun is one of the best ways to improve Vitamin D levels. Postmenopausal women should get at least 400 IU to 600 IU of Vitamin D daily for better bone health. Eat fatty fish, seafood, and look for foods fortified with Vitamin D."
Step 3: Consume enough protein,"'Why?''How?' Apart from calcium, your bones are also made up of protein. Inadequate protein intake harms bone health in the elderly. A higher protein diet increases a key chemical that enhances bone health, improves intestinal calcium absorption, and improves muscle strength and mass, all of which may benefit the skeleton. Eat high protein foods, such as lean meat, fish, eggs, and nuts."
Step 4: Include more veggies and fruits in your diet,"'Why?''How?' Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals, some of which are necessary for bone healing after a fracture. They have been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD). A study showed that a dietary pattern rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce your chances of getting broken bones, especially hip fractures. Replace the high-fat, sugar-loaded, and processed foods with vegetables and fruits."
Step 5: Be physically active: Load your skeleton,"'Why?''How?' A complete lack of activity causes bone loss. Continued physical activity stimulates the strengthening of bone and muscle. Putting pressure/stress on the bones to work through weight-bearing exercises strengthens them. You can start with simple activities like walking, jogging, or weight training exercises. You should engage in at least 30 minutes (adults) of moderate physical activity every day. Core strengthening exercises should also be a part of your exercises. These include abdominal exercises, lower back exercises, yoga, and tai chi."
Step 6: Cut back on smoking and alcohol,"'Why?''How?' Tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption contribute to bone loss. Consume alcoholic drinks in moderation (i.e., one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men). Get yourself enrolled in a program that can help you quit smoking."
Step 7: Discuss with your doctor,"'Why?''How?''Asking some important questions to your doctor can help. Examples include:' There are factors, such as certain medications you are taking for some other illness, that may weaken your bones. Some may cause dizziness and make you prone to falls. Talking about such things with your doctor can help prevent osteoporosis and fractures. What is the best calcium to take? Am I taking on any medication that puts me at risk for falls or fractures? What should I do to prevent falls? What exercises are suitable for me and what are not?"
Step 8: Take a BMD test,"'Why?''How?' A BMD test is the only way that measures your bone health and lets you know whether you are at risk for osteoporosis and fractures. You can ask your doctor if you can undergo a BMD test. A small, portable machine uses X-rays to capture the bones present at the far ends of your skeleton, such as those in your finger, wrist, or heel."
Improve kidney health,"'Kidneys are vital organs involved in performing several important functions in the body. Almost a third of the adults in the United States are at risk of developing kidney diseases. People who are on long-term medications or suffering from conditions such as ''diabetes'' and ''hypertension'' have a higher risk of kidney diseases. Unfortunately, most people with kidney diseases develop noticeable symptoms very late. Thus, by the time they are diagnosed, a lot of irreversible damage would have already occurred, and they are left with two options: ''dialysis'' or a ''kidney transplant''.\xa0''Kidneys perform various functions such as:''Several conditions can put a person at risk of kidney diseases. These include:''It is important to look after the kidneys and get regular check-ups done, particularly if you are at risk of kidney diseases.\xa0''The risk of developing kidney diseases may vary from person to person. There are certain nonmodifiable factors such as age and genetics or family history of kidney diseases that may put you at risk. You can, however, manage the modifiable factors such as a healthy ''diet'' and lifestyle to protect yourself from the risk of developing kidney diseases.\xa0''Below are nine tips through which you can improve your kidney health:' Regulate proper salt–water balance in the body Filter various wastes and toxic products from the body Maintain adequate electrolyte (such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus) balance in the body Regulate optimum blood pressure Maintain healthy bones by activating vitamin D Maintain healthy levels of red blood cells in the body High blood pressure Diabetes Cigarette smoking Obesity Heart diseases Family history of kidney diseases Long-term use of certain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (painkillers) Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple myeloma Kidney stones Chronic (long-term) urinary tract infections Old age Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of fluids is important to keep your kidneys healthy. The optimum fluid intake depends on several factors such as physical activity, climate, and health conditions. It is advisable to drink around two liters of fluids each day if you are healthy and in a comfortable climate condition. You may consult your health provider to know about your individual fluid needs. Keep yourself active: Regular physical activity protects from kidney diseases and risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight or obese may put you at risk of kidney diseases. Eat healthily: Consuming fruits and vegetables and avoiding processed and fatty foods can help you keep your kidneys healthy. Limit your total salt consumption to 5-6 g a day. Regulate your blood pressure: Keep a check on your blood pressure. Take appropriate medications and adopt a healthy lifestyle in consultation with your doctor. Keep your blood sugars controlled: Many people with diabetes are diagnosed late. You must check your blood sugar regularly based on the risk factor for diabetes you may have. Kidney damage due to diabetes can be prevented by keeping the blood sugars controlled. Quit smoking: Smoking in any form, active, passive, or vaping, is bad for your kidneys. Smoking can also increase the risk of heart diseases and kidney cancer. Avoid regular intake of over-the-counter pain medications: Long-term use of pain medications such as NSAIDs can damage your kidneys.  Get your kidney functions checked if you are at risk: People with risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and a family history of kidney diseases must get themselves regularly examined to exclude the development of kidney disorders. Getting checked for urine protein or microalbuminuria (trace protein in urine) six monthly is a good way to chart your kidney function if you have diabetes or hypertension. The positive test indicates injury to the kidney, which is still reversible."
Increase Pregnancy Chance,"'You and your partner in a good state of health, both mentally and physically, is the first requisite''You and your partner in a good state of health, both mentally and physically, is the first requisite for increasing your chances of ''getting pregnant''. Making healthy choices, such as regular physical activity, healthy ''diet'', and ''stress''-relieving activities may increase your chances to get ''pregnant'' and have a healthy baby thereafter. You must not be disheartened if you are not able to conceive in the first year of trying as many couples conceive in their second year of planning a ''pregnancy''.''Some of the following tips may help you get pregnant and have a healthy pregnancy:' Maintaining a healthy weight: If you or your partner are overweight/obese or underweight, your chances of getting pregnant may be affected. Being overweight or underweight can affect your periods. It can make you get irregular periods or no periods at all. Thus, affecting your ability to conceive. A healthy weight means that your BMI (body mass index) falls between 18.5 and 24.9. A BMI below 18.5 means you are underweight while having a BMI over 24.9 means that you are overweight. Regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you achieve a healthy weight. You can take the help of your doctor to know how you can achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Go for a pre-conception checkup: Before you conceive, it is advisable to consult your doctor. They will screen you for any infections or other health conditions and provide the necessary treatment. Many conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and asthma, may affect your chances of getting pregnant. Your doctor will help you manage them so that you have a safe and healthy pregnancy. They may also prescribe certain vitamins, such as folic acid, to prevent the baby against birth defects like spina bifida. Quit smoking and alcohol consumption: Smoking as well as being exposed to passive smoking can decrease fertility in both men and women. It can also harm the baby. Health experts recommend that women who are pregnant or are planning to get pregnant should completely avoid alcohol. Alcohol consumption can decrease the chances of conceiving and can cause various birth defects in the baby. Know your menstrual cycle: Knowing your menstrual cycle will help you know the days when you are most likely to get pregnant. In a typical menstrual cycle of around 28 days, ovulation happens on the 14th day. There are about 6 days in each menstrual cycle when you are most likely to conceive. Since different women have different length of menstrual cycles, ask your doctor to guide you about your fertile days. Lie in bed for some time after intercourse: Experts suggest that lying in the bed for 10 to 15 minutes after intercourse can increase your chances of getting pregnant. You do not need to raise your legs to put your feet up since the pelvis does not move when you raise legs. Avoid going to the bathroom during this period. Although there is no prescribed ‘best position’ to conceive, having intercourse while sitting or standing may prevent the sperms from moving up your cervix for fertilization and eventual conception. Practice stress-reducing activities: Stress can affect ovulation and your chances of getting pregnant. It can also contribute to stress-related medical conditions, such as high blood pressure and heart diseases, which can complicate your pregnancy. Practice stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, walking, or pursuing hobbies like reading and listening to music. Do not stress about trying too hard to get pregnant. Consult your doctor and let the process take its natural time. Have a healthy lifestyle: Eat healthily and perform regular exercises. Do not try to do more exercise than what is safe and healthy for you. Losing or gaining a lot of weight can also affect your chances of getting pregnant."
What are the side effects of losing one pound a day?,"'Rapid ''weight loss'' might make you shed those extra pounds quickly but at the cost of serious risks that include:''Other side effects of rapid weight loss include:' Nutritional deficiency: Consuming less food to reduce calorie intake may make you prone to malnutrition. You may eat less protein and get fewer intakes of your vitamins and minerals. You may use nutritional supplements, but consuming nutrients directly from fresh food and fruits/vegetables provides more health benefits. Brittle bones: Reduced calcium and vitamin D intake will affect both the muscles and bones and make you prone to fractures. Gallstones: When you eat less, the gallbladder produces less of its digestive juice. Over time, the stagnated digestive juice gives rise to gallstones, which is a medical condition. It occurs in 12-25 out of every 100 people who try to lose weight quickly. Dehydration: This can make you feel tired, fatigued, and give you headaches and leg cramps. In the long run, persistent dehydration will make your skin to develop wrinkles more than for your age. Slower metabolism: Rapid weight loss has been shown to reduce the metabolic rate. This can make you more likely to regain much of the lost weight in a few years. An analysis of 29 studies on rapid weight loss programs found that more than half of the lost weight was regained within two years, and by five years, more than 80% of lost weight was regained. Constipation Irritability Dizziness Hair loss Muscle loss"
What should you do to achieve sustained weight loss?,"'Gradual weight loss is sustained more easily than rapid weight loss.''It is recommended to lose one to two pounds per week and not one pound daily. This means reducing the calorie intake by only 500 kcal per day.''Losing one to two pounds/week just requires the incorporation of healthy dietary habits and regular physical activities.''Healthy dietary habits to achieve slow but sustained weight loss are as follows:''The American ''Heart'' Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activities five days a week or 150 minutes of physical activities spread over a week. You can do high-intensity exercises along with moderate ones in between. Along with aerobic activities (jogging, ''cycling''), you can do weight-bearing exercises and muscle-strengthening exercises. ''Swimming'' is excellent exercise.''It is necessary to speak with your doctor, ''fitness'' expert, and certified nutritionist/dietician before you embark on any rapid weight loss programs. This applies more to people with an underlying health condition such as ''heart disease''.' Substituting high-calorie, low-nutrient foods with low-calorie, high-nutrient foods Replacing the processed, packaged food with whole cereals, fruits, and vegetables Choosing low-fat products instead of high-fat items (low-fat skimmed milk instead of high-fat milk) Including more proteins and less proportion of carbohydrates in the diet Intermittent fasting technique"
What type of food is recommended to control blood pressure?,"'As per the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, a person has ''high blood pressure'' (BP) if their BP is more than 130/80, which means that nearly half of all adults may need to lower their BP.''Below are a few common ''diet'' and food that help in relieving BP:''Apart from the aforementioned options, limiting ''alcohol'' consumption, maintaining weight as recommended for height, exercising daily, and avoiding ''smoking'' are the best ways to lower BP in long term.' Moderate sodium reduction: There is a decrease in BP in hypertensive individuals with a reduction in salt intake and keeping it to below 1500 mg. Olive oil: Olive oil may be one of the most important ingredients of a healthy diet. It is packed with antioxidants and polyphenols that have various health benefits, including the reduction of BP. Cooking veggies with olive oil also allows bodies to absorb fat-soluble vitamins K, A, D, and E. It is always recommended to opt for a quality extra-virgin olive oil for maximum health benefits. Flaxseeds: Several studies have shown that flaxseeds are a powerful superfood when it comes to reducing hypertension. They contain α-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid, that has been found to reduce BP. They can also be sprinkled on salads, smoothies, or baked goods. High-potassium and magnesium-rich foods: Unless contraindicated in persons with poor kidney function, a potassium-rich diet lowers BP. Potassium-rich foods include spinach, orange, papaya, grapes, and banana. Potassium helps the kidneys flush sodium out of our systems, which in turn can cause our BP to decrease. Some other high-potassium foods to try are melons, apricots, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, potatoes, sweet potatoes, tuna, salmon, beans, nuts, seed, Swiss chard, and white beans. Smoothies with banana, spinach, and avocado can also be considered a snack or breakfast. Magnesium may also help in relaxing the blood vessels, making it easier for the blood to pass through. Foods rich in magnesium include vegetables, dairy, chicken, legumes, and whole grains."
What is acid reflux?,"'Acid reflux'' refers to the condition in which the stomach contents move up into the food pipe (''esophagus'').''When the acidic stomach contents leak frequently, more than twice a week over several weeks, into the esophagus, the condition is called ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').\xa0''The site where the food pipe joins the stomach is guarded by a valve (the lower esophageal sphincter). The valve prevents the backflow of the stomach contents into the food pipe. When the lower esophageal sphincter does not close properly when the food enters the stomach, acid reflux occurs. Because the stomach contents are acidic, the backwash then flows back up through the food pipe into the throat and mouth, which gives a strong sour taste.\xa0''GERD'' needs medical attention, not just to relieve the symptoms, but because it may lead to more serious problems (such as narrowing of the esophagus and difficulty in swallowing) if left untreated.' "
What are the common signs of acid reflux?,"'The common ''symptoms of acid reflux'' are as follows:' Heartburn: An uncomfortable sensation in the middle of the chest usually after eating food, this condition may worsen on lying down, which may disturb the person during sleep. It is caused by irritation to the inside of the food pipe because of stomach acid. Chest pain Sour taste in the mouth Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) Bloating Burping Feeling of food caught in the throat Hiccups Nausea Vomiting Weight loss Long-term cough Sore throat Hoarse voice Difficulty in breathing"
Who is at risk of acid reflux?,"'Acid reflux can affect anyone. Some risk factors, however, may increase the chances of acid reflux:' Eating heavy or large meals  Lying down right after a meal Being obese or overweight  Eating or snacking right before bedtime Having certain foods, such as spicy or oily foods, citrus, tomato, mint, garlic, onions, and chocolate Consuming certain drinks, such as alcohol, carbonated drinks, coffee, or tea Smoking or being frequently exposed to second-hand smoke Being pregnant  Taking medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and some muscle relaxants  Hiatal hernia (a condition in which the upper part of the stomach bulges into the diaphragm—a muscle that separates the stomach from the chest)"

What are the most common triggers for heart diseases? ,"'The most common triggers for heart diseases include:' Physical inactivity Preexisting health conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, and abnormal blood pressure Familial history or inherited genes Improper lifestyle, which includes stress, less sleep, smoking, alcohol, and similar bad habits"
What are the common types of heart diseases?,"'The heart is one of the body’s most essential organs, so understanding the symptoms associated with heart disease and adopting heart-healthy lifestyle strategies may be essential for every individual. Below are the common types of heart diseases:' Arrhythmia: The term arrhythmia describes any change in the heart’s normal electrical impulses. Arrhythmias can cause the heart to beat too quickly, too slowly, or irregularly, resulting in a broad range of symptoms. Arrhythmia is one of the most common heart conditions. Heart valve disease: The heart has four valves that work in unison to make sure that blood is pumped in the proper direction. Heart valve disease can occur when one or more of your four heart valves do not work correctly. The valves may either narrow down and obstruct the blood movement from one chamber to another, or it may grow floppy and cause backflow of blood in the heart. Both conditions increase the workload on the heart, tiring the heart out. Coronary heart disease (CHD): It is among the most common type of heart disease. CHD happens when plaque grows in the walls of the coronary arteries and limits the blood flow to the heart’s muscle. CHD may ultimately lead to a heart attack. Heart failure: It is a heart condition in which the heart’s pumping capacity is not adequate to meet the demands for blood and oxygen required by the rest of the body. This can be the result of a range of conditions that lead to the weakening of the heart muscle."
Which tests are usually considered to know the ovulation days for pregnancy?,"'A woman may rely on a few accurate and common tests, such as' Ovulation kits: These contain antibodies to luteinizing hormones, which peak around 12 to 36 hours before ovulation. Testing the morning urine sample with these kits helps to determine whether ovulation has occurred or not. These home testing kits give accurate results in about 90 % cases. Fertility monitors: It is an all-inclusive device that monitors monthly cycles, hormone levels, body temperature, and electrolyte levels. This may help in charting out the ovulating days every month. Blood tests: The most common blood test is detecting the progesterone level. It is typically done in the third week of the cycle around day 21 to 23. Progesterone is released in pulses after the ovulation, so even a low progesterone level might be perfectly normal. Luteinizing hormone (LH) can also be detected at high levels in the blood during the 48 hours around ovulation. This test is not commonly performed and requires frequent trips to the laboratory for blood testing. Transvaginal ultrasound: The egg develops within a part of the ovary called the follicle (a fluid-filled sac). As the egg gets ready to ovulate the follicle grows larger. Follicle growth can be measured with the ultrasound, a technique that uses sound waves to produce an image on a monitor screen using a tampon-like probe placed in the vagina. Before ovulation, the follicle is thin-walled and filled with fluid. Ovulation generally happens when the follicle measures between 1.8 and 2.5 cm. For women on fertility treatment, ultrasound may help time intercourse or insemination. In women taking fertility drugs, ultrasound may be done on several different days during the menstrual cycle to measure and monitor each follicle."

What is the common cold?,"'A cold (''common cold'') is a viral infection. It affects the upper respiratory system that includes the nose, throat, and sinuses. The ''common cold'' is a self-limited ''contagious'' disease. Most teens get between two and four colds a year. The common cold is the most frequently occurring viral infection in the world, and it is a leading cause of doctor visits and missed days from school and work. The usual ''symptoms of common cold'' include the following:' Low grade fever Nose congestion or runny nose Irritation in the throat Headache Weakness Difficulty breathing Cough Recurrent sneezing Loss of appetite Body aches Hoarseness (Change in voice)"
Is the common cold contagious?,"'Common cold is usually caused by the virus group called rhinoviruses, which are highly contagious. The common cold spreads either by direct contact with infected secretions from contaminated surfaces or by inhaling the airborne virus after individuals sneeze or ''cough''. Person-to-person transmission often occurs when an individual who has cold blows or touches their nose and then touches someone or something else. A healthy individual who then makes direct contact with these secretions can subsequently become infected. If the virus gets through the protective lining of the nose and throat, it triggers an immune reaction that can start symptoms of cold.' "
How long do symptoms of the common cold last in the body?,"'The duration of common cold in a body depends on a person’s immune system. Some individuals will develop very mild symptoms, whereas others may develop more severe symptoms. The type of symptoms may also vary, with some individuals developing only ''nasal congestion'', whereas others may develop many or all of the symptoms described above. The symptoms that develop also depend on the underlying health of the person infected. Old people and people with ''diabetes'' generally are at a risk of secondary infection by a bacterium. Most colds will resolve after 7-10 days, although some individuals experience a shorter course and others a more prolonged illness, depending on the particular virus involved, as well as underlying health issues. If a teen or person has a weak immune system, they may need medical attention.\xa0' "
Does the common cold require a doctor’s attention?,"'Not everyone may require doctor supervision or attention for common cold because it is a self-limited contagious disease. However, teens with a weak immune system or preexisting respiratory infections such as ''asthma'' or ''pneumonia'' may require doctor supervision. A teen may need medical attention if they have below conditions:' If cold symptoms last for more than a week or appear at the same time every year or whenever they are exposed to pollen, dust, animals, or some other substance (allergy) Trouble breathing or wheezes during cold (like asthma) Worsening symptoms  Cough if lasts for more than two to three weeks Inability to keep food or liquids down Increasing headache or facial or throat pain Severe painful sore throat Fever of 103°F (39.3°C) or higher or a fever of 102°F (38.9°C) that lasts for more than a day Chest or stomach pain Swollen glands (lymph nodes) Earache"
What is breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' develops from the cells of the breasts and can spread to other parts of the body (''metastasis''). It is one of the most common ''cancers'' diagnosed in women in the United States. Although extremely rare, ''breast cancer'' can sometimes occur in men. The survival rates for ''breast cancer'' have increased substantially because of a better understanding of the disease, an increase in awareness, better technology for early detection and more advanced treatment options.' "
How can you detect breast cancer early?,"'In the early stages, there may be no noticeable ''symptoms of breast cancer''.''Some of the earliest signs are:' A painless lump in the breast or under the armpit. The lump is firm or hard and does not move within the breast tissue (fixed to the underlying structures). Self-examination by patients and regular screening in high-risk individuals are advised. This allows for early diagnosis and treatment. In some people, there can be swelling throughout the breast or in part of the breast without a palpable lump.  Cancer cells multiply fast and spread quickly. Hence, the lump quickly increases in size, involves surrounding structures including the skin and spreads to the rest of the body. Other signs and symptoms of breast cancer are as follows Affected skin of the breast appears reddish and dimpled similar to that of an orange peel. Changes in the breast shape. The nipple, if involved, may become retracted, leading to an inverted appearance. Discharge or bleeding from the nipple. Peeling, crusting and flaking of the areola (pigmented skin around the nipple) or skin of the breast. Enlarged lymph nodes felt as lumps in the armpit, groin, neck and other areas."
What are the causes of breast cancer?,"'The exact cause of breast ''cancer'' has not been determined. Researchers have found that several factors can increase the risk of breast cancer. It could either be a single risk factor or a combination of risk factors that cause breast cancer. Some common risk factors that have been identified to cause breast cancer are as follows' Genetic factors: A family history of breast cancer increases the risk of the disease. Breast cancers may occur due to the inheritance of mutated genes. The most commonly affected genes causing breast cancer are BRAC1 and BRAC2. They also increase the risk of ovarian cancer.  Age: The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Most women with breast cancer are over the age of 50. Radiation exposure: This could be due to occupational exposure, imaging or radiotherapy for other conditions to the chest during childhood. Early menarche: This is the onset of periods before the age of 12.  Late onset of menopause after the age of 55. Late first pregnancy after the age of 30 or never being pregnant. Hormone replacement therapy: Hormonal therapy to reduce the side effects of menopause or for other reasons increases breast cancer risk.  Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption Obesity"
How is breast cancer diagnosed?," Self-examination: You can learn about breast anatomy and self-examination techniques from the doctor. This allows for early diagnosis and treatment.  Physical assessment by the doctor. Mammogram: This is the first and most commonly performed radiological assessment. It can detect the presence of cancer even before it can be seen or felt. Women who are at increased risk are advised to have mammograms regularly as per the schedule advised by the doctor. Other radiological tests: These include breast ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bone scan and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) may be done to study the spread of cancer (metastasis) to other parts of the body. Biopsy: This helps confirm the diagnosis. A specialized needle is used to take a tissue sample from the lump which is studied under the microscope. "
How is breast cancer treated?,"'Breast cancer may be treated surgically and nonsurgically. Treatment may involve a combination of multiple treatment modalities such as ''chemotherapy'', radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, surgery and palliative care. Based on the extent of the disease, the surgeon recommends a suitable treatment plan.' "
What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?,"'Women of 35 to 44 years old are susceptible to cervical ''cancer''. More than 15% of new cases are in women above the age of 65 years. Below are few common ''symptoms of cervical cancer'':' Dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) Unusual vaginal bleeding, such as after sex, between periods, after menopause or after a pelvic exam Unusual and frequent vaginal discharge Lower abdominal or pelvic pain Trouble peeing Swollen legs Malfunctioning of kidneys Generalized body pains with weakness Weight loss and lack of appetite"
How is cervical cancer diagnosed?,"'Usually, cervical cancer grows slowly. Cervical cancer can be diagnosed using below methods:' Papanicolaou test (Pap smear): A Pap smear is part of a woman’s regular pelvic exam. Doctor usually collects cells from the surface of the cervix, and a technician examines them under a microscope to spot anything unusual. Colposcopy: It is performed if the Pap smear shows any abnormal cells. In this procedure, the cervix is stained with a harmless dye or acetic acid so that the cells are easier to observe. Then, a microscope known as colposcope is used to magnify the cervix by 8 to 15 times for identifying unusual cells for biopsy. Some patients may need another biopsy if the colposcope shows signs of invasive cancer. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): In the LEEP, doctor usually uses an electrified loop of wire to take a sample of tissue from the cervix. Doctor can even do a conization (removal of part of your cervix) in the operating room under anesthesia. They might use a LEEP, a scalpel (cold knife conization) or a laser. LEEP and cold knife conization procedures give doctor a better look at the types of unusual cells in the cervix."
How cervical cancer is usually treated?,"'Cervical cancer is usually treated using below methods:' Surgery: If the cancer is only on the surface of the cervix, doctor may remove or destroy the cancerous cells with procedures like LEEP or cold knife conization. If cancerous cells have passed through a layer called the basement membrane, which separates the surface of the cervix from underlying layers, patient may need invasive surgery. If the disease has invaded deeper layers of your cervix but hasn’t spread to other parts of your body, an operation to take out the tumor might be recommended. If it spreads into the uterus, doctor will probably recommend a hysterectomy (removing the entire uterus to decrease the chances of cancer spread). Radiation therapy (or radiotherapy): It uses high-energy rays to damage cancer cells and stop their growth. Sometimes, a small capsule containing radioactive material is placed in the cervix. The capsule emits cancer-killing rays close to the tumor while sparing most of the healthy tissue around it. Chemotherapy: It uses powerful drugs to kill cancer cells. Doctors often use it for cervical cancer that’s locally advanced and if cancer has a high chance to spread to other parts of the body. Biological therapy or immunotherapy: This targets checkpoints in the immune cells that are turned on or off to set off an immune response. A medicine called pembrolizumab (Keytruda) blocks a protein on the cells to shrink tumors or slow their growth. Doctors use it if chemotherapy isn’t working or if the cancer is beginning to spread."
How can you prevent a stroke from happening?,"'Strokes'' occur due to the obstruction of blood flow to the brain. Two types of strokes obstruct the blood flow to the brain.''Some irreversible factors, such as age and family history, are likely to increase the risk of stroke. These factors cannot be modified. However, many such preventable or modifiable factors can help prevent strokes.''Here are several ways to start reining in your risks today to prevent stroke before it happens.''\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Medications, medical procedures and surgery can treat these disorders.\xa0' Ischemic stroke: This type of stroke occurs due to the formation of clots. Hemorrhagic stroke: This type of stroke occurs due to bleeding in the brain. Treat hypertension: Hypertension is the most potent risk factor for stroke. It increases the risk of stroke by two- to four-fold before the age of 80. Hypertension is associated with thickened artery walls and the deposition of cholesterol or other fats to form plaques. High blood pressure can weaken the arteries and can make them burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. Several methods to control high blood pressure includeMaintaining a proper weightAvoiding drugs that raise blood pressureCutting down on saltEating fruits and vegetables to increase potassium levelsExercising regularlyMonitoring and controlling blood pressure Maintaining a proper weight Avoiding drugs that raise blood pressure Cutting down on salt Eating fruits and vegetables to increase potassium levels Exercising regularly Monitoring and controlling blood pressure Quit cigarette smoking: Cigarette smoke causes a two-fold increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and a four-fold increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Smoking can increase the risk of stroke in the following waysIt promotes the buildup of fatty substances in the main neck artery (carotid artery) that supplies blood to the brain.Nicotine raises blood pressure and carbon monoxide from smoking reduces the oxygen supply to the brain.Cigarette smoke thickens the blood leading to clot formation.Smoking promotes aneurysm formation.Medications or therapy may help you to quit smoking.

Cigarette smoke thickens the blood leading to clot formation. Smoking promotes aneurysm formation. Medications or therapy may help you to quit smoking. Manage heart health: Some heart disorders can result in blood clots that may break loose and block vessels leading to the brain, which includeAtrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)Enlargement of one of the heart’s chambersCoronary artery diseaseValve defects Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) Enlargement of one of the heart’s chambers Coronary artery disease Valve defects Limit alcohol: High alcohol content can raise blood pressure and triglycerides. Limit alcohol to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men to help reduce side effects. One drink means 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.  Treat diabetes: Diabetes can damage blood vessels over time and lead to clot formation inside the vessels. It can increase the risk of stroke by two to four times. High blood sugar management involvesRegularly monitoring blood sugar levelsTaking anti-diabetic medicationsExercising regularly Eating a healthy diet Regularly monitoring blood sugar levels Taking anti-diabetic medications Exercising regularly  Eating a healthy diet Exercise more: Exercise helps lower weight and maintain normal blood pressure.

What is a skin rash?,"'An ''itchy'' area of skin that’s caused by infection, ''allergy'', or injury is known as a ''rash''. Usually, a ''rash'' on the skin looks red and is accompanied by irritation. It may or may not be associated with ''pain'' and swelling. ''Rashes'' usually indicate an underlying medical problem in the body.' "
How can you tell if a rash is serious?,'A rash can become serious if immediate medical assistance is not provided when a patient has the below symptoms:' Rash covers most of the body Continuous itching Fever Difficulty breathing
What are the most common skin rashes caused by an infection?,"'Bacterial, fungal, and viral infections typically present with a skin rash as a symptom. Below are a few common skin ''rashes'' caused by infection:''Herpes zoster'' infection or ''shingles'':\xa0''Herpes'' simplex infection (HSV):\xa0''Tinea corporis'' (''ringworm''):''Chickenpox'':''Hand, foot, and mouth disease'' (''HFMD''):''Erythema infectiosum'' (also called the ''fifth disease''):''Pityriasis Rosea'':''Cellulitis'':' It is a skin and nerve disorder caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Usually seen in patients with a compromised immune system.  Symptoms include abnormal redness on the skin (looks like a sunburn) with tiny multiple fluid-filled sacs (vesicles) and enlargement of the lymph nodes (where a body fluid called lymph is filtered) usually on the neck.  Treatment options include vaccine and antiviral agents.  It is caused by a DNA virus called herpes simplex virus.  It is a sexually transmitted disease.  Transmission occurs due to the body fluids of an infected person contacting the open skin of another person. Symptoms include abnormal redness on skin (like a sunburn) with tiny multiple sacs of fluids (vesicles) on the mouth, genitals, anal region, and buttocks.  There is no cure for this infection; however, infection is self-resolving. Usually, antiviral drugs are recommended by doctors to shorten the course of this disease. It is a superficial fungal skin infection affecting moist and warm areas of the skin. If it affects the feet, it is called tinea pedis; on the body, it is called tinea corporis and on the scalp or head, it is called tinea capitis. Transmission occurs due to skin contact, contaminated items, or infected animals. Symptoms include circular, red scaly swelling patches on the skin with pus (vesicles or bullae) or a burning sensation. Treatment options include antifungal drugs.  It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. This infection is highly contagious via air droplets from a contagious person and direct contact with the virus particles. Usually affects children younger than 10 years old, the infection starts after 10 to 21 days of contact.  Symptoms include skin rash with severe and many pus-filled sacs on the body with a low-grade fever. This infection usually resolves within five to 10 days. Treatment options include only supportive therapy (keep the patient clean and healthy). Initially, it starts on the face and then develops on other sites of the body. If it affects individuals with a compromised immune system, doctors usually prescribe antiviral drugs.  It is caused by a highly contagious virus called coxsackievirus A16. Symptoms include abnormal redness on the skin (looks like sunburn) with 2-3 mm multiple sacs of fluid (vesicles) on mouth, feet, and palms. Patients have a fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, and loss of appetite. It usually affects infants and children and is transmitted through nose and mouth secretions or fecal matter.  Treatment includes supportive care with fever-reducing drugs and sometimes anesthesia for relieving the symptoms. Typically resolves within 7 days.  It is a common childhood infection caused by human parvovirus B19. Transmission occurs through air droplets, blood, or blood transfusion. Symptoms include fever, running nose, and headache. It has three stages:Stage 1: Bright abnormal redness seen on cheeks giving slapped cheek appearance.Stage 2: Abnormal bright redness with vesicles extends to hands and legs.Stage 3: Abnormal redness fades away, leaving a lace-like pattern on infected areas. Stage 1: Bright abnormal redness seen on cheeks giving slapped cheek appearance. Stage 2: Abnormal bright redness with vesicles extends to hands and legs. Stage 3: Abnormal redness fades away, leaving a lace-like pattern on infected areas. Infection resolves within seven days without treatment in children. Symptoms include a large, scaly, pink area of skin, followed by additional skin spots that are itchy and red with swelling. It usually affects the back, neck, chest, abdomen, upper arms, and legs, but the rash may differ from person to person.  Treatment may not be necessary, as it heals within 12 weeks with sun exposure or ultraviolet light. It is a bacterial infection usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyrogens. Symptoms include pain, swelling, abnormal redness, and warmth in the infected area.  Treatment includes oral or intravenous antibacterial drugs. "
How can you tell if you are dehydrated?,"'Drinking plenty of water every day is important for many reasons. Water helps you maintain a stable temperature, keeps your joints lubricated, and helps your body get rid of waste properly. Throughout the day, your body uses and gets rid of water, so you need to replace it. If you lose more than you take in, you become dehydrated.''Dehydration'' is a common problem. While many people think they’re drinking enough, approximately 75% of Americans aren’t. Anyone can become dehydrated, but some people are more at risk than others, including:''If you become too dehydrated, your risk of serious health issues increases. It can lead to:''Recognizing the signs and ''symptoms of dehydration'' is important for reversing it and ensuring your body gets the water it needs.' Children and infants Older adults People who live in warmer areas People who live at higher altitudes, such as the mountains  Athletes Organ damage Organ failure  Brain damage Shock"
Signs and symptoms of dehydration,"'Feeling thirsty is often considered to be an early warning sign that you’re becoming dehydrated. When you feel ''thirst'', however, it’s a sign that ''dehydration'' has already started.''Other warning signs of dehydration include:''Dry Mouth''When your body doesn’t have enough water, your salivary glands can’t produce saliva. Your mouth might feel dry or sticky. You may notice that you have trouble talking or swallowing, your throat is sore, or your sense of taste has changed. ''Dry mouth'' can also lead to ''bad breath'', because you don’t have enough saliva to wash away bacteria.\xa0''Infrequent Urination''Your body loses water when you urinate. If you don’t have enough water in your system, you’ll urinate less. Your urine will also be darker. The color can provide clues as to your hydration status. A pale, straw-yellow color shows you that you’re drinking enough. Darker yellow shades, however, let you know you’re dehydrated. If you’re not urinating at all, you should seek medical care right away.\xa0''Dry Skin''Dehydration can affect your skin. If it doesn’t bounce back quickly when you pinch it, that could be a sign that you need to drink more fluids.\xa0''Fatigue''Water carries important nutrients throughout your body and delivers them to where they need to be. When you’re dehydrated, your body has to work harder, which can leave you feeling tired and sluggish.\xa0''Headaches''Not drinking enough water can lead to severe ''headaches''. If your head hurts, it could mean you’re dehydrated.\xa0''In cases of severe dehydration, symptoms might include:''If you notice any of these signs, you should seek medical care right away.\xa0' Confusion Dizziness Fainting Rapid heartbeat"
Causes of dehydration,"'There are several causes of dehydration. Some people just don’t drink enough water throughout the day. For others, there are underlying issues, such as:''Illness''If you have an illness that causes ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'', you are more likely to become dehydrated. These side effects, especially when serious, lead to the loss of a lot of water and ''electrolytes'' in a short time.\xa0''Increased Urination''When you urinate, you lose water. If you’re urinating a lot, you’re losing even more. Not only can an increase in urination point toward dehydration, but it may also be a sign of ''diabetes''.\xa0''Excessive Sweating''You lose water and salts when you sweat. If you’re outside in hot weather, playing sports, working out, or have a ''fever'', you’re likely to sweat more, increasing your risk of dehydration.\xa0''Certain Medications''Certain types of medications can lead to dehydration. These medications include:' Laxatives Antacids Blood pressure medications Antihistamines"
Diagnosing dehydration,"'Your doctor may be able to diagnose dehydration with a physical exam. They’ll check your blood pressure and ''heart'' rate. You may also need blood tests or a urine test. Blood tests can check your ''electrolyte'' levels and kidney function. ''Urinalysis'' can let your doctor know how dehydrated you are and allow them to check for infections. If your doctor suspects an underlying condition, they may order additional tests.' "
Treatments for dehydration,"'You can generally treat mild to moderate dehydration at home by increasing your water intake. Electrolyte ''drinks'' can help to restore lost electrolytes as well. For children with dehydration, a pediatrician may recommend an ''over-the-counter'' rehydration solution.\xa0''In more severe cases of dehydration, your doctor may recommend IV rehydration. The treatment involves inserting a small IV into your vein to provide a mixture of water and electrolytes. Individuals who can’t keep fluids down may also need IV rehydration.\xa0''If your doctor finds your dehydration to be the result of another condition, they will recommend treatments to help.' "
How common is female sexual dysfunction?,"'Sexual dysfunction is known as recurrent or persistent problems with sexual response, desire, ''orgasm'' or ''pain'' that can potentially create a strain in relationships. Sexual dysfunction can occur in men and women. Female sexual dysfunction may include problems with sexual desire, arousal, attaining an orgasm, painful spasms of the vaginal muscles causing contraction of the vagina and ''painful intercourse''. Female sexual dysfunction may be caused by multiple causes and treatment often involves more than one approach.''Sexual dysfunction in women is fairly common. Around 43% of women experience sexual dysfunction at some point in their lives. However, some may have difficulties throughout their lives and this can occur at any stage of life. It may either occur only during some specific sexual situations or during all sexual situations.' "
What is normal female sexual function?,"'Normal sexual function and response involve the mind and body. A woman can have problems at any stage of sexual function' Motivation or desire: This is required to engage in sexual activity or to continue it. Sexual desire could be triggered by thoughts, words, sights or touch and varies with each woman. Arousal: Arousal is the sexual excitement that is felt and involves a physical element. The blood flow increases to the genital area, the vaginal wall starts to swell and vaginal secretions increase. Orgasm: Orgasm is the peak of sexual excitement. There is increased muscle tension throughout the body and the muscles around the vagina start contracting rhythmically. Resolution: This occurs following orgasm or sexual activity. There is widespread muscular relaxation throughout the body and a feeling of well-being."
What causes female sexual dysfunction?,"'Sexual dysfunction can occur due to various physical, hormonal and psychological causes or a combination of multiple factors. Factors contributing to sexual dysfunction include' Physical: Several medical conditions and major illnesses, such as cancer, chronic pain, severe arthritis, physical injuries, diabetes, heart diseases, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis and bladder problems can lead to sexual dysfunction. Certain medications, such as antidepressants, blood pressure medications, antihistamines or chemotherapy drugs, can affect sexual function. Hormonal: Decline in estrogen levels after menopause can lead to changes in the genital tissues, such as dryness and decreased elasticity, which can cause pain during intercourse. Sexual desire may also decrease after menopause. A decrease in estrogen leads to decreased blood flow to the genitals. Women also have hormonal imbalance after childbirth and while breastfeeding, which can cause sexual dysfunction. Psychological and/or social: Untreated psychological conditions like anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), history of sexual abuse, stress, insecurity, body image issues or depression can cause or aggravate sexual dysfunction. Having problems with other aspects of the relationship, such as cultural and religious beliefs, may also contribute to sexual dysfunction."
How is female sexual dysfunction treated?,"'Sexual dysfunction requires treatment only if one is bothered by it. If it is not bothersome, it doesn’t require treatment because it doesn’t affect the health of the body.''Treatment varies depending on the symptoms and causes of sexual dysfunction. Most women require a combined treatment approach that treats medical, psychological and relationship problems that contribute to sexual dysfunction.''Nonmedical treatment options''Medical treatment for female sexual dysfunction''Certain medications can cause sexual dysfunction. The doctor may prescribe an alternative medicine or adjust the dose of such medications. Sexual dysfunction caused due to hormones and other medical illnesses may require medical treatment, which includes' Communicating openly with the partner about sexual preferences or resolving conflicts can solve most relationship problems that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction. Counseling: Consulting with a licensed therapist or psychiatrist can help treat psychological and emotional problems or relationship problems contributing to sexual dysfunction. Lifestyle modifications: Lifestyle modifications includeReducing alcohol consumptionGetting regular physical activityEating a healthy, balanced diet Reducing alcohol consumption Getting regular physical activity Eating a healthy, balanced diet Vaginal lubricants: Vaginal lubricants can reduce dryness, pain and discomfort during intercourse. Using a device: Stimulate arousal by using a vibrator over the clitoris. Hormone therapy: Localized estrogen therapy is administered in the form of creams, vaginal rings or tablets. This improves vaginal dryness, tone and elasticity and increases blood flow locally. There are also medications that modulate estrogen receptors, reducing pain during sex. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help reduce the symptoms of menopause throughout the body, including the genitals. Androgen therapy: Testosterone is an androgen that affects sexual function in women as well, but the use of testosterone to treat female dysfunction is still controversial. Treatment of psychological conditions: Medical treatment to manage stress, anxiety, PTSD, depression and other psychological conditions may be prescribed by the doctor."
How common is hair tourniquet?,"'Hair tourniquet syndrome is a rare medical disorder in which part of the body such as a finger, toe or penis gets wrapped in hair very tightly. This is most common in ''babies'' if the parents, siblings or caretakers have long hair. Because a lot of hair tourniquets are resolved at home,\xa0they are probably underreported. The most common location is the penis (44%) followed by toes (40%) and fingers (9%). The most commonly affected toe is the third toe (32%). About one-third of the cases will have multiple fingers involved. Hair tourniquet syndrome likely occurs as an infant’s fingers/toes come into contact with hair or similar ''fiber'' in an enclosed covering of mittens/socks or a similar situation. As the infant moves their fingers back and forth, the hair progressively encircles the fingers. Wet hair especially may constrict as it dries, leading to additional strangulation and complications.' "
What is hair tourniquet syndrome?,"'Hair tourniquet syndrome is a medical condition where a hair or thread becomes tightly tied to a finger, toe or genitals, cutting off circulation and potentially leading to infection and amputation. This condition is more likely to be seen in babies who are younger than four months of age as hormonal changes in the mother may cause her to lose more hair than usual during this time period. Babies may cry more than usual due to ''pain'' and discomfort. Redness and swelling may be noticed in the affected area.' "
How is hair tourniquet syndrome treated?,"'Once you notice the affected area and tourniquet, it is recommended to not pull it because it may cause a deep cut or severe injury. The following methods can work to remove the hair''If the baby’s toe (or other area) is already ''turning blue'', don’t waste precious time trying to remove the hair at home. The patient may need to be taken to a hospital immediately. The way in which the hair tourniquet is removed depends on the location and severity of the condition. The doctor may use the methods below''Once the tourniquet is removed, the patient may be prescribed painkillers and antibiotics to avoid any discomfort.' Use Vaseline, olive oil or coconut oil to lubricate the area and try to gently slide off the hair. Soak the toe in water to help the hair to relax (hair constricts when dry and expands when wet). It may be easy to unwind the hair  with a fingernail while the hair is wet. Darker hair is easier to see against the skin compared to lighter hair, so you may notice the hair tourniquet sooner. Hair wrapped around the baby’s toe may be harder to detect if the hair is blonde or lighter in color. When the hair is unnoticeable, use a magnifying glass and tweezers to lift up the hair and snip it carefully with baby nail scissors. Stretch the skin around the tourniquet and place a piece of clear scotch tape horizontally over the hair. Lift it up carefully and hopefully the hair will attach itself to the tape. Either slide the hair off or while it’s lifted up or snip it carefully with baby nail scissors. They may apply an ointment to dissolve the hair tourniquet. They may use scissors, forceps, a probe or other tools to unwrap or cut the hair tourniquet. In very severe cases, the doctor will use a scalpel (surgical knife) to make incisions in the skin to access the tourniquet"
What is the outlook of the patient after removing a hair tourniquet?,"'Hair tourniquet syndrome is a rare and dangerous but preventable condition. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of the condition is vital to attain a good outcome and prevent further harm. Parents should be warned of excessive ''hair loss'', and they may need to\xa0 monitor the baby regularly, especially if they are crying without any reason. Although hair tourniquet syndrome is rarely reported in older children/adults, any individual with compromised mentation/communication abilities may also be at risk. Despite the distressing nature of the condition, outcomes are usually excellent. The loss of an affected area is extremely rare, and hence, it should not be a concern or worry. In most cases, the patient does not suffer from any residual disability and only a small ''scar'' may be left post recovery.' "
How is bariatric surgery performed?,"'Bariatric surgery is performed under general anesthesia. Most bariatric surgeries are laparoscopic, but some patients may need a conventional surgery. The procedure may last several hours.\xa0 A surgeon specialized in bariatric surgery will perform the procedure. A ''gastroenterologist'' is integral in caring for the patient before and after the surgery.' The patient first undergoes blood, urine and imaging tests. Based on the individual’s specific needs, the surgeon decides on the type of bariatric surgery. The patient must stop taking blood thinners, have nothing to eat or drink 8 hours prior to surgery, and check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the surgery. The surgeon performs the bariatric surgery and closes the incisions with sutures. The patient is monitored in a recovery room and administered painkillers for post-surgical pain. The patient may be required to remain in the hospital for a few days, depending on the type of surgery. Patients will generally not be allowed to eat for one or two days after surgery to let the digestive system heal. The dietitian will prescribe a diet regimen for the patient post-surgery. Patients must supplement the diet with multivitamins, calcium and iron. Patients must modify lifestyle and eating habits. Periodic health check-ups will be required post-surgery. Body contouring procedures might be required to correct flabbiness caused by weight loss."
How long is recovery from bariatric surgery?,"'With a laparoscopic surgery a patient is usually discharged in two or three days and most patients will be able to get back to normal activities in three to five weeks, depending on their original stage of ''obesity'' and other health conditions.' "
What are the benefits of bariatric surgery?,"'Bariatric surgery currently is the best and fastest option for significant and long-lasting ''weight loss'' in morbidly ''obese'' people. Along with ''weight loss'', many obesity-related health issues tend to resolve along with the resulting weight loss, enhancing the patient’s quality of life.''The life expectancy improves in many, as does general health, and ability to do daily activities. It is important to follow a healthy lifestyle and eating habits to sustain the weight loss and improved health.' "
How dangerous is bariatric surgery?,"'The bariatric surgery itself is generally a safe procedure, especially with recent technological advancements in the surgical field. The effects of surgery on the digestive system might pose specific risks like nutritional deficiency caused by malabsorption, leading to conditions like ''anemia'' or ''osteoporosis''.\xa0''Considering the multitude of obesity-related diseases affecting many organ systems, bariatric surgery may be the safest option for many morbidly obese people, despite its risks.\xa0\xa0' "
What are the risks and complications of bariatric surgery?,"'Bariatric surgery may not be suitable for everyone, and in some it may not achieve the desired weight loss. The patient has to combine it with modified lifestyle, diet and activity. Bariatric surgery has a few risks and possible complications, some of them specific to this kind of surgery.''Besides the surgical risks, other complications (listed by procedure type) may include:' Anesthetic side effects like headache, nausea and confusion Infection Excessive bleeding Blood clots Breathing problems Leaks in the digestive tract Abdominal pain Pneumonia Injury to the stomach or food pipe Displacement or leakage of the band Leaking of the sleeve Long-term risks are still being evaluated Diarrhea Leakage from the digestive tract Distension of stomach Bowel obstruction Gallstones Staple line leaks Dumping syndrome Hernia Ulcer Acid reflux Nutrient deficiency Malnutrition from protein deficiency Vitamin deficiency leading to anemia, osteoporosis, and night blindness Complications from gastric bypass"
What is general anesthesia?,"'General anesthesia is a state of unconsciousness induced under medical supervision for certain types of surgery. Typically, an anesthesiologist administers a combination of medicines to make the patient unconscious and relax the muscles. General anesthesia prevents the patient from feeling any sensations at all while surgeons perform procedures that would otherwise cause unbearable ''pain''.''General anesthesia works by interrupting nerve signals in the brain and body. It prevents the brain from processing ''pain'' and from remembering what happened during your surgery.' "
What are the three types of anesthesia?,'The anesthetist decides on the form of anesthesia depending on the surgery or procedure to be done. 3 types of anesthesia are:' Local anesthesia - to numb an area for minor procedures Regional anesthesia - to numb a specific portion of the body General anesthesia - to keep the patient unconscious for long periods
Why do I need general anesthesia?,'General anesthesia is usually to keep a patient painless and asleep during surgeries that:' take a long time are done over a large area of the body affect breathing or blood circulation involve major organs like heart or brain can cause heavy blood loss
How is anesthesia given?,"'A specially trained doctor or nurse, called an anesthetist or anesthesiologist, gives you the anesthetic medications and cares for you before, during, and after the surgery.''The anesthetic team will keep the patient unconscious by constantly adjusting the dosage of the medication. They will continuously monitor vital functions including''At the end of the surgery the anesthetist, in consultation with the surgeon, will withdraw the anesthesia in a planned manner.' First, the anesthetist goes through the patient’s medical history to learn of any pertinent test results, known reactions to drugs, etc. They will then administer the anesthesia through an IV (intravenous) line that goes into a vein in the arm or hand. The patient might also breathe a gaseous medication through a mask. Once the patient is unconscious, the anesthetist may insert an endotracheal tube through their mouth into the windpipe to maintain oxygen supply. breathing, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, and fluid levels. They will give medication to reverse excessive muscle relaxation. They also give sufficient pain medicine and sedation so that the patient does not feel pain post-surgery. They will continue to monitor in the post-operative ward until the endotracheal tube is removed and the vital functions are stable. It may require a whole day to fully recover from the effects of anesthesia."
Can you die from general anesthesia?,"'General anesthesia is quite safe, and even people with certain health conditions tolerate anesthesia without much problem. It does have a few risks and side effects, and some individuals may have rare complications. But the benefits of pain-free surgery almost always outweigh the risks of anesthesia.''Risks while under anesthesia:' Inhaling fluids into the lung Waking up during surgery Breathing problems Blood pressure and heart function problems Corneal abrasions and dental injury Allergic reaction to the anesthesia Death, in rare situations Anesthesia side effects: Common side effects of general anesthesia are: nausea and vomiting dry mouth dry throat and hoarseness muscle aches chills and shivering itching sleepiness dizziness bladder and bowel problems blood clots confusion, especially in the elderly memory loss and delirium, which is more likely in people with heart disease, lung disease, Alzheimer’s disease Parkinson’s disease Anesthesia complications: Complications are more likely in patients with the following conditions: Obesity Sleep apnea Advanced age History of drug allergy Smoking High blood pressure, kidney, heart or lung disease, epilepsy In preparation for the surgery the doctor will ask you to: Lose weight if possible. Stop taking blood thinners and herbal supplements, if any, a week or so before surgery. Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before surgery."
What is hepatitis C?,"'The ''HCV'' virus infects the ''liver'' and leads to its inflammation. ''Hep C'' can manifest in a variety of ways, ranging from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Thus, Hep C is divided into two broad categories: “acute,” meaning a new infection and “chronic,” meaning a potentially lifelong infection.' Acute Hep C occurs within the first six months of HCV infection. Around 50% of acute cases progress to a long-term “chronic” stage. Chronic Hep C refers to the long-term persistence of Hep C disease and can be a lifelong infection if left untreated. Without proper treatment chronic Hep C can cause serious health problems, including:Liver damageCirrhosis (scarring of the liver)Liver cancerDeath Liver damage Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) Liver cancer Death"
What are the symptoms of hep C?,"'Initial symptoms of hep C are often outside the liver, including:''Symptoms typical of liver involvement are:' Pain in joints Pins and needles sensation (Paresthesias) Bodyache Itching Fever Numbness Mental changes Loss of appetite Ankle swelling Distended abdomen Pain abdomen Nausea Vomiting blood Dark, tarry stools Dark urine Jaundice (yellowish skin or eyes) Easy bruising and bleeding"
How dangerous is Hep C?,"'Hep C, specifically chronic Hep C, can be a serious disease. It can lead to long-term health issues, including liver damage, liver failure, liver ''cancer'', or even death. Hep C is a major cause of ''cirrhosis'' (scarring of the liver) and liver ''cancer''.''This makes it the most common reason for ''liver transplant'' in the United States. In 2016, CDC reported over 1,800 deaths related to the HCV. Nevertheless, the actual deaths due to Hep C are believed to be far more in number because not all people are tested for the virus.' "
How do you get Hep C?,"'You can acquire Hep C if you receive blood from a person infected with HCV. Before 1992, when blood screening for HCV infection was not available, Hep C spread through ''blood transfusion'' and organ donation. This is not the case now due to widespread screening of blood donors in the United States. However, one can still get Hep C in the following situations:' Sharing needles and syringes Needlestick injury in healthcare or other settings Baby born to a mother with Hep C Contaminated instruments like colonoscope, via dialysis or during surgery Sexual contact with an infected person Sharing razors with an infected person Getting a tattoo or body piercing in an unregulated setting"
Is there a treatment for Hep C?,'Acute Hep C: ''There is no recommended treatment for acute Hep C. Infected people should be followed by a doctor and only considered for treatment if the infection persists.''Chronic Hep C: ''There are now many treatment options available for Hep C. The following drug combinations are currently used:' Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (Harvoni) Elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier) Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir (Viekira Pak) Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Technivie) Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret) Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (Vosevi) Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa)
Can I get vaccinated against Hep C?,"'Unfortunately, no ''vaccine'' is available to protect from Hep C infection. So, avoiding the risks is the only protection against Hep C.' "
What are hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids, commonly called ''piles'', are swollen, inflamed veins around the anus or lower part of the rectum (the terminal part of the large bowel). Hemorrhoids are common in both men and women. It is estimated that one in 20 Americans have hemorrhoids. They occur more commonly with age; around 50% of the Americans over 50 years of age are affected.''Hemorrhoids may be felt as tiny lumps in and around the anus. They may often get better on their own within a few days, but some may need medications and even surgery to go away. Hemorrhoids are of two main types:''Hemorrhoids may cause the following symptoms:' External hemorrhoids: They form under the skin around the anus. Internal hemorrhoids: They form in the lining of the anus and lower rectum. Itching in and around the anus Hard, tender lumps felt at the bottom (anus) Anal pain, especially while sitting Bleeding from the rectum observed as bright red blood in the stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement A bulging or swelling may be felt through the anus in case of a prolapsed hemorrhoid (a hemorrhoid that has bulged or fallen through the anal opening)"
What causes hemorrhoids?,'Piles or hemorrhoids generally happen when there is a lot of pressure on the veins around the anus. This raised pressure may happen because of the following reasons:' Straining during bowel movements  Chronic (long-term) constipation or diarrhea Sitting on the toilet for long periods Having a low-fiber diet  Pregnancy Aging Lifting heavy weights or objects often
Benefits of hugs,"'According to the research, a hug may make an individual feel happy by reducing feelings of loneliness and harmful physical effects of ''stress''. Hugs can change negative ''moods'' by helping the body and brain, boosting these feel-good hormones.''Research shows that a proper deep hug may give an individual the following benefits:''There are two main operating systems we run on a day-to-day basis (parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems). Our sympathetic nervous system gets activated when we are stressed or perceive some kind of a threat in our environment. Therefore, if we want to balance our mind and body, we must rely on our parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for rest, recovery, and ''digestion''. Hugs activate parts of the brain that control the nerve of the parasympathetic system (vagus). When this system is operating, we are able to restore energy, repair our body, and shift into a more balanced state. Combine the working of the parasympathetic nervous system with elevated feelings of love, compassion, and gratitude, together with the oxytocin and serotonin release in your brain during a hug, and it’s no surprise that a good hug leaves us feeling happy, relaxed, and content with the world.' Dopamine: It is the pleasure hormone that makes an individual feel good.  Serotonin: It is the antidepressant hormone that elevates mood, controls anxiety, and reduces feelings of loneliness. Oxytocin: It is the love hormone that relieves stress and boosts heart health. It also helps in losing weight, lowers blood pressure, fights diseases, increases libido, reduces stress, and gives us a feeling of comfort. A 10-second hug helps the body fight infections, eases depression, and lessens tiredness. A 20-second hug reduces the harmful effects of stress, relieves blood pressure, and ensures a healthy heart. Increasing the hug ratio results in reduced blood pressure, decreased cortisol, improved healing, reduced cravings, and better immunity. Hugging a newborn child (kangaroo mother care) increases the baby's weight and improves its overall development. It builds trust and a sense of safety. This helps with open and honest communication. Because hugs can instantly boost oxytocin levels, it helps in healing some negative feelings such as loneliness, isolation, and anger. Hugs strengthen the immune system. Gentle pressure on the sternum and emotional charge stimulate the thymus gland, which regulates and balances the body's production of white blood cells, which keep an individual healthy and disease-free. Hugging boosts self-esteem. The physical contact during a hug not only makes us safe and loved but also boosts self-esteem. All the hugs we received from our parents, lover, and friends make us more self-confident and happier. They connect us to our ability to self-love. Hugging relaxes the muscles by releasing tension in the body. Hugs can take away pain and aches by increasing circulation into the soft tissues. A hug lowers blood pressure. When you hug, touch, or sit close to someone you love, your body releases oxytocin, which scientists call the “cuddle hormone.” This hormone can help relax and lower anxiety, which in turn can effectively lower blood pressure. It boosts heart health. One study found that a hug showed greater reductions in blood pressure levels and heart rate. Findings indicate that hugs can be good for heart health. According to a study, touch and hugs reduced the worry of mortality. It makes us feel safe. The study revealed that hugging alleviates the existential fear of a person. A hug makes us more mindful and aware of the current situation. Being present in the moment brings us happiness. Hugging is similar to meditation (which also makes us more mindful and aware). An abundance of research has shown that skin-to-skin contact such as a hug between a mother and newborn yields important physical and psychological benefits for the child, including:Reduced cryingImproved sleepSense of body ownershipReduced anxietyCorrect production of growth hormone, leading to correct physical developmentIncreased empathy for others as they grow up Reduced crying Improved sleep Sense of body ownership Reduced anxiety Correct production of growth hormone, leading to correct physical development Increased empathy for others as they grow up"
How do I calculate my BMI?,"'Body mass index (''BMI'') is a measurement of body fat based on height and weight. The formula for calculating BMI is given in Table 1.''Table 1. The Formula for Calculating BMI''Formula: weight (kg) / height (m)''2''The formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. If height has been measured in centimeters, divide by 100 to convert this to meters.''Formula: 703 x weight (lbs) / height (in)''2''Example: If a person weighs 65 kg and the person’s height is 165 cm (1.65 m), the BMI is calculated as 65 ÷ (1.65)2\xa0= 23.87 kg/m2, which means that the person has a BMI of 23.87 kg/m2 and is considered to have a healthy weight.''When calculating in pounds and inches, if a person weighs 120 lbs and the person’s height is 5 ''feet'' 6 inches (66 inches), the BMI is calculated as 703 x 120/(66)2 = 19.3 kg/m2, which means that the person has a BMI of 19.3 kg/m2 and is considered to have a healthy weight.' "
What is the body mass index (BMI)?,"'Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

Avoid ibuprofen if you have asthma or stomach ulcers or you had them in the past. Aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years of age. Antiviral creams such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir or penciclovir may help to speed up healing. You may get cold sore cream from pharmacies over-the- counter without a prescription. Do not share your cold sore cream. These creams are most effective in the initial stages of the cold sore when you begin to feel a tingling or itching sensation. Creams may not be beneficial when frank rashes appear. You may need to regularly apply the cream five times a day for five to six days. Antiviral tablets may be taken in severe cases if you have a doctor’s prescription. Cold sore patches contain a special gel hydrocolloid. They can be placed over the cold sore to cover the sore area while it heals. Avoid triggers such as stress, sunlight, wind and exertion. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Antiseptic mouthwashes may help if brushing your teeth is painful. Avoid acidic or salty foods such as fried and grilled foods, soda, meat and sugary foods and drinks. Eat cool and soft foods. Don’t rub the affected part while applying the cream. Instead, gently dab the cream onto cold sores. Wash your hands before and after applying the cream on the sores. Avoid touching the sores. Use sunscreen and sunblock lip balm. Do not kiss anybody while you have a cold sore.

What are cold sores?,"'Cold sores or ''fever blisters'' are small painful ''blisters'' that can appear around the mouth, face or nose. They are commonly caused by viral infections such as ''herpes simplex virus type 1'' (HSV 1) and less commonly by ''herpes simplex virus type 2'' (HSV 2). Cold sores are quite common and they usually subside on their own within a week or two. They start as blisters on the lips and around the mouth. They may also occur inside the mouth. The blisters progress to form painful sores. The fluid-filled blisters slowly crust over and form a scab before they go away. Cold sores may go away without treatment within a week or two. There is no cure for cold sores. However, to speed up the healing time of a cold sore, you can consult with your doctor and take prescription medications such as antiviral tablets and creams.' "
What are the symptoms of cold sores?,"'The symptoms are usually more severe during the first outbreak when someone develops a cold sore. Symptoms of cold sores include' Tingling, itching and/or burning sensations are felt on or around the lips. Slowly the blisters appear and  make the affected part red, swollen and painful. In the following two to three days, the blisters rupture. The ruptured blisters ooze fluid that may be clear or yellowish. This phase of oozing fluid is called the “weeping phase.” During the next four to five days after the cold sore develops, it crusts and scabs over. The skin may crack or bleed as it heals. Ultimately, the scab falls off. The skin underneath may be a little more pink or reddish than usual for a few days. There may be other symptoms such as fever, a sore throat and bodyache."
What is a stye?,"'A ''stye'' is painful inflammation and swelling of the ''eyelid'' with accumulation of pus. It is caused by infection by the bacteria ''staphylococcus''. With appropriate treatment, it resolves without any complications.' "
What are the types of stye?,"'There are ''two main types: hordeolum and ''chalazion''. They have different causes and treatment.' Hordeolum: It occurs due to blockage of the sweat gland found in the skin of the eyelid at the base of the eyelashes or a small sebaceous gland present at the base of the eyelashes. Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, a waxy, oily substance, that provides moisture and protection to the skin and hair. Chalazion: It occurs due to blockage of a meibomian gland, which is a special sebaceous gland present only in the eyelid. It is located inside the eyelid and opens at the rim of the eyelid behind the lashes."
What are the signs and symptoms of a stye?,"'After symptoms appear, a small ''pimple'' will develop in the affected area. Usually this is accompanied by ''swollen eyes''. Sometimes just the immediate area is swollen; at other times, the entire eyelid swells.\xa0Other symptoms include:' It appears as a swollen, red bump over the upper or lower eyelid. Multiple swellings may be present Puffiness of the eyes Pain and tenderness  Increased warmth over the affected area Increased pressure over the eyes  Heaviness of the eye Epiphora (watering of the eyes) Crusting around the eyelids and eyelashes  Crusting may cause the eyelids to stick to each other  Itching  Pus discharge that may or may not be mixed with blood Fever "
Can you pop a stye?,"'Because a ''stye'' may sometimes be similar in appearance to a pimple, it should not be touched repeatedly or popped. Popping a stye can be very painful, leading to worsening of infection and recurrence or scarring.' "

How do I get rid of the stomach flu?,"'The medical treatment for ''stomach flu'' is based on maintaining adequate hydration and body sodium-potassium levels. The treatment for stomach ''flu'' initially consists of self-care measures such as' You should drink plenty of liquids, clear broths, soups or noncaffeinated drinks taking small frequent sips. Gradually, you should begin to eat bland, easy-to-digest foods like bananas, rice and chicken. You should avoid certain foods and substances until you feel better like dairy products, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, fatty or spicy food. You should get plenty of rest because the illness can cause weakness. Painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can make your stomach more upset; therefore, you should be cautious about the medication. You will get mild anti-inflammatory drugs such as acetaminophen from your doctor. You should avoid antibiotics because they fight bacteria not viruses. Antibiotic overuse can encourage the development of an antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria. Dehydration in stomach flu can lead to serious problems. In severe dehydration, you may require hospitalization and your doctor may inject fluids through your veins."

How do you  manage stomach flu in children?," Help your child to rehydrate with the help of oral rehydration solution (ORS) that is available at pharmacies. Your pediatrician may guide you to prepare this solution. It prevents and treats early dehydration and replaces the ongoing fluid loss. Avoid giving plain water to your child because replacing lost electrolytes is also necessary. Gradually introduce bland, easy-to-digest food such as bananas, rice and potatoes to your child. Avoid certain food items such as dairy products or sugary foods such as ice cream, sodas and candy. Make sure your child gets plenty of rest to get rid of illness, weakness and dehydration. If your sick baby is vomiting or has a bout of diarrhea, let their stomach rest for 15 to 20 minutes and then offer small amounts of liquid. Continue breastfeeding your baby. If your baby is bottle-fed, offer small sips of an ORS or a regular formula. Do not dilute the baby’s formula food. When the child is mild-to-moderately dehydrated, resume the age-appropriate diet. Age-appropriate diets should be continued in children with diarrhea who are not dehydrated. Use medication in children only after discussing it with your pediatrician. Your pediatrician may prescribe zinc supplements and probiotics to your child to reduce the severity and duration of illness. If your child has shock, severe dehydration and low consciousness, then they need to be hospitalized and the pediatrician will give fluid therapy through the child’s vein."

Second-degree or partial-thickness burns: These affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin. Second-degree burns can cause pain, redness, swelling and blistering. Third-degree or full-thickness burns: These affect the deep layers of the skin. They can cause white or blackened, burned skin. Third-degree burns may make the skin numb. Run cold water over the affected part. Alternatively, you may soak the burned part in a cool water bath (not ice water). The affected part must be kept underwater for at least 5 to 30 minutes. This must be followed by covering the part with a dry and clean dressing. Apply cold, wet compresses for about 10 minutes or until the pain gets better. Calm and reassure the affected person. After the skin has cooled, you may apply moisturizing lotion containing aloe, petroleum jelly or antibiotic cream two to three times a day. Do not apply butter, ointments or toothpaste to the burn because they may cause an infection. You may take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen to reduce pain and inflammation. The burned area should be protected from pressure and friction. After the burn has healed, you must protect the area from the sun through protective clothing or applying a broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more. Ensure your safety and bring the affected person to a safe place so that they are not touching any burning or smoking materials. In case of an electrical burn, do not touch the person. Try moving them away from the source with the help of nonmetallic objects. Use a thick material such as a wool or cotton coat, rug or blanket to wrap the affected person to help put the fire out. Pour water on the person. Do not remove the burned clothes sticking on the person’s skin. Ensure that the person is breathing. Rescue breathing and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must begin when needed.

Medical management uses hormonal therapy to suppress hormones.''The most commonly used hormonal therapies as well as ''oral contraceptives'' are as follows''Surgical therapy involves destroying endometrial mass and breaking the bond between the fallopian tube and ovary that interferes with the ovum transport. The different techniques used are as follows' Medroxyprogesterone acetate Elagolix Danazol Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol Norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol Leuprolide Laparoscopic surgery Laser therapy  Removal of nerve bundles
What to expect after endometriosis treatment," The medical therapy may continue for six months. Taking the medications regularly as prescribed is important. It is important to know that medical therapy may have other adverse effects. Endometriosis is a progressive disease. It is one of the causes of infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Individuals may develop the symptoms again within five years of medical therapy. Minimally invasive surgery results in a better fertility rate. The symptoms usually go away after a woman reaches menopause. Pregnancy is possible for individuals with endometriosis, although it may require fertility treatment."
What is a miscarriage?,"'The loss of a baby within the first 20 weeks of ''pregnancy'' is called a ''miscarriage'"". When the unborn baby's weight is less than 400 grams and the baby dies, it is also considered a miscarriage.

About 75% of women who have had three or four miscarriages will go on to have a successful pregnancy later. A doctor or nurse may refer to a miscarriage as a spontaneous abortion. Abortion is a common medical name for all pregnancies that end before 20 weeks. If a miscarriage occurs in the first 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy, it’s referred to as an early miscarriage. If pregnancy loss occurs after 14 weeks and up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, it’s referred to as a late miscarriage.' "

How is a miscarriage usually treated?,"'Once a pregnancy has ended, there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage from occurring.''Patients may also be advised to take' Natural: Many women prefer to wait for the miscarriage to occur naturally. An incomplete miscarriage should happen within a week. A missed miscarriage may take longer to begin naturally (three to four weeks). Medication: Women may prefer to take medication to ensure the miscarriage happens sooner rather than later. An incomplete miscarriage will usually be passed within six to eight hours of taking the medication. A missed miscarriage can happen quickly or may not happen for a few weeks. There are side effects that can occur with the medication, such as nausea and vomiting, chills, fever and diarrhea. These effects usually only last for a few hours but can be distressing. Surgery: In rare cases, women need surgery to remove the pregnancy tissue (called a dilation and curettage or D&C). This may happen in the case of a missed miscarriage if there is severe bleeding and pain or if patient preference is to avoid medication and they don’t wish to wait for a miscarriage to begin naturally. A surgery called D&C happens under general anesthesia and the surgery happens through the vagina. Like all surgical procedures, there are some risks involved such as infection, heavy bleeding (retained pregnancy tissue), damage to the cervix and risks associated with anesthesia.

Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL): More serious than ACL, it occurs due to a serious blow on the knee, causing excruciating pain and swelling. Tendon rupture: Extensive stretching or kicking can rupture the tendon (the band of fibrous tissue attaching the muscle to the bone) present inside the knee. Meniscal injuries: Injury or overuse of the meniscus (cartilaginous structure) that cushions the knee joint can lead to its tear. The meniscus will tear off and float in the knee joint. Knee dislocation: A powerful blow to the knee may cause knee dislocation leading to a medical emergency. Dislocated kneecap (patella): Injury to the knee or forceful straightening of the leg causes dislocation of the kneecap. Bursitis: The joint sac of the knee gets inflamed as a result of a trauma, an infection, or crystalline deposits. Tendonitis: Inflammation of the tendon in the knee typically seen in a basketball or volleyball player Osgood-Schlatter disease: This condition occurs due to repetitive stretching of the knees, causing inflammation of the bony protuberance at the top of the shin bone."
What are the different ways to prevent knee pain?,"'Knee pain cannot be avoided, although trying out certain things may make you less susceptible to sustaining a ''knee injury''. These include:' Staying slim Stretching your knees or performing strengthening exercises Exercising according to your body Protecting the knee with knee pads Using proper footwear"
What do stretch marks mean?,"'A stretch mark (striae or striae distensae) is a form of scarring on the skin with a pinkish or whitish hue that appears when your skin stretches or shrinks quickly.''Collagen is a protein underneath your skin that makes it more elastic and supports your skin. Your skin tries to heal any abrupt change or tear in your skin collagen, and in that process, ''stretch marks'' may appear on your skin.''They often appear on your belly, arms, breasts, back, shoulders, torso, hips, buttocks or thighs. These grooves or lines aren’t painful or harmful. However, some people may feel awkward about their appearance. Over time, they become less noticeable.' "
What do stretch marks look like?,"'A stretch mark varies depending on when they form, the cause, the location and the type and color of your skin. They may appear as follows' Slightly depressed, parallel lines or long, thin, rippled streaks on your skin With pink, red, black, blue, silver or purple hue Bright dark streaks that may fade to a lighter shade over time Whitish and scar-like appearance over time Several centimeters long and one to 10 mm wide, usually Different texture than your normal skin and may look wrinkled Stripes covering large parts of your body, especially the tummy, torso, breast, hips, buttocks or thighs Slightly raised and can be itchy, especially early new marks"
Why do they appear?,"'Anyone can develop ''stretch marks'', but you may get stretch marks due to the following reasons' Being a woman  Pregnancy (especially last trimester) Sudden rapid excessive weight gain Rapid loss of weight Puberty (sexual maturity) Hormonal treatment (steroids) After breast enhancement surgery Bodybuilding Family history  Certain diseases or conditions such as Cushing syndrome (a disorder due to a high level of the hormone cortisol)Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a disorder with very stretchy skin that bruises easily)Marfan’s syndrome (a disorder that weakens your skin fibers and causes unusual growth) Cushing syndrome (a disorder due to a high level of the hormone cortisol) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a disorder with very stretchy skin that bruises easily) Marfan’s syndrome (a disorder that weakens your skin fibers and causes unusual growth)"
How do I permanently get rid of stretch marks?,"'Stretch marks are usually considered a cosmetic issue. Rarely, they can be extensive where they may tear easily in an accident. Like any scar, stretch marks are permanent and may fade with time. Because stretch marks are caused due to a tear deep inside your skin, there is no absolute cure for it. However, some treatments may make them less noticeable. Some treatments can help you with the ''itch''. There is no single treatment that works for everyone and some treatments don’t work at all.\xa0''Stretch marks may diminish with the help of certain ''over-the-counter products'' or procedures, but will never disappear completely. If you are concerned about the look of the skin, then some treatments may be effective.''To help your skin to produce more collagen, a skin doctor (dermatologist) or ''plastic surgeon'' may suggest or perform one or more of the following procedures to give you the best results.' Moisturizers: Hyaluronic acid-based cream is most often prescribed. If applied in the early stage of stretch marks, it may make the stretch marks less noticeable. Topical retinoid therapy: Tretinoin (retinoid) or retinol works best for some people. If applied in the early stage every night for 24 weeks, it may make them less noticeable. However, it may be associated with side effects if not used as directed. It should be avoided in pregnancy because it can be harmful. Pulsed dye laser therapy: This is a painless blast of light used to relax blood vessels under your skin that cause stretch marks. Fractional CO2 laser therapy: Old white marks may smooth out with this therapy. It may be more effective than topical creams such as glycolic acid and tretinoin. Excimer laser therapy: Stretch marks are targeted by a safe ultraviolet-B light. It may take more than one to four months to correct the pigmentation of your stretch marks. Microdermabrasion: Tiny crystals or microneedles are used to rub off the upper layer of your skin to help fade new stretch marks. If combined with skin-peeling treatment, it may give better results. Chemical peels: Burning of the top layer of your skin with glycolic acid (an acidic solution) may boost new skin growth. This may provide a slight improvement in appearance, but it may not permanently get rid of stretch marks. Radiofrequency: Radio wave energy creates heat and triggers your body to produce more collagen. It is found to be safe and can improve the appearance of stretch marks. Ultrasound treatment: This works similar to radiofrequency treatment. In this procedure, sound waves are sent deep into your skin to create heat and tighten and trigger your skin to produce collagen. Cosmetic surgery: Surgeries such as a tummy tuck may help to remove the skin with stretch marks. However, the surgery itself could leave a new, painful scar and surgery is expensive."
Can I prevent stretch marks?,"'You may try to prevent stretch marks, but there is no guarantee. The best way to prevent stretch marks is to maintain a healthy weight, even during pregnancy. You can ask for an ''exercise'' and a healthy ''diet'' plan from your doctor. This is the best way to reduce your chances of getting stretch marks.''Researchers say many remedies such as almond oil, cocoa butter, olive oil and ''vitamin E'' do not help to prevent stretch marks. Using products containing ''Centella asiatica ''herb and hyaluronic acid may help you prevent stretch marks, but only to a certain extent.' "
What test methods to doctors use to detect and diagnose COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)?,"'Tests for coronavirus\xa0may use two methods to detect the ''SARS''-CoV-2 virus, the cause of ''COVID-19'' disease, a\xa0debilitating and potentially deadly viral ''pneumonia''.\xa0''The tests are:\xa0' genomic detection-based (molecular) immunoglobulin detection-based (serology)"
How do the  gene tests for the COVID-19 coronavirus work?,"'The first and most prevalent method to detect the virus in individuals is based on detecting genetic material specific to ''SARS''-CoV-2 ''viruses'' in a person’s nasopharyngeal secretions.''Although tests kits have a wide variation in their procedures (swabs of oral and/or of nasal surfaces, differences in solutions to transfer the swabbed tissue to, time and place to run the subsequent test reagents, for example), they all use methods that detect a specific part of the viral genome.''Here is an example of how one test system accomplishes this:' Swabbed tissue is loaded into a standard reaction vial Reagents (the general term for additional chemicals needed in such tests) break open viruses to expose viral genome (RNA) to other reagents like synthesized RNA that binds to a specific small part of the viral RNA This small bound-up strand of viral genome and reagent is then replicated many times (in some tests, up to a billion times!) over minutes to hours Then, at the same time, another reagent specifically binds to each replicated genetic complex.This reagent has a bounded marker that when enough replicated complexes are made, the machines can detect the attached marker. For example, the marker may be designed to glow with fluorescence, which the machine can pick up on its sensors. This reagent has a bounded marker that when enough replicated complexes are made, the machines can detect the attached marker.  For example, the marker may be designed to glow with fluorescence, which the machine can pick up on its sensors. Depending on how many viruses are present in the sample, positive results may occur (depending on the test used) in minutes to days Conversely, if the test detects no viral material after a fixed time (minutes to days), the result is a negative test"
What do the results of the COVID-19 coronavirus gene test mean?,"'The qualitative results from these tests are either the person is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and considered to be able to transmit the disease (a positive test) or is negative for the virus.\xa0''This test cannot tell whether a person is immune from past infection or has yet to be exposed and is still in danger, however.' "
What are immunoglobulin detection-based tests for COVID-19 coronavirus?,"'Immunoglobulin detection tests are based on the qualitative detection of IgM and IgG that are specifically generated by the body in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\xa0''IgM is usually the first, specific antibody type generated by the body in response to infection. Then, the IgG antibody type is generated and replaces IgM as the predominant antibody in the response to infection.\xa0''IgM and IgG fight infections by targeting\xa0specific antigens on the surface of the SARS-nCoV-2\xa0virus.\xa0''In general, immunoglobulin\xa0tests use specific viral antigens to detect the IgM and/or IgG antibodies against those antigens.''Here is a sample of how the test works:' Collect 2-3 drops of fresh blood/serum or plasma and place it in a sample container and place 2-3 drops of provided buffer in the same container (cassette) The cassette allows the diluted sample to move through the cassette by capillary action The cassette has labeled SARS-CoV-2 antigen that may  bind chemically with either IgM or IgG; thus, forming an antigen/antibody complexes of antigen/IgG and/or antigen/IgM    After that reaction, the antigen/antibody product passes over anti-IgM and anti-IgG antibodies that are immobilized in a line within the cassette The anti-IgM and/or anti-IgG then will capture the specific complex and signal a result (a red line) if either complex is bound to the immobile anti-IgM or anti-IgG  The results need to be read after 10 minutes and no more than 15 minutes (the test resembles a home pregnancy test in this respect.)  A third line is a control line; it indicates that the test is working properly"
What do the COVID-19 immunoglobulin test results mean?,"'A total of three detection lines are possible, the control with (C) line appearing when sample has finished flowing through the cassette, indicating the test is complete.\xa0''The following are what the results mean:''Immunoglobulin tests for ''COVID-19'' cannot confirm the presence of the virus in your system. It can only tell whether you have been exposed in the past or if you have never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, it should only be used alone as a screening test and should be used in tandem with a genetic-based test to determine a complete status. Genetic testing is the gold standard for ''COVID-19'' diagnosis.' Negative Result: If only the quality control line (C) appears and the detection lines G and M are not visible, then no novel coronavirus antibody has been detected and the result is negative. Positive Result, IgM only: If both the quality control line (C) and the detection line M appears, then the novel coronavirus IgM antibody has been detected and the result is positive for the IgM antibody. Positive Result, IgG only: If both the quality control line (C) and the detection line G appears, then the novel coronavirus IgG antibody has been detected and the result is positive for the IgG antibody. Positive Result, IgG and IgM: If the quality control line (C) and both detection lines G and M appear, then the novel coronavirus IgG and IgM antibodies have been detected and the result is positive for both the IgG and IgM antibodies."
How can you get your COVID-19 infection status?,"'The goals of mass testing are to accurately test most people to determine their status in relation to this infectious disease so they can go forward with their lives.''The large majority of people fall into the categories below:''The results of these two different COVID-19 tests, run in tandem, can determine the person’s status as described below:''In most cases, independent of the results of the immunoglobulin tests, the test for the viral genes still must be administered to confirm infection status.' People that have COVID-19, (with or without symptoms), Some results may also show whether or not the infected patient's immune system seems to be responding well or poorly to the virus People not yet exposed to the virus, People that have immunologically responded and have a good antibody response (and possibly be an antibody donor to help fight the virus in other people), People able to go back to work and be unaffected by the virus and currently not transmitting the virus, even if they were positive for the virus at some point in the past. A positive gene test means the person is actively shedding virus and is contagious; A negative gene test means the person is not shedding virus;With two negative genetic tests done 24 hours apart, according to CDC, the person is not contagious (shedding virus), meaning the person either has never been infected or (if previously infected) is no longer shedding virus. With two negative genetic tests done 24 hours apart, according to CDC, the person is not contagious (shedding virus), meaning the person either has never been infected or (if previously infected) is no longer shedding virus. If immunoglobulin tests are all negative, the test indicates the person has not been recently exposed to the COVID-19 virus. If the test shows only IgM, the person is likely in the early stage of the virus infection; If IgM and IgG are positive, the person is likely in the middle stage of infection, If the person is only positive for IgG, then the person is either over the infection or in its last stage."
How do they fix a perforated duodenal ulcer?,"'Omental patching'' is a surgical procedure for treating perforated ulcers. It is also called a Graham patch after the surgeon who first performed this technique. This procedure uses a patch of the omentum to repair the injury because it is durable.\xa0''Omental patching may be combined with other procedures such as the resection of the vagus nerve that stimulates acid production (vagotomy) to reduce acid production in the stomach or combined with other surgical procedures in case of very large ulcers.\xa0''The medical treatment of ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'') infection and acidity is required. ''Diet'' and lifestyle modifications would have to be followed after the surgery to prevent the recurrence of ulcers. Sometimes, a perforated ulcer can seal itself by an adherent omentum. Hence, the patient may be managed with medical treatment instead of surgery.''An ulcer'' is discontinuation occurring on the external or internal surface of the body. Caused by ''trauma'' to the skin or a mucous membrane that does not heal, ulcers vary in width and depth. They can be painful and lead to severe complications. Ulcers can occur in the ''esophagus'', stomach, and ''intestines'' (duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and connected to the stomach).''Ulcers occur when acid damages the lining of the digestive tract. The common causes of ulcers are bacteria ''Helicobacter pylori'', improper ''diet'' habits, and medication that increases the stomach acid level (''pain reliever'' group). If the ulcers are not treated appropriately, there is continuous damage to the lining of the digestive tract, and the depth of the ulcer increases, ultimately leading to complete perforation (a hole) and bleeding.''The omentum ''is a double-layered fatty tissue that covers and supports the intestines and organs in the abdomen. The omentum is made up of the greater omentum that is important storage for fat and the lesser omentum that connects the stomach and intestines to the ''liver''.' "
How is an omental patch surgery performed?," The surgeon performs the complete physical assessment, and complete blood and radiological analyses before the surgery and takes informed consent from the patient. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia.  Different types of incisions may be used during the surgery, but the upper midline incision is the most popular, which provides good surgical exposure.  Once the bowel perforation is identified, sponges would be used to prevent further spillage of the stomach/intestinal contents at the perforation site.  Sutures are placed to prevent the leakage from bringing the margins closer. The greater omentum is then detached from the intestines and stomach.  Once the omentum is mobilized, it is then lengthened by dividing it according to the anatomic pattern of the vessels.  The omentum is then transferred to the site required to patch and strengthen the sutured area (stitches).  The applied tension to the sutures should be strong enough to stabilize the omentum in place but loose enough to preserve the omental blood supply. The surgical wound is then closed. A surgical drain may be inserted to drain the accumulated fluid and blood.  A tube placed through the skin of the abdomen into the midsection of the small intestine (feeding jejunostomy tube) may be inserted to provide nutrition postoperatively. A laparoscopic omental patch closure of the perforated duodenal ulcer has become increasingly common. It is less invasive, and the recovery rate is fast.  Multiple small incisions are made over the abdomen through which the laparoscope (a long, thin tube that has a tiny video camera and light on the end) and surgical instruments are inserted. A feeding jejunostomy tube may be inserted. Painkillers and antibiotics are administered after the surgery.  The patient may have to stay in the hospital for three-seven days after the surgery.  Feeding would be done through the jejunostomy feeding tube because oral feeding would be delayed until the patch heals.  Intravenous nutritional therapy may be administered as an alternative to a feeding tube. Attention to nutrition in the postoperative period is important to improve the health status of the patients and ensure adequate healing.  Pain, swelling, and bruising is normal in the postoperative period and usually resolves within two weeks.  Complete recovery can take four to six weeks."
What are the complications of an omental patch surgery?,'The success rate of the surgery is high. Some complications that may be encountered are:' Paralytic Ileus (paralysis of the small intestine) Bleeding Infection  Abscess (pus) formation  Gastric outlet obstruction Necrosis (tissue death) Post-operative leak
Why do doctors induce labor?,"'It is not always necessary to induce labor. Doctors induce labor when''Induction can also be induced electively without having any of the reasons above. This may be carried out if the ''pregnant'' woman is full-term and' Labor fails to start by itself even after crossing two weeks beyond the due date. There is less amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac, which surrounds the baby. The amniotic sac has ruptured but labor did not start. There is an infection in the uterus. The baby weighs less for its gestational age. The mother develops diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy. The placenta gets separated from the uterus. Has a history of rapid vaginal deliveries Stays far away from the hospital or medical center"
What are the risks of inducing labor?,"'Labor induction carries various possible risks, including:''Women should stay away from risky tricks, such as consuming castor oil, exercising, or having sex to induce labor. They should know that labor induction is not for everyone. Only the doctor can decide the right candidates for whom labor can be induced with safe and evidence-based methods.' Induction failure: Induction of labor fails in around 25% of women when induction has been attempted. At such times, doctors may have no option but to go for a cesarean section. Infection: If the amniotic sac remains ruptured for a long time even after trying ways to induce labor, it may get infected. A low heart rate of the baby: The medicines used to induce the labor may affect the baby’s oxygen levels and cause its heart rate to become low. Bleeding: The induction process may end up affecting the capacity of the uterus to relax. The contracted state of the uterus may result in bleeding after the delivery."
Why is obstetric ultrasound performed?,"""Obstetric ultrasound is a safe and painless procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce pictures of the developing baby (fetus or embryo) inside the mother’s womb. It also shows pictures of the mother's uterus and ovaries. Obstetric ultrasound is an important part of antenatal (before the delivery of the baby) care. It can tell about:"" The presence of a living embryo or fetus The age of a pregnancy The expected date of delivery Presence of any abnormalities of the fetus The presence of an ectopic pregnancy (the embryo or fetus is present outside the womb) The position of the fetus inside the womb The position of the placenta and diagnosis of any placental abnormalities Number of embryo or fetus (diagnosis of multiple pregnancies) The amount of amniotic fluid around the developing fetus The presence of any opening or shortening of the cervix The adequacy of fetal growth Fetal wellbeing"
Are there any risks of an obstetric ultrasound?,"'Obstetric ultrasound is used for diagnostic purposes and does not have any risks for the mother or the baby. It is a safe and noninvasive procedure since it does not involve the usage of any ionizing radiations, any needles, or injections on the patient.' "
What do you mean by neonatal resuscitation?,"'Neonatal'' resuscitation is a procedure performed if a ''newborn'' infant does not start ''breathing'' spontaneously immediately after birth. Neonatal resuscitation provides oxygen, stimulates breathing and gets the ''heart'' to start pumping normally.''A majority of ''babies'' start breathing on their own and need only routine neonatal care. Approximately 10% of newborn require some assistance for the transition from fetus to newborn, and about 1% require extensive resuscitative measures.\xa0''Most premature babies and babies with certain congenital conditions require extensive resuscitation.' "
What are the steps in neonatal resuscitation?,"'Readiness and capability in handling a potential emergency during delivery are two most important components of successful neonatal resuscitation. Preparation for neonatal resuscitation includes the following:''The initial steps in neonatal resuscitation include:' Skilled personnel: Medical personnel in the delivery room must be skilled in neonatal resuscitation. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program is a highly respected training program for delivery room personnel, developed jointly by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association (AHA). Resuscitation equipment: The delivery room should be equipped with all the tools required for neonatal resuscitation. Anticipation of potential problems: Anticipation and identification of the risk factors, though not always possible, is greatly helpful in successful neonatal resuscitation. Rapid assessment: The infant must be rapidly assessed to determine need for resuscitation. Resuscitation must be considered and/or initiated if the answer is “no” to any of the following questions:Is the baby born after full gestation term?Is the amniotic fluid clear of meconium (baby’s first stool) and signs of infection?Is the baby breathing and crying?Does the baby have good muscle tone? Is the baby born after full gestation term? Is the amniotic fluid clear of meconium (baby’s first stool) and signs of infection? Is the baby breathing and crying? Does the baby have good muscle tone? ThermoregulationMaintaining adequate warmth during neonatal resuscitation is of primary importance. Loss of heat increases the newborn’s metabolic rate in order to generate heat. As a result, the oxygen requirement also is driven up, which is dangerous in a baby already under respiratory distress.Some of the measures taken to keep the baby warm include the following:Using pre-warmed towels to dry the babyUsing pre-warmed blankets and bed warmersMaintaining a room temperature of 75 F to 80 F based on the baby’s gestational age and birth weight.Using heat-resistant food grade plastic wrap around premature infants with low birthweightUsing an adequately pre-warmed incubatorThe AAP and AHA state that the baby’s body temperature should be maintained at 97.7 F (36.5 C). Temperature is recorded as soon as possible after birth and every 10 to 15 minutes thereafter. Maintaining adequate warmth during neonatal resuscitation is of primary importance.

If more stimulation is required, gently slapping the soles of the feet or rubbing the back can initiate breathing. EvaluationThe initial steps should be completed with an evaluation of the baby’s respiratory rate, heart rate and skin color, within 30 seconds after birth. If the baby is pink, breathing normally, and has a heart rate of over 100 beats per minute (BPM), no further intervention is required. The baby stays under observation and receives routine neonatal care.If the newborn does not meet the criteria for routine care after the initial steps, supplemental oxygen with assisted ventilation is initiated within the next 30 seconds.

The baby stays under observation and receives routine neonatal care. If the newborn does not meet the criteria for routine care after the initial steps, supplemental oxygen with assisted ventilation is initiated within the next 30 seconds. Assisted ventilationAssisted ventilation is a procedure performed with a mask or a thin tube inserted into the trachea to provide oxygen and stimulate breathing. Assisted ventilation is a procedure performed with a mask or a thin tube inserted into the trachea to provide oxygen and stimulate breathing. Supplemental oxygenIf the baby is breathing adequately and sustains a heart rate of over 100 BPM, but remains blue (cyanotic), supplemental oxygen is provided with a mask or oxygen tubing. Supplemental oxygen is maintained until the saturation level in the blood is at 92% to 96% in full term babies and 88% to 92% in preterm babies.Supplemental oxygen is usually delivered at the concentration it is present in the room air, which is 21%, but may be increased if required. If oxygen requirement continues for a relatively long period, heated and humidified oxygen is supplied with an oxygen hood. If the baby is breathing adequately and sustains a heart rate of over 100 BPM, but remains blue (cyanotic), supplemental oxygen is provided with a mask or oxygen tubing.

Supplemental oxygen is usually delivered at the concentration it is present in the room air, which is 21%, but may be increased if required. If oxygen requirement continues for a relatively long period, heated and humidified oxygen is supplied with an oxygen hood. Positive pressure ventilationIf the baby continues to be blue and in respiratory distress (gasping or not breathing), with a heart rate below 100 BPM, positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is initiated. PPV maintains a continuous flow of air under stable pressure and helps inflate the airway and lungs, and stimulate breathing.A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device provides ventilation through a mask. The baby is evaluated after 30 seconds of PPV and if the baby’s respiration and heart rate continue to be depressed, the next steps are intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If the baby continues to be blue and in respiratory distress (gasping or not breathing), with a heart rate below 100 BPM, positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is initiated.

How do you do CPR on a neonate?,"'CPR is initiated if the baby’s heart rate remains below 60 BPM after 30 seconds of PPV. CPR involves intubation, chest compressions and administration of medications that raise the heart rate.''Intubation procedure involves inserting a thin flexible tube (endotracheal tube) into the infant’s trachea. The endotracheal tube helps keep the airway clear and open and delivers oxygen to the lungs directly. A newborn may require intubation in the following situations:''Medications are administered if the baby’s heart rate remains below 60 BPM after 60 seconds of chest compressions and ventilation, while continuing with the next cycle of CPR. Currently recommended medications include:''The medications may be administered through the endotracheal tube into the lungs or intravenously through an umbilical catheter.' Before starting chest compressions To suction the trachea directly Ineffective bag-mask ventilation Prolonged need for ventilation To administer medications Suspected congenital hernia in the diaphragm After positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with intubation for 30 seconds, if the heart rate remains below 60 BPM, chest compressions are performed. Chest compressions are performed on the lower third of the breastbone (sternum) to a depth of approximately one-third of the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest. Compressions are delivered with thumbs on the sternum with the fingers encircling the chest. Ideally, the CPR cycle consists of three chest compressions to one breath from the ventilator at the rate of 90 compressions/30 breaths per minute. This is 3:1 ratio of compressions to ventilations comprises a single set of compressions/ventilations. After each set of 3 compressions/ventilations, the chest is allowed to fully re-expand with the ventilatory breath and exhalation takes place with the first compression of the next cycle. The baby’s respiration, heart rate and color are evaluated every 60 seconds and chest compressions are discontinued when the baby’s spontaneous heart rate goes (and remains) above 60 BPM. Epinephrine: To increase the heart rate and blood pressure. Saline solution: To increase the blood volume. O-negative packed red blood cells: To supplement red blood cells in the event of blood loss. "
What are the immediate steps post resuscitation?,"'After completion of successful resuscitation, the newborn is continuously monitored to make sure the baby’s vital signs stay normal. Full-term babies who sustain spontaneous breathing and heart rates above 100 BPM with initial steps of resuscitation or supplemental oxygen are placed close to the mother and kept under observation.''Babies who are extremely premature and babies who undergo PPV and more extensive resuscitation will need post resuscitation care which may include the following:' Once the lungs and heart start functioning, mechanical ventilation may be continued for a period. Babies requiring assisted ventilation for a prolonged period will be ventilated with humidified and heated oxygen until they can be weaned off assisted ventilation safely. Glucose, fluid and electrolytes levels are monitored and maintained with appropriate infusion of glucose and fluids to achieve a normal balance (homeostasis). Babies who require continued intensive care, extremely premature babies for instance, are moved to a remote neonatal intensive care unit for further care, placed in humidified incubators, and monitored closely with appropriate interventions as needed."
What are the potential complications during neonatal resuscitation?,"'Many congenital and other conditions can lead to complications during neonatal resuscitation. Some of the main reasons for complications include:''Extremely premature infants are fragile and vulnerable to injury because they are not fully developed. Low birth weight and underdevelopment puts premature babies at a greater risk for:''Complications because of a thin, immature skin, such as:''Intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain’s fluid-filled areas known as ventricles) and periventricular leukomalacia (brain tissue death from bleeding), because the brain’s blood vessels are not fully developed. These disorders can lead to permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities.''Airway problems include:''Conditions that cause pulmonary compression include:''Other situations that can pose problems in the delivery room include the following:' Respiratory failure requiring extensive resuscitative measures and prolonged ventilation with its associated risks such as: Injury to the delicate trachea and lungs Fluctuations in cerebral blood flow High water and heat loss Increased risk for bacterial skin infections Toxic reactions to any skin applications Low blood glucose levels Choanal atresia: Blocked nasal passage from incomplete fetal development. Pierre Robin syndrome: A condition in which a baby has a very small lower jaw resulting in displacement of the tongue, blocking the airway. Tracheal webbing: A web of tissue near the vocal cords blocking the airway. Esophageal atresia: A blind esophagus unconnected to the stomach. There are several types of this disorder with or without an abnormal connection to the trachea. Cystic adenomatoid malformation: Masses in the lung. Cystic hygromas: Congenital deformity of the lymphatic channels leading to accumulation of lymphatic fluid and compression of the airway. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Incomplete development of the diaphragm resulting in a hernia with abdominal organs pushing in and compressing the lungs. Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum: Rupture of pulmonary tissue resulting in air leak in the space around the lungs or in between the lungs. Multiple gestation: Multiple gestation infants are often premature and require adequate equipment and trained personnel during delivery. Hydrops fetalis: A condition in which fluid accumulates in the spaces around organs and compartments in the body. The fluid has to be removed as it can compromise lung and heart function.

How to identify and select fresh sardines?,"'If you want to buy fresh sardine fish, there are certain things that you should check. They are:' Smell: Fresh sardine fish will smell like the sea. A rotten fish will give a pungent odor. Eyes: For sardine fish to be fresh, it should have bulging, clear, and shiny eyes. Eyes that are cloudy or sunken into the head means the fish is stale. Gills: The gills must be wet and bright pink or reddish. They should not be slimy or dry. Skin: The skin should be intact, smooth, and shiny. Flaky skin is a sign of stale fish."
What are the health benefits of sardines?,'Sardines provide a variety of health benefits.'

Importance of good sleep,'Good ''sleep'' hygiene means practicing habits that help you get good quality ''sleep'' every night. Adequate sleep is essential for your overall mental and physical health.' 
How do you fall asleep in five minutes?,"'There are no quick fixes to fall asleep within five minutes. Here are some tips that will help you fall asleep faster.\xa0' Sleep when sleepy: Try to sleep when you actually feel tired or sleepy rather than spending too much time awake in bed. Avoid looking at the clock when in bed. This will delay sleep onset. Use your bed only for sleep and sex: Try not to use your bed for anything other than sleep and sex. If you use the bed to watch TV, eat, read, work on your laptop and other things, your body will not learn to associate bed with sleeping. Stick to a schedule: Always stick to a specific bedtime and get up at the same time every day, including weekends. Consistency will make it easier to fall asleep faster. Practice a bedtime ritual: Certain activities, such as taking a warm bath, massaging your head with warm oil, reading a book, listening to music and practicing deep breathing exercises for 15 to 30 minutes before sleeping makes your body aware that bedtime is near. Certain bedtime snacks like warm milk, chamomile tea, bananas and almonds may make it easier for you to fall asleep. Make your bedroom conducive to sleep: Have a firm mattress and a good pillow with neck support. The bedroom must be dark, but cool. Use earplugs or an eye mask  if sound and light bother you too much. A room temperature of about 65 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal to fall asleep. Unplug: Avoid the use of laptops, eBooks and cell phones at least 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. The blue light emitted from computer screens and hand-held devices can confuse your brain and make it difficult to fall asleep. Avoid napping in the afternoon, especially after 3 PM: Naps late in the day,  especially if they are longer than 30 minutes, may make it more difficult to fall asleep. Get regular exercise: Being physically active may help you fall asleep faster. However, exercising in the late evenings may make it difficult to fall asleep. Avoid smoking, coffee and eating a heavy dinner: Drinking alcohol at night may make it easier to fall asleep, but it can cause nighttime awakening and disturbed sleep patterns in the long run. Have a buffer zone before bedtime: Set aside time to worry every day. Use this time well before bedtime to plan your activities for the next day and acknowledge your worries. Using a journal can be helpful. Never take your worries to the bedroom. Expose your eyes to sunlight first thing in the morning: Daylight is key to regulating sleep patterns. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least 30 minutes every day, preferably as soon as you wake up. This will help you wake up during the day and make it easier to fall asleep at night.  Adjust your medication schedule: Some commonly prescribed medicines to treat  heart conditions, high blood pressure, colds or asthma can disrupt sleep patterns. If you have trouble going to sleep, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. They may tell you whether any drugs you are taking might be contributing to your insomnia (inability to sleep). Ask whether those drugs can be taken at other times during the day or early in the evening."
What is HIV?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') is a virus that attacks the cells of the immune system (CD4 cells). CD4+ cells help the body to resist any infections. When the number of these cells goes down, the body is less resistant,which makes it vulnerable to other infections and diseases. ''HIV'' spreads mainly via body fluids (blood and semen) from the infected person.''If untreated, ''HIV'' can lead to ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS''). Hence, treating HIV with antiretroviral therapy (HIV medicine) is necessary to reduce the viral load and prevent transmission of HIV to the patient’s sexual partners.' "
How is HIV transmitted?,"'Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted by coming in direct contact with certain body fluids from the person infected with HIV. These fluids are as follows''The transmission occurs only when the fluid gets into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through open sores or ''cuts'', by direct injection or through contact with a mucous membrane.''The most common ways of spreading HIV are as follows' Blood Semen Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk Having anal or vaginal sex with an HIV-positive person Sharing needles with a person who has HIV Less common ways are as follows During pregnancy or breastfeeding Having oral sex with an infected person Receiving blood products that are contaminated with HIV Getting stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle"
How do you feel when you have HIV?,"'Around two to four weeks after getting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the patient may experience the following symptoms''As the disease progresses, the patient may remain symptomless for quite some time. This stage is also known as clinical latency. During this stage, the virus multiplies at a low level. Without treatment, the patient may remain in this stage for 10 to 15 years. However, the virus remains active during this stage.''If left untreated, HIV progresses to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (''AIDS''). ''AIDS'' can weaken the immune system causing several opportunistic diseases. The patient may experience the following severe symptoms in this stage:' Fever Rash Sore throat Swollen glands Headache Upset stomach Joint aches and pains Unexplainable weight loss Recurring fever Getting tired easily Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin or neck Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week Sores of the mouth, anus or genitals Pneumonia Memory loss and depression Purplish spots on the skin that don’t go away Night sweats Bruises or bleeding due to an unknown reason"
What are the types of HIV tests?,'There are three types of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests used to diagnose HIV infections' Antibody tests: These tests check for HIV antibodies in blood or oral fluid. Antigen/antibody tests: These help to detect both HIV antibodies and antigens in the blood. Nucleic acid tests: These look for HIV in the blood.
How to manage HIV symptoms,"'Antiretroviral medications are the first-line treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Patients should be compliant with the medications to reduce the amount of virus in the body.''The various symptoms and their treatments are as follows' Weight loss: In addition to the HIV medications (antiretroviral therapy), patients should eat a well-balanced diet and high-protein supplements and perform exercises to build muscle mass. The physician may prescribe medications such as Megace (megestrol acetate) and Marinol (dronabinol) to treat wasting syndrome commonly seen in HIV patients. Skin problems: Skin infections or dry itchy skin are usually treated with antifungal or antibacterial cream. Oral medicines may also be required. Herpes (Shingles): Shingles can cause a painful, blistering rash. Antiviral medications, pain relievers and calamine lotions are mainly used to treat rashes. Fever: Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and applying cold compresses may bring down the temperature. Nagging cough: Dry cough can be due to an infection known as pneumocystis pneumonia. The physician may prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. Medicines to thin the mucus may also help. Diarrhea: Doctors may prescribe antidiarrheals to control diarrhea. Patients need to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated."
What are nail bed injuries?,"'Nail bed injuries are the most common type of fingertip injuries seen in emergency rooms. Such an injury may occur if the nail bed is caught between two objects, gets crushed while hammering at a nail or heavy objects fall on the nail. Nail bed injuries may present as nail bed laceration, nail bed avulsion or other injuries such as ''fracture'' of the distal tip of the finger.' "
How do you get nail bed lacerations?,'Nail bed lacerations may occur when''Self-inflicted injuries may cause nail bed lacerations such as\xa0''Proper and optimal management of these nail bed injuries are essential for fast healing and to prevent complications and avoid late deformities.' Sharp knives or objects land with enough force to penetrate your nail plate causing sharp lacerations. Your nail gets crushed between a larger heavy object and your finger bone causes stellate (irregular) laceration. Your nail bed gets squeezed between the hard nail and finger bone due to pressure such as between doors resulting in simple or complex lacerations. Nail-biting Insertion of artificial nails  Improper manicure
How do you fix a laceration on a nail bed?,"'If you get injured on your nails, you must''Reach out to the emergency room quickly if\xa0''Your doctor may assess your history including the timing and type of your injury. After examining and evaluating the extent of your injury clinically and after checking the finger bone or toe bone on X-ray reports, your doctor may''After the doctor’s treatment, you should' Remove the ring or jewelry from your hand. Wash the injury gently with soap and clean water. Cut off rough edges of your nail using a sterile scissor if your nail is torn to avoid further injuries. Apply pressure with a clean cloth to stop the bleeding. Apply ice to that area and take over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen to reduce swelling. Apply antibiotic ointment and bandages, if necessary. Elevate the injured arm or leg above the heart. Your nail is cut or torn and not attached to the nail bed. Your nail has a bruise that is more than one-fourth size of your nail. Your finger or toe is bent or displaced or deformed. Your nail bed wound looks deep and needs suturing. Remove part or your entire nail. Cut the nail bed and close it with stitches after administering lidocaine (local anesthesia). Make a hole in your nail to drain the blood if it is clotting inside the nail bed. Reattach your nail with special glue or stitches. Use a special surgical material if reattachment is not possible, which will remain on your nail bed until it heals properly. Prescribe some antibiotics (ointment and tablets) to prevent infection. Prescribe Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Advil (ibuprofen) to reduce pain and swelling. Place a wire or splint inside your finger if you have broken your finger bone. It will keep your finger bone in place. Give you a tetanus booster injection to prevent septic conditions. Refer you to a plastic surgeon if the loss looks challenging to reconstruct with simple procedures and requires grafts and microsurgical procedures to restore the appearance of your finger or toe. Apply ice for 20 minutes every two hours on the first day and then three times a day thereafter. Keep your hand or foot above the level of your heart to reduce throbbing. Take pain relievers as directed by your doctor such as ibuprofen or naproxen. It may also reduce your swelling. Change the bandage daily. Ask your doctor before using pain relievers if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease or a history of stomach ulcers or internal bleeding."
What should I expect?," Your pain and swelling may heal within a week or 10 days. However, it may take several months to grow back a separate nail. Fingernails take four to six months and toenails take 12 months. If your finger or toe bone has broken along with the nail bed injury, it may take four weeks to heal. If you see any signs of infections such as pus, redness, or a red streak extending from that wound, then see your doctor. Your new nail may have grooves or ridges and may remain permanently distorted."
What causes hypersomnia?,"'Based on the causes, hypersomnia can be divided into two types:''Primary hypersomnia: ''Primary ''insomnia'' does not have any other medical problem as its cause. It is an idiopathic condition and the cause cannot be found.''Secondary hypersomnia: ''This is caused by conditions that include:' Obstructive sleep apnea (cessation of breathing during sleep that results in snoring) Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Parkinsonism Head injury Hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) Depression Heart problems Restless leg syndrome (an uncontrollable urge to move the legs continuously) Narcolepsy (extreme daytime sleepiness and sudden attacks of sleep) Bipolar disorder (mood swings that range from extreme highs to extreme lows)"
How do you know if you have hypersomnia?,"'If you have hypersomnia, you will''With hypersomnia, you may''Excessive sleepiness can become a serious issue when you fall asleep in the middle of an activity that requires you to stay awake, such as driving that could lead to motor accidents.'

Get frequently tired Stay less alert Suffer from anxiety Become irritable easily Develop restlessness Make mistakes often Have poor judgment Work less efficiently"
What is the treatment for hypersomnia?,"'The treatment for hypersomnia includes medications that include''Along with the medications, it is also necessary to follow a regular sleep schedule.''If you have ''sleep apnea'', your doctor may advise you to use a ''CPAP'' machine, which is a nasal device that is connected to a blower that keeps your airways open while asleep.' Stimulants: Armodafinil, modafinil, methylphenidate, or dextroamphetamine are the most commonly used medications for hypersomnia. Antidepressants: These include amitriptyline, clomipramine, and doxepin amongst many others. Newer medications: Some of these include Provigil and Xyrem."
What does shoulder impingement mean?,"'Your shoulder is made up of several joints, tendons (flexible inelastic cord), and muscles that provide a great range of motion to your arm. This group of muscles and tendons is called the ''rotator cuff''.''Sometimes, you may get pain when you raise your arm above your shoulders. The tendons in your shoulder socket may get pinched as it passes between the top of the upper arm bone (humerus) and the tip of your shoulder (acromion) known as shoulder impingement. It is commonly seen in elders and athletes because of a shoulder injury.''You may have a shoulder injury of the following severity:' Grade 1: Swelling, redness, and pain in the shoulder Grade 2: Progressive thickening of the area with reduced mobility Grade 3: Tears in the rotator cuff or changes in the shoulder bone due to bony growth (severe)"
What are the causes of shoulder impingement?," Injury Age above 50 years Tear and wear of your shoulder muscles Weak tendons and muscles Heavy weight-lifting or overhead activities such as hanging, construction, or wall painting Rigorous sports such as swimming, baseball, and tennis Unknown cause"
What are the surgical treatments for shoulder impingement?,"'If your symptoms persist even after all medications, then your doctor may order an ultrasound, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and arthrogram (a picture inside your joint) to rule out any tear in the shoulder socket tendons. If your shoulder imaging shows any tear in the shoulder socket tendons, then your doctor may suggest the following:''After the surgery, your arm may be placed in a sling for a short period to allow healing. Once your discomfort and pain resolve, your doctor will remove the sling. Then you will be instructed to start some shoulder-stretching exercises.''Your doctor will provide rehabilitation support based on your requirements and situation. Exercises are given after the shoulder surgery to help to regain a range of motions of your shoulder and strengthening your arm muscles. It generally requires two to four months to get complete relief from pain. However, some people may require a year.' Arthroscopic arthroplasty: In this procedure, two or three keyhole-shaped cuts are made around your affected shoulder, and a thin fiberoptic scope (camera) is inserted into it. The surgeon examines the inside of your shoulder through a video camera. They may perform arthroplasty (removal of any bony growth or inflamed soft tissue to create more space for the rotator cuff). They may also perform acromioplasty (removal of some part of the tip of your shoulder). Open arthroplasty: In open arthroplasty, your surgeon will make a small cut on the front side of your shoulder. They will inspect the shoulder joint condition directly and perform arthroplasty (repairing it by resurfacing the joint)."
How does an IUD work?,'The basic mechanism of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) is that it acts as a foreign body in the uterus. It invokes a strong reaction due to its presence and makes the uterine ''cavity'' hostile for the sperm. Newer intrauterine devices (IUDs) are loaded with ''progesterone'' that has an added advantage of thickening the cervical mucous and thinning the inner lining of the uterus. The IUD sits in the womb and does not move from there. It starts working as soon as it is put in and stops working as soon as it is taken out. The hormones can also stop the eggs from leaving the ovaries by avoiding ''ovulation'' and preventing ''pregnancy''.\xa0' 
How is an intrauterine device removed?,"'Removing an intrauterine device (IUD) is a quick procedure; however, it should only be done by an experienced medical practitioner. Removing an IUD is usually less painful than putting it in:' The doctor may ask the patient to lay on a table with knees bent and legs apart. The doctor may insert a speculum into the vagina to widen the opening. Threads from your IUD may hang out from the cervix (neck of the womb) into the vagina. The doctor may gently pull on the strings and pull out the device using a special grasping tool. An IUD is T-shaped, and its arms will fold up as it slides out. If the doctor can't see or reach the threads, they may use a special hook or other tools to pull them into view. In rare cases, an IUD won't come out easily because it may get stuck in the wall of the uterus. During such instances, the doctors usually give anesthesia to the patient and widen the cervix with forceps to pull it out. The doctor may use a thin, lighted scope to look inside the vagina and uterus to remove the IUD. The patient may feel mild cramps and spotting or light bleeding for a few days or weeks after the IUD comes out. An over-the-counter pain reliever is usually recommended for a few days."
Can I get pregnant even while using an intrauterine device?,"""Yes, but it is extremely rare. If the intrauterine device (IUD) isn't functioning properly or hasn't been put into place properly, the chances may go up. An\xa0IUD is extremely effective, having a 99% effectiveness rate. When getting an IUD, the patient may either get a non-hormonal IUD that lasts for up to 12 years or a hormonal IUD that usually lasts for two to six years. It should also be noted that IUDs do not offer protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs); hence, it is advised to use ""'condoms'' for avoiding ''sexually transmitted diseases'' and nullifying the chances of ''getting pregnant''.' "
What causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,"'Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' belongs to a broad group of human and animal diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). The cause of CJD and other TSE diseases is due to the abnormality of a protein called a prion. Normally prions are harmless, but when they become misshapen, they can become infectious and affect normal biological processes in the body. The disease is not transmitted through casual touching, sexual contact, ''coughing'', or ''sneezing''.\xa0''Some possible ways of developing CJD are:' Spontaneous: In most cases, the exact cause of CJD or prion disability is not known, and the disorder can arise spontaneously. This is also called sporadic CJD. Genetics: Familial CJD occurs due to genetic mutation associated with CJD that may be inherited. Contamination: Exposure to an infected human or animal tissue during a medical procedure, such as brain surgery, blood transfusion, corneal or skin transplant, or consuming contaminated meat, especially beef. CJD has been associated with eating beef infected with mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). Age: The risk of CJD increases with age, especially after 60 years of age. Familial CJD usually presents at a younger age, usually in the 20s."
What are the signs and symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease? ,"'Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' is characterized by rapid mental deterioration within a few months. The symptoms worsen rapidly. Patients eventually have the failure of multiple organ systems, such as the ''heart'' and ''lungs''. CJD can cause fatal complications leading to death. Early signs and symptoms typically include:' Loss of memory Anxiety Changes in personality Reduced or blurred vision Insomnia Impaired thinking, reasoning, and decision making Difficulty swallowing Sudden, jerky movements of the body Delusions"
How is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease treated?,"'There is no cure for CJD or treatments available to control the disorder or slow or stop the progression of the disease. Treatment mainly involves providing symptom reliefs and providing comfort to the patient.''Opiate ''drugs'' may be administered to relieve the ''pain''. Medications like Sodium valproate, an antiseizure medication can help relieve or reduce involuntary movements, such as muscle jerking and twitching. In the later stages of the disorder, the patient may be bedridden and unable to perform normal activities or care for themselves on their own. Patients who are bedridden for long periods develop complications like bedsores, which need treatment and preventive measures. Most patients require a ''caregiver'' since they aren’t self-sufficient in the later stages. A catheter placed in the bladder will drain the patient’s urine to help the person urinate without having to go to the bathroom. A bedpan may be used by the caregiver to help the patient defecate. Since patients can develop ''difficulty swallowing'', ''nutrition'' may be administered through a tube (Ryle’s tube), which is passed through the nose and into the food pipe, a tube may be placed directly into the stomach, or ''nutrition'' can also be provided intravenously.' "
How to prevent Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?,"'The following measures can help reduce the risk of acquiring and spreading of CJD:' Getting medical treatment in a reputed clinic or hospital where the medical equipment is thoroughly sterilized. Avoiding accepting corneal and skin donations for cornea and skin transplantation, respectively, without knowing the cause of death of the donor. Covering open wounds, cuts, and abrasions on the skin. Wearing gloves, face shield, protective eyewear, disposable gown, or apron while handling human or animal tissue, blood, and fluids. Sterilizing equipment, utensils, or fabrics that are used by CJD patients. Using disposable bed sheets and linens for CJD patients."
What is lupus?,"'Lupus'' is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system targets and attacks its own tissues and organs. Interestingly, more than 90% of ''lupus'' patients are women, and most of them start experiencing symptoms when they are in their childbearing age (15 to 49 years according to WHO).''Note: While the term ''lupus'' can refer to a localized skin condition, this article is referring to the systemic autoimmune disease, ''systemic lupus erythematosus''.'

Is lupus curable?,"'Lupus does not have a cure. As lupus involves different organs in the body, the treatment aims to provide relief from the symptoms and improve quality of life, along with preventing further damage to the organs. Thus, treating lupus is a lifelong process.''Many drugs are used in treating lupus, namely:' Antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine) Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisone) Nonbiologic DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs):CyclophosphamideMethotrexateAzathioprineMycophenolateCyclosporine Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate Azathioprine Mycophenolate Cyclosporine Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS):IbuprofenNaproxenDiclofenac Ibuprofen Naproxen Diclofenac Biologic DMARDsBelimumabrituximabIV immune globulin Belimumab rituximab IV immune globulin"

What is the difference between Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma?,"'Lymphomas'' are of two types, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma.' Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is more common than Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Physicians distinguish the lymphomas by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are absent in Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are giant cells present in the lymph fluid that are easily detectable under the microscope."
What are the different types of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma?,"'Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma involves the abnormal production of white blood cells (lymphocytes) affecting the immune system. These lymphocytes are of two types:''Based on the rate of disease progression, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma can be classified as:''There are some cancers such as mantle cell lymphoma, which do not fall into either category.\xa0' B lymphocytes (B cells): B cells protect the body from foreign microbes by producing antibodies T lymphocytes (T cells): T cells primarily modify the activities of cells of the immune system Indolent lymphomas: The rate of growth and spreading is slow. The most common type of lymphoma is follicular lymphoma. Aggressive lymphomas spread rapidly and require immediate treatment. The most common type is diffuse large B cell lymphoma."
How do you get Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma?,"'Like most cancers, the exact cause of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is unknown. However, a variety of conditions act as risk factors in the development of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma:' Family history of lymphoma Psoriasis Inherited immune-deficiency disease Helicobacter pylori infection associated with stomach cancer Viral infections such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and hepatitis C virus Autoimmune disorders such as Rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren’s syndrome and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis Inflammatory bowel disease Exposure to radiation and chemotherapy Exposure to various chemicals present in the herbicides, pesticides, solvents, and preservatives Genetic disorder such as Down syndrome Celiac disease: inability to digest gluten Chromosomal abnormalities  Age above 60 years Obesity Women with breast implants Alcohol intake Diets high in fat and meat products Ultraviolet exposure"
What are the symptoms and signs of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma?,'Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma exhibits different signs and symptoms. Many other conditions may also exhibit similar symptoms.

How is Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma diagnosed?,"'The doctor uses a variety of tests and examinations to diagnose Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma:' Medical history and physical exam: Complete medical history of the signs and symptoms. The physician will examine some swelling and infection of the lymph nodes. Some blood tests will be used to rule out infection. Biopsy: A biopsy will be suggested if the size, texture, location, or presence of other symptoms strongly suggest a Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The biopsies usually performed to diagnose Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma include:Excisional or incisional biopsy: Excisional biopsy involves the removal of the entire lymph node for diagnosis. An incisional biopsy involves the removal of a small part of the tumor.Needle biopsy: A less invasive procedure as compared to an excisional biopsy, but less accurate.Bone marrow aspiration: These are done to confirm if the lymphoma has involved the bone marrow.Lumbar puncture: This test detects lymphoma cells in the brain.Pleural or peritoneal fluid sampling: Lymphoma, if spread to the chest and abdomen, can be detected using this method. Excisional or incisional biopsy: Excisional biopsy involves the removal of the entire lymph node for diagnosis. An incisional biopsy involves the removal of a small part of the tumor. Needle biopsy: A less invasive procedure as compared to an excisional biopsy, but less accurate. Bone marrow aspiration: These are done to confirm if the lymphoma has involved the bone marrow. Lumbar puncture: This test detects lymphoma cells in the brain. Pleural or peritoneal fluid sampling: Lymphoma, if spread to the chest and abdomen, can be detected using this method. Laboratory tests involve flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry in which the biopsy samples are treated with antibodies. Imaging tests such as chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and a bone scan helps in diagnosing Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and its extent. Blood tests, such as complete blood cell count, blood chemistry tests, and lactate dehydrogenase, tests also help in diagnosing the extent of the disease."
What are the 4 stages of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma?,"'Oncologists classify the stages of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma based on the extent of the spread of the disease. The current staging system in adults (known as Lugano classification) is:' Stage I: The cancer is present in only one of the organs inside the lymphatic system (such as in tonsils) or one organ outside the lymphatic system (such as lung or bone marrow). Stage II: Lymphomas may be present in two lymph node areas on the same side, or above or below the diaphragm, which is a thin band of muscle separating the chest and abdomen. The lymphoma may also be present in one organ and the lymph nodes in the nearby area. Stage III: The lymphoma is in the lymph node area, which may be above or below the diaphragm. Stage IV:  Lymphomas have spread to several organs and tissues."
How is Non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated?,"'The various treatment options include:' Chemotherapy: Physician administers this drug via oral or injection route. Radiation therapy: A high dose of radiation terminates the cancer cell. Stem cell transplant: Physician injects healthy stem cells taken from the donor before the treatment. Biological drugs: Certain drugs such as Rituxan (rituximab) and Gazyva (Obinutuzumab) enhance the immune system’s ability to combat cancer cells.

Double chin treatment ,"'The face is often regarded as the doorway to the soul. Your worries, thoughts, and desires, all show up on your face in some way or the other. Beyond this philosophical notion, whatever you eat and however active you are shows up on your face as well. One of the bothersome features of the face for many people is the double chin. The double chin is the layer of skin between the neck and face. It is typically caused by the layer of fat under the chin in front of the neck. While being ''overweight'' or ''obese'' generally causes a double chin, you might be normal in weight but still, have a double chin. It may be due to genetic reasons or as a result of the ''aging'' process or poor posture. Sometimes, poor thyroid function or sinus ''allergies'' may also cause double chins.

What is Guinea worm?,"'Dracunculiasis'' is also called guinea worm disease (GWD). It is an infection caused by a parasite called\xa0Dracunculus medinensis (guinea worm). This parasite is an organism that survives by deriving nutrients and feeding off another organism. GWD spreads through drinking contaminated water. It is presently eradicated in most parts of the world. It is still seen in remote parts of Africa and some remote rural areas in the world where there is no access to clean drinking water. GWD is considered endemic in three African countries, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Mali. In recent years, a few cases of GWD in animals, especially ''dogs'', have been reported in developed countries as well. GWD is a serious condition, causing debilitating ''pain'' and complications, affecting the quality of life.' "
How does guinea worm disease occur?,"'GWD can occur after drinking contaminated water from ponds or other stagnant water containing small water fleas called copepods. These fleas are not visible without using a magnifying glass. The copepods in the water ingest Guinea worm larvae (early stage of the worm when it just comes out of the egg). When people drink contaminated water, they swallow the copepods that have ingested Guinea worm larvae. The disease can also be acquired by consuming raw or undercooked fish and other seafood that have swallowed the infected copepods.''Once the infected copepods have entered the ''digestive system'' of humans or animals, the copepods die, and the Guinea worm larvae are released. The larvae enter the stomach and intestinal wall of the host and then move into the tissues of the abdomen where they mate. Over the next 10-14 months, the male worm dies, and the ''pregnant'' female worm continues to grow 2-3 ''feet'' long and has the width of cooked spaghetti.''Around this time, the adult female worm becomes ready to release the larvae and migrates to just beneath the skin forming a ''blister'' on the skin. The blister bursts 24 to 72 hours after formation, forming a wound through which it emerges. Contact of the affected area with water triggers the Guinea worm to release a whitish fluid into the water containing immature larvae. Copepods in the water swallow the larvae and the cycle repeats again.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of guinea worm disease?,"'There are usually no signs and symptoms until about a year after the initial infection.' The first signs are fever, swelling, and blister formation, commonly occurring in the legs or feet that is painful and burns. Blisters burst after 24 to 72 hours of formation forming a wound. The adult female Guinea worm emerges through this and is very painful. Swelling, warmth, and redness in the affected area. Contact of the affected area with water triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white fluid into the water containing immature larvae. A wound caused by the Guinea worm can develop a secondary bacterial infection, presenting with worsening pain, oozing, and pus formation. Joint underlying the affected area can get infected, causing pain, restriction of movement, and permanent damage.  If a worm remains inside the tissue and dies, it can cause serious allergic reactions."
How to prevent guinea worm disease?,"'The following measures and educating others of them can help control the spread of disease:' Drinking water only from protected sources, such as boreholes or protected wells or packaged water. Filtering water with a warm fabric filter and boiling water before drinking if the source of water is safe or unsafe (ponds and stagnant water). Giving pets clean drinking water. Avoiding swimming or allowing pets in unsafe water sources. Cooking fish and sea animals before eating. Avoiding feeding raw seafood to pets. Burning, burying, or safely disposing of raw seafood remnants to prevent pets and stray animals from consuming them. Human beings and pets need to be treated immediately for blisters and wounds that appear suspicious or if there is a worm emerging from a wound."
How do head lice spread?,"'Head lice'' can’t jump or fly; they can only crawl. ''Lice'' usually directly transfer from the hair of one person to another.

Side effects may include itching and redness of the scalp. Pyrethrin shouldn't be used if your child is allergic to chrysanthemum or ragweed."
Prescription medications,'Prescription medication is usually used when\xa0over-the-counter (OTC)\xa0treatments fail.' Ivermectin is a medication that kills lice and can be used in anyone over six months of age. It is usually applied once to dry hair and then rinsed off with water after 10 minutes. Ivermectin can also be taken orally. Malathion is a lotion that can be used in those older than six years. It is applied to the scalp and rinsed off with water after 8-12 hours. The treatment may be repeated seven to nine days after the first treatment. Spinosad can kill lice and eggs. It is usually applied only once to dry hair and rinsed off with warm water after 10 minutes.
Lifestyle and home remedies,"'Alternative lifestyle and home remedies can be used alongside medical treatment to help get rid of lice faster. Home remedies alone may not be effective because there is no scientific proof of their effectiveness, and one may consult with a doctor before following them.' Wet combing: Combing the entire hair from the scalp to tips when it is wet using a fine-toothed comb can remove lice and some eggs. Using a lubricant like olive oil or coconut oil while combing the hair makes the lice come out easily. This can be repeated every three to four days for a few weeks until there are no more lice found. Essential oils: Certain essential oils such as tea tree oil or ylang-ylang oil may kill lice by suffocating them. Smothering agents: There are several common home products that may kill lice by depriving them of air and smothering them. These products include petroleum jelly (Vaseline), olive oil, butter, or mayonnaise. Any of these products may be applied to the scalp and hair, covered with a shower cap, and left on overnight.  Dehydration: Applying hot air with a special machine operated by a professional can cause dehydration, possibly killing the eggs and lice. Household cleaning: Lice usually can’t live more than a day without feeding off a human scalp, and the eggs can’t survive if they aren't incubated at the temperature in the scalp. Despite this, as a precaution, it is advised to clean items affected by a person with life infestation who has used them in the previous two days. Cleaning recommendations include: Washing clothing, soft toys, and bedding in hot soapy water at a temperature of 130°F (54.4°C) at least, and they should be dried at high heat. Cleaning hair care items such as hair combs, brushes, or hair accessories by soaking them in hot soap water for at least 10 minutes. Safely sealing items that cannot be washed in plastic bags for at least two weeks. Vacuuming the floor and furniture can help get rid of lice."
What is a menstrual cycle?,"'The ''menstrual cycle'' is cyclic changes that occur in a woman’s body every month. During the menstrual cycle, the levels of reproductive hormones change, the egg is released from the ovary, and the uterus is prepared for ''pregnancy''.''The typical female menstrual cycle is 28-30 days. Some women may have a shorter cycle of around 20 days or a longer cycle of around 35 days. The first day of the menstrual cycle is when a woman starts bleeding. Periods usually last for three to seven days in most women. ''Ovulation'' (release of the egg from the ovary) occurs between 11-15 days of the menstrual cycle but most commonly on the 14th day. During ovulation, usually, only a single egg is released from the ovary.''When the sperm meets the egg (''fertilization''), pregnancy occurs. If fertilization does not occur, the uterine lining sheds and presents with bleeding, marking the onset of periods.' "
About period cramps,"'Period ''pain'' and ''cramps'' are also called ''dysmenorrhea'', and they vary in intensity. There are two types of dysmenorrhea, namely, primary and secondary.' Primary dysmenorrhea: This begins right after a woman starts having her menstrual periods. For some women, period pain and cramps reduce as they get older or after childbirth, whereas for others, the intensity of the pain remains the same. Period cramps are the most intense in the first one to three days of the periods. Secondary dysmenorrhea: This is usually a result of reproductive system disorders. Pain and cramps are worse compared with those in primary dysmenorrhea, and they worsen with time. Dysmenorrhea may begin a few days before a period starts and can get worse or may not go away after it ends. Some of the conditions that can cause secondary dysmenorrhea are endometriosis, adenomyosis, or uterine fibroids. Secondary dysmenorrhea can be associated with heavy bleeding and clots. If period pains and cramps are severe, worsen, and cause significant discomfort, it is advised to consult with a doctor."
Treatment of period cramps,"'Treatment for period cramps includes medical treatment, lifestyle changes, and home remedies.''Medical treatment:' Pain relief medications: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, etc. can help reduce the pain of cramps. Prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be advised for women with severe pain. Oral contraceptive pills (birth control pills): Oral contraceptives contain hormones that prevent ovulation and reduce period cramps. These hormones may also be administered in other forms such as injection, skin patch, or intrauterine device (IUD). Surgery: Surgery may be required to treat uterine fibroids or endometriosis and reduce associated symptoms."
Lifestyle and home remedies,"'Home remedies include:' Anti-inflammatory foods: Eating foods that have anti-inflammatory properties can reduce menstrual pain. These foods include blueberries, squash, cherries, capsicum, tomatoes, cold-water fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids, beans, green leafy vegetables, and almonds. It's advised to incorporate these foods in the diet throughout the year, instead of just during the periods. Sugary foods, fried and fatty foods, white bread or pasta, alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and tobacco can increase cramps. Herbs: Chamomile tea, fennel, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric root, fenugreek, and dill are some herbs that have anti-inflammatory effects and can reduce cramps. Sipping two cups of chamomile tea per day, starting a week before the period begins, can reduce cramps. You may benefit more if you drink it every month. Nutritional supplements: Taking fish oil, vitamin B1, vitamin B, and calcium supplements all year round can significantly reduce period pain and improve overall body health. Heat therapy: Applying a heating pad, hot water bottle, hot towel, and heat wrap over the abdomen and back helps the muscles around the uterus to relax and relieve menstrual cramps. The temperature should ideally be 104°F. Taking a hot bath with bubbles and essential oils or hot showers can also help. Exercise: Exercising regularly can help reduce menstrual cramps and overall health. Exercise could include sports, walking, running, swimming, dance, Pilates, or yoga. Women may exercise during their period as well based on an individual comfort level. Massage: Massaging the abdomen with essential oils for five minutes a day to however long one is comfortable for can relieve menstrual cramps. Massaging improves blood flow and relaxes the muscles. Acupuncture and acupressure: Acupressure and acupuncture are performed by a professional to reduce menstrual cramps by stimulating specific trigger points. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy uses mild electric currents to stimulate your nerves to relieve pain. Good sleep: Sleep quality can affect menstrual symptoms. Insomnia increases the risk of dysmenorrhea. Practicing good sleep by getting adequate rest and sleep of six to eight hours a day can reduce menstruation pain and cramps. Sexual activity: Intercourse during periods is known to reduce cramps. However, condoms must be used because there is a high risk of infection in both partners."
Overnight acne treatment,"'Pimples'' or ''acne vulgaris'' is a common skin condition affecting ''teens'' and even some adults. The cause of ''acne'' is mainly hormonal. In the case of ''acne'', ''prevention'' is the best cure. Hence, maintaining good skin health, avoiding ''cosmetics'', washing face before going to ''sleep'', and checking for hormonal issues are paramount.''There is no magic pill for a ''pimple'' to disappear, but certain ointments may help. Always think twice before applying any do-it-yourself (DIY) remedy to your face.''Try out one of the following methods to get rid of a pimple overnight:''Prevention tips:''A dermatologist will offer you more effective options to clear acne and avoid frequent flares.' Aloe vera: Aloe vera has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. Simply break off an aloe vera leaf from the plant and dab it onto acne spots throughout the day. Apply it at night before going to sleep as well. Tea tree oil: Tea tree oil is a well-known treatment for pimples. To use, you need to dilute the tea tree oil first with other carrier oil. Use a cotton ball to soak up the formula and dab the liquid onto the problem areas. Benzoyl peroxide face wash or gel: These are available over the counter and provide good results in reducing acne. Spot application over acne is advised at night. Green tea: To make the green tea solution, bring 1/2 cup of water to a boil. Remove from heat and add a green tea teabag. Let the leaves steep for 5 minutes. Carefully remove the teabag, squeeze, and recycle. Allow the concentrated tea to cool and it may be stored up to 3 days, covered and in the refrigerator. To use, wet a cotton ball with the tea and dab it on your face. It will reduce inflammation and is antibacterial. Fresh basil leaf: Pick a fresh basil leaf and crush it with the fingers. Spread the crushed leaf on the pimple so that its juice coats your zit. Do this throughout the day and at night before going to bed. Basil is anti-inflammatory and has antibacterial properties. Salicylic acid gel: The over the counter salicylic acid gel may help in spot reduction of a stray pimple if applied overnight. It is not advised for extensive application over the face. Fresh lemon juice: The Vitamin C in lemon juice helps dry up pimples. Dab the fresh lemon juice onto the pimple or pimples throughout the day and before going to bed at night. Ice dabbing: Dabbing ice onto the pimple can help reduce swelling and redness. Wet a washcloth with cold water and wrap an ice cube in it. Use this to dab the ice cube onto the pimple. Hold the wrapped ice on the spot for a few seconds, remove for a few seconds, and again reapply the wrapped ice. Doing this repeatedly will tighten the pores and increase blood circulation to the area. Neem oil: It has antibacterial properties and can benefit the skin in several ways. Rinse the face with warm water; apply neem oil directly over pimples with cotton buds. Leave it for the night so that it can penetrate the skin to destroy all bacteria. Honey and cinnamon: They both have antimicrobial properties. Take one teaspoon of cinnamon and two tablespoons of natural honey. Mix them together and  Tomatoes: Tomato juice not only provides relief from pimples but also lightens skin and evens out the patchy skin. Drink hot water with lemon in the morning Add more turmeric and iron into your diet Get plenty of sleep Practice yoga or moderate exercise to keep the body fit, allowing overall blood circulation Practice healthy diet"
What is a mandibular nerve block?,"'A mandibular nerve block is a procedure to numb the lower jaw (mandible) and a part of the mouth and tongue. An anesthetic solution is injected adjacent to the mandibular nerve to block the transmission of ''pain'' signals from the mandible to the brain.''The mandibular nerve is one of the three major branches of the trigeminal nerve, which is located on either side of the face. The mandibular nerve is responsible for the motor and sensory functions in the mandibular region.''The mandibular nerve block administered on one side of the face is effective in anesthetizing all the mandibular nerve’s branches on that side. The main terminal branches of the mandibular nerve are:''A mandibular nerve block provides anesthesia to the following areas:' Temporoauricular nerve Inferior alveolar nerve Buccal nerve Mylohyoid nerve Lingual nerve Mandibular teeth up to the mid-line Soft and hard tissue on the inside of the cheek, and on both sides of the teeth Floor of the mouth Anterior two-thirds of the tongue Skin over the lower jaw, posterior cheek and temple Ear, including the external ear canal"

What is mental nerve block?,"'A mental nerve block is a type of anesthesia used for numbing parts of the face. This type of anesthetic nerve block is mainly used for ''wound'' repair to the lip and chin.\xa0''The sensory area of the mental nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve located on the face, below the lower lip, on the side of the chin. The mental nerve is a branch of the 5th cranial nerve (called the trigeminal nerve), which provides sensory input to the face.\xa0''The trigeminal nerve divides into the inferior alveolar nerve, and exits the jaw and enters the face through the mental canal (mental foramen) and supplies sensation to the skin of the chin and the ''mucus'' membranes of the lower lip.\xa0''This type of nerve block does not numb the ''teeth'' and is not used for dental procedures.' "
What is mental nerve block used for?,"'Mental nerve block is used for the following:' To repair lacerations and wounds of the lower lip, especially if the cosmetic edge of the lip (vermillion border) is involved To repair lacerations and wounds to the soft tissue of the chin that extends from the lip  To surgically remove facial tumors/lesions To relieve chronic nerve pain from shingles (postherpetic neuralgia)"
How do you give a mental nerve block?,"'There are two ways to numb the mental nerve and perform a mental nerve block: through the mouth (intraoral) and outside the mouth (extraoral).\xa0''For a mental nerve block performed through the mouth (intraoral):''For a mental nerve block performed from outside the mouth (extraoral):''For either the intraoral or extraoral approach, the local anesthetic’s (usually ''lidocaine'') effect lasts between 30 minutes and two hours.'

What is local infiltration anesthesia?,"'Local infiltration anesthesia is the technique of producing loss-of-sensation restricted to a superficial, localized area in the body. A low concentration of anesthetic agent is infiltrated into the tissues in the area that requires anesthesia.' "
What are local anesthetic agents?,"'Local anesthetic agents are a class of ''drugs'' used to induce local anesthesia. ''Cocaine'', which is extracted from coca beans, was the first anesthetic compound to be discovered. Cocaine is the only naturally occurring local anesthetic, all other anesthetic compounds are synthetically derived products.''Anesthetic agents are of two classes:''Amino amides are stable in solution and are metabolized by the ''liver'' and excreted in the urine. Amino esters are unstable in solution and are metabolized by an enzyme in blood plasma. Amino esters are much more likely than amino amides to cause ''allergic'' hypersensitivity reactions.' Amino amides Amino esters"
How does local anesthesia work?,"'Local anesthetic agents temporarily block the sodium channels at the nerve endings and prevent the flow of sodium ions into nerve cells. Without the inflow of sodium ions, the nerve cells cannot conduct an impulse. The communication from the nerve endings in the specific area to the brain is blocked leading to loss of sensation.' "
What are the uses of local infiltration anesthesia?,"'Local anesthesia is used for tissue infiltration and nerve block anesthesia. Infiltration anesthesia is mostly used for minor surgical and dental procedures. ''Nerve blocks'', in addition, are used for diagnostic procedures and ''pain management'' as well.''The uses of local infiltration anesthesia include:' Subcutaneous (fat tissue under the skin) infiltration forIV placementSuperficial/shave biopsySuturing IV placement Superficial/shave biopsy Suturing Submucosal (mucous tissue) infiltration forDental proceduresLaceration repairs Dental procedures Laceration repairs Wound infiltration for postoperative pain control at the incision site Intraarticular (in the joints) injections forPostoperative pain controlArthritic joint pain control Postoperative pain control Arthritic joint pain control Infiltrative nerve blocks such asAnkle blockScalp blockDigit block Ankle block Scalp block Digit block"
How do you infiltrate local anesthesia?,"'The local anesthetic for infiltration is prepared by diluting the anesthetic agent with saline solution. The choice of anesthetic agent and concentration depends on the required procedure because different anesthetic agents vary in toxicity and absorption.\xa0''Epinephrine added to the solution can prolong the anesthetic effects, for example. But epinephrine may be detrimental in some wound repair surgeries on the limbs as it can constrict blood vessels thus slowing oxygenation and healing to the damaged tissue.''Other factors that influence the choice of anesthetic agents include:''Before administration of injections in the skin, the doctor makes the area sterile with an antiseptic solution. A common technique for local anesthesia infiltration is to inject the anesthetic solution in a circular pattern around the operative area.''The doctor keeps the number of needle insertions minimal by inserting the needle in a plane beneath the skin. After aspirating the syringe to make sure the needle is not inside a blood vessel, the doctor slowly injects the anesthetic solution while withdrawing the needle. Fast-acting anesthetic agents take effect in about five minutes, while longer lasting drugs may take up to 20 minutes.' Onset of action: The time required for anesthesia to take effect Potency: Strength of the anesthetic effect Duration of action: The period that anesthetic effects last"
How painful is local anesthesia?,"'Apart from the sting from the needle prick, there might be some slight pain and tingling. Doctors usually warm the anesthetic solution to 25-40 degrees centigrade before administration, which can minimize the pain. The doctor may also add ''sodium bicarbonate'' to decrease the acidity of the solution, which can reduce the pain further.' "
What are the most common local anesthetic agents?,"'A list of common local anesthetic agents used for tissue infiltration and their duration of effects is as follows:''Adding epinephrine to the anesthetic solution doubles the duration of anesthetic effects.' Lidocaine (Xylocaine): Rapid onset and lasts two hours Mepivacaine (Carbocaine, Polocaine): Rapid onset and lasts three hours Bupivacaine (Marcaine, Sensorcaine): Slow onset and lasts four hours Ropivacaine (Naropin): Medium onset and lasts three hours Prilocaine (Citanest): Medium onset and lasts 90 minutes Procaine (Novocain): Slow onset and lasts 45 minutes Chloroprocaine (Nesacaine): Rapid onset and lasts 30 minutes"
What are the risks and side effects of local anesthesia?,"'Local infiltration anesthesia is mostly a safe and effective way to produce local loss of sensation. Adverse effects mainly result from high anesthetic concentration in blood plasma (local anesthesia systemic toxicity), which may be caused by:''Most of the above risks can be eliminated with careful administration of the injection.''The possible risks and side effects of local anesthesia include:''Addition of epinephrine may have the opposite effect and can lead to:''Effects on other systems:' Accidental injection into a blood vessel Excessive anesthetic dose Excessive rate of administration Delayed drug clearance from the tissues Fast clearance from the infiltrated tissues which may lead to systemic absorption of the anesthetic agent Central nervous system (CNS): High concentration of anesthetic in the plasma first causes CNS stimulation (including seizures), followed by CNS depression (including respiratory arrest). Amide anesthetics may not produce a stimulatory effect on CNS, but adding epinephrine may add to the stimulatory effect. Cardiovascular system: High plasma levels of anesthetics depress the heart and may cause:Slow heart rate (bradycardia)Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)Low blood pressure (hypotension)Cardiovascular collapseCardiac arrest Slow heart rate (bradycardia) Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Low blood pressure (hypotension) Cardiovascular collapse Cardiac arrest High blood pressure (hypertension) High heart rate (tachycardia) Chest pain (angina) Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity to amino amide anesthetics is rare and may be caused by preservatives in the anesthetic solution. Amino ester anesthetics, when metabolized in the plasma, release an allergen known as para-aminobenzoic acid, which may cause hypersensitivity. Allergic reactions may also result from local anesthesia systemic toxicity.

Avoid vigorous activities for 24 hours Protect your face from sunlight exposure by using sunscreen lotion with at least SPF 25 Use acetaminophen for pain relief; all medications can be restarted the the same day after the procedure Avoid massaging the corrected areas for a minimum of 24 hours In the case of a bruising, use a warm compress to speed up the healing To control pain and swelling; a cold compress can be used Adverse effects such as asymmetry, overcorrection of wrinkles, skin reddening, skin itching and edema may occur; if untreated, these can lead to serious repercussions."
What is lateral epicondylitis?,"'Lateral epicondylitis'', or\xa0''tennis elbow'',\xa0''is a painful condition of the elbow due to its overuse or strenuous activity that causes ''pain'' in the elbow and arm.\xa0''As the name suggests, ''tennis elbow'' may be caused by playing racquet sports, such as tennis. It is not, however, restricted to racquet sports and may be caused due to several other repeated activities such as weightlifting, carpentry, painting, typing, raking, and knitting.''It is caused by the'' inflammation of the tendons'' (bands of tissue that connect a muscle to a bone) that join the forearm muscles on the outside of the elbow.''Because of overuse and repeated motion, the forearm muscles and tendons become damaged, leading to ''pain'' and tenderness on the outside of the elbow. It is one of the most common reasons for long-term (chronic) ''elbow pain''. Although tennis elbow may be observed in people of any age, it is most common in people around 40 years of age.''It presents as pain and tenderness in the bony knob on the outside of the elbow. This knob (lateral epicondyle) is where the injured tendons attach to the bone. Pain may also be felt on the upper or lower arm. Pain is increased upon:''Treatment may be conservative such as icing the elbow, using an elbow strap, painkillers, physiotherapy, and injections in the lateral epicondyle. If conservative treatment fails to provide relief, surgery may be considered.' Lifting something Making a fist or grasping an object Opening a door Shaking hands Raising the hand  Straightening the wrist"
How do you inject a tennis elbow?," A lateral epicondyle injection is performed as an outpatient procedure. The patient lies in a comfortable position.  The patient flexes (bends) the affected elbow to 90° with the hand tucked under the buttock. The doctor identifies the landmarks on the elbow for guiding the needle. The doctor cleans the skin with antiseptics. The doctor applies a local anesthetic (such as ethyl chloride) to the skin. Experienced clinicians may administer it with topical anesthesia or no anesthesia at all. After numbing the skin, the doctor inserts a thin needle directly over the center of the epicondyle, either perpendicular to the skin (if the patient has sufficient subcutaneous fat) or at a 45° angle to a depth of one-fourth to half an inch. The doctor injects the corticosteroid medication (to reduce the pain and inflammation) and local anesthetic into the origin of the tendon and the surrounding tissue causing pain and discomfort. At the end of the injection, the doctor withdraws the needle swiftly. The doctor applies light pressure to the injection site. After injection, the hand may be moved to ascertain the proper delivery of the medication. The doctor may apply a small bandage to the injection site."
What are the complications of lateral epicondyle injections?,'The procedure is quite safe with few complications such as:' Infection Tendonitis (inflammation of the tendon) Nerve injury Transient increase in pain Skin discoloration Skin atrophy (wasting) Hormonal imbalances Localized osteoporosis (a medical condition in which the bones become brittle and fragile) Rupture of the tendon because of repeated injections
Alleviate Stress,"'Managing ''stress'' leads to a state of “well-being and contentment.”\xa0Maintaining a ''stress''-free life takes work and time. One can accomplish that by taking steps each day to reduce stress and increase joy. What makes one person happy does not necessarily work for another person. It is important to understand who you are as a person and what works for you to reduce stress. Reducing stress can lead to a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life. The following tips could instantly put you in a better mood and relieve stress.' Exercise: Exercise does not always mean sweating it out in the gym. Just staying physically active by taking walks, yoga, Pilates, or dancing will help keep your mind refreshed and active. An active lifestyle results in a healthy body and mind. It is a great way to battle depression as well. When you feel stressed, any sort of physical activity can put you in a better mood and relieve stress instantly. Meditation: Meditating for 10-30 minutes when feeling stressed can help feel relaxed, improve mood, and reduce stress and anger. Inculcating a habit of meditating every day can help manage stress and depression, declutter your mind, and help you focus. Pets: Pets are a great way to instantly put you in a positive mood. Not all pets require a lot of time, space, or money. There are many low-maintenance pets such as hamsters, turtles, or birds. You could do your research to find a pet that suits your schedule and budget. Volunteering: Volunteering is a powerful way to help feel positive and happy while helping others. The appreciation you would receive from others would give you a sense of purpose and motivate you. In your free time, you could consider volunteering at local animal shelters, orphanages, or old age homes and also visiting these places whenever you are feeling stressed to instantly improve your mood. Hobbies: Spending some time every day to do an activity you like and cultivate your hobby would make your life more enjoyable. When you feel stressed, you could spend time on your hobby that can instantly help you relieve stress. It could be simple such as reading a book, listening to music, playing an instrument, cooking, gardening, and performing arts and crafts. New experiences: Going out of your comfort zone to experience something new could add joy and excitement to your life. When you are feeling stressed, you could try something new and different, which can bring you joy and reduce stress. This could be as simple as trying a new cuisine or going on a trip. You could make it a point to enjoy a new experience regularly such as attending a cool workshop or hiking. This could also introduce you to like-minded people, expand your social circle, and have a fulfilling life. Talking to someone: Talking to someone when you are down will prevent you from keeping your emotions bottled up. This someone could be a friend or relative you confide in or a counselor. There is no shame in visiting a psychologist to help deal with your emotional stress. Visiting a professional does not mean you have a “mental illness.” A professional could guide you, help you release your emotions, and maintain your mental health. It is better to seek help before it’s too late. Being optimistic: Although this is easier said than done, it is important to find the silver lining. It is natural to feel defeated after the loss of a job, loss of a loved one, or failure of a relationship. It is completely understandable to take your time to mourn and heal. However, avoid dwelling in the past and negative thoughts. Believe that there is good to come. Spending time with loved ones: Making time for friends and family on a regular basis is essential to bring laughter, joy, and happiness to your life. Meeting good friends and family when you are feeling stressed can help divert your mind, put you in a better mood, and reduce stress."
What is wound irrigation?,"'Wound irrigation is a non-invasive procedure in which a steady flow of a solution is used to achieve wound hydration; remove debris, dead cells, pathogens, and excess blood or other exudates such as pus in an ''open wound''; and assist with a better visual examination. Wound irrigation is one of the most effective methods of wound cleansing.''Wound debridement may be combined with wound irrigation. Wound debridement is the process of removing necrotic (dead) tissue from the wound. Wound irrigation, with or without debridement, can aid in wound healing and prevent premature surface healing over an ''abscess'' or a foreign body, reducing the recurrence. The goal of wound irrigation is to clean the wound and decontaminate it, reducing the risk of infection or worsening infection, without creating anymore ''trauma'' to the wound.' "
What are the solutions used for wound irrigation?,"'There are various solutions that can be used for wound irrigation, depending on the wound. Solutions that may be used are topical cleansers, antiseptics, antibiotics, antifungals, and anesthetics.' Normal saline: Normal saline is the most commonly used solution for wound irrigation. It is the safest, inexpensive, and easily available. It may be used on simple wounds with minimal contamination. Saline can’t thoroughly cleanse dirty or necrotic wounds.  Sterile water: Sterile water is frequently used to irrigate wounds. It is easily available and even cheaper than saline. Sterile water is hypotonic, meaning it would get absorbed by the cells; hence, if excess volumes are used, the tissues swell up due to water. Potable water: Potable water may be used when normal saline or sterile water is not available. It may be used to clean simple wounds that aren’t contaminated. Povidone-iodine: Povidone-iodine is an antimicrobial solution that is broad-spectrum and effective against various pathogens. There is a risk of damage to healthy cells and tissues due to povidone-iodine. Povidone-iodine causes a yellowish-brown discoloration of the skin when it dries.  Hydrogen peroxide: Hydrogen peroxide is a commonly used antiseptic, and it is usually diluted with saline. It can help remove dead tissues and debris and control active bleeding from the wound. Hydrogen peroxide is not known to be effective against microorganisms. There is a small risk of damage to healthy cells. Sodium hypochlorite: Sodium hypochlorite is usually used for cleaning pressure ulcers with necrotic tissue. It is effective against most organisms found in open wounds and reduces foul odor from an infected wound. The solution can cause damage to the healthy tissues; hence, it’s advised not to use it for more than 7-10 days. Commercial wound cleansers: Commercial wound cleansers are available over the counter at drug stores. They can remove debris, pathogens, or dead cells. They usually contain preservatives that slow the growth of bacteria and fungi and extend shelf life. They may not be effective in killing all pathogens."
What are the complications of wound irrigation?,"'Wound irrigation may cause the following complications:' Excoriation (erosion due to loss of tissue) Increased pain Increased swelling  Bone damage, infection, and delayed healing due to high-pressure irrigation in bone and joint surgery Surface contaminants penetrating deeper layers due to high-pressure irrigation"
What is a stomach ulcer?,"'Stomach ulcer or ''gastric ulcer'' is a painful open sore that develops on the lining of your stomach due to the damage to the inner stomach lining.''This is a type of ''peptic ulcer'' disease. Stomach ulcers often can be easily cured; however, it can be fatal if not treated properly. It occurs mostly in men are than women' "
What are the causes of stomach ulcers?,"'You may get a stomach ulcer due to' Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection Taking drugs, such as painkillers, steroids, analgesics (Aspirin), for a long time or at high doses Stress Spicy food Age (≥60 years) Rarely, a tumor or cancer in the stomach that increases stomach acid production (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome)."
How can my doctor diagnose my stomach ulcer?,"'Depending on the availability and cost, following the test, your doctor may ask for' Helicobacter pylori infection testsCulture of bacteriaMicroscopic examinationUrea-breath testStool-antigen testAntibody blood test Culture of bacteria Microscopic examination Urea-breath test Stool-antigen test Antibody blood test X-ray imaging by swallowing a barium dye Examination by inserting a thin tube, which has a light and camera attached to it, through the incision made onto the stomach (endoscopy) A piece of stomach tissue removed by endoscopy and examined in the laboratory (endoscopic biopsy)"
How will my doctor treat my stomach ulcer?,"'Most stomach ulcers take 1-2 months to heal and your doctor/gastroenterologist will prescribe you the treatment based on the cause of your ulcer.''If the underlying cause is not addressed properly, the stomach ulcer may recur even after the treatment.' Your doctor will assess your family history, dietary history, diseases, and medication history and examine your tummy to address the cause of your stomach ulcer. Your doctor will discuss with you the side effects of the painkillers and analgesics, which you may be taking, and whether you should keep using them or stop them. Your doctor may advise you to stop smoking, stop alcohol consumption, lose some weight, and avoid some trigger foods, such as spicy and fatty food. Your doctor may prescribe an alternative painkiller, analgesic, or anti-inflammatory medications, such as Paracetamol. Your doctor will prescribe you proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and antacids to reduce the amount of acid production and some antibiotics for up to 2 weeks to treat H pylori infection. Your doctor will prescribe probiotics, which will help to grow good bacteria in your gut and may be useful in killing H pylori bacteria. Your doctor may prescribe you bismuth supplements. Your doctor may have another endoscopy to check stomach ulcers several weeks after treatment to make sure that the ulcer is gone because a very small number of stomach ulcers might contain cancer."
What are the possible complications I may have to face?,"'Complications of stomach ulcers are very rare. However, they can be serious and fatal, such as' Bleeding at the site of the ulcer, which may cause blood in vomit or in the stool. Stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splitting open (perforation). Blocks the movement of food through the digestive system (stomach obstruction)."
Facial fat treatment,"'While staying fit and healthy is a universal concern, the face fat is something that bothers people the most. In the modern era of selfies and Instagram, looks have become a greater priority. People prefer to have a lean face. However, before you conclude that a chubby face is just because of fat deposition, you must know that many times, it may not be fat that makes the face look that way. What you thought is facial fat might be puffiness because of underlying medical conditions such as ''allergies'', hormonal issues, ''liver'' ailments, or kidney diseases. This is especially suspected when the face fat is relatively out of proportion with the body fat. Face fat may also appear because of genetic causes. Some people, however, may not have excessive facial fat, but they perceive that it is there. This may be a part of ''body dysmorphic disorder'' where a person is excessively conscious about the way they appear. This can at times be harmful, making the person go too far that they harm their bodies. Whatever might be the reason, taking a healthcare provider’s opinion before starting any dietary or ''exercise'' plans is highly recommended. You must also remember that spot reduction of body fat neither is scientifically possible nor must be desired. If you want your face to look lean, you need to reduce your overall body fat. Some people argue that merely building facial muscles may “eat-up” the fat from the face. This is, however, not true. If you have an unhealthy lifestyle with more calories consumed than burnt with physical activity, the result will inevitably show up on the face as well.''Here are six ways that can help reduce your body fat, providing you a leaner face and body:' Keep moving: Sitting is the new smoking. It is said that hours of sitting may harm your body the way smoking does. Make sure to take small walks at regular intervals. Walking is a great way to stay fit and active in the most physiological way. You can take a brisk or a slow walk depending upon your health condition and stamina and slowly increase it with time. Eat your fruits and vegetables: The modern lifestyle has decreased our activity level. Growing pollution has exposed our bodies to various toxins. Fruits and vegetables are not only low-calorie and fiber-rich foods but also loaded with various nutrients and antioxidants that help your body get rid of toxins and build your immunity. Snacking on fruits and vegetables rather than cookies and chips can help you achieve your fitness goals. Ditch the processed foods: Processed foods such as pastries, cookies, and chips are loaded with fats and carbs. They are very calorie-dense, and eating them in small portions may not satisfy your hunger so that you end up binging and gaining more pounds. Stay hydrated: Around 70% of our body weight is water. Water is essential for various metabolic reactions in our body. Drinking fluids such as water and other non-sugary beverages can help you feel full as well without the burden of extra calories. Regular exercise: Exercise is necessary to stay fit and prevent lifestyle disorders such as obesity and diabetes. Perform regular exercises as per your general health and interests. This may include weight-bearing exercises for about thrice a week along with cardio exercises such as jogging, running, or aerobics. To keep the exercise regime interesting, you can try and learn new things such as swimming, water aerobics, badminton, or other sports that may make staying fit fun. Take adequate rest and sleep: While you wish to get rid of the fat fast, remember that consistency is the key. Do not be excessively harsh to yourself. Your exercise should make you feel good and not be a punishment for eating more. Keep stress away by taking adequate time to relax and unwind. Do not compromise on your sleep as well. Good sleep is a must to make you get going with your fitness regime.  Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking: Drinking can cause the face to look puffy the next day. Smoking can loosen the skin elasticity and cause the face to look drawn and sagged."
What is a maxillary nerve block?,"'A maxillary nerve block is a procedure that provides regional anesthesia to parts of the nose, upper jaw, cheek, and mouth. Maxilla is the plate of bone in the front of the face from below the eyes up to the top of the upper ''teeth''.''The maxillary nerve block procedure involves administration of a local anesthetic adjacent to the maxillary nerve. The anesthetic blocks transmission of ''pain'' signals that pass through the nerve from the face to the brain.''The maxillary nerve is a nerve of sensation. The maxillary nerve carries sensory information to the brain as it is received through four major branches:' Middle meningeal nerve: Supplies sensation to a part of the brain’s membrane (dura mater). Zygomatic nerves: Responsible for sensation in the cheek, lower eyelid and tear gland. Pterygopalatine (sphenopalatine) nerves: Responsible for sensation in the nasal cavity, nostrils, soft and hard palate, and pharynx. Posterior superior alveolar nerves: Responsible for the sensation in the gums, posterior cheek, nasal floor, and upper teeth, except for the three molars."
Why is a maxillary nerve block performed?,'A maxillary nerve block is mainly performed for treatment procedures such as:''A maxillary nerve block is avoided with:' Dental procedures involving multiple teeth and surrounding areas Treatment of large canine tooth abscesses Inability to administer local blocks due to infection or abscess Major surgery involving the maxilla for cancer or trauma Repair of the congenital cleft palate in children Post-operative pain relief after maxillary surgeries Chronic facial pain that does not respond to medication Some forms of trigeminal neuralgia Infection in the injection site Bleeding disorders Allergy to local anesthetics
How is a maxillary nerve block done?,"'A maxillary nerve block may be administered as an outpatient procedure, or along with general anesthesia for major facial surgeries. The duration of hospitalization and recovery will depend on the type of surgical procedure performed.''The doctor may use one of the following three anesthetic agents:''No special preparation is normally required for a maxillary nerve block, except if it accompanies general anesthesia.''The doctor may give the maxillary nerve block injection using one of the following three techniques:''The doctor''The doctor''The doctor' Lidocaine Bupivacaine Mepivacaine The patient lies flat or in a semi-reclining position. The doctor may administer mild sedation. The patient’s heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen levels are monitored. Retracts the cheek with a tongue depressor, while the patient keeps their mouth open. Inserts the needle near the gum of the second upper molar, parallel to the cheek. Advances the needle into the depression under the cheek bone (pterygopalatine fossa). Slowly injects the anesthetic and withdraws the needle. Positions the needle in the palate next to the second upper molar, while the patient keeps their mouth wide open. Inserts the needle till it reaches the bone and injects a small quantity of anesthetic. After a five-minute wait for the anesthesia to take effect, advances the needle into the hole (foramen) through which the maxillary nerve branch emerges into the palate. Advances the needle through the foramen into the greater palatine canal. Slowly injects the anesthetic and withdraws the needle. Uses imaging guidance for this approach. Sterilizes the skin on the cheek in front of the ear, while the patient keeps their mouth in a neutral position. Inserts the needle perpendicular to the skin. Advances the needle in the notch (coronoid process) under the cheekbone, slightly upward. Slowly injects the anesthetic and withdraws the needle."
What are the risks and complications of a maxillary nerve block?,"'A maxillary nerve block is a relatively safe procedure with minimal risks. Complications include:' Needle-track infection Hematoma behind the eye  Nerve injury resulting in persistent tingling or numbness Block of other nearby nerves resulting in temporaryBlindnessDouble vision Blindness Double vision Injury to a blood vessel and hemorrhaging Allergic reaction to the medication Systemic toxic response from the local anesthetic injected into a blood vessel causingAnxietyNumbnessDizzinessWeaknessTremors Anxiety Numbness Dizziness Weakness Tremors Cardiovascular and central nervous system collapse, due to local anesthetic systemic toxicity (very rare)"
What is an ulnar nerve release surgery?,"'The ulnar nerve'' is one of the three main nerves in the arm that travel from the neck through a bony protuberance (medial epicondyle) in the elbow, under the muscles of the forearm, down the hand, the side of the palm up to the pinky finger. The ulnar nerve controls most of the hand muscles that carry out fine movements and some bigger forearm muscles that help in making a strong grip.''The ulnar nerve can be constricted at many places, which results in ''nerve entrapment''. The compression pressure on the nerve can cause ''pain'' and numbness in various parts of the arm. The compression of the nerve occurs most commonly against the medial epicondyle and is called cubital tunnel syndrome.\xa0''Ulnar nerve release is a surgical procedure performed to release the compression on the ulnar nerve and the symptoms caused by the compression of the ulnar nerve.\xa0' "
When is an ulnar nerve release surgery done?,'An ulnar nerve release surgery'' is indicated in patients in the following conditions:' The most common indication of ulnar nerve release is cubital tunnel syndrome. Compression of the ulnar nerve caused following trauma or excessive pressure on the elbow Ulnar nerve entrapment due to inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis Failure of conservative therapy measures Functional loss in the hands or fingers
When is an ulnar nerve release surgery not done?,'Contraindications for an ulnar nerve release surgery include the following:''Relative contraindications include recurrent problems of the nerve.' Deformity or instability of the elbow Tumors and cysts Changes to the joint due to arthritis 
How do you release a trapped ulnar nerve?," Prior to the surgery, the doctor will perform a clinical examination, advise blood tests and perform radiological assessment (X-ray, computed tomography [CT], and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). The procedure is performed using anesthesia. There are various surgical techniques and approaches. The choice of approach depends on the site of compression, extent of disease, and surgeon’s discretion. Typically, an incision is made behind the elbow joint. The ulnar nerve is identified, and the course of the nerve is traced. Any soft tissue or bone that is compressing and irritating the nerve is released. Finally, the nerve is left in the groove. The procedure can also be performed endoscopically. Endoscopic ulnar nerve release is a less invasive procedure, and the healing is faster. A small incision is made behind the medial epicondyle, through which a scope (a camera with a light source) and surgical instruments are inserted.  Painkillers and antibiotics would be prescribed after the surgery. The patient is advised to keep the wound dry, gently compressed and elevated after the surgery. Early mobilization of the arm is encouraged because it reduces stiffness.  The arm may be placed in a sling for a few days postoperatively. Rigorous exercise, heavy lifting, or repetitive tasks involving the arm should be avoided until the surgeon allows it. The surgeon and physiotherapist would recommend an exercise regimen to rehabilitate the arm. Simple analgesia should be taken as required. The patient is advised to visit the surgeon or an emergency room (ER) right away if there is any sign of infection (fever, new pain, swelling, warmth, redness, or pus from the operative site), loss of sensation or function."
What are the complications of an ulnar nerve release surgery?,'Potential complications of an ulnar nerve release surgery are:' Incomplete or inadequate decompression of the nerve and/or entrapment at a different location causing recurrence of symptoms Bleeding  Scar formation  Change in nerve position  Direct injury or stretching injury to the ulnar nerve  Loss of sensation or function  Local postoperative hematomas (blood clots)  Wound infection 
What are dark circles?,"'Dark circles are puffiness and darkening of the skin under the eye, and they create cosmetic concerns. It is usually not a serious condition and doesn’t have any serious complications. They are seen bilaterally. If these features are only seen on one side, it requires immediate medical attention as it might be due to ''trauma'' or serious underlying condition related to the eye and/or structures around the eye.''Dark circles appear in men and women. They are more common in adults and rarely seen in children.' "
What are the causes of dark circles under the eye?,"'The skin under the eye is normally thinner and sensitive than the rest of the face. So, it is prone to ''hyperpigmentation'' and swelling. Dark circles are usually caused because of a combination of multiple factors. Some common causes of dark circles are:' Lack of sleep, disturbed sleep or oversleeping and fatigue. Skin rashes and inflammation of the skin. Frequent allergies and sinus infections. The natural aging process leading to increased thinning of under-eye skin. Poor diet, nutrition and dehydration. Excessive sun exposure. Eye strain especially due to prolonged usage of the computer or phone screen, or TV. Smoking, drug abuse and excessive alcohol. Genetic predisposition. Ethnicity: Darker skin tones are more prone to develop hyperpigmentation. Dark circles may appear more pronounced in these skin tones. Dark circles in children: This usually occurs due to poor quality sleep which is a result of chronic conditions like adenoiditis and tonsillitis which causes obstruction of the airway."
How are dark circles treated?,"'Treatment of dark circles involves a combination of medical treatment and natural remedies, and may take a long time. Using natural remedies may not provide satisfactory aesthetic results. Ideally, a combination of a medical and natural treatment plan would be necessary to completely get rid of dark circles. The results are usually not permanent. Appropriate home care and follow-ups with the physician and lifestyle modifications would be required to maintain results.''Many aesthetic medical treatments require multiple sessions to achieve satisfactory results and few sessions later to maintain the results. The doctor would advise an appropriate treatment plan based on the severity of the condition. It is also important to have realistic goals.''Some effective treatment options are:''Medical treatment''Natural/home remedies' Topical agent: Creams containing skin lightening agents like kojic acid, glycolic acid, and hydroquinone, may be used. Low strength creams are available over-the-counter as well. Higher-strength creams would require a doctor’s prescription. These creams need to be applied every day for several months. Chemical peel: Light chemical peels are used because the under-eye area is thin and sensitive. Common peels include glycolic peel, salicylic acid peel, and a lactic acid peel. Chemical peels should be performed by a licensed physician or aesthetician. Doing chemical peels at home without an expert’s supervision could lead to serious complications like chemical skin burns, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, allergic reaction, and a chemical injury to the eyes. Lasers: Several lasers are available to lighten dark circles. Some have additional benefits of reducing wrinkles and inducing collagen growth. Injectable fillers: Volume loss and increased thinning of the skin in the under-eye area causes the affected area to appear dull, sunken, dark, wrinkled, and aged. Fillers injected by a physician correct the volume loss, reduces wrinkles, reduces shadows, and brightens up the under-eye area. Blepharoplasty: This is a surgical procedure that may be done for patients with fat accumulation under the eyes, causing an appearance of dark circles due to the shadows cast. Treatment of underlying medical conditions like allergies and sinus infections. Treatment of skin conditions like dermatitis and eczema. Adequate sleep: Adults require an average of seven to eight hours of sleep a day. Healthy diet, nutritional supplements and adequate hydration. Applying a cold compress or tea bags soaked in cold water or cold cucumber slices. Applying sunscreen, using sunglasses or carrying an umbrella or wearing a hat can prevent sun damage. Hydrating the skin under the eyes using a good moisturizer and under-eye creams. Applying natural oils like almond oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil, or pure vitamin E oil. Reducing eye strain by taking breaks from the computer, phone or TV, and avoid reading in dim lighting. Avoid smoking, drug abuse and excessive alcohol consumption."
What is a gastrostomy tube or G-tube?,"'A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is a feeding tube that is placed into the abdomen to provide ''nutrition'' or medication to the patients who are unable to feed themselves.\xa0 ''A G-tube is placed through a small cut in the abdominal wall via a surgery. Once the G-tube is removed, the tract narrows down or closes within hours. Hence, it is necessary to replace a displaced tube with another tube immediately.''A simple G-tube requires one to two weeks to form a tract.' "
When is the gastrostomy tube recommended?,"'A G-tube insertion is indicated in patients' Who are unable to consume food orally With cancers of the oral cavities or esophagus With Alzheimer’s disease With stroke With certain conditions of the brain and nerves, where the muscles of the throat and mouth are weakened"
When should replacement of the gastrostomy tube be avoided?,'The replacement of a G-tube should be avoided in the case of' A tract that has not been matured with the previous gastrostomy. Infections around the G-tube.
How do you replace a gastrostomy tube?,"'The physicians may choose one of the two types of tubes:''The physician usually avoids administering local anesthesia in this procedure. The physician ensures that you lie on a flatbed or reclining chair. A scope is used to replace the tube.''Once you are made comfortable, the physician performs the following steps:''Once the physician confirms the tube placement, feeding must be started immediately, and the fluid status of the patients must be examined.' Balloon tubes: These are held in place by a water-filled balloon. Non-balloon tubes: These are harder to pull out than balloon tubes. They need to be placed at the hospital. Removal of tube: The initial G-tube may be partially dislodged in the abdomen; hence, it is necessary to remove the tube completely before replacing it with a new tube. In the case of balloon tubes, balloon rupture can dislodge the G-tube. G-tubes can be easily removed by pulling. Replacement of tube: Once the tube has been removed, the physician performs immediate replacement to prevent tract closure or narrowing. Before inserting the tube, the physician examines the tract. The physician uses a similar tube to replace the existing tube. If the information on the tube type is not available, the physician places a feeding tube or Foley catheter based on the availability.  Confirmation of tube placement: Before using the G-tubes for feeding, the physician confirms the G-tube placement using water-soluble contrast dyes into the tube and taking a radiograph for a few minutes."
What are the risks involved with the insertion of a g-tube?,'Certain risks involved with the insertion of a G-tube are:' Leakage of fluid into the abdominal wall Infection at the incision site Bleeding around the tube Misplacement of a tube into the abdominal cavity Upper abdomen pain and vomiting Pain at the incision site
What is rectal prolapse?,"'Rectal prolapse is a condition in which the last part of your large bowel (rectum) comes out of your anus. This can happen in any of the following three ways:''Although rectal prolapse can occur at any stage of life, it is more common in older adults who suffer from chronic ''constipation''.

What are the symptoms of rectal prolapse?,"'Rectal prolapse makes you feel that something is bulging out of the anus. Usually, this happens when you strain while defecating. You may be able to push it in by yourself or it may not go inside even after you try pushing it (complete or full-thickness prolapse).''Other symptoms of rectal prolapse include:' Fecal incontinence (loss of bowel control): Occurs in 5 to 7 out of every 10 patients of rectal prolapse Pain in the anus or rectum Bleeding from the rectum: Delay in the treatment causes the inner lining of the rectum to develop ulcers leading to significant bleeding."
How do you treat rectal prolapse without surgery?,"'The main treatment for complete rectal prolapse and recurrent rectal prolapse is surgery. Initially, if it is not severe, the doctor may try fixing it temporarily by a technique known as “manual reduction of the prolapse.”\xa0''When only the inner lining (mucosa) of your rectum comes out of the anus, your doctor will instruct you how you can perform self-reduction of your rectal prolapse at home. For this, you have to apply gentle pressure on the rectum to move it back into the anus. It is normal for your rectum to bleed a little during the procedure.\xa0''Along with the reduction technique, treating the cause of your rectal prolapse (e.g. ''constipation'') may help you delay or even avoid the surgery. Ask your doctor about what you can do.''Your doctor will usually advise you to''Pelvic floor exercises, such as Kegel exercises, strengthen your pelvic muscles. Here’s how you can do them:''You should do one set of Kegel exercises two to three times a day.\xa0If you cannot perform a set of 10 on your first day, start with a smaller set as much as you can tolerate and build up gradually over time.' Avoid constipation by following a healthy diet and regular exercise. Take a stool softener to keep your bowel movements soft. Do pelvic floor muscle-strengthening exercises. Try tightening your pelvic floor muscles slowly for three seconds.  You will feel like you are lifting them.  Then release for three seconds.  Do this 10 times at a stretch. That’s one set. "
How do you shrink rectal prolapse?,"'Ideally, you cannot shrink the prolapse. You can just restore your rectum to its normal position by manual reduction or surgery.\xa0''In rectal prolapse, the rectum can only be shrunk when its mucosa is swollen due to the buildup of fluid in it. For this, before pushing it inside the anus, you can apply a few granules of ''sugar'' on it, and let it rest there for a few minutes. ''Sugar'' will absorb the excess water in the rectum and cause it to shrink.' "
Why does stress make psoriasis worse?,"'Psoriasis'' is an autoimmune skin disease that can be passed down (hereditary) to you from your parents or grandparents. ''Stress'' is a common factor that can trigger your ''psoriasis''.''Psoriasis'' has a stronger association with psychiatric disorders than other skin diseases. Research reports that mental ''stress'' precedes the first attack of ''psoriasis'' in 44% of patients with psoriasis and frequently triggers psoriasis flares in up to 88% of patients. Additionally, patients with high levels of psychological stress exhibit more severe skin and joint symptoms than those with low levels of psychological stress.''Stress worsens psoriasis by triggering a complex network of signals between the endocrine (hormones), nervous and immune systems. These signals stimulate the inflammatory processes in the skin and help psoriasis and recurring episodes of ''itching'' develop along with the typical skin changes.\xa0' "
How do you stop psoriasis from stress?,"'Stress can cause psoriasis and psoriasis itself can also cause stress. Living with psoriasis can make you feel self-conscious and anxious. You may avoid meeting people, which can impact your social and romantic relationships. Treatments that are not working or their side-effects might affect your mind. If you get ''joint pain'' (''psoriatic arthritis'') because of psoriasis, the ''pain'' can make doing routine activities difficult for you. All these things that come with psoriasis can make you stressed, which can further trigger psoriasis.''You can stop psoriasis flare-ups from developing due to stress by taking a few of the following steps' Relaxation techniques: These include deep breathing, meditation and yoga. Long walks and long baths: Long walks in nature and warm baths can help refresh your mind and make you feel better. Regular exercise and a healthy diet: These two things in combination can reduce the severity of your psoriasis. Keep weight in check: Obesity affects psoriasis.

In other cases, you should visit a healthcare provider if you have a pink eye along with any of the following:' pain in the eye(s) discomfort or sensitivity to light  blurred vision that does not improve when discharge is wiped from the eye(s) intense redness in the eye(s) symptoms that get worse or do not improve  weak immunity, e.g., HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, cancer treatment, or other medical conditions or treatments"
How do you treat a bacterial pink eye?,"'A bacterial pink eye usually produces more mucus or pus than a viral or ''allergic'' pink eye. Your doctor may prescribe:''Antibiotics are not always essential for the treatment of a pink eye; however, they may be necessary in the following cases:' Antibiotic eye drops or ointment Oral antibiotics Painkillers like ibuprofen  Lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) Warm compresses Soak a clean washcloth in warm water, wring out excess water, and place it over your eyes.Do this for 10 to 15 minutes at a timeRepeat three to five times a day or as often as is comfortable.Use a clean washcloth each timeIn the case of infectious conjunctivitis in both eyes, use a different washcloth for each eye.Do not rub or touch the eyesUntil the eye heals, do not wear makeup or contact lenses.

What is a Bartholin cyst?,"'The ''Bartholin glands'' are located on each side of the vaginal opening and they secrete a fluid that lubricates the vagina. Sometimes the openings of the Bartholin glands can be obstructed due to injury or infection, causing fluid to accumulate in the gland that results in a ''cyst'' called ''Bartholin ''cyst''. The swelling is usually painless, but can become infected causing pus accumulation and ''pain''. This is called ''Bartholin ''abscess''. Safe sexual practices, such as using ''condoms'' and maintaining good hygiene habits, can help prevent infection of a cyst.''Conservative home remedies may be used to treat Bartholin ''cysts'', but most cases are treated surgically because they can recur, worsen or become infected. If the Bartholin cyst is infected by bacteria, including sexually transmitted infections, antibiotics and painkillers would be required. After Bartholin cyst drainage, the doctor would recommend certain self-care measures to care for the ''wound'' and healing takes about 1 to 2 weeks.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Bartholin cysts?,"'Small Bartholin cysts that are not infected usually go unnoticed. As the cyst grows, the cyst feels like a painless lump or mass near the vaginal opening. The swelling is usually on one side of the vaginal opening.''A Bartholin cyst can become infected (called Bartholin abscess) and the patient may experience the following' Painful swelling near the vaginal opening Tenderness Fever Difficulty/discomfort while walking or sitting Pain during sexual intercourse"
How is a Bartholin cyst treated?,"'Early, asymptomatic Bartholin cysts usually do not require any treatment. The treatment depends on the size of the cyst, the discomfort level of the patient and whether or not the cyst is infected. Treatment options include''Self-care after surgical drainage of the cyst' Sitz baths: Soaking in a tub filled with a few inches of warm water (sitz bath). This may help the cyst rupture and drain by itself. Sitz baths may be done several times a day for 3 to 7 days or as advised by the doctor. Surgical drainage: Surgical drainage is required for Bartholin cysts that recur or cause discomfort or pain. Drainage of the cyst is usually done under local anesthesia or intravenous sedation. The doctor makes a small incision over the cyst and drains the fluid. A small tube (catheter) is placed in the incision within the cyst for about 6 weeks. This helps to continuously drain out the fluid that accumulates, allowing for complete drainage. Marsupialization: If cysts recur, a marsupialization procedure may be done. The doctor places sutures (stitches) on either side of the incision, creating a small permanent opening about  6 mm in diameter. A catheter may be placed for a few days to drain the fluid completely and help prevent a recurrence. Antibiotics: Antibiotics may be prescribed if the cyst is infected or to avoid post-procedure infection following surgical drainage. Painkillers: Painkillers help decrease pain and inflammation of an infected cyst or after surgical drainage. Sitz bath: Patients may be advised to begin taking sitz baths after the packing is removed. A sitz bath can help reduce swelling and pain. Sitz baths may be prepared with just warm water or warm water mixed with a spoon of Epsom salt or an antiseptic solution prescribed by the doctor. A sitz bath may be taken 3 to 4 times a day for 10 minutes every time for 3 to 5 days or for as long as the doctor advises. Place a clean towel on the bottom of the bathtub. Fill the bathtub with warm water up to hip level. A ready sitz bath that fits in the toilet is available as well. The genital area should be wiped dry using a clean towel. Wear a sanitary napkin: Wear a sanitary napkin to help absorb discharge from the wound, which may take about 2 weeks to resolve. Patients are advised to wear loose-fitting underwear and clothes made of breathable material like cotton. Patients can perform daily activities after 2 to 3 days, but should avoid specific activities like exercise, sports or sexual intercourse until the doctor approves. Otherwise, the drain may fall out and increase the risk of infection. The genital area should be kept clean and dry. Patients are advised to wipe from front to back and shower at least once a day."

What causes a swollen eyelid?,"'You get a swollen ''eyelid'' when the area around your eyes gets filled with fluid. The condition is also commonly called “puffy eyes.”''Your eyelids might swell due to local infection, ''trauma'', or any other illness, where fluid builds up in the entire body. Depending on the cause, one or both eyelids may become swollen.' "
Why is my upper eyelid swollen?,"'Your eyelids can become swollen due to many reasons, such as the following:' Stye or chalazion: Stye and chalazion are small bumps on anyone or both of your upper or lower eyelids that are caused by infection of the oil glands of your eye. A stye looks like a boil or a pimple. Although a stye is formed on the external surface of your eyelid, a chalazion is located inside the eyelid. Conjunctivitis (pink eye): Your eyes may be swollen due to an infectious eye disease known as conjunctivitis where your eyes become red and watery. Dacryocystitis: Blockage of the tear glands draining into the nose can make your eyelids swell and result in the watering of eyes. Cosmetic use: Not removing eye makeup at night can irritate the delicate area around the eye and cause swollen eyelids.  Allergy: Allergy to insect bites (bees, bugs), dust, certain eyeliners or mascaras, and reaction to certain medicines can cause your eyelids to swell. Sinusitis: Recurrent inflammation of the nose that may be associated with swelling of the eyelids. Lack of sleep: Not sleeping well the previous night can make your eyes look puffy the next morning. Trauma: A heavy blow to the eye can rupture the small blood vessels under your eyelid and make your eyelids swollen.  Corneal ulcer: A corneal ulcer (also known as keratitis) is an open sore on the clear outer layer of the front of your eye (cornea). Orbital and periorbital cellulitis: An infection of the deeper tissues of the eyes that spreads to the skin around your eyes. Ocular herpes simplex: A viral infection that causes your eyes to become red, swollen, and painful. Thyroid problem: An aggravated form of hyperthyroidism known as Grave’s disease can lead to an eye condition known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy, which is characterized by protruding eyeballs and puffy eyes. Blepharitis: Blepharitis is an inflammatory eyelid disease that causes the eyelids to become red, swollen, and itchy. Dandruff-like scales form on the eyelashes. Kidney problem: The inability of the kidneys to retain proteins in the body causes fluid build-up in the body leading to swelling all over the body, including the face and eyelids. Serious liver or heart problem: If there is a serious problem in your liver or heart, it leads to water retention in the body and causes puffy eyes."
How do you treat a swollen eyelid?,"'Treatment of the swollen eyelids will depend on the cause. Until you can see your doctor, you can try resolving the swelling of your eyelids at home by' Applying a compress: Put a clean, wet cloth on your eyes twice a day for 15 minutes. Use a warm (hot) compress if the problem is due to a stye. Cleaning the eyes: Clean your eyes with sterile water or saline solution if there is a discharge from the eyes.  Avoiding contact lenses: Avoid wearing contact lenses, which might irritate the eyelids further. Avoiding eye makeup: Avoid applying eyeliner or mascara until the eyelid swelling goes away. Use of over-the-counter eye drops: Over-the-counter eye drops contain antihistamines that help in treating eye allergies and relieve the redness and itching. Getting adequate sleep: Get adequate sleep to give rest to your eyes if you feel that the cause of the swollen eyelids is exhaustion and lack of sleep."
When should you see a doctor for swollen eyelid?,"'A simple eyelid swelling usually resolves within 24 hours. If it does not go away with simple home remedies as described above, you should see a doctor. You should also visit a doctor if:''Your doctor will examine your eyes and take your complete history. He will prescribe you antibiotics in the form of eye drops or oral pills if he/she suspects infection.\xa0''Depending on the cause, your doctor might even advise you on some medical procedure or eye surgery, e.g., Dacryocystorhinostomy for dacryocystitis.'

What is low vision?,"'Low vision means diminished vision; the visual acuity is 20/70 or worse that cannot be fully corrected by surgery, wearing glasses or contact lenses. In\xa0low vision, a person does not become completely blind; there is still some sight that can sometimes be coped with or improved with the help of visual aids and visual rehabilitation. With appropriate management and regular follow-up, the vision loss can be prevented from worsening.''The American Optometric Association classifies low vision into two categories:''The ratio measurement of vision:''This describes the visual acuity or the sharpness of vision at 20 ''feet'' from an object. For example, 20/70 vision means that the patient is at 20 feet to see what a person with normal vision would be able to see at 70 feet.' Partially sighted: The person has visual acuity between 20/70 and 20/200 with conventional prescription lenses. Legally blind: The person has visual acuity no better than 20/200 with conventional correction and/or a restricted field of vision, which is less than 20 degrees."
What are the types of low vision?,"'The most common types of low vision include:' Loss of central vision: Characterized by a blind spot in the center of one's vision. Loss of peripheral (side) vision: The person does not have any vision on either side or above and below eye level. Central vision, however, remains intact. Night blindness: The inability to see in poor lighting or dark and when outside at night. Blurred vision: Objects both near and far appear blurry or out of focus. Hazy vision: The entire field of vision appears to be covered with a film of haze or glare."
What causes low vision?,"'Anyone at any age can be affected by low vision. Low vision is relatively more common in adults over the age of 45 and the risk increases further over the age of 75. Low vision is not a typical sign of ''aging''. There may be one or more conditions causing low vision. These are usually the result of disorders or injuries affecting the eye or a systemic disorder affecting the eyes, such as ''diabetes''. There are several causes of low vision, including:' Diabetes/Diabetic retinopathy Macular degeneration Glaucoma (increased pressure in the eye) Cataracts Retinitis pigmentosa Inherited diseases Eye trauma Corneal opacity"
What are the signs and symptoms of low vision?,"'Low vision can cause difficulty in performing daily activities. It can also be dangerous because it causes difficulty while driving, crossing the road, and operating heavy machinery. Hence, leading to accidents. People with low vision may experience the following symptoms:' Loss of central vision Night blindness Loss of peripheral vision Blurred vision Hazy vision Difficulty distinguishing colors Difficulty identifying faces of people Difficulty viewing digital screens Eyestrain"
How is low vision diagnosed?,"'A thorough eye examination is needed to diagnose the causes of low vision. Several diseases can cause low vision. Low vision can be diagnosed by an ophthalmologist by simple out-patient diagnostic tests as a part\xa0of a detailed eye exam. The doctor\xa0would\xa0ask the patient to read letters and numbers from different distances, near and far. The field of vision is also studied.' "
What is perioral dermatitis?,"'Perioral dermatitis'' (POD) is a ''rash'' that involves the skin around the mouth. The ''rash'' of POD is bumpy and scaly in appearance. There may be ''itching'' and ''pain'', along with the discharge of clear fluid from the rash. POD mostly occurs in women and children.\xa0''The exact cause of perioral ''dermatitis'' is not known.

Treatment options include:' Praziquantel cream Pimecrolimus cream Antibiotic creams  Oral vitamin A analogs Oral antibiotics Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Avoid the use of cosmetics, cleansers, and moisturizers during the treatment Avoid strenuous physical exercise until the skin heals"
Does perioral dermatitis go away on its own?, 
What should I do to prevent perioral dermatitis?,"'When the exact cause of perioral dermatitis is not known, there are no specific strategies to prevent it. Following precautions may help avoid episodes of perioral dermatitis:' Avoid using steroid creams and ointments unless prescribed by your doctor Avoid using harsh cosmetics and fragrances  Protect your skin from strong sunlight Keep your face clean with water and gentle cleansers Minimize the use of makeup Consume a healthy diet"
How is perioral dermatitis diagnosed?," The diagnosis of perioral dermatitis usually does not require any tests.  Your dermatologist or physician can diagnose it by visual examination of your face.  They may ask you about the use of steroid creams and ointments apart from other relevant histories. Swabs may be collected to perform skin culture for ruling out a possible infection.  In rare circumstances, your doctor may take a sample of the affected skin and send it for a skin biopsy. This is done when the standard treatment regimen is ineffective. Blood tests may be used to rule out nutritional deficiencies."
Mild cases of polyhydramnios,'Doctors treat polyhydramnios by looking at its severity and causes.''Doctors will usually monitor mild cases of polyhydramnios for several weeks before deciding to treat them. Mild cases most often do not need treatment.' 
Moderate polyhydramnios,'Doctors recommend expectant mothers with moderate polyhydramnios to take bed rest. This helps prevent preterm ''labor'' that may happen due to polyhydramnios.' 
Severe cases of polyhydramnios,"'Depending upon the risks involved, severe cases of polyhydramnios can be treated in any of the following ways''The condition can cause a lot of distress if not addressed. ''Pregnant'' women should make sure that they follow their doctor’s instructions throughout their gestational period to have a successful delivery.' Amniocentesis: This is a procedure that involves removing amniotic fluid from the uterus at regular intervals using a large needle.  Oral medication: An oral pill of Indocin (indomethacin) can be given before 31 weeks of pregnancy. This medication helps in the treatment of polyhydramnios by reducing fetal urine production and amniotic fluid volume. Early induction of labor: If all other treatments fail or are deemed unfit for you, your doctor may plan to induce labor."
What is polyhydramnios?,"'Polyhydramnios is a condition in which the uterus of a pregnant woman becomes filled with excess amniotic fluid (>2000 mL). It is a rare condition that happens in one out of every 100 pregnant women.''The amniotic fluid is a clear, yellow fluid that is present in a bag-like structure known as the amniotic sac in the uterus. The baby lies in this amniotic sac and derives its ''nutrition'' from the amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid also protects the baby from any external shocks or injuries.''Polyhydramnios generally presents in the ''second trimester'' of pregnancy (13th to 28th week).' "
What causes polyhydramnios?,"'For most women, the cause of their polyhydramnios condition remains unknown.''The most common causes of polyhydramnios include''Other causes include' Gestational diabetes (mother has diabetes either before or after becoming pregnant) Birth defects that affect the baby’s swallowing of amniotic fluid Infections in the baby Carrying identical twins with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) (a condition in which there is imbalance in the blood flow between identical twins) Difference in the blood types of the mother and her baby (the mother has Rh-negative blood group, whereas the baby has Rh-positive blood group) Abnormalities in the baby’s digestive system Problems with the placenta Presence of infections Fetal anemia Presence of diabetes in the mother"
What are the signs and symptoms of polyhydramnios?,"'Mild polyhydramnios usually does not cause any symptoms.''Women with a severe form of the condition may experience symptoms that include' Abdominal tightness or discomfort  Indigestion Constipation Decrease in urination Enlargement of the vulva Shortness of breath Swollen legs, thighs, hips, ankles and/or feet"
How is polyhydramnios diagnosed?,"'Polyhydramnios is suspected when the mother’s abdomen measures more than it should for its gestational age. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by performing ''ultrasonography'' (USG) of the mother’s pelvis. USG is used to determine the amount of amniotic fluid.''Polyhydramnios may also affect the health of the baby. To check the baby’s condition, the doctor may also order additional tests that include' Amniocentesis: A sample of the amniotic fluid is sent to the lab to check if the baby has any genetic problems. Non-stress test: This test uses a special device (tied to the mother’s abdomen) to track the changes in the baby’s heart rate in response to the activities of the mother. Doppler ultrasound: This is a special type of ultrasound technique that helps to visualize the baby’s circulatory system."
What are the complications of polyhydramnios?,'Complications may not come with mild to moderate polyhydramnios. The possible risks of severe polyhydramnios include' Maternal dyspnea (mother finds it difficult to breathe) Preterm labor Premature rupture of the membranes (early water breaking) Premature birth Fetal malposition (the baby turns to an abnormal position) Umbilical cord prolapse (the cord drops down from the vagina before the baby) Postpartum hemorrhage (excessive bleeding after delivery) Large baby Placental abruption (the placenta separates from the uterus before childbirth) Stillbirth (death of a baby in the womb after the 20th week of pregnancy)
What is saphenous nerve block?,"'Saphenous nerve block is a type of anesthetic procedure that blocks the saphenous nerve, a pure sensory nerve of the leg, to anesthetize the lower extremity.''Saphenous nerve block is performed by injecting local anesthetic (usually ''lidocaine'' or ''bupivacaine'') with a small needle near the knee or ankle. Sometimes an ''ultrasound'' machine is used to locate the nerve that runs behind the leg and near the knee. Injecting an anesthetic in the area of the nerve near the knee or ankle will numb all the structures served by that nerve, which includes the shin, fibula, ankle, and foot.' "
What is a saphenous nerve block used for?,'Saphenous nerve block is used:' For wound repair or exploration of the ankle or lower leg  As part of an ankle block required to manipulate a fractured or dislocated ankle  For incision and drainage of an abscess in the ankle or lower leg For foreign body removal in the ankle or lower leg To control pain after surgical repair of the meniscus (partial meniscectomy)
How do you treat saphenous nerve pain?,"'A saphenous nerve block can be used to temporarily stop saphenous ''nerve pain'' during surgery, but, other treatments for more chronic nerve ''pain'' include:' Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications (NSAIDs) such asibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), oracetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin),  naproxen (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) Physical therapy Leg braces Medications that modify nerve pain such asgabapentin (Neurontin) andpregabalin (Lyrica) gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) Opioid pain medications(not recommended for long-term use) (not recommended for long-term use) Lidocaine patches Capsaicin cream Biofeedback Acupuncture Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)"
How is the saphenous nerve block procedure performed?,"'The block may be performed at the knee or ankle. The following are the usual steps for performing a saphenous nerve block:' The patient is positioned laying down.  An ultrasound machine is sometimes used to find the location of the nerve at the knee or ankle.  The area to be anesthetized at the knee or ankle is draped with sterile drapes and prepped with a cleaning solution, usually betadine or chlorhexidine.  The anesthetic (usually lidocaine or bupivacaine) is slowly injected into the area around the nerve, being careful not to inject directly into the nerve or the vascular structures nearby.  After a few minutes, the patients will notice numbness in the area of the lower leg, ankle, or foot.  The area where the anesthetic was injected is cleaned again, and a sterile bandage is placed over the area.  The anesthesia (numbness) from the nerve block can last from 1 to 36 hours, depending on the anesthetic used."
What are the risks and complications of a saphenous nerve block?,"'Complications of a saphenous nerve block procedure include:' Infection: Any procedure that involves injecting medications into the skin has the potential to cause infection. This can occur if the injection site is not properly cleaned prior to the procedure.  Nerve injury: If the anesthetic medication is injected into the nerve itself, it may result in temporary or permanent damage to the nerve. The patient may have numbness, tingling, or pain, at the site of the injection if this occurs.  Allergic reaction: Most anesthetic blocks are safe and rarely cause allergic reactions. When allergic reactions occur, they can range from delayed hypersensitivity (mild itching and swelling) to full anaphylactic shock. If you have a known allergy to injectable anesthetic medications such as lidocaine or bupivacaine, discuss this with your doctor prior to receiving a saphenous nerve block.  Bleeding: Because a saphenous nerve block is performed with injectable medication, bleeding under the skin (bruise or hematoma) may occur. "
How do you treat sexual dysfunction in women? ,"'Sexual dysfunction is recurrent or persistent problems with sexual response, desire, ''orgasm'' or ''pain'' that can potentially create a strain in relationships. Sexual dysfunction can occur in men and women. Female sexual dysfunction may include problems with sexual desire, arousal, attaining an orgasm, painful spasms of the vaginal muscles causing contraction of the vagina and ''painful intercourse''. Sexual dysfunction in women is fairly common. Around 43% of women experience sexual dysfunction at some point in their lives. Some may have difficulties throughout their lives.\xa0 Sexual dysfunction can occur at any stage of life. It may either occur in only some specific sexual situations or in all sexual situations.''Female sexual dysfunction may be due to multiple reasons. Treatment of sexual dysfunction involves addressing the underlying cause, which may be due to a medical, psychological or hormonal condition. Treatment of sexual dysfunction involves more than one approach and is a team effort of multiple healthcare professionals.' "
What is normal female sexual function?,"'Normal sexual function and responses involve the mind and body. A woman can have problems at any stage of sexual function' Motivation or desire: Motivation or desire is required to engage in a sexual activity or continue it. Sexual desire could be triggered by thoughts, words, sights or touch and varies with each woman. Arousal: Arousal is the sexual excitement that is felt and it has a physical element. The blood flow increases to the genital area, the vaginal wall starts to swell and vaginal secretions increase. Orgasm: Orgasm is the peak of sexual excitement. There is increased muscle tension throughout the body and the muscles around the vagina start contracting rhythmically. Resolution: This occurs following an orgasm or sexual activity. There is widespread muscular relaxation throughout the body and a feeling of well-being."
What causes female sexual dysfunction?,"'Sexual dysfunction can occur due to various physical, hormonal and psychological causes or a combination of multiple factors. Factors contributing to sexual dysfunction include' Physical: Several medical conditions and major illnesses such as cancer, chronic pain, severe arthritis, physical injuries, diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis and bladder problems can lead to sexual dysfunction. Certain medications such as antidepressants, blood pressure medications, antihistamines and chemotherapy drugs can affect sexual function. Hormonal: Decline in estrogen levels after menopause can lead to changes in the genital tissues such as dryness, decreased elasticity and decreased sensation that can cause pain during intercourse. Sexual desire may also decrease after menopause. Decrease in estrogen leads to decreased blood flow to the genitals. Women also have hormonal imbalance after childbirth and while breastfeeding that can cause sexual dysfunction. Psychological and/or social: Untreated psychological conditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), history of sexual abuse, stress, insecurity, body image issues and depression can cause sexual dysfunction. Having problems with other aspects of the relationship and cultural and religious beliefs may also contribute to sexual dysfunction."
Can female sexual dysfunction be treated?,"'Sexual dysfunction requires treatment only if one is bothered by it. If not, it doesn’t require treatment because it doesn’t affect health.''Treatment varies depending on the symptoms and cause of sexual dysfunction. Most women require a combined treatment approach that treats medical, psychological and relationship problems that contribute to sexual dysfunction.''Non-medical treatment options\xa0''Medical treatment for female sexual dysfunction''Certain medications can cause sexual dysfunction. The doctor may prescribe an alternate or adjust the dose of such medications. Sexual dysfunction caused due to hormones and other medical illnesses may require medical treatment, which includes' Communication: Communicating openly with the partner about sexual preferences or resolving conflicts can solve most relationship problems that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction. Counseling: Consulting with a licensed therapist or psychiatrist can help treat psychological and emotional problems or relationship problems contributing to sexual dysfunction. Lifestyle modifications: Lifestyle modifications includeReducing alcohol consumptionPerforming regular physical activityConsuming a healthy, balanced diet  Reducing alcohol consumption Performing regular physical activity Consuming a healthy, balanced diet  Vaginal lubricants: A vaginal lubricant can reduce dryness, pain and discomfort during intercourse. Using a device: Arousal may be stimulated by using a vibrator over the clitoris to stimulate it. Hormone therapy: Localized estrogen therapy is administered in the form of creams, vaginal rings or tablets. This improves vaginal dryness, tone, and elasticity and increases blood flow locally. Additionally, there are medications that modulate estrogen receptors, reducing pain during sex. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can help reduce the symptoms of menopause throughout the body, including the genitals. Addyi (flibanserin) and Vyleesi (bremelanotide): These are the two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for hypoactive sexual drive in women. These may be taken after discussion with the physician. They cause chemical changes in the brain and thus lead to arousal. Androgen therapy: Testosterone is an androgen that affects sexual function in women as well, but the use of testosterone to treat female dysfunction is still controversial. Treatment of psychological conditions: Medical treatment to manage stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and other psychological conditions may be prescribed by the doctor."
What are strictures?,'Strictures are narrowed parts in the intestine that often leads to bowel obstruction.\xa0''Factors causing strictures are as follows:' Tuberculosis Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease Cancer Infections Previous surgery
What is strictureplasty?,'Strictureplasty is a surgical procedure to repair strictures by enlarging the narrowed area without removing any portion of your intestine. Strictureplasty is a well-established treatment for Crohn’s disease.\xa0''Strictureplasty is generally a safe procedure and is most effective in treating lower sections of the small intestine called the ileum and jejunum.' 
Why is strictureplasty done?,'Strictureplasty is performed under the following conditions:' Multiple strictures in the long segment of the bowel A previous resection surgery (surgical removal of more than 100 cm of the small bowel) Rapid reoccurrence of Crohn’s disease with obstructive symptoms Obstructive small bowel strictures without associated sepsis formation
How is strictureplasty performed?,"'Strictureplasty depends on various factors:''Strictureplasty techniques depend on the length of strictures, which are as follows:''Heineke Miulicz technique:''Finney strictureplasty technique:''Jaboulay (side-to-side isoperistaltic) technique:' Length of strictures Positioning of strictures within the small intestine Number of strictures present For short strictures (less than 10 cm in length), the Heineke Miulicz strictureplasty technique is used. For medium strictures (10-20 cm in length), the Finney strictureplasty technique is used. For long strictures (longer than 20 cm in length), the side-to-side isoperistaltic strictureplasty technique is used. Strictureplasty is performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia. An incision (surgical cut) is made along the bowel that is slightly longer than strictures. The incision is transverse (perpendicular) to the stricture length. Two stitches are placed at the ends of the opening of strictures. The incision is closed using absorbable sutures. This causes widening of strictures. The intestine is folded at the stricture site. A U-shaped incision is made along strictures without disturbing the adjacent healthy tissues. Strictures are sealed by stitching it side-to-side creating a widened passage in the intestine. This is done where the opening is too narrow. The intestine is folded at the stricture site. Two short incisions are made along strictures without disturbing the adjacent healthy tissues. In this, a bypass is created around strictures."
How do you treat strictures in Crohn's disease?,"'Inflammatory bowel disease'' such as Crohn’s disease can lead to scarring within your ''intestines''. Over time, this can lead to narrow sections in your bowels (strictures). Surgery is needed to widen strictures to remove an obstruction.''Strictureplasty does not involve the removal of any part of the intestine, and hence, it is a bowel-preserving surgery. Strictureplasty reduces the risk of short bowel syndrome, which is usually the complication of resection surgery.' "
What are the complications of strictureplasty?,"'As with any surgery, complications are inevitable with strictureplasty. Some uncommon possible complications caused due to strictureplasty are as follows:' Infection at the surgical incision Bowel obstruction Bleeding in your bowel Fluid leaking from the stitches Recurrence of strictures"
When should strictureplasty be avoided?,"'Strictureplasty should be avoided in the following conditions:' Inflammation, swelling, or hole at the affected site Strictures close to a planned surgical site Multiple strictures in a short segment of the bowel Any stricture with cancerous cells"
What are splints?,"'A splint is a rigid or flexible device that maintains in position a displaced or movable part and protects it from any further damage.''Splints are usually applied to reduce movement and provide support and comfort by stabilizing an injury.\xa0''Splints are primarily used during nonemergency injuries to the bones or ligaments until they can be evaluated by a consultant such as an orthopedic surgeon. They are also used to temporarily immobilize an extremity before the surgery (e.g., for an open ''fracture'') or enable healing.''Unlike casts, splints are preferred in an emergency setting, where injuries are often acute and swelling may continuously increase. All patients with injuries that are splinted should be referred for evaluation by a consultant within two to seven days.' "
How does a thumb spica splint work?,'Thumb spica splints are a type of orthopedic splint\xa0applied to minimize movement and provide support and comfort by stabilizing an injury of the thumb. This kind of splint\xa0usually allows the other fingers to move freely.\xa0''Immobilizing the joint reduces ''pain'' and helps the injury heal faster. Studies report the combination of ''corticosteroid'' injection with thumb spica cast may yield better results than injection alone in inflammatory conditions.' 
When is a thumb spica splint done?,"'A thumb spica splint can be used for various injuries, including the following:' Injuries and fractures of the anatomical snuffbox (area over the thumb base) and thumb Ligament injuries and inflammation Inflammation of the tendon  Gamekeeper’s or skier’s thumb: It is an injury and inflammation of the ligament in the space between the thumb and index finger. Patients present with pain, swelling, and inability to grasp any object between the index finger and thumb. Tenosynovitis: Inflammation of the tendon sheath (where the muscle connects the bone) that may occur in the hand, wrist, or foot. It is caused by trauma, joint overuse, playing racquet sports (e.g., tennis, golf, etc.) regularly, or infection. Patients present with pain, swelling, and difficulty moving the joint. A thumb injection with corticosteroid along with thumb spica splinting is usually effective in 80% of patients with tenosynovitis."
When is a thumb spica splint not done?,"'There are no absolute contraindications for thumb spica splint. Relative contraindications involve injuries that require immediate evaluation or an intervention by a consultant (an orthopedic surgeon, a hand surgeon or a ''plastic surgeon'') such as the following:' Complicated fractures Open fractures Injuries with associated neurovascular compromise"
How do you wrap a thumb spica splint?,"'There are various types of thumb splints made of various materials and have different techniques of application. Thumb spica splints are generally applied by a healthcare professional.''Thumb spica splinting is usually tolerated without the use of anesthesia. In case of significant pain during joint manipulation or reduction of fracture, anesthesia and painkillers would be required.''The injured limb is completely exposed. A stockinette is applied to the thumb, extending beyond the wrist. Soft padding is applied over the stockinette. The padding should extend 2-3 cm beyond the overlying plaster on both ends.\xa0''Plaster of Paris (POP) is applied over the padding. A bandage wrap is applied over the wet plaster. The thumb and wrist remain immobile until the splint is dry. Patients may feel some warmth released from the plaster as it dries.''In case of a simple sprain, the doctor may advise a simple brace with Velcro clips or a bandage wrap to be worn for two to six weeks to immobilize the joint.''Patients are advised to rest, elevate, and ice the injured limb. If they experience ''weakness'', numbness, color change (pale or bluish), increasing pressure or pain, or spreading redness, they are advised to remove the splint and visit the emergency department right away.\xa0''The splint must be kept clean and dry. Patients may be tempted to use sticks, pens, or hangers to scratch an ''itch'' inside the splint. Sticking objects into the splint to scratch an ''itch'' can wrinkle the padding and lead to pressure injuries or cause ''cuts'' in the skin, leading to infection. The splint is usually rechecked in 48 hours by the doctor.' "
What are the complications of thumb spica splints?,"'Thermal ''burns'' may occur due to the warmth as the plaster dries' Pressure sores Contact dermatitis Neurovascular compromise (damage to nerves and blood vessels) Decreased range of motion from immobilization Because of these complications, splint aftercare often requires physical therapy."
What is a biventricular pacemaker?,"'A biventricular pacemaker is a type of pacemaker to treat heart failure with abnormal electrical systems. This type of pacemaker stimulates the two chambers of the heart.''In a normal heart, the lower chambers of the heart pump together in sync with the heart’s upper chamber. During heart failure, the lower chamber and upper chamber do not pump together. When the contraction is out of sync, the ''left ventricle'' fails to pump sufficient blood to the body. Insufficient blood pumping ultimately leads to worsening of symptoms, such as:' Cough especially when sleeping or lying down Shortness of breath Swelling in the ankles or legs Weight gain Increased urination Fatigue Rapid or irregular heartbeat"
Who should receive a biventricular pacemaker?,"'People with ejection fraction less than 35% are at a greater risk of fast, irregular, or sometimes, life-threatening heart rhythms. Ejection fraction is the measure of the blood volume pumped from the left ventricles. A biventricular pacemaker is appropriate for patients associated with the below factors:' History of cardiac arrest or are at risk of getting cardiac arrest Moderate to severe heart failure symptoms Take many medicines for a failed heart Delayed electrical activation of the heart"
What happens during the biventricular pacemaker implantation?,"'A pacemaker can be implanted by one of the two methods:' Endocardial, transvenous approach: This is the most common and simple method of pacemaker implantation. A lead is implanted into the vein present under the collar bone and guided to the heart. The tip of the lead attaches to the heart muscle. The other end is attached to the pulse generator, which is placed under the skin in the upper chest. Epicardial approach: The physician opens the chest to attach the tip of the lead outside the heart. The other end is attached to the pulse generator, which is placed under the skin in the abdomen."
What happens after the biventricular pacemaker implantation?,"'After the implant, you will have to stay in the hospital overnight. The leads are tested to make sure it is correctly placed and functioning. Small amounts of energy are delivered through the leads into your heart muscle, causing it to contract. Once the testing is successful, the physician connects the lead to the device. The nurses continuously monitor your heart rate and rhythm to see for any variations. The Holter monitor attached to your chest records your heart rhythm for 12 hours to ensure that the pacemaker is functioning.' "
How does a person get hepatitis?,"'A person can get ''hepatitis A'' through the following sources:''A person can get ''hepatitis B'' in many ways, which include:''A person can get ''hepatitis C'' through:''Hepatitis'' D'' can be spread through:''Hepatitis E'' mainly infects people who eat or drink food or water contaminated with the virus. Under-cooked foods can also spread ''hepatitis E''. It is more dangerous in ''pregnant'' women.' Food or water contaminated with the fecal matter of an infected person Sexual contact (rare)  Having sexual contact with an infected person Blood transfusion Sharing needles (while doing drugs or during procedures) Being in direct contact with an infected person’s blood Transferred from mother to the fetus Getting an infected needle prick Being in contact with an infected person’s body fluid (semen or other body fluids) Tattoo needles Sharing infected needles Blood transfusion Being in direct contact with an infected person’s blood Getting an infected needle prick Having sexual contact with an infected person (less common) Transferred from mother to the fetus Being in contact with the infected fluid or blood A person can get hepatitis D only if they are infected previously with hepatitis B."
What is hepatitis?,"'Hepatitis'' is the swelling of the ''liver'' and is mainly caused due to ''viruses''. The other causes of hepatitis include:''Viral hepatitis'' is caused by a virus and can be of two types:''The most common type of ''viral hepatitis'' includes:' Autoimmune reactions (allergy to one’s own body’s proteins) Medications, drugs, or toxins Drinking alcohol in more than recommended amounts for a long time Acute (lasting less than six months) Chronic (lasting more than six months) Hepatitis A: It is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This form of hepatitis heals on its own and does not lead to a chronic infection. It generally does not have any complications. Hepatitis A can be prevented by vaccination. Hepatitis B: Most of the patients with hepatitis B recover from it and do not become chronically infected. It can be prevented by a vaccine. Hepatitis C: Hepatitis C is the most common cause of liver disease. Most of the cases can lead to chronic liver infection. It cannot be prevented using a vaccine. Hepatitis D: Hepatitis D happens to people infected with the hepatitis B virus. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus gives protection from hepatitis D virus. Hepatitis E: This infection is common throughout the world. Vaccines are not available everywhere."
How do you know if you have hepatitis?,"'You may be a carrier of the hepatitis virus and may be unaware of it completely. This is true, particularly in ''hepatitis B and C.'' Symptoms may occur only after significant liver damage.''Symptoms of ''acute hepatitis'' appear quickly, which include:''Symptoms of ''chronic hepatitis'' develop slowly and may not be noticeable.' Fatigue Flu-like symptoms Dark urine Nausea  Stomach pain Loss of appetite Joint ache Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) Low-grade fever Pale-colored stool Unexplained weight loss"
How do you prevent hepatitis?,"'You need to follow these tips to prevent hepatitis:' Practice safe sex using condoms Do not share needles, razors, or toothbrush with anyone Do not touch spilled blood Practice good hygiene, such as handwashing with soap and water Avoid eating undercooked shellfish and oysters Avoid eating raw vegetables Take vaccination on time Refrain from heavy drinking Drink bottled water while traveling Use precautions during piercing and tattooing"
What are the complications of hepatitis?,'Hepatitis is considered as a serious health issue due to the following reasons:' Damages liver tissue Spreads easily from person to person Weaken the immune system of the body Cause liver cancer (Hepatitis B and C) Liver failure Result in death
What is a polyamorous relationship?,"'The traditional belief is that every person should seek a single soulmate and they should commit to that person completely. There are people who don’t believe that a single individual can fulfill all their needs in a relationship, so they prefer having many partners.''Polyamory, or consensual nonmonogamy, is the practice of having multiple intimate relationships with the full knowledge and consent of all the parties involved. It is not\xa0gender-specific. Anyone can have multiple partners of any\xa0gender. Polyamorous relationships require consent, open-mindedness, immense trust, communication skills, clear boundaries, and mutual respect, without feelings of\xa0jealously, to work in the long run.''Numerous studies conducted in the United States have reported that about four to eight percent of the population are in polyamorous relationships.''Polyamory differs from other types of open relationships such as swinging (couples having casual sex outside of the relationship, without being emotionally attached). Polyamory may often be confused with polygamy. Polygamy is being married to more than one person at the same time, whereas polyamory involves both married partners having the freedom to have relationships outside their primary relationship. Polyamorous relationships are not illegal, but polygamy is illegal in many parts of the world, including the United States.''Polyamorous relationships face a social stigma. Hence, it is often practiced privately and maybe kept a secret even from close friends and family out of fear of being judged. Polyamory is not a sexual orientation, but more of a lifestyle choice. Numerous studies have reported that individuals in polyamorous relationships have more chances of practicing ''safe sex'' and get tested more frequently for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'').''Some polyamorous people have a primary relationship and engage in casual relationships with others with consent from the other partner. Some may introduce a secondary partner that requires the primary couple to agree on a set of rules, such as date times and the type of\xa0intimacy\xa0allowed. Some relationships start off as being polyamorous, whereas others may become polyamorous after being together for a while. Each couple may have their own set of rules. However, if one partner wants a polyamorous relationship and the other does not, it could be threatening to the relationship.''Polyamorous relationships definitely benefit from regular counseling sessions to cope with feelings of jealousy and ''anxiety'', which may surface in the long run. The couple may start off being polyamorous but may want to change the parameters of the relationship and this is okay.' "
How does a polyamorous relationship work?,"'The reason why polyamorous relationships are not very common is that they do not follow the traditional social, cultural, or religious construct of relationships. Polyamorous relationships work for people who may travel a lot for work, have long-distance marriages, and do not wish to cheat on their partner.''The concept of “cheating” does not exist in polyamorous relationships because both of the parties involved are required to be completely honest about their other relationships.''Ultimately, being in a polyamorous relationship comes down to the people involved in the relationship. It may work for some people, but it requires being open and transparent.' "
Signs and symptoms of anemia in pregnancy,"'This condition usually starts out mild and becomes more severe as you move through later ''stages of pregnancy''. Signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia may include some or all of the following:''If your iron-deficiency anemia is severe, you might also develop pica, where you crave unusual or non-food items. Ice cubes, clay, and dirt are some of the items iron-deficient women may crave.' Fatigue and lack of energy Dizziness or lightheadedness Weakness Shortness of breath Brittle nails Hair loss Inflammation or soreness on your tongue Cold hands and feet Headaches Low body temperature Pale or yellowish skin Chest pains Irregular or fast heartbeat"
Causes of anemia in pregnancy,"""The most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy is the increasing demand your growing baby places on your body. During pregnancy, your body requires a lot more iron to support the placenta and your baby's development.\xa0""'Over the course of your pregnancy, iron requirements for the placenta amount to 90 milligrams, while your baby will need around 270 milligrams. Iron demand increases as you move through the ''trimesters'', with the ''third trimester'' requiring the most iron.\xa0'""Along with the strain of keeping up with your baby's iron needs, you may develop anemia if you don't eat enough iron-rich foods or if you eat too many foods that block iron absorption.\xa0""'Beyond these common causes, you have a higher chance of developing iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy if you have closely spaced ''pregnancies'', are pregnant with more than one baby, experience a lot of ''morning sickness'', or typically had heavy menstrual flows before pregnancy.' "
Diagnosing anemia in pregnancy,"'If you are pregnant and you think that you are developing iron-deficiency anemia, you should contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor will order a blood test called a ''complete blood count'', or ''CBC'', to check your red blood cell and hemoglobin levels.\xa0''They might also order other ''prenatal care'"" tests to check your body's serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, white blood cell levels, and platelets. \xa0"" "
Treatments for anemia in pregnancy,"'Depending on your test results, your doctor might recommend that you increase your intake of iron-rich foods, cut down on certain foods and ''beverages'', or take ''prenatal vitamins'' or an iron supplement.\xa0''Iron-rich foods are important for women at any age, but you need more of them during pregnancy. While most women need about 18 milligrams of iron each day, pregnant women need about 27 to 30 milligrams of iron to support their baby.\xa0''Foods high in iron include:''Foods containing calcium, such as dairy or ''soy'"" products, tend to block your body's ability to absorb iron, so try to limit calcium-rich foods. Many doctors will advise limiting ""'caffeine'' consumption during pregnancy to avoid potential negative effects on your baby’s growth, but coffee and tea can also prevent you from absorbing iron. If you’re drinking ''caffeinated'' beverages during your pregnancy, have them between meals. Foods rich in ''vitamin C'', however, can help your body absorb more iron.\xa0''You should take ''prenatal'' ''vitamins'' when trying to get pregnant, but you also need them during your entire pregnancy. These ''vitamins'' not only supply you and your baby with ''folic acid'' and iron, but they also provide other nutrients like zinc, ''vitamin E'', B vitamins, omega-3s, vitamin C, and ''vitamin D''.''Finally, if your blood tests still show low levels of iron, your doctor might recommend that you take ''iron supplements'' to boost iron levels.\xa0''Iron pills can cause ''upset stomach'' or ''diarrhea'"", so you should always take them with food. Check in regularly with your doctor to test your blood levels to ensure you aren't taking too high a dose, since too much iron can be toxic to the body.""

What is body dysmorphic disorder?,'Body dysmorphic disorder'' (BDD) is a body image disorder characterized by persistent thinking and worrying about one or more perceived defects or minor flaws in your appearance. People with BDD may think about the perceived or real flaws for hours each day. They find it hard to control their negative feelings and don’t believe people who tell positive things about them. They may like to live in isolation due to fear of being judged by others.' 
Which parts of the body are involved in BDD?,"'People with BDD are commonly preoccupied with some aspect of their face, and many believe they have multiple defects. The most common body parts include:''Overall, people with BDD complain of a lack of symmetry or feel that something is too big, too small, or out of proportion compared to other body parts.' Skin Nose Hair Eyes Chin Lips Overall body build Breasts Genitals"
How does BDD affect emotion?,"'BDD causes emotional distress, such as:''Even if their concern is related to the appearance; however, their distress is real.' Anxiety Depression Shame Disgust Embarrassment"
How to treat BDD?,"'The physician treats BDD in either of the two ways:' Cognitive-behavioral therapy: It helps to control all the negative thoughts, emotional reactions, and behaviors. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may help to resolve the problems related to the brain chemical serotonin."
What causes Graves disease?,"'Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system releases abnormal antibodies that mimic the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH, released by the ''pituitary gland'', activates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. Abnormal antibodies lead to the overproduction of thyroid hormones. Hereditary can play a major role in determining the susceptibility of abnormal antibodies.' "
Who is at risk of developing Graves disease?,"'Graves disease mainly affects women between the ages of 30 and 50 years. People with the following conditions are at risk of developing Graves disease:' Family history of thyroid disease Celiac disease (a digestive disorder causing indigestion of gluten) Vitiligo (skin disorder causing changes in skin coloration) Pernicious anemia (iron deficiency caused due to lack of vitamin B12) Hormone disorder, such as Addison disease Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or type 1 diabetes"
What are the symptoms of Graves disease?,"'Hyperthyroidism'' augments certain body functions. Symptoms of Graves disease include:' Enlarged thyroid (goiter) Fatigue Hand tremors Muscle weakness or tiredness Heat intolerance Irritability or nervousness Weight loss without any efforts Arrhythmia (fast, irregular heartbeat) Difficulty sleeping Eye inflammation, causing eyeballs to protrude from the socket Excessive perspiration More frequent bowel movements Reddish, thickened, and lumpy skin, especially on the shins and upper feet Change in frequency or total cessation of menstrual periods Diarrhea Trembling hands"
How is Graves disease treated?,"'Treatment for Graves disease involves lowering the thyroid level or blocking the action of the thyroid. The three main treatments of Graves disease include:''Medications, such as ''beta-blockers'', may block some of the effects of excess thyroid hormone. They slow down the heart rate and reduce the symptoms of shakiness and nervousness.' Antithyroid medications: Methimazole (MMI) or Propylthiouracil blocks the thyroid from producing excess thyroid hormone. Avoid MMI during the early stages of pregnancy. Radioactive iodine (RAI): RAI destroys thyroid cells to prevent the thyroid gland from producing more thyroid hormone. It can sometimes lead to an underactive thyroid gland. Surgery (thyroidectomy) to remove all or some of the thyroid gland."
What is leukemia?,"'Leukemia'' is a ''cancer'' of the white blood cells of the bone marrow. Patients with ''leukemia'' have an over-production of a particular blood cell type in the body, the white blood cells (cells that fight infection and provide immunity).\xa0 The excessive number of white blood cells cause many of the ''symptoms of leukemia''.\xa0''Based on the origin, the white blood cells can be divided into two broad types – myeloid or lymphoid:''Based on how fast it progresses, it is divided into acute and ''chronic leukemia''.' Myeloid leukemia (myelogenous leukemia) arises from the uncontrolled production of the blood cells called myeloblasts in the bone marrow. Normally, myeloblasts would turn into white blood cells (other than lymphocytes). Lymphoid leukemia (lymphoid or lymphoblastic leukemia) arises from cells called lymphoblasts in the bone marrow. Normally, lymphoblasts would turn into a particular type of white blood cells, the lymphocytes. Acute leukemia: Most of the abnormal blood cells are immature and do not function normally. It progresses very quickly. Chronic leukemia: There are some immature cells, but others are normal and function normally. It is slowly progressive."
What are the causes of leukemia?,"'There are several causes of leukemia. All the causative agents ultimately lead to the damage or alteration of DNA. The probable causes are:''The outcome of leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the extent of the disease, age of the patient, and the general condition of the patient.\xa0''Patients with leukemia may ultimately die due to multiple infections (bacteria, fungal, and/or viral), severe nutritional deficiencies, and failure of multiple organ systems. The patients can also face complications due to the leukemia treatment itself, which can sometimes be life-threatening.\xa0''Some patients can go into complete remission.\xa0' Genetics: Family history, chromosomal abnormalities, etc.  Viral Environmental factors: radiation exposure, drugs, and chemicals Other underlying blood disorders "
What are the signs and symptoms of leukemia?,"'18 Signs and symptoms of leukemia include:' Fever Frequent infection Weakness Fatigue Headaches Pale skin and nails Nausea and vomiting Body pain Bleeding gums Nosebleeds Prolonged bleeding following injuries Heavy and prolonged bleeding during menstruation  Easy bruising Swollen lymph nodes around the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Difficulty in breathing Weight loss Loss of appetite  Inflammation of the eyes"
What are the types of leukemia?,"'Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)\xa0''Acute myeloid leukemia'' (AML)''Chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL)\xa0''Chronic myeloid leukemia'' (CML)\xa0''Hairy cell leukemia'' (HCL)''Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)' Progresses rapidly and spreads to other organ systems through the blood. It mostly occurs in children and those older than 45 years.  It is the second most common leukemia in adults. Commonly seen in adults older than 55-60 years. In AML, the myeloid cells mutate, forming defective cells and prevent the formation of normal, healthy cells. There is a decrease in healthy and functioning mature white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It is rapidly progressive.   Slow-growing cancer that begins in lymphocyte cells present in the bone marrow. There is an abnormally high multiplication of lymphocyte cells that are immature and do not function properly. This decreases the body’s immunity against infections. Spreads to the lymph nodes and other organ systems through the blood. CML is associated with a chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph chromosome). Spreads through the blood to other organ systems A rare subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that progresses slowly. The bone marrow produces a high number of B-cells, a type of white blood cell that normally fights against infection.  There is a decrease in the production of healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. A group of closely-related diseases in which the bone marrow produces very few healthy, functioning red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets, or any combination of these three."
How is leukemia treated?," Chemotherapy: a single drug or combination of drugs that kill cancer cells.  Radiation therapy: radiation is used to damage the rapidly produced cancer cells, killing them, and inhibiting their growth. It can be applied selectively to a specific area or the whole body. Bone marrow transplant: diseased bone marrow is replaced with healthy bone marrow from the patient (called autologous transplantation) or from a donor (called allogeneic transplantation).  Immune therapy: the body’s immune system is modulated to recognize and attack cancer cells. Treatment of symptoms and other diseases: pain, anemia, and infections  Nutrition: Nutritional supplementation  Palliative care: for untreatable situations (interdisciplinary medical care to improve quality of life, and reduce pain and suffering in patients with a terminal illness) Psychological support  Treatment of side effects and complications: such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and inflammation of the skin"
How does occipital nerve stimulation work?,"'Occipital nerve stimulation relieves ''pain'' in the back of the head (occipital region) by producing a tingling sensation in the occipital area. The electrical impulses from the pulse generator affect the occipital nerve’s function and block its transmission of ''pain'' signals to the brain.''Electrodes are placed into the tissues under the skin over the occipital nerve. The electrodes are connected with insulated leads to a battery-powered pulse generator that is implanted under the skin in the upper chest, abdomen or back. The non-rechargeable batteries last up to five years, and the rechargeable batteries last nearly 10 years.''The pulse generator is programmed by a clinical specialist and can be operated by the patient with a remote-control device. The device may be either programmed to provide continuous or intermittent stimulation. Based on individual needs, the patient can turn the device on or off, as well as adjust the stimulation parameters, such as voltage and frequency, for comfortable paresthesia.' "
How is occipital nerve stimulation performed?,"'Occipital nerve stimulation is performed in two stages, usually a week apart. In the first stage, the doctor places only the electrodes in the ''scalp'', which are operated with an external battery. The patient uses the device for four to seven days, on a trial basis. If the patient experiences significant pain relief from the occipital nerve stimulation, implantation of the pulse generator follows.''A pain specialist or a neurosurgeon performs the procedure. The trial procedure is performed using local anesthesia and mild sedation, while the implantation of the pulse generator requires general anesthesia.''Stage I: Occipital nerve stimulation trial''The doctor''Stage II: Occipital nerve stimulator implantation''The doctor' Blood and imaging tests Historical data notedBleeding disordersHigh blood pressureAllergiesAny other health problemsAny regular medications taken Bleeding disorders High blood pressure Allergies Any other health problems Any regular medications taken Hair over electrode implantation site clipped Administers sedation and injects local anesthesia in the occipital area of the scalp. Makes a tiny incision in the scalp. Inserts the electrodes into the tissues under the skin using continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) for guidance. Connects the leads to an external pulse generator. Tests the stimulator with response from the patient to ensure that the electrodes are placed optimally. Closes the incision with sutures with the leads trailing out of the incision. The patient is monitored in the recovery room for a few hours. The leads from the scalp are connected to the external pulse generator and settings are adjusted to suit the requirement of the patient. The patient uses the device for the next four to seven days as needed. The patient performs activities and eats food that usually trigger migraines and maintains a pain diary, noting the stimulation effect. Implantation of the pulse generator is undertaken if the patient benefits from significant pain relief from occipital nerve stimulation. The trial stimulation may not prove useful with certain kinds of headaches, as the response to stimulation may take a few weeks or even months. The patient must avoid eating and drinking for eight hours before the procedure. Attaches an IV line and administers general anesthesia. Opens the incision site in the scalp where the leads are implanted at the trial stage. Ensures the electrodes are firmly in place or adjusts the placement as necessary, with fluoroscopic guidance. Tunnels the leads subcutaneously to the pulse generator implant site. Creates a small pocket under the skin to implant the pulse generator. Connects the tunneled leads to the pulse generator. Tests the pulse generator to make sure it works properly. Places the pulse generator in the implant site and closes it with sutures. The patient is weaned off anesthesia and administered painkillers. The patient is monitored in the recovery room for a few hours. Most patients are discharged within a day or two. Complete recovery may take up to six weeks. Pain relief or reduction in pain intensity from the neurostimulation can occur variably in patients. Neurostimulation effects may take weeks or even months in some patients."
What are the risks and side effects of occipital nerve stimulation?,"'Implantation of occipital nerve stimulation devices is a relatively safe procedure with minimal complications. Studies show that most patients report significant reduction in the pain intensity, and ''headache'' days per month.''The complications include:' Lead dislodgement or breakage Wound infection Wound erosion (skin deterioration at the surgical site) Pain and numbness at the lead sites Hematoma Collection of fluid (seroma) in the incision sites Device malfunction Battery failure Lack of pain relief Insufficient stimulation coverage of pain area Need for revision surgery"
How does tubal sterilization work?,"'Tubal sterilization ''is also called ''tubal ligation''. It is a form of permanent ''birth control'' for women. During ''conception'', the ovaries release the eggs into the fallopian tubes. The sperm enters the vagina, uterus and then fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg. Following ''fertilization'' in the fallopian tubes, the fertilized egg leaves the fallopian tubes and moves into the uterus and implants in the uterine wall, where the fetus develops.''Tubal sterilization works to permanently prevent ''pregnancy'' by cutting and tying or clipping the fallopian tubes, hence preventing the egg from traveling from the ovaries through the fallopian tubes. It also blocks the sperm from entering the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg.'' Reversal surgery may be attempted, but the surgery is invasive and not usually effective. Tubal sterilization does not affect the ''menstrual cycle''.''A woman can undergo tubal sterilization at any time, including right after normal ''childbirth'', cesarean delivery or along with other abdominal surgeries. The best time to undergo tubal sterilization is following ''childbirth'' or combined with other abdominal or pelvic surgeries. Another alternative to tubal sterilization, which is also permanent, is hysteroscopic sterilization that involves the doctor placing a small coil into the fallopian tubes that causes ''scar tissue'' to form and blocks the tubes.' "
How is tubal sterilization performed?,"'Before the procedure''The woman would have to undergo a ''pregnancy test'' to ensure she is not ''pregnant''. If the woman is pregnant, she may discuss her options whether to continue the pregnancy before undergoing sterilization. Routine blood and radiological tests would be performed to assess ''fitness'' for surgery.''During the procedure''The procedure is performed under anesthesia. The procedure is usually performed laparoscopically. Two to three small incisions are made in the abdomen under the umbilicus (''belly button'') through which a thin tube with a light and camera (laparoscope) and surgical instruments are inserted.\xa0''The fallopian tubes are sealed off by cutting them and tying the ends. Part of the fallopian tubes may be removed. The fallopian tubes may also be blocked, destroying parts of the tubes or blocking them with rings or clips.''If the procedure is being combined with other open or laparoscopic surgeries of the abdomen or pelvis or cesarean delivery, the surgeon would perform the sterilization procedure using the incisions made for the abdominal or pelvic surgery or cesarean delivery. If tubal sterilization is being done after vaginal ''childbirth'' or isolated at any time, the procedure would be performed laparoscopically.''After the procedure''Patients are usually discharged the same day and occasionally the next day. Patients may experience ''pain'', discomfort, giddiness and ''bloating'' that usually resolve in a few days. Painkillers and antibiotics are usually prescribed. Patients can resume their daily activities the next day after surgery because they feel better and more comfortable, but should avoid straining. Patients may bathe 48 hours after surgery. Patients can resume ''exercise'', sports, heavy lifting and sexual intercourse after consulting the doctor. Recovery would take longer (six to eight weeks) if other abdominal or pelvic surgeries or cesarean delivery has also been performed.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of tubal sterilization?,"'Tubal sterilization may not be ideal for all women. Hence, it is important to discuss the advantages, disadvantages and risks of the procedure with the doctor.''Advantages of tubal sterilization''Disadvantages of tubal sterilization''The risk of complications increases in the following cases' Tubal sterilization can permanently prevent pregnancy with a good success rate. Hence, women need not use other types of birth control. It reduces the risk of ovarian cancer, especially if the fallopian tubes are cut. The procedure is irreversible.; Hence, women who may want to get pregnant in the future can discuss with the doctor and opt for other long-acting contraceptive options such as intrauterine contraceptive devices/intrauterine devices (IUCDs/IUDs). The procedure does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Although tubal sterilization is relatively safe, it’s still a surgical procedure requiring anesthesia. Hence, there is a risk of complications. Some complications that may occur includeBleeding InfectionPelvic pain Improper wound healingScarring Damage to the surrounding structures such as the bowel, bladder, muscles, major blood vessel, and other tissuesReaction to anesthesiaFailure of the procedure, resulting in unwanted pregnancy in the future, especially tubal pregnancy (implantation of the fertilized egg in the fallopian tubes). Bleeding  Infection Pelvic pain  Improper wound healing Scarring  Damage to the surrounding structures such as the bowel, bladder, muscles, major blood vessel, and other tissues Reaction to anesthesia Failure of the procedure, resulting in unwanted pregnancy in the future, especially tubal pregnancy (implantation of the fertilized egg in the fallopian tubes). History of major pelvic or abdominal surgery Chronic smoking Obesity Diabetes and other major systemic illnesses  Age, that is the younger the woman, the higher the risk of failure of the procedure"
How effective is a LEEP procedure?,"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure'' (''LEEP'') is used to remove abnormal or potentially cancerous regions in the cervix (mouth of the uterus). Research has shown that this procedure is as effective as other treatments (laser ablation, ''cold'' knife conization and cold therapy or ''cryotherapy'') that are used to destroy or remove the suspicious areas in the cervix.''A recent study in a low-income country found that nearly 70 to 90 out of every 100 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were cured with LEEP. These results are similar to studies conducted in moderate- to high-income countries.''Following a LEEP procedure, all affected areas of the cervix are removed in a single session. Rarely is a second session necessary. The condition may recur only in a small number of people.' "
What is a LEEP?,'A LEEP procedure is a simple procedure that involves the use of an electric current passed through a loop of wire to destroy suspicious cells in the cervix.''It is usually done after a ''Pap smear'' test that shows abnormal results. A LEEP procedure is done as the next step to remove the abnormal portion and send the sample to the lab to get a correct diagnosis.' 
How to prepare before a LEEP,"'Women should schedule the appointment for the LEEP procedure only before or after their periods (never when they are menstruating).''Women just need to take a few simple precautions for two days before the procedure''Also, let women should let their doctor know' Do not have sex (vaginal intercourse). Do not use tampons or vaginal douches. Do not use vaginal creams. Do not take an over-the-counter pain medication. If they are pregnant If they are on any blood-thinning medications (aspirin, heparin or warfarin)"
What happens during a LEEP?,"""A LEEP procedure is usually done in a doctor's office or clinic and typically takes 10 to 20 minutes."" The woman will be asked to lie down on a table in the same position (stirrup position) as during a pelvic examination or Pap test. The doctor will then insert a special instrument (speculum) into the vagina that helps stretch (dilating) it open. Next, a long camera-like tube (colposcope) is placed just near the vulva (but not inside) in such a way that it lights the entire path from inside the vagina up to the cervix. This allows the doctor to visualize the vagina, vulva and cervix. The doctor then clears the area of mucus or other discharge. The anesthetic medication is injected (locally) into the cervix to numb it and ensure the woman is pain-free during the procedure. The doctor may apply a solution containing acetic acid or vinegar to the cervix, which may cause a mild burning sensation. This solution highlights the abnormal regions in and around the cervix. The doctor then inserts an electrically charged loop of wire into the cervix. This loop is passed through all abnormal areas in the cervix to cut out a thin layer, thereby removing the abnormal tissue. A small piece (biopsy) of the removed tissue is sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. The biopsy results show if the abnormality is due to the presence of precancerous cells."
What is done after a LEEP?,"'The doctor will ask the woman to rest for a few minutes before she goes home the same day of the procedure.''The woman can wear a sanitary pad before leaving the doctor’s office because there may be mild bleeding after the procedure. It is normal to have some mild ''spotting'' followed by dark or black-colored discharge for several days.''The woman will usually have to avoid the following things for four weeks after the procedure''A woman who’s undergone a LEEP procedure should avoid excessive activity and rest as much as she can for 48 hours after the procedure.''She should avoid strenuous activities, such as jogging, heavy workouts and heavy lifting, for at least a week or as instructed by the doctor.''A woman can take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') for her ''cramps''.''A woman’s healthcare provider will tell her when to follow up for further treatment or care.' Douching Using tampons Having sex"
Does the LEEP carry any risks?,"'LEEP is a relatively safe procedure with minimal risk of complications. Rarely, there are chances that a woman may get''The doctor will discuss all these risks with the woman before the procedure. She should discuss any and all concerns she may have with her doctor.''A woman should call the doctor right away if she experiences any of the following after the procedure' Infection (treated by a short course of antibiotics) Bleeding Scarring in the cervix Trouble conceiving or getting pregnant Early labor Heavy vaginal bleeding (more than she experiences during her periods) Severe lower abdominal pain Fever Chills"
What are the benefits of an intrauterine device?,"'Intrauterine devices offer multiple advantages over other ''contraceptive'' methods, including hormonal pills and sterilization procedures. These include:' Long-lasting (3-10 years depending on the brand) with minimal efforts Hassle-free way of contraception with no need for daily compliance Reversible (easier to remove after insertion) One-time investment (you do not have to keep buying or stocking them from time to time as the case with oral contraceptive pills) Most effective option if you can neither take oral contraceptive pills nor undergo sterilization surgery Safe and suitable for immediate insertion after (within 10-20 minutes) delivery and abortion (accidental or planned) Safe during breastfeeding"
What are the types of intrauterine devices and how do they work?,"'Currently available IUDs are of two types:''Hormonal IUD:'' Hormonal IUDs release a specific amount of hormone every day. Depending on the hormone, these IUDs thicken the cervical ''mucus'' to prevent the sperm from reaching the uterus and/or inhibit the release of the egg (''ovulation'') from the ovaries. The different brands are:''Nonhormonal IUD: ''Copper IUD is the only available nonhormonal IUD under the brand name Paraguard. It is effective for a longer duration than most hormonal methods with its effects lasting for up to 12 years. This kind of IUD works by destroying the sperms when they come into contact with the metal copper. It also helps in preventing unwanted pregnancy if you get it inserted within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sex.' Skyla: Effective for up to 3 years. Liletta: Effective for up to 5 years. Kyleena: Effective for up to 5 years. Mirena: Effective for 5 years."
How is an intrauterine device inserted and removed?,"'Your doctor will ask you several questions to see if you are fit for an IUD insertion. Generally, there are only a few factors that could restrict you from getting an IUD. These are''Let your doctor know if you are pregnant or think you could be pregnant because IUD cannot be inserted during pregnancy.''The doctor can insert IUD in the office setting. The insertion procedure takes less than 5 minutes. You will have to lie down on the back with legs spread wide apart.''You may experience some mild cramping and bleeding for a few days after the insertion. You can take over the counter ''pain'' medication, such as ''Ibuprofen'' or ''Acetaminophen'' before coming to the office or after the procedure.''After the IUD is in place in your uterus, you can continue doing any kind of physical activity, such as ''swimming'', jogging, heavy weightlifting, and even have sex after 24 hours.''You can get your IUD removed by requesting the doctor or at the time of its expiration date, approximately 3-10 years later depending on the type of IUD. Its removal takes about 2-3 minutes.' Sexually transmitted disease (STD) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) An allergy to the material in the IUD (such as copper) An abnormal uterus Cancer of the reproductive organs"
How is a Bakri balloon placed?,"'A Bakri balloon is used in the management of excessive bleeding after ''childbirth'' (postpartum hemorrhage). Bakri balloon placement after vaginal delivery involves the following''Bakri balloon placement after Cesarean delivery involves''Effectiveness of the balloon is measured using a tamponade test. This test is considered positive when sufficient hemostasis (cessation of blood loss) is achieved following the inflation of the balloon. Using a vaginal pack helps to maintain the balloon in the vagina and provides compression to the lower part of the uterus.''The physician may also recommend antibiotics to reduce the risk of infections.' Before inserting the balloon, the physician ensures to empty the patient’s bladder by placing a Foley catheter. The physician inspects the uterine cavity (inside of the womb) to ensure that it is clear of placental remnants. Next, the physician cleanses the vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution, such as povidone-iodine. After cleansing with an antiseptic solution, the physician grasps the cervix with forceps and inserts the balloon into the uterine cavity with the help of ultrasound. The entire portion of the balloon is pushed above the internal os (opening of the uterus). After the correct placement of the balloon, the physician inflates the balloon with a sterile saline solution using the enclosed syringe. To achieve the tamponade effect (maximum blockage), the physician applies gentle traction at the base of the balloon. The physician achieves the traction by placing weights not exceeding 500 g at the base of the balloon. A fluid-collecting bag is used to monitor hemostasis (stopping of blood flow). The balloon should remain inflated for 12 to 24 hours. After the Cesarean delivery, the physician inserts the end of the catheter through the open uterine incision until it reaches the cervix and then advances it into the vagina. The physician closes the uterine incision while taking special care not to damage the balloon with the suturing needle. The physician inflates the balloon under direct examination."
What is a Bakri balloon procedure?,'Bakri balloon placement is a minimally invasive procedure to control uterine bleeding while conserving the mother’s child-bearing capacity. It is an effective and easy method of controlling uterine bleeding. The main advantages of Bakri balloon placement include''The complications of Bakri balloon include' Easy insertion of the balloon Easy removal without the need for an additional surgery Effectiveness of the device can be quickly determined Conservatively manages blood loss after childbirth Gives time for the physician to prepare for aggressive treatments Uterine rupture (tear in the uterus) Balloon prolapse (slipping down of the balloon from its original position) Endometritis (inflammation of the endometrium) Blockage of blood supply in a blood vessel or heart when inflated with air or carbon dioxide
When is Bakri balloon placement indicated?,"'Bakri balloon placement is useful to control postpartum hemorrhage. Postpartum hemorrhage is a condition characterized by blood loss of more than 500 mL after vaginal ''childbirth'' or more than 1000 mL after Cesarean delivery within 24 hours. It is a second-line treatment for severe postpartum hemorrhage after the failure of other therapy and medications. It is indicated in''Bakri balloon placement should be avoided in' Uterine atony in acute postpartum hemorrhage (failure of uterine contractions adequately following the delivery). Cesarean delivery due to placenta previa (the placenta covering the opening in the mother’s cervix) and a low-lying placenta. Acute or recurrent uterine inversion (failure of detachment of the placenta from the uterus). Secondary postpartum hemorrhage (postpartum hemorrhage that occurs 24 hours to 12 weeks after delivery). Infection of the vagina, uterus or cervix. Allergy to the components of the Bakri balloon. Suspected rupturing of the uterus. Retained products of conception."
What is a bullectomy?,'Bullectomy'' is the surgical removal of a bulla. ''Bulla or bullae'' is a pathological condition of the ''lungs'' caused by ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD''). Bulla of the lung develops when ''emphysema'' (''COPD'') damages the lungs to an extent that air pockets start developing.\xa0''These air pockets increase in size and apply pressure on the lungs since it starts occupying the space within the chest ''cavity''. This results in symptoms like pressure in the chest and difficulty ''breathing''. A bulla that occupies more than 30% of the chest is called a ''giant bulla.' 
When is a bullectomy done?,"'Bullectomy is indicated in ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') and other conditions like ''alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency'', Marfan’s syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, ''cocaine'', intravenous ''drug abuse'', ''sarcoidosis'', and ''HIV''.''These conditions typically present with the following:' Difficulty breathing Chest pain Repeated infection Hemoptysis (coughing blood) Wheezing (whistling sound while breathing)"
When should a bullectomy not be done?,'Contraindications for bullectomy include the following:' Significant comorbid conditions Poorly defined bullae on chest imaging Pulmonary hypertension
How is a bullectomy performed?,"'As with any other surgery, there are a few important parts involved with undergoing a bullectomy.' The surgeon performs a complete physical assessment along with radiological tests (X-ray, computed tomography scan, angiography) and laboratory tests.  The patient is asked to quit smoking before surgery, as smoking delays the healing process. The patient will also have to fast for at least 12 hours before surgery. Bullectomy is typically performed under general anesthesia. The choice of surgical technique depends on the size and number of bullae to be removed which is based on the surgeon’s discretion.  The main options are video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy/sternotomy.  VATS is less invasive. Small incisions are made on the skin above the chest cavity to insert a thoracoscope (camera with a light source) and surgical instruments.  VATS also allows quicker recovery and is associated with lesser postoperative pain than open thoracotomy. It can be used for bilateral disease as well. The patient is administered painkillers and antibiotics.  The patient is required to stay in the hospital for three to seven days.  Pain, bruising, and swelling may be present in the postoperative period, which usually resolves in one to two weeks. Complete recovery takes a few weeks."
What are the complications of a bullectomy surgery?,"'Like any major surgery, bullectomy has a risk of complications.\xa0''Some common complications encountered are:''Common cardiac complications are as follows:''Other complications include the following:' Air leakage Respiratory failure Pneumonia (lung infection) Bleeding Atelectasis (collapse of the lung) Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat/abnormal heart rhythm) Myocardial infarction (heart attack) Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Blood clot in deep-lying veins Pulmonary embolism (PE): Blood clot in the lungs Pain and/or infection at the incision site Reaction to anesthesia"

Why is a cervical cerclage done? ,"'The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that opens to the vagina. During pregnancy, the rigid cervix helps to keep the fetus inside the uterus. As the pregnancy progresses, the cervix softens in preparation for birth. If the cervix does not stay closed until the baby is full-term, a miscarriage or premature birth may occur. The cervical cerclage may help to keep the cervix closed until the baby is considered full-term. Women with a weak or incompetent cervix are candidates for cervical cerclage. This condition may cause the cervix to dilate painlessly without contractions before the baby is full-term, typically between 16-24 weeks of pregnancy. Causes of a weak cervix may include the following:' Women with a history of premature delivery (18-22-week delivery) Women with a short cervix, seen on an ultrasound Women with prior surgery or damage to the cervix Daughters of women who took DES, a hormone used to prevent miscarriage"
What are the risks involved in cervical cerclage?,"'The risks involved in cervical cerclage include:' Anesthesia risks (headache, vomiting, dizziness) Bleeding Infection Injury to the bladder Injury to the cervix Amniotic sac rupture (water breaking in pregnant women) Injury to cervix and scarring Inflammation of fetal membranes causing bacterial infection of the uterus and amniotic fluid It sometimes is not possible to put the stitch in, for example, if your cervix is already too short or too far open. The stitch may not always work, and you might still experience a late miscarriage or preterm birth. A cervical stitch does not increase your chances of needing induction of labor or a cesarean section."
What care should I take after cervical cerclage?,"'The patient may return to normal activities within a few days of the procedure and may need to have regular visits with your doctor.''If an abdominal cerclage is done, the patient may need another operation to remove the stitches put. The removal of stitches is done during the subsequent cesarean section.' The first few days after surgery, the patient may need to rest most of the day. Generally, the patient may return to work within a few days if the cerclage was electively done. If it was performed as an emergency procedure, the patient may need to be out of work for an extended period. All sexual activity and breast stimulation should be stopped if the cerclage was performed under emergency conditions. The patient may visit the doctor every 1-3 weeks and the cervix may be checked more frequently. Ultrasounds will tell the doctor if your cervix is getting shorter but may not be able to tell if your cervix is dilating. It is important not to miss an appointment. Patients should call their doctor if they experience below cramping, contractions, or tightening Pressure in the lower back, abdomen, or backache Excessive vaginal bleeding or discharge Foul-smelling vaginal discharge Water break"
What is cesarean delivery?,"'Cesarean delivery is the surgical ''delivery of a baby'' by making an incision in the mother’s abdominal wall and uterus. Although cesarean delivery is generally safe, it should be performed during certain circumstances. About 30% of all ''babies'' in the United States are born through cesarean delivery.''There are certain disadvantages of cesarean delivery over vaginal delivery. They are as follows:' Longer recovery period Prolonged hospitalization Uterine scarring, making further pregnancies riskier "
Why is cesarean delivery needed?,'Cesarean delivery might be planned due to a medical reason or performed due to any medical emergency. Cesarean delivery might be recommended in''An emergency cesarean delivery may be indicated in the following situations:''Cesarean delivery should be avoided when' Cephalopelvic disproportion (a condition where the baby’s head or body is too large to pass through the mother’s pelvis). Previous cesarean birth (attempting vaginal birth may cause the uterus to rupture). Multiple pregnancies. Placenta previa (a condition where the placenta covers partially or fully the opening of the cervix). Transverse lie (the baby lies in a horizontal or sideways position of the uterus). Breech presentation (the baby is positioned to deliver feet or bottom first). Mothers with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Mothers with infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or herpes. Fetal distress (a condition where the fetal brain starts experiencing oxygen shortage) Failure of labor to progress Placental abruption (the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus) Cord compression (the umbilical cord is tangled around the baby’s neck or body) Prolapsed cord (the umbilical cord comes first before the baby) The mother has a severe pulmonary disease. There is a defect in the child that may lead to their death.
What are the complications of cesarean delivery?,'Cesarean delivery involves some risks that include:''Subsequent pregnancies may have an improper placental position due to a uterine ''scar'' from cesarean delivery done at present.' Infection Bleeding Embolism (a blood clot that breaks into the bloodstream) Fetal injury Injury to the bowel or bladder Tear in the uterine wall Risks from general anesthesia Abnormalities of the placenta in the consequent pregnancy Infection in the uterus Wound infection Trouble urinating or urinary tract infection Blood clots
What is coronary CT angiography?,"'Coronary ''computerized tomography'' ''angiography'' (CCTA)'' is a ''heart'' scan or imaging test that helps diagnose plaque buildup and consequent narrowing of the coronary arteries (the blood vessels that supply the heart).\xa0''During a CCTA scan,'' you may receive an ''iodine''-containing material (contrast) as an intravenous injection to ensure the best possible images of the coronary blood vessels.''It uses powerful ''X-rays'' and produces multiple cross-sectional images or pictures of the inside of the body which can be viewed on a computer monitor, printed on film or by a 3D printer or transferred to a CD or DVD.\xa0''The procedure is performed to diagnose many heart conditions. These include:' Diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) Diagnosis of narrowing of the existing stent in cases of previous stent placement Evaluation of coronary bypass graft patency"
How is a coronary CT angiography done?,"'A coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is generally done in the doctor’s office or hospital. The procedure, on average, takes 15 minutes to one hour to complete. CCTA is quite similar to a normal ''CT scan'', the difference being the CT scanner speed and the use of a heart monitor to determine the heart rate.' You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for a few hours.  You must tell your doctor of any medications you are on or allergies you may have.  You need to inform your doctor of any medical conditions or illnesses you may have. You may be asked to avoid diet pills, Viagra (or any similar medicines), and caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, or sodas for 12 to 24 hours before the test. The night before the procedure, you may be given medications (e.g., beta-blockers) to optimize the quality of the scan.  You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Your doctor will perform your physical examination and explain the procedure in detail. You may be asked to shave your chest hair. You may be asked to give your written consent for the procedure. You may need to wear a hospital gown. Metal objects such as jewelry, dentures, hairpins, and eyeglasses should be removed. The CT scanner machine is typically a large, donut-shaped structure with a short tunnel in the center.  You will lie on a narrow examination table that slides in and out of the short tunnel. The X-ray tube and electronic X-ray detectors rotate around you in a ring, called a gantry. A technologist operates the scanner and monitors your exam in a separate control room from where they can hear and talk to you via a speaker and a microphone.  The technologist will clean small areas on your chest and place small, sticky discs (electrodes) attached to an electrocardiography monitor.  They will insert an intravenous line in your arm to administer contrast material during the procedure.  You may be given other medications like beta-blockers and nitroglycerine to improve visualization. You may be asked to raise your arms over your head during the exam to improve image quality. The examination table will move several times during the test. You may be asked many times to stay still and hold your breath for a few seconds during the scanning.  You will be asked to wait until the technologist verifies that the images are of good quality. Your intravenous line is removed. The radiologist interprets your results and issues a report."
Is CT coronary angiography better?,"'CT ''coronary angiography'' or CCTA is a better procedure as compared to other imaging studies for the heart blood vessels as it has many benefits:' CCTA is not invasive (instruments are not introduced inside the body) and thus has fewer complications and faster recovery. The imaging provides a clear view of bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels at the same time.  It provides very detailed images of many types of tissue. The examination is fast and simple. It is cost-effective. The imaging is less disturbed by patient movement, unlike magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike MRI, CCTA can be performed if you have an implanted medical device of any kind. No radiation remains in the body after the CCTA examination. There are no immediate side effects."
What happens if the fetal heart rate is not normal?,'If the baby’s heart rate is not normal doctor may follow the below steps:' May give mother oxygen supplementation to breathe May change the mother’s position Start intravenous (IV) fluids Give medicine to stop or slow the contractions or to lessen their strength Deliver the baby right away with forceps or vacuum extraction Deliver the baby by cesarean delivery
What are the possible risks involved during attaching the fetal scalp electrode?,"'The risks of the procedure include:' The electrode may cause an infection in the baby Improper placement of the electrode may injure the baby The catheter put into the uterus may cause bleeding if it goes through the placenta or the womb wall, or it may cause an infection in the uterus."
When does a doctor recommend the fetal scalp electrode?,"'Doctors usually recommend a fetal scalp electrode due to the below reasons:' If the mother has a problem during pregnancy or labor, the doctor may need continuous fetal heart rate monitoring to observe the baby’s condition When the doctor wants to measure the strength of your contractions When the external monitor (placed on the mother’s belly) is not recording accurately When it is a high-risk pregnancy When the mother has an illness, such as diabetes or high blood pressure When the mother is given the drug Oxytocin that helps stimulate and strengthen the contractions"
When is the fetal scalp electrode not recommended?,"'The membrane and fluid, called the bag of water or ''amniotic fluid'', surrounding the baby must be broken to put the instruments into the uterus. For this reason, there are times when the doctor may not use fetal scalp electrode:' When the placenta is covering the opening to the womb (a condition called placenta previa) When the baby is too high in the womb and breaking the bag of waters could be dangerous When the mother has a severe infection, such as herpes or HIV, the doctor may not use a fetal scalp electrode. Using an internal monitor could increase the chance of spreading the infection to the baby."
What is a fractional flow reserve measurement?,"'A fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a procedure done during ''cardiac catheterization'' to estimate the degree of blockage in the coronary arteries. It is a guide wire-based procedure that determines the ratio between the maximum achievable blood flow in a diseased blood vessel (coronary artery) and normal maximum flow.\xa0''An FFR of one is accepted as normal, whereas values lower than 0.75 generally indicate a ''heart attack''.''An FFR is measured at the time of ''coronary angiogram'' or cardiac catheterization using a pressure wire. If an FFR does not reveal any significant obstruction, the physician will prefer medical therapy.\xa0''In short, an FFR may be used to determine the course of therapy in patients with abnormal narrowing of the coronary artery (coronary stenosis).' "
When is a fractional flow reserve measurement indicated?,"'A fractional flow reserve measurement is indicated:''However, individuals with ''asthma'' should avoid undergoing the fractional flow reserve procedure.' To identify the extent of coronary stenosis (the narrowing of blood vessels) To identify the culprit block in the multiple blood vessels To identify the exact location of the block in the case of an unclear angiographic image To determine if a particular obstruction requires an angioplasty or a coronary bypass graft (CABG)"
How is a fractional flow reserve measured?," The physician will explain the risks and benefits of the procedure to the patients. You need to sign an informed consent before the procedure. You should clarify all your concerns with the physician regarding the procedure. The physician may perform a cardiac catheterization to identify the need for a fractional flow reserve. There are some potential discomforts associated with the procedure such asShortness of breath,Chest pain,Warmth in the area,Abnormal sweating andRacing heart. Shortness of breath, Chest pain, Warmth in the area, Abnormal sweating and Racing heart. Blood thinners would be given to you before the surgery. Your physician would ask you to stop medications such as theophylline 12 hours before the surgery. The physician performs a fractional flow reserve under sedation. You will lie flat on the operating table, then the physician inserts a thin guide wire through a catheter during an angiogram. Once the special guide wire crosses the block, the physician infuses a medicine such as adenosine into the blood vessel that increases blood flow (hyperemic). This will measure the flow and pressure of the blood.  The fractional flow reserve value is displayed on the monitor attached. The higher the fractional flow reserve value, the lower the chances of any abnormality. Usually, a fractional flow reserve value of one is accepted as normal, whereas values lower than 0.75 generally indicate a heart attack."
What are the complications of a fractional flow reserve procedure?,"'The risk associated with a fractional flow reserve is low, but complications are associated with cardiac catheterization. These include' Coronary vessel perforation (hole in the blood vessels) Embolism (diffused blood clots in the blood vessels) Infection in the site Spasm of the blood vessel Kidney failure Heart attack Stroke Serious arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) Death"
How is a lumbar facetectomy performed?,"'A lumbar facetectomy is a surgical procedure to remove facet joints partially or completely in the ''lumbar vertebrae'' of the low back. Vertebrae are the chain of bones that form the backbone, which protects the spinal cord. The vertebrae are attached together by facet joints, which provide stability and flexibility to the backbone.''An orthopedic spine surgeon performs the lumbar facetectomy, typically with the patient under general anesthesia. A tube is inserted into the ''airway'' (''endotracheal intubation'') to assist ''breathing''. The surgeon may administer regional or local anesthesia to numb the operative area, if the patient is unable or unwilling to undergo general anesthesia. The procedure may take approximately two hours.' "
What happens during the lumbar facetectomy procedure?,"'Prior to the surgery, the patient''The patient lies on a special table that allows X-rays to pass through, either flat on their stomach or over a frame that arches their back up, depending on the requirement.''The anesthesiologist''The surgeon''The patient is' Undergoes blood and urine tests Undergoes imaging tests such as 3D CT scan, MRI and X-rays Is given antibiotics to prevent infection Must check with the surgeon before taking any regular medications Must inform the doctor of any allergies Must avoid eating and drinking for eight hours before the procedure Attaches an IV line for administration of anesthesia, medications and fluids. Performs endotracheal intubation and administers anesthesia through the IV line. Monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient’s nerve functions may be continuously monitored during the operation with techniques such as electromyography. Uses continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) for guidance during the procedure. Makes a skin incision in the midline of the back or a little lateral to the midline, over the affected vertebra. Cuts through and retracts the tissue and muscle to expose the facet joint. Removes the ligament and cartilage around the joint. Cuts and removes the facet joint partially or entirely as required. May remove any herniated disc tissue or parts of bone compressing the nerve. May fuse the affected vertebrae together with bone graft, pedicle screws and a rod if the facet joints are removed entirely. Closes the incision with sutures.

What is a pulmonary function test?,"'Pulmonary function test or lung function test is a group of tests that check the workings of the ''lungs''. They are noninvasive test which can determine the functional status of the lung cells and how well the lungs\xa0are working.\xa0''The tests look for:''There are several types of lung tests. They include:''These tests may be used singly or together, depending on specific symptoms or conditions.' How much air can lungs hold? How well can air move in and out of the lungs? How well the lungs move oxygen the into bloodstream.  Spirometry: The most common type of lung function test. It measures how much and how quickly air can move in and out of the lungs. Lung volume test: It is also known as body plethysmography. This test measures the amount of air an individual can hold in the lungs and the amount of air that remains after exhalation (breathing out). Gas diffusion test: This test measures how oxygen and other gases move from the lungs to the bloodstream. Exercise stress test: This test looks at how exercise affects lung function."
How is a pulmonary function test performed?,"'Below are the steps for the most common four\xa0types of lung function tests.''For a spirometry test:''For a lung volume (body plethysmography) test:''For a gas diffusion test:''For an ''exercise'' test:\xa0' The patient is asked to sit on a chair and a soft clip will be put on the nose. This is done so that patient breathes through the mouth, rather than your nose. The patient is asked to place lips tightly around the mouthpiece and breathe in and out as instructed.  The spirometer will measure the amount and rate of airflow over a period of time. The patient asked to sit in a clear, airtight room that looks like a telephone booth. The patient may wear a nose clip and place lips around a mouthpiece connected to a machine. The patient is asked to breathe in and out as instructed. The pressure changes inside the room help measure lung volume. The patient may wear a mouthpiece connected to a machine. They may be asked to inhale (breathe in) a very small, non-dangerous amount of carbon monoxide or other types of gas. Measurements will either be taken as they breathe in and out. The test can show how effective the lungs are functioning by moving gases to the bloodstream. The patient may be asked to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill. They may be attached to monitors and machines that will measure blood oxygen, blood pressure, and heartbeat. This test shows how well the lungs perform during exercise."
Why would my doctor order a pulmonary function test?,"'Your doctor may order pulmonary function tests to:''Testing pulmonary function tests can help doctors diagnose\xa0other conditions\xa0such as:' Find the cause of breathing problems Diagnose and monitor chronic lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema See if lung disease treatments are working Check lung function before surgery Check whether exposure to chemicals or other substances in the home or workplace has caused lung damage. Thickened, stretched, or enlarged airways Thickening or hardening of your connective tissues (scleroderma) The weakness of the muscles in the wall of the chest Diseases of the air exchange units of the lung (alveolar membrane)"
What do the results of the pulmonary function test mean?,"'If a patient has abnormal lung function test results they might have a lung disease. There are two main types of lung diseases that can be diagnosed with a lung function test:' Obstructive diseases: These diseases cause airways to become narrow, making it hard for air to flow out of the lungs. Obstructive lung diseases include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Restrictive diseases: In these diseases, the lungs or chest muscles aren't able to expand enough. This reduces airflow and the ability to send oxygen into the bloodstream. Restrictive lung disorders include scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Mixed pattern: Sometimes, a disease may be a combination of obstructive and restrictive patterns, this may need a different management protocol."
What is a shoulder arthrocentesis?,"'Joint aspiration'' (arthrocentesis) of the shoulder is a diagnostic procedure involving the extraction and analysis of the synovial fluid in the joints. It is an important component in diagnosing ''arthritis'' and differentiating an inflammatory arthritis from noninflammatory arthritis. An arthrocentesis can also be performed therapeutically (for pain relief, drainage of fluid, or injection of medications).''Any joint in the body can be aspirated. Joint aspiration is a relatively quick and inexpensive procedure to perform. It can be done in a clinic or hospital. It can be done by any physician, physician’s assistant or nurse who has the training and equipment.' "
When is a shoulder arthrocentesis done?,"'A shoulder arthrocentesis may be indicated for any patient with inflamed shoulder joints who does not have an established diagnosis. Inflamed joints are recognized by being red, warm, tender, swollen, and painful during movement. Some conditions that may require joint aspiration and analysis to establish diagnosis are as follows:''Joint aspiration may be performed as a treatment in certain conditions:' Monoarticular arthritis (inflammation of the joints) Septic arthritis (infection of the joints) Joint effusion (swelling due to fluid accumulation in the body) Intra-articular fracture (fractures that involve the joint space)  Crystal arthropathy (accumulation of calcium crystals in the joints and surrounding areas) Repeated aspirations can be part of the management of the septic joint to relieve discomfort and prevent joint damage. Aspiration can be considered in cases of hemarthrosis (blood in the joints) to prevent adhesions. Aspiration can be accompanied by injecting intra-articular medications such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid into the joints. Steroid injections reduce joint inflammation and pain and preserve joint structure and function. Hyaluronic acid lubricates the joints, decreases impact, delays joint aging, and reduces pain and stiffness."
When should a shoulder arthrocentesis not be done?,'A shoulder arthrocentesis should be done with caution in patients with a ''bleeding disorder'' or those on ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs''. Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may be advised to stop the medications few days before the procedure and resume after the procedure.' 
What are the complications of a shoulder arthrocentesis?,"'A shoulder arthrocentesis is a relatively safe procedure, and complications are rare. Common complications patients usually face are localized bleeding, pain and swelling and sometimes a reaction to local anesthesia. Infection of the joints may occur, which is called ''septic arthritis''.\xa0''If other medications such as steroids are simultaneously injected, it may cause localized shrinkage or hypopigmentation of the skin. Long-term use of steroid injections may cause systemic side effects such as ''weight gain'', poor bone health, puffy face, ''stretch marks'', and ''easy bruising''.' "
What is stereotactic needle biopsy? ,"'Stereotactic needle biopsy is a well-tolerated, widely available medical procedure that involves the extraction of breast tissues using a needle to examine any abnormalities. It is a special ''mammography'' machine that uses ''x-rays'' to guide the physician to detect any abnormality. Stereotactic needle biopsy is less invasive than surgical biopsy and leaves little to no scarring. They are also an excellent way to analyze calcium deposits or tiny masses, which are not detected in ultrasound.' "
When is stereotactic needle biopsy indicated?,"'A stereotactic ''breast biopsy'' is indicated, when the mammogram shows a breast abnormality, such as:' A suspicious mass Microcalcifications (a tiny cluster of small calcium deposits) Distortion in the structure of the breast tissue An area of abnormal tissue change A new mass or area of calcium deposits in the previous surgical site"
When should be the stereotactic breast biopsy avoided?,'Stereotactic biopsy should be avoided in the following conditions:' The lesion is located near the chest wall or directly behind the nipple Mammogram shows only a vague abnormality Extremely thin breasts Diffused calcium deposits spread throughout the breast
What are the different types of a stereotactic needle biopsy?,"'The different types of stereotactic needle biopsy include:' Core-needle biopsy: A small cylinder (core) needle is used instead of fine needles to extract a core tissue. Wild-bore needle biopsy: The needle is attached to a spring-loaded tool to pass quickly through the lesions. Vacuum-assisted core biopsy: The needle is positioned using an ultrasonographic, and this is mainly useful in the extraction of lesions less than 15 mm or for removing additional tissue."
What to expect after a stereotactic breast biopsy?,"'You may experience some discomfort after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity for at least 24 hours after the biopsy. You may experience swelling or ''bruising'' following your biopsy for which the physician may recommend ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' relievers or ''cold'' packs. Contact the physician, if you observe any of these symptoms:' Excessive swelling Bleeding Drainage Redness Warmth in breast"

What is a sternotomy?,"'A sternotomy is a surgical incision made through the breastbone (sternum) to access the thoracic ''cavity''. A median sternotomy is the primary approach used for major surgeries in the thoracic region, as it offers a wide view.' Median sternotomy: an incision down the midline of the entire sternum. Hemisternotomy: an incision in the midline of half the sternum on the upper or lower part. Clamshell sternotomy (bilateral thoracosternotomy): a partial sternotomy with a horizontal incision on both sides of the sternum in the fifth or sixth intercostal space (space between the ribs) with the ribs retracted for a wider view. Hemiclamshell sternotomy (thoracosternotomy): a partial sternotomy with a horizontal incision on either side of the sternum in the fifth or sixth intercostal space. Modified thoracosternotomy: a clamshell sternotomy with a modified sternal incision closure technique of the sternum with crossed wires."
Why is a median sternotomy performed?,'Median sternotomy'': for surgeries in the chest involving''Upper hemisternotomy'': for surgeries on aortic and mitral valves.''Lower hemisternotomy'': for coronary artery bypass for arteries that need approach from the lower sternum.''Emergency resternotomy'': when there is hemorrhage or fluid buildup (tamponade) following a cardiac surgery.''Redo sternotomy'': when the ''aorta'' or heart is adhered to the sternum.' Lungs Heart Esophagus Blood vessels The following procedures may require a median sternotomy: Open heart surgeries such as Heart transplant Coronary artery bypass grafting Corrective surgery for congenital heart defects Lung transplant Surgery for goiter growth in the chest region Surgery to reconstruct the esophagus (esophagectomy) Removal of large tumors in the thoracic cavity (mediastinal tumors) Neurosurgical procedures in the thoracic region for treatment of Fracture Abnormal tissue growth (neoplasm) Bone cysts Bone infection (osteomyelitis) Spinal tumors Vertebral disc space inflammation (discitis) Herniation of the disc’s core (nucleus pulposus)
How is a sternotomy done?,'The patient may need hospitalization of 7-10 days depending on the kind of surgery required with sternotomy. A thoracic surgeon performs a sternotomy under general anesthesia.' The patient undergoes blood and imaging tests. The patient must avoid eating or drinking for 8 hours prior. The patient must check with the doctor before taking any regular medication The patient must inform the surgeon about any allergies. An anesthesiologist administers general anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions throughout the procedure. The doctor may insert a tube through the patient’s nose or throat to maintain the airway clear and ensure oxygen supply. The surgeon may attach defibrillator pads in order to prepare for the risk of irregular heartbeat. The surgeon makes an incision in the skin and tissue along the sternum’s midline. The surgeon uses a saw to cut through the sternum to expose the thoracic cavity. The surgeon performs the required surgery. The surgeon usually places chest drains before closing the incision. The surgeon uses titanium wires to bind the sternum together or may use a titanium plate with screws. An advanced development in sternal closure is using kryptonite bone cement to glue the sternum together. The incision is closed with sutures. The patient will be administered painkillers and monitored for several hours in the recovery room after the doctor withdraws anesthesia.
How long does a sternotomy take to heal?,"'Generally, it takes the sternum about six weeks to heal after a sternotomy. The patient must follow certain sternal precautions such as avoiding:' lifting more than five to eight pounds pushing or pulling with the arms reaching both arms overhead reaching the arms behind the back reaching both arms out to the side"

How is a sural nerve block performed?,"'The doctor' The patient lies on their stomach with the ankle elevated by a pillow or lies on their back with the ankle rotated internally. The doctor performs a physical examination to assess the patient’s muscle, nerve, and circulation functions in the lower leg and sensation in the calf and the little toe. May apply a tourniquet in the calf or above the ankle to expose the vein (saphenous vein) which lies adjacent to the sural nerve. Marks the injection site between the Achilles tendon and the bony projection (malleolus) on the outer ankle. Sterilizes the injection site with an antiseptic solution. May use ultrasound guidance during the procedure for accurate positioning of the needle. Inserts the needle and injects a small amount of anesthetic into the tissue under the skin to raise a bump (wheal). Advances the needle through the skin wheal towards the lateral malleolus. Aspirates the syringe to be certain it is not inside a blood vessel. Slowly injects the anesthetic close to the sural nerve avoiding direct contact with the nerve. Withdraws the needle and massages the injection site gently to help the solution spread in the tissues. Waits for up to 10 minutes for the sural nerve block to take effect. If there is a fracture and hematoma, may also administer an injection into the hematoma."
How long does a sural nerve block last?,'The duration of a sural nerve block depends on the anesthetic agent used. Approximate durations of a sural nerve block’s effect are:''Post-procedural ''pain'' can be relieved with oral painkillers.'

What is amniotomy?,"'Amniotomy is a procedure to break a ''pregnant'' woman’s amniotic sac. It is also called an artificial rupture of membranes or breaking water inside a pregnant woman. The amniotic sac is a pouch of fluid that surrounds and protects the baby. Breaking of the amniotic sac releases the chemicals that signal the body to begin or fasten ''labor contractions''. Amniotomy is done for the below reasons:' To start the delivery process To speed up the delivery process if it has stalled or slowed for several hours To attach a monitoring device to the baby’s head and record the heartbeat in a lengthy or high-risk labor and delivery To examine the amniotic fluid for fetal stool, this may indicate fetal distress"
What are the possible risks of amniotomy?,"'Amniotomy involves risks and possible complications. Complications may become serious in some cases. Complications can develop during the procedure or after some days:' Excessive vaginal bleeding Fetal blood loss: This may be a life-threatening complication needing emergency cesarean delivery to save the fetus. Umbilical cord prolapse: This occurs when the umbilical cord comes out of the uterus before the baby. This can compress the umbilical cord between the baby and the mother and cut off blood supply to the baby. Umbilical cord prolapse may require an emergency cesarean delivery. Infection in the mother or the baby: Once a woman’s membranes have ruptured, either via natural or artificial means, the fetus becomes vulnerable to infections that can ascend from the vagina into the uterus. This may lead to conditions, such as placentitis and chorioamnionitis (which can result in lifelong disabilities if improperly handled). Injury to the baby, especially the head of the baby."
What is an esophageal manometry?,"'The ''esophagus'' is the muscular tube that connects the throat and the stomach. The esophagus moves the food down to the stomach with wave-like contractions initiated by swallowing. This process is known as peristalsis.''A valve-like ring of muscles at the top of the esophagus (upper esophageal sphincter) ensures that the food doesn’t enter the windpipe (trachea).''Another ring of muscles at the bottom of the esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter) opens to let the food pass into the stomach and closes to prevent it from coming back up along with stomach acid.''Esophageal manometry'' is a procedure performed with a thin, flexible, pressure-sensitive tube. The procedure tests the function of the esophagus and the esophageal sphincters by measuring the pressure they generate.' "
Why is an esophageal manometry done?,"'Esophageal manometry is used to determine if the esophageal muscles are functioning normally. Esophageal manometry is usually performed to find the cause of symptoms such as:''Esophageal manometry is generally performed after tests such as ''X-rays'' and ''endoscopy'' fail to demonstrate if the esophagus has any''Esophageal manometry helps in the diagnosis of conditions such as''Esophageal manometry may also be performed' Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Painful swallowing (odynophagia) Feeling of food being stuck in the throat Nausea Heartburn or reflux Non-cardiac chest pain obstruction narrowing inflammation Achalasia -- dysfunction of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) Distal esophageal spasm -- uncoordinated contractions Jackhammer (hypercontractile) esophagus -- extra powerful contractions Absent or ineffective peristalsis Hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter Systemic diseases such as scleroderma, which can paralyze the esophagus Prior to surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Evaluation post-surgery for GERD or achalasia  Esophageal manometry is not advised in patients who are unresponsive or unconscious are unable to follow instructions have known or suspected upper esophageal obstruction or tumors"

The doctor applies a numbing lubricant to the nostril. The doctor inserts a thin pressure-sensitive tube gently through the nostril, pharynx, down the esophagus through the LES into the stomach. The patient must follow instructions from the doctor and swallow tiny sips of water at intervals. After the tube insertion the patient will lie down. The manometry machine will record the pressure readings from various points on the tube for the doctor to interpret. The doctor will slowly withdraw the tube. The patient will be able to leave immediately after the procedure. The patient can resume a regular diet after the procedure."
What are the limitations of esophageal manometry?,"'Esophageal manometry is a useful test but has certain limitations. Because ''swallowing problems'' and spasms do not occur all the time, there is no certainty that the problems will occur during the test, hence the results may not be conclusive for a diagnosis.' "
Is it painful when you have an esophageal manometry?,"'Esophageal manometry is generally not painful. During the insertion of the tube some may feel''Rarely, some patients may ''cough'' or vomit during the insertion of the tube.' discomfort in the nose and throat gagging sensation watery eyes"

What is external ultrasound-assisted liposuction?,"'External ''ultrasound''-assisted ''liposuction'' (EUAL) is a technique by which the fat cells around the abdomen or thighs are disrupted. EUAL uses high-frequency ultrasonic fields to prepare the fat cells for surgical removal by liposuction.''The advantages of using high-frequency and high-intensity external ultrasound before liposuction are as follows:''Other methods of liposuction are:' Enhanced fat extraction Decreased patient discomfort Decreased blood loss Negotiates scar tissue that other kinds of liposuction can’t penetrate Suction-assisted liposuction: This is the traditional method of liposuction in which the surgeon removes fat cells by inserting tube (cannula) connected to a vacuum pressure unit. The surgeon directs the cannula through tiny incisions into areas to be suctioned. Power-assisted liposuction: In this technique, a cannula with a back-and-forth motion tip passes through the tissue to suck out fat and scar tissue."
Why is EUAL done?," EUAL is beneficial in patients with fat concentrated around arms, thighs, hips, and buttocks. EUAL, in conjunction with other procedures, may help in treating extremely obese patients. EUAL is also helpful in removing more fibrous areas, which cannot be removed by liposuction alone. It helps access fat through scar tissue. EUAL is also helpful in reducing large male breasts (gynecomastia). It's safe in body contouring. EUAL is effective in liposuction of thighs."
Who should not undergo EUAL?, Patients with poor general health and chronic conditions should avoid this surgery. Patients with an extreme level of obesity should not undergo this surgery.
How is the EUAL procedure performed?," Consult the surgeon and discuss your goals, the options, risks, benefits, and costs. Your doctor will ask to restrict certain foods and limit alcohol consumption. You will describe your medications, including over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, and dietary supplements. You must undergo some laboratory tests to detect any underlying problems. Your surgeon will describe the procedure and get your informed consent. The areas to be addressed will be marked by the surgeon. Antibiotics are administered one hour before the surgery. Your surgeon might administer local or general anesthesia, depending on the areas to be corrected. The site is sterilized with povidone-iodine or betadine. Your surgeon will use a EUAL machine to disrupt the fat cells in the areas to be corrected. A transducer attached to the machine is placed on the site, which is moved in continuous circular strokes to apply the energy. Your doctor may prescribe acetaminophen and antibiotics for a few days after the surgery. You may note some leakage after the surgery. For high-impact sports you must wait for two weeks. Patients should wear compression garments continuously for two to four weeks. The practitioner may ask you to do light exercises or walking within a few days of the procedure."
What are the risks involved in EUAL surgery?,'The following rare complications may be observed with EUAL:' Skin burning Bruising Built-up of fluid in the areas of surgery Skin necrosis (cell death) Fibrosis (scarring and thickening of tissue which makes it harder) Pigmentation alteration and A person’s ability to function may be severely affected. Performing liposuction around the neck or upper chest can create depressions or cavities Blockage of blood vessels caused by air bubbles
What is cardiac resynchronization therapy?,"'Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a treatment to help the ''heart'' beat with healthy rhythm. CRT is a minor surgical procedure to implant an electronic device under the skin. The device helps coordinate the timing of the contraction of the heart’s lower chambers (ventricles), and improves the heart’s pumping function.' "
How does CRT work?,"'The CRT device has insulated leads that are attached to the right and ''left ventricle'', ''right atrium'' and the coronary sinus vein (the blood vessel that returns the oxygen-depleted blood from the organs to the right ''atrium'').\xa0''The CRT device delivers tiny electrical impulses to the ventricles to synchronize their contraction. The CRT device has an inbuilt battery that lasts for about 5 to 7 years, after which it will require replacement.' "
Is CRT the same as a pacemaker?,"'Yes. CRT refers to implantation of a ''pacemaker'', and there are two types.' CRT-P (cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemaker): This device, also known as a biventricular pacemaker, delivers regular electric impulses making the ventricles contract with normal rhythm. CRT-D (cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator): Besides functioning as a regular pacemaker, this device senses when the heart beats dangerously fast and delivers a shock to stop the abnormal rhythm. This device is used for people with heart failure who have a high risk of sudden cardiac death."
Why is cardiac resynchronization therapy done?,'Cardiac resynchronization therapy is performed as a treatment for heart failure due to irregular heartbeat (''arrhythmia''). Arrhythmia may be caused by factors such as''By resynchronizing the heart’s rhythm the CRT improves the heart’s efficiency and the blood flow.' Advanced age Heart disease Certain medications Genetics
Does CRT cure heart failure?,"'CRT is useful in improving left ventricular function and relieving symptoms of heart failure such as ''palpitations'' and ''shortness of breath''. CRT is not useful for all heart failure patients.''CRT does not cure heart failure, it can only slow down its progress. Heart failure is a chronic progressive disease that requires management with medications and lifestyle changes.''Heart failure may be caused by many factors such as' Coronary artery disease Heart valve disease Fluid buildup around the heart Lung diseases Heart muscle disorder (cardiomyopathy) Congenital heart defect Diabetes and other systemic diseases Anemia Thyroid disease Obesity and unhealthy eating habits Smoking, drug and alcohol abuse"
How is cardiac resynchronization therapy done?,"'A cardiac surgeon performs CRT with mild sedation and local anesthesia for most people. Some may require general anesthesia, especially if any other cardiac surgery is performed along with pacemaker placement. The CRT procedure alone may take up to five hours and require a day of hospitalization.''Before a CRT, the patient''During the procedure the surgeon' Undergoes physical examination and blood tests. Undergoes electro and echocardiography. Must avoid eating or drinking 8 hours prior to the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Inform the doctor of any allergies or implants. Attaches an IV line and administers medication for sedation and pain. Monitors the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. Administers local anesthesia in the area where the device will be implanted, typically under the left collarbone. Makes an incision and creates a pocket under the skin to place the battery pack of the CRT device. Advances the CRT device’s 4 insulated leads through the coronary sinus vein and positions one each in the right atrium, right and left ventricles, and the sinus vein. Tests the device to make sure it works well. Places the pacemaker in the pocket created, covers it with the skin flap, and closes the incision with sutures. The patient is monitored for a few hours in the recovery room. Most people are discharged the same day or the next. Most patients will be able to return to normal activities in 6 weeks but may have restrictions for certain activities. Depending on underlying conditions, some patients may have to modify diet and lifestyle. The patients must follow up with regular checkups to ensure proper functioning of the device."
What are the risks and complications of cardiac resynchronization therapy?,"'CRT is a minor surgical procedure that can save lives. Complications and risks that may arise include:' Bleeding and blood clots Injury to the vein, muscle or nerve Damage to the heart or lung Arrhythmia or heart attack Inability to place the leads in correct position Infection Pain and irritation at the implant site Movement of the device or the leads out of place Malfunction or failure of the device"
What is circumcision?,"'Circumcision'' is the surgical removal of foreskin, a loose fold of skin that covers the head (glans) of the penis. The foreskin is detached from the glans penis and the excess skin is snipped off. Circumcision is usually performed with local anesthesia in ''newborn'', but older children, adolescents and adults may require sedation.''Circumcision has its origins in religion and as a ritual for passage into manhood, but is also performed for hygienic purposes and certain medical reasons. The age for ritualistic circumcision differs with cultures, ranging from just days after birth to around ''puberty''.''Circumcision is an ancient practice which likely originated in Egypt. Egyptian mummies and wall carvings show evidence of circumcision that can be dated to at least 6000 BCE. The practice may have spread with migration and also independently developed in different cultures. The Jewish faith worldwide still practices religious circumcision -- perhaps the most well-known of groups who currently perform this rite.' "
Is circumcision good or bad?,"'Routine circumcision for the newborn is a controversial issue and has risks and benefits. The latest policy statement of the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' states that the health benefits of ''neonatal'' circumcision outweigh the risks, but are not great enough to recommend routine universal neonatal circumcision.''Conflicting views prevail on the subject of elective circumcision. People who follow the practice consider circumcision hygienic and beneficial. Opposers contend that the foreskin protects the glans and circumcision also desensitizes the penis because the foreskin has specialized nerve endings that enhance sexual pleasure. No systematic scientific studies support\xa0this assumption, however.''Ethically, some feel neonatal circumcision violates a baby’s bodily integrity without consent, and so, ethically, should be left to the individual to decide.' "
Are most men circumcised?,"'A high percentage of American men are circumcised, though routine neonatal circumcision rates have declined in the recent decades, from 64.5% to 58.3% from 1979 through 2010, according to data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey.\xa0''Withdrawal of Medicaid funding in some states for neonatal circumcision may be one of the contributing reasons.''Globally, approximately 37.7% of men are estimated to be circumcised. Prevalence of circumcision is relatively low in much of Europe, parts of Asia, South Africa and South and Central America.' "
Why do boys get circumcised?,"'Historically, circumcision was considered a miraculous cure for a gamut of ailments that ranged from a somewhat understandable ''bedwetting'', to a bewildering array of conditions that included ''headaches'' and ''crossed eyes'' to ''epilepsy'', ''paralysis'' and even clubfoot. ''Masturbation'' was a primary “ailment” that circumcision was thought to “cure.”''Circumcision can be a treatment procedure in conditions that include:''Circumcision may not be performed in the following situations:' Urinary tract infections (UTIs): Circumcision is beneficial in infants who develop recurrent urinary tract infections and require frequent catheterization. Phimosis: Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin adheres to the glans and cannot retract. All boys are born with natural phimosis which usually resolves by the age of three. Acquired phimosis may result from poor hygiene, infections or repeated forceful retraction of the foreskin. Paraphimosis: Paraphimosis is the inability to draw the retracted foreskin back to the normal position covering the glans. Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency requiring prompt treatment because it can cause edema and restrict blood supply to the penis. Balanitis: Balanitis is an infection of the glans penis. Posthitis: Posthitis is an infection of the foreskin. Premature babies Abnormal curvature of the penis (chordee) Hypospadias (urethral opening on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip) Epispadias (urethral opening on the upper surface of the penis) Concealed or buried penis Micropenis (abnormally small penis) Webbed penis (the scrotum is attached to the penis by a web of skin) Ambiguous genitals Bleeding disorders"
Is it worth getting circumcised?,"'Phimosis, without complications like urinary obstruction or ''blood in urine'', may often be resolved without circumcision with daily cleaning and avoiding forced foreskin retraction. Local application of ''corticosteroids'' such as clobetasol or betamethasone cream for up to eight weeks is effective in separating loose adhesions between the foreskin and the glans.''There is, however, some evidence that elective circumcision has benefits that include the following:' Lower risk for UTIs. Uncircumcised male infants may have up to 20 times greater risk for developing a UTI, however, the absolute risk of UTIs remains low at 1%. Lower risk for some sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, chancroid and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Prevention of acquired phimosis and paraphimosis. Prevention of balanitis and posthitis. Protection against penile cancer. Lower risk for uterus cancer in female sex partners from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection."
How is circumcision done?,"'Circumcision in infancy is a relatively simple and safe procedure, but in adults, it becomes a little more complicated. Circumcision takes just about 10 minutes in a newborn, while it may take up to an hour for adults.''During circumcision the doctor' Cleans and numbs the penis with a local anesthetic cream and/or injection. Separates the adhesions between the foreskin and the glans. Places a clamping device on the penis.

Applies antibiotic cream and petroleum jelly on the penis and a gauze bandage over it."
Circumcision follow-up care, Newborn infants should only have sponge baths. Older patients may start bathing after a day. Petroleum jelly and antibiotic cream must be applied after every diaper change or a bath. Older boys and adult males should avoid swimming and strenuous activities for up to six weeks.
How painful is circumcision in adults?,'The circumcision procedure itself is painless because the penis is numbed with local anesthesia during the procedure and adults may also receive sedation. The penis may be swollen and bruised for a couple of days and any post-procedural ''pain'' can be relieved with painkillers. The circumcision usually heals within a week. Most men can resume normal activities in two or three days.' 
What are the complications from circumcision?,"'Circumcision is a relatively simple and safe procedure, but carries a few risks like any surgical procedure. Common risks include:''Some isolated complications include the following:''Other infection-related rare complications reported include:' Pain Bleeding Infection Irritation of the glans Meatal stenosis (narrowing of the urethral opening) Injury to the penis Recurrent phimosis Wound separation Penile torsion (twisting of the penis) Concealed penis Unsatisfactory cosmetic result Skin bridges (adhesions) Urinary retention Meatitis (inflammation of the urethral opening) Chordee due to removal of excess skin Inclusion cysts (cysts in the skin) Retained Plastibell device Scalded skin syndrome Necrotizing fasciitis Sepsis Meningitis Urethral fistula Penile necrosis Amputation of a portion of the glans penis"
What is coronary artery bypass grafting?,"'Coronary artery bypass'' grafting (''CABG'') ''is a surgery performed in patients with ''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'').\xa0''Your ''heart'' is fed oxygen and nutrients through blood vessels called ''coronary arteries.'' If the coronary arteries get clogged by fat or other causes, the blood supply to the heart muscles may be compromised.\xa0''Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) ''is a surgery that helps create adequate blood flow to the heart by using healthy blood vessels harvested from some other sites (e.g., leg, arm, or chest) to bypass the flow of blood from the site of the blockage. The harvested blood vessels that are used to redirect blood to the heart are called grafts.\xa0''The procedure prevents heart damage caused by a reduced blood supply and eases the related symptoms like ''chest pain'' and breathlessness.' "
How is a coronary artery bypass graft performed?,"'A ''coronary artery bypass graft'' (CABG) surgery ''is performed by a cardiothoracic and vascular surgeon (CTVS). The surgery is done under deep general anesthesia with a ''breathing tube'' placed in the windpipe (endotracheal tube).''Your doctor may:' Order some blood tests and other tests such as electrocardiography, angiography, echocardiography, and computerized tomography scan Ask you about any chronic health conditions like diabetes and kidney diseases Ask you about any medications you are on Ask about any allergies you may have Explain the surgical procedure in detail, including possible complications and address your doubts and concerns related to the surgery Obtain your written consent Ask you to not eat anything for at least eight hours before the surgery You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. The anesthesiologist will attach an intravenous line and administer anesthesia. A breathing tube (endotracheal tube) will be put into your throat and you will be connected to a ventilator.  A catheter will be placed into your bladder to drain urine. The anesthesiologist will monitor your vitals (heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and blood oxygen level) during the surgery.  The skin over the surgical site will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. The surgeon will clean the skin over the surgical site with an antiseptic and make cuts (incisions) on one or both of your legs or one of your wrists to access the blood vessel(s) to be used for the grafts.  The surgeon will remove the vessel(s) and close those incision(s) with stitches. Thereafter, the surgeon will make an incision (cut) down the center of your chest from just below the Adam’s apple to just above the navel. The surgeon will cut the breastbone (sternum) in two parts along the length.  The halves of the breastbone are separated and spread apart to expose the heart. The surgeon follows a series of steps to place the graft(s) for ensuring adequate blood supply to the heart. After ensuring that the grafts are functioning properly, the surgeon will sew the sternum together with small wires. They will insert tubes into your chest to drain blood and other fluids from around the heart. The skin over the sternum is stitched and dressing is done. A tube is inserted through your mouth or nose into your stomach to drain stomach fluids. Your vital signs will be monitored in the recovery room.  You will be weaned off the anesthesia and shifted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring."
How many arteries can be bypassed in heart surgery?,"'The number of arteries bypassed during the CABG surgery depends on the number of blockages your heart may have. Generally, up to four arteries can be bypassed during single heart surgery.' "
Is coronary artery bypass grafting safe?,'Coronary artery bypass grafting is necessary whenever the blood supply to the heart is compromised due to the narrowing of the coronary arteries. It may provide significant relief from the symptoms and protect the heart from further damage. Coronary artery bypass grafting may have the following complications:' Bleeding Irregular heartbeat Heart attack Stroke Kidney failure Cardiac tamponade (compression of the heart by the fluid collected around it) Infections Injury to blood vessels
How are the results of culdocentesis interpreted?,"'Depending on the type of fluid withdrawn, the result interpretation involves:' A small amount of clear fluid is normal, but the chances of ovarian cyst, unruptured ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy at a site other than the womb), tubal infection, or other disorders can be a possibility No fluid in the cul-de-sac can also be a normal finding Nonclotting blood indicates active bleeding from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy Clotting blood indicates blood from the vein or artery during an aspiration The presence of pus indicates an infection, such as pelvic inflammatory disease"
How to prepare for a culdocentesis?,"'To prepare for culdocentesis, you have to follow these instructions:' Detail your medical and medication history to your physician Undergo a pelvic examination for the physician to identify the abnormality of the cul-de-sac Understand each step of culdocentesis to know what to expect from the procedure Give your informed consent after understanding the procedure thoroughly You may need to walk or sit upright for 10 to 15 minutes to allow the fluid to pool into the cul-de-sac Inform about any drug allergies or substance allergy to your physician Quit cigarette smoking and other nicotine products before the procedure Avoid alcohol for a few days before the surgery You may have to undergo specific tests before the procedure, which include:Blood tests and urine analysisComputed tomography (CT) scanUltrasoundX-ray of the lower abdomen Blood tests and urine analysis Computed tomography (CT) scan Ultrasound X-ray of the lower abdomen"
What to expect after the culdocentesis procedure?,"'After a culdocentesis procedure:' You may resume your daily routine To relieve minor pain, the physician may prescribe painkillers You have to notify your physician if you notice:Excessive vaginal bleeding (more than one pad per hour)FeverNausea or vomitingWorsening or persistent lower abdominal painPus-like discharge from the vagina Excessive vaginal bleeding (more than one pad per hour) Fever Nausea or vomiting Worsening or persistent lower abdominal pain Pus-like discharge from the vagina"
What are the complications of the culdocentesis procedure?,'The complications of culdocentesis procedure include:' Puncture/injury of adjacent organs Infection Bleeding A false result Leakage of fluid into the uterus
What is dermoscopy?,"'Dermoscopy is a noninvasive technique that is primarily used for the examination of the skin using skin surface microscopy. Dermoscopy is mainly used to evaluate skin lesions to differentiate between cancerous and benign (noncancerous) skin lesions. It is also called ‘epiluminoscopy’ or ‘epiluminescence microscopy.’ It is primarily done for examining the pigmented (colored) skin lesions, although nonpigmented lesions may also be examined through this procedure.''Dermatoscope used for dermoscopy is a handheld device that consists of a high-quality ''lens'' and a lighting system for illumination and magnification purposes. It helps examine skin structures and patterns.''There are three types of dermatoscopes available:''Nonpolarized and polarized light help in the analysis of deeper structures and other minute details. Several convenient attachments may help video or still photography, which can even be done via a smartphone.' Nonpolarized light, contact Polarized light, contact Polarized light, noncontact"
When is a dermoscopy indicated?,"'Dermoscopy is helpful in the evaluation of pigmented and non-pigmented skin lesions and to rule out the chances of ''skin cancers''. A dermoscopic examination is useful in the following conditions:' Any new or changing lesion Any lesions that cause discomforts in the patients, such as ulcerations Skin lesions that appear to be abnormal compared to other lesions Lesions that appear to be cancerous Inflammatory and infectious disease of hair and nail, such as scabies Finding a splinter in the skin Abnormal blood vessels, such as atypical naevi or blue naevi Evaluating hair loss"
What are the benefits of dermoscopy?,"'The benefits of dermoscopy include:' Dermoscopy increases the sensitivity for the diagnosis of skin cancer Dermoscopy improves the detection of benign skin lesions, thus avoiding unnecessary biopsies It is useful in differentiating benign and malignant tumors It allows the monitoring of lesions due to the deposition of melanin It may be up to 35% more accurate than clinical diagnosis It is noninvasive and painless It provides clear and high-quality images of skin lesions It is a low-cost technique The results are immediate"
What are the complications of dermoscopy?, 
What is the external cephalic version?,"'External cephalic version (ECV)'' is a procedure in which an attempt is made by the doctor to shift the fetus while still in the uterus. It is done by putting external pressure on the swollen belly. The goal of the procedure is to change the presentation of the fetus from breech to cephalic. ECV is done by the doctor by placing their hands on the maternal abdomen and gently turning the fetus while continuously monitoring the fetus and mother.''Cephalic presentation'' or vertex presentation is when the head of the fetus is at the uterine mouth at the time of ''childbirth''. The head enters the pelvis first. Cephalic presentation of the fetus is preferred at term because it is associated with lesser risks and mortality to the baby during delivery. Cephalic presentation reduces the need for cesarean delivery.''Breech presentation'' is when the fetus lies longitudinally, with the buttocks or ''feet'' closest to the cervix. Breech presentation occurs in 3-4% of all deliveries. There is an increased risk of perinatal mortality with breech presentation. Fetal death is often associated with fetal malformations, prematurity, and\xa0intrauterine death. Hence, more than 90% of breech fetuses are delivered by elective (planned) cesarean delivery. If vaginal delivery is attempted, the doctor may have to convert it to cesarean delivery if the former fails.''Types of breech presentations:' Frank breech (50-70%): The fetus is in a pike position (the hips are flexed and the knees are extended). Complete breech (5-10%): The fetus is in a cannonball position (the hips and knees are flexed). Footling or incomplete breech (10-30%): One or both the hips are extended with the foot presenting."
Why is the external cephalic version done?,"'External cephalic version (ECV) has proven to be a valuable maneuver to reduce the rate of cesarean delivery by reducing the incidence of breech presentation at term. If the patient is an ideal candidate for ECV, the procedure is a safe and effective way to convert fetuses from breech to cephalic presentation to try to avoid cesarean delivery. Cesarean delivery is associated with a high risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Hence, ECV is usually offered to all near-term women with breech presentation who do not have any contraindications to the procedure to increase their chances of having a safe cephalic vaginal delivery.' "
When is the external cephalic version not done?,"'External cephalic version (ECV) is usually contraindicated if the procedure would put the fetus or mother at risk of life-threatening complications or if the procedure is not likely to succeed.''ECV may not be performed in the following conditions:''Relative contraindications include:' Placenta previa (low-lying placenta covering the cervix) Abruptio placenta (the placenta detaches from the uterus before delivery) Poor fetal health status  Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Abnormal umbilical artery  Maternal hypertension  Fetal abnormalities such as neck mass History of recent vaginal bleeding during pregnancy Anatomical uterine abnormalities  Uterine pathologies such as uterine fibroids  Ruptured membranes (referred to as water breaking) Hyperextended head of the fetus in the uterus  Multiple gestations (more than one fetus, such as twins or triplets) Maternal obesity A fetus that is small for gestational age Oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid in the uterus)  Uterine scarring from previous cesarean delivery or other surgeries performed to treat uterine pathologies"
What is hypnotherapy?,"'Hypnotherapy is a therapeutic technique to produce an altered state of consciousness (hypnosis) in a person by inducing deep relaxation. While the person in this state, the therapist makes suggestions for behavioral changes during hypnosis. Hypnotherapy is an alternative form of therapy, mostly used along with cognitive ''behavior therapy'' and medication.''Submission to hypnotherapy is a voluntary act.\xa0 The patient is always in control of their actions and can withdraw when they want to. The hypnotherapist cannot make a patient do anything they are unwilling to. Hypnotherapy is performed by certified ''mental health'' professionals who are specially trained in this form of therapy.''Hypnotherapy is considered complementary or alternative care and does not have a robust body of scientific evidence for its effectiveness. First-line treatments include talk therapy and medications.\xa0 Hypnosis, however, may help reduce symptoms or cravings in some people with mental health, ''chronic pain'' or ''addiction'' problems.' "
Four main stages of hypnotherapy,"'Hypnotherapists employ several techniques to induce hypnosis in a person.''The hypnotherapist induces hypnosis by taking the individual through four steps, asking them to''This technique involves fixating the gaze on some object until the eyelids become heavy and close, and the person drifts into deep relaxation.''The individual fixes the gaze on one of their fingers with the forearm kept vertical, until the hand becomes heavy and starts drifting downward. As the arm lowers, the eyes become heavy and close, and hypnosis is achieved.''The individual settles down comfortably, focuses on ''breathing'' in and out, and relaxes their body from the ''feet'' up to go into complete relaxation.''Imagery involves having the individual breathing deeply and imagining a scene that makes them feel safe and comfortable.' Close their eyes Imagine that they can’t open their eyes Try to open their eyes while pretending they can’t Relax the eyes and the whole body"
Deepening of hypnosis,"'After induction of hypnosis, the hypnotherapist deepens the hypnotic level, because an individual is likely to respond more positively in such a state. The hypnotherapist may use some of the same techniques employed during induction, including the following:' Progressive relaxation Visual imagery Periods of silence Deep breathing and counting Counting"
Posthypnotic suggestions,"'While the individual is in a deep hypnotic state, the hypnotherapist' Makes suggestions To counter problems with behaviorTo stop addictive habits like smokingTo alter response to pain symptoms To counter problems with behavior To stop addictive habits like smoking To alter response to pain symptoms Asks leading questions to induce the individual to talk about deep-rooted trauma, and offers suitable therapy"
Termination, 
What are the risks of hypnotherapy?,"'The main problem with hypnotherapy is that hypnosis may not be achievable in some people. Adverse reactions to hypnotherapy are rare but some people may experience:' Headache Drowsiness Dizziness Anxiety or distress Confabulation (creation of false memories) Abreaction (emotional outburst because of remembering past trauma), though this may be used as part of the therapy"
What is knee arthrocentesis?,"'Arthrocentesis'' (''joint aspiration'') is a diagnostic procedure in which fluid is drained from a joint (synovial fluid) using a sterile needle and syringe.\xa0''Knee arthrocentesis is an important procedure used for diagnosing ''arthritis'' and differentiating inflammatory arthritis from noninflammatory arthritis. Arthrocentesis can also be performed therapeutically for''Any joint in the body can be aspirated. Joint aspiration is a relatively quick and inexpensive procedure to perform. It can be done in a clinic or hospital setting. Any trained physician, physician’s assistant, or nurse can perform the procedure.' pain relief, drainage of fluid or injection of medications."
When is knee arthrocentesis done?,"'Knee arthrocentesis may be indicated in the patients with inflamed knee joints without an established diagnosis. Inflamed joints are recognized by being''Some conditions that may require joint aspiration and analysis to establish diagnosis are:''Joint aspiration may be performed as a treatment in certain conditions:' red, warm, tender, swollen, and painful during movement.  Monoarticular arthritis (inflammation of the joint) Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) Joint effusion (swelling due to fluid accumulation in the body) Intra-articular fracture (fractures which involve the joint space)  Crystal arthropathy (accumulation of calcium crystals in the joint and surrounding areas) Repeated aspirations can be part of the management of the septic joint to relieve discomfort and prevent joint damage. Aspiration can be considered in cases of hemarthrosis (blood in the joints) to prevent adhesions.  Aspiration can be performed while injecting intra-articular medications, such as corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid to improve efficacy. Steroid injections help reduce joint inflammation, reduce pain, preserve joint structure, and function. Hyaluronic acid lubricates the joint, decreases impact, delays joint aging, and reduces pain and stiffness. "
When should knee arthrocentesis not be done?,'Knee arthrocentesis should be performed with caution in patients with ''bleeding disorder'' or those on ''anticoagulant'' ''drugs'' (blood thinners). Patients taking anticoagulant drugs may be advised to stop the medications a few days before the procedure and resume again after the procedure.' 
How is knee arthrocentesis performed?,"'Occasionally, knee arthrocentesis can be performed using radiological guidance as it may require to confirm the presence of fluid before aspirating. Radiological guidance can also be helpful in aspirating other deep and technically difficult joints like the hip joint or spine.\xa0''Knee arthrocentesis is a relatively quick procedure but may be performed under local anesthesia to avoid pain.\xa0' A sterile needle of appropriate size and length is introduced into the joint and the synovial fluid is collected in syringes.  The fluid is then analyzed microscopically. Apart from microscopic analysis, the appearance of the aspirated synovial fluid can indicate certain features.  Normal fluid is clear or light yellow and viscous. Inflammatory fluid appears darker yellow to cloudy and loses its viscosity. Purulent fluid (pus in the fluid) is brownish to whitish and opaque. After the procedure, the patient is asked to rest for a few minutes, after that they can resume normal activities.  Some patients may experience pain and bruising which resolves in a few days. Ice packs and pain killers can help reduce pain and bruising."
What are the complications of knee arthrocentesis?,"'Knee arthrocentesis is a relatively safe procedure and complications are rare. The common complications patients usually face are''Infection of the joint may occur, which is called ''septic arthritis''.\xa0''If medications like steroids are simultaneously injected, though rare, it may cause localized shrinkage or hypopigmentation of the skin. Long-term use of steroid injections may cause systemic side effects like' localized bleeding, pain, swelling, and sometimes a reaction to local anesthesia. weight gain, puffy face, stretch marks, and easy bruising. "
What is a cyst?,"'A\xa0''cyst'' has a sac-like structure and is an abnormal, benign (noncancerous) growth. Sometimes, they may be felt as an abnormal or new lump or bump. Cysts usually are filled with fluid, air, or semisolid substances like tissue debris or other materials and covered by a capsule. If a cyst gets infected, it gets filled with pus. Cysts vary in size and are painless. They are usually asymptomatic initially. Larger cysts can cause discomfort. Infected cysts can cause ''pain'' and significant discomfort. Cysts are usually caused due to obstructions to the outflow of fluid due to injury, infections, tumors, chronic inflammation, wear, and tear. ''Poor hygiene'' practices increase the risk of cyst formation.''Types of cysts:''There are over hundreds of different types of cysts that can arise anywhere in the body or at any age. Some common types of cysts for which marsupialization is done include:' Bartholin cysts: They arise from the Bartholin glands that lubricate the vagina. Pilonidal cysts: Cysts that occur on the lower back, near the cleft of the buttocks. Epidermal cysts: Small cysts in the skin. Dentigerous cyst: A cyst occurring in the jaw. Lacrimal cyst: This arises from the lacrimal or tears glands in the eyes. Dermoid cysts: Benign (noncancerous) cysts that contain a mix of different tissue types. Baker cyst: This is also called a popliteal cyst and occurs behind the knee."
After the procedure,"'Early, asymptomatic cysts usually do not require any treatment. Some cysts may resolve with conservative remedies but they can recur. Treatment of cysts that don’t resolve with conservative measures, require surgical drainage. Surgical drainage with marsupialization is done to prevent a recurrence. If the cyst is infected, the patient would first be treated with antibiotics to resolve the infection before proceeding with surgical drainage and marsupialization. The procedure is done under general or local anesthesia.''During surgical drainage, the doctor makes a small incision over the cyst and drains the fluid. During marsupialization, the doctor places ''sutures'' (''stitches'') on either side of the incision, creating a small permanent opening of around 6 mm. A thin tube (catheter) may be placed for a few days to drain the fluid completely and further help prevent a recurrence.''After the procedure:''Patients are usually discharged the same day after the procedure once they recover from anesthesia. Patients can resume their daily activities the next day. Patients may resume specific activities like ''exercise'', sports, and sexual intercourse after consulting with the doctor. It is advised that patients keep the surgical wound clean and dry and follow specific aftercare instructions given by the doctor. Antibiotics and painkillers are usually prescribed after the procedure to prevent infection and reduce ''pain'', respectively. Complete wound healing may take 1-2 weeks.' "
What is meconium ileus?,"'Meconium ileus is ''intestinal obstruction'' caused by thick, congealed meconium (baby’s first ''stool''), which does not get evacuated after the birth of a baby.''Cystic fibrosis'' is an ''inherited'' disorder caused by a genetic mutation which causes thickening of the ''mucus'' and primarily affects the respiratory tract and pancreatic function. Cystic fibrosis leads to hardening of meconium and prevents its evacuation.''Meconium ileus may be:' Simple meconium ileus: Simple obstruction in the small intestines resulting in dilatation of the bowel above the obstruction, and bowel wall thickening. Complicated meconium ileus: Intestinal obstruction complicated by conditions such as intestinal twisting, perforation and infection."
How is meconium ileus treated?,"'If the ''newborn'' has abdominal distension or other symptoms of meconium ileus, the initial medical treatment involves:''A diagnosis of a simple meconium ileus is most often treated with an enema, though some infants may require surgery. The administration of enema involves the following steps:''Potential complications of Gastrografin include:' Initiation of resuscitation of the infant Administration of IV fluids Gastric decompression by removing the gas in the digestive tract Administration of antibiotics Imaging test to evaluate the cause for abdominal distension Meglumine diatrizoate enema Prepare the infant with adequate hydration, supplemental electrolytes and antibiotics. Administer enema with meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin), a water- soluble substance that softens the meconium, and also acts as a contrast medium for continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) to monitor the process. Continue hydration with IV fluids. Monitor the baby closely for the next few hours. Administer additional enemas if required, until the meconium is completely evacuated. Imaging tests to confirm complete evacuation of the meconium. Administer supplemental pancreatic enzymes after obstruction is cleared, usually within 48 hours, if the baby is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Perforation of the bowel Hypovolemic shock (shock from loss of fluids, which must be carefully monitored and managed with supplemental IV fluids) Ischemia (reduced blood supply to the tissues)"
When is surgery indicated for meconium ileus?,"'Surgical treatment is indicated if the newborn has complicated meconium ileus, with one or more of the following conditions:' Persistent abdominal distension Enlarging abdominal mass Volvulus (twisting of a loop of intestine) Atresia (malformation of intestine) Necrosis (tissue death) Perforation Meconium peritonitis (inflammation of peritoneum, the abdominal membrane) and pseudocyst formation from the spillage of meconium through the perforation"
What are the surgical treatments for meconium ileus?,"'Surgical treatments for meconium ileus are individualized for each infant. A pediatric surgeon performs the surgery with the baby under general anesthesia.''Prior to a surgical procedure''The surgical treatments for meconium ileus may involve one or more of the following procedures:''After surgery, the baby’s hydration and ''electrolyte'' requirements are managed carefully. Infants who have surgery for simple meconium ileus with cystic fibrosis may receive ''breast milk'' or formula milk, pancreatic enzymes and ''vitamins''.''Babies'' who have a complex surgical procedure for complicated meconium ileus may receive diluted, pre-digested ''infant formula'' through the tube, until they are able to feed orally. Pancreatic enzymes are administered orally after the baby starts oral feeding.''In addition to surgical risks such as ''wound'' infection and bleeding, complications from surgical procedures for meconium ileus include the following:' The infant undergoes imaging tests The neonatal care team Administers IV fluids and antibiotics Performs gastric decompression Enterostomy: A procedure to make one or more openings (stomas) in the abdomen to insert small tubes into the intestine. The tubes are used to irrigate, decompress the bowel, and also for feeding. The tubes are removed once the obstruction is completely cleared. Resection: Removal of the affected portion of the intestine. Anastomosis: Anastomosis is a procedure to connect the severed ends of the bowel after a resection. Transplantation: Intestinal and/or liver transplantation because of cystic fibrosis associated liver damage. Excessive fluid and sodium loss in infants who undergo removal of a significant portion of the intestines. Adverse effects on the development of the colon and the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon below the stoma, which is nonfunctional until the enterostomy tubes are removed. Excessive gastric acid in the shortened intestines can cause malabsorption of nutrients (short bowel syndrome)."
How long does PDA surgery take?,"'The PDA closure procedure may take up to three hours, depending on the type of procedure. It may take longer if the PDA closure is accompanied by other procedures to correct any additional ''heart'' defects.''PDA stands for “patent ductus arteriosis,” which is a congenital failure of the heart to develop properly, leaving an opening between chambers that hinders blood flow.\xa0' "
How is PDA surgery performed?,"'The patient is under general anesthesia for all types of PDA closure procedures.\xa0''In the case of full-term and premature newborns, the procedure may be performed in the ''neonatal'' ICU.\xa0''For other children and adults, surgical closure is performed in the operation room.

What is peritoneal lavage?,"'Peritoneal lavage is a bedside procedure for evaluating bleeding in the abdominal ''cavity'' or a ruptured organ. In this procedure, a needle connected to a catheter, a tube-like structure, is inserted into your abdominal ''cavity''. It is commonly known as diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL).''Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is used to evaluate the extent of abdominal ''trauma'' caused by accidents, e.g., in motor vehicle accidents. However, with the advent of ''computerized tomography'' (''CT scan''), the use of DPL to detect bleeding in the abdominal cavity has decreased considerably.' "
What is peritoneal lavage used for?,"'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is used in unstable patients who have suffered severe physical trauma (unstable means unconscious with abnormal ''heart'' rate, ''blood pressure'', and respiratory rate). It is an emergency diagnostic procedure that is preferred over the CT scan in these patients because a delay encountered while performing the CT scan might endanger life.''Being a bedside procedure, diagnostic peritoneal lavage is feasible in patients whose life is at stake— where every minute counts to save a life.''The conditions where peritoneal lavage is used include:''peritoneal lavage, it becomes clear to the surgeons whether to perform surgery on the patients or try an alternative treatment.\xa0' Blunt abdominal injury: An injury that occurs due to blunt trauma to the abdomen, e.g., due to falling from a tall height to the ground, a heavy blow with a fist or with any blunt object to the abdomen, or banging the abdomen on the steering wheel during motor vehicle accidents. Penetrating abdominal injury: An injury that occurs when sharp instruments, weapons (stab injury), or gunshots pierce the abdomen.

How is peritoneal lavage performed?," You will be rested on your back (supine position). A catheter (a rubber tube) may be inserted in your urethra and nasogastric tube (feeding tube) into your nose to avoid injury to your bladder and stomach. A sterile solution will be applied to the abdomen where the incision is planned. A local anesthetic solution will be injected to numb the area of operation. An incision will be made 2 cm below the umbilicus or belly button. A catheter with a needle will be inserted through this incision. The fluid will be drawn (aspiration of fluid) through the needle to check for the presence of blood. This will be done in two steps. If 10 mL or more of blood is aspirated, the procedure will be stopped.  If little or no blood is detected, the doctor will perform a lavage (washing) of the abdominal cavity with a normal saline solution. A small sample of the abdominal fluid will be collected and sent to the laboratory for investigation. A sterile solution will be applied at the site of the incision. The wound will be closed with sutures and then bandaged. "

How is polyamory different from polygamy?,"'Polygamy''Polyamory''Monogamy' Polygamy is the practice of marrying more than one person, whereas polyamory means having multiple relations while being married (or not married) to one person. Polygamy is more often done for sexual gratification or sometimes for political reasons, but polyamory also has an emotional aspect apart from the sexual or romantic side. Polygamy is more commonly seen in the form of Polygyny, in which one man marries multiple women. In polygamy, one person has multiple partners, whereas, in polyamory, both the partners are allowed to take multiple lovers or one lover. Polyamory means having multiple lovers and polygamy means having multiple spouses. Both are unconventional, uncommon practices in contemporary Western society.  Polyamory is a form of consensual nonmonogamy (CNM). Polyamory is also different from other types of CNM, such as swinging or “open” relationships, in which partners interact with each other mainly because of sexual intentions. Monogamy is far more common than polygamy in North America, but CNM exists as well. An online survey found that 4 out of every 100 people in North America are involved in CNM. "
Is polyamory the same as hypersexuality?,"'No, polyamory is not a sexual disorder or personality disorder. It is simply an alternate way of living one’s life.''Hypersexuality is a sexual behavioral disorder treated by psychiatrists. It is also called compulsive sexual behavior, hypersexuality disorder or ''sexual addiction''. People suffering from hypersexuality are always preoccupied with feelings of sex to the point that it affects them emotionally, personally and professionally.''Some may desire to enter polyamory, but they can control their feelings and can decide not to go for it. Some relationships start as polyamorous relations and later may revert to monogamy, subject to consent from both primary partners. It generally does not cause devastating disturbances in their family and professional lives as seen with people suffering from hypersexuality.''But yes, a polyamorous couple may need periodic counselling to cope with their feelings and “talk it out” about how they really feel in this relationship.' "
Are there any health consequences of polyamory?,"'Having multiple sexual partners carries the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Before people enter into a sexual relationship with any new partner, they must discuss their sexual histories with their new partners.''A study involving people in polyamory found that people practicing polyamory reported taking more precautions than those in monogamous relationships. They used ''condoms'' most of the time when they had sex and were also involved in getting themselves and their partners tested for STIs.' "
How to know if polyamory is right for you,"'Just like polygamy, polyamory is not for everyone. Like any relationship, polygamy also involves commitment with multiple partners. Effort to maintain each relationship needs constant work, a sound mental state, a healthy respect for personal boundaries and candid conversations about how both partners really feel in the long run. There must be a choice to change your preference at any point.''Polyamory encompasses more than just the physical aspect. A healthy relationship requires four things'""A polyamorous relationship isn't going to work unless all partners agree with the arrangement.""'To know if polyamory is right for you, you should be ready to deal with issues that may come with it.

When should you be screened for prostate cancer?,"'Prostate cancer'' is one of the most common killers of men – it’s the second leading cause of ''cancer'' deaths among men in America. It’s largely a disease of men over 40, so it’s around this age doctors recommend the first prostate screening.''Age, ethnicity, family history, nationality, genetic factors, and ''obesity'' are all risk factors for ''prostate cancer'', and any one of these is a reason to get checked. The good news is the prognosis for prostate ''cancer'', depending on the stage at which it’s diagnosed, is good compared with some other ''cancers''. Because the condition is so common, there’s a large set of data on what treatments are effective and lots of support for men with the disease''The prostate is a walnut-sized gland in men that wraps around the urethra below the bladder and produces the fluid portion of semen. Early signs of a cancerous prostate are ''blood in the urine'' and/or semen and ''pain'' or ''inability to urinate'' or ejaculate. Prostate ''cancer'' commonly metastasizes to ''lymph nodes'' in the pelvis and to the bones.''The best treatment results come when prostate cancer is diagnosed early.''The first screening exam is a blood test to determine if there are abnormal ''Prostate specific antigen'' (PSA) levels in your blood – PSA is a specific protein produced by the prostate. If the PSA is high, your doctor or specialist will perform a digital rectal exam, during which the doctor feels your prostate from inside your rectum with a gloved finger. Though it’s uncomfortable, a digital rectal exam may be far less uncomfortable and painful than the end result of prostate cancer left undiagnosed.''If the results of the ''PSA test'' and rectal exam show abnormalities, your doctor may refer you to a ''urologist'' for a biopsy, and you will make treatment decisions with your doctor based on the biopsy results.''This article will discuss this diagnostic process in detail, as well as the how prostate cancer is classified by type (i.e. the ''Gleason score'').' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose prostate cancer?,"""The diagnosis of prostate cancer ultimately is based on the pathologist's review of tissue removed at the time of the prostate biopsy. An abnormal PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal examination often are present and are the indications for the prostate biopsy.""'Digital rectal examination (DRE)'': As part of a physical examination, your doctor inserts a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum and feels toward the front of your body. The ''prostate gland'"" is a walnut or larger sized gland immediately in front of the rectum, and beneath your bladder. The back portion of prostate gland can be felt in this manner. Findings on this exam are compared to notes about the patient's prior digital rectal examinations.""'The exam is usually brief, and most find it uncomfortable due to the pressure used to adequately examine the prostate gland. Findings such as abnormal size, lumps, or nodules (hard areas within the prostate) may indicate prostate cancer.''The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) notes that a DRE should not be used as a stand-alone test for detection of prostate cancer but should be performed in men with an elevated PSA. The NCCN also notes that DRE may be considered as a baseline test in all patients, as it may help identify high-grade cancers associated with a normal PSA.''Prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test'': The PSA blood test measures the level of a protein found in the blood that is produced by the prostate gland and helps keep semen in liquid form. The PSA test can indicate an increased likelihood of prostate cancer if the PSA is at an increased or elevated level or has changed significantly over time, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Prostate cancer can be found in patients with a low PSA level, but this occurs less than 20% of the time.''If the PSA level is elevated (levels can depend upon your age, on the size of your prostate gland on examination, certain medications you may be taking, or recent sexual activity) or has increased significantly over time, further testing may be needed to rule out prostate cancer.''PSA measurements are often tracked over time to look for evidence of a change. The amount of time it takes for the PSA level to increase is referred to as PSA velocity. The time it takes for the PSA to double, known as the PSA doubling time, can be also tracked. PSA velocity and PSA doubling time can help your doctor determine whether prostate cancer may be present.''The presence of an abnormal result on digital rectal examination, or a new or progressive abnormality in a PSA test may lead to a referral to a physician who specializes in diseases of the urinary system (a urologist) who may perform further testing, such as a biopsy of the prostate gland.''Prostate biopsy'': A biopsy refers to a procedure that involves taking of a sample of tissue from an area in the body. Prostate cancer is only definitively diagnosed by finding cancer cells on a biopsy sample taken from the prostate gland.''If you do not have an anus (due to previous surgery), then transperineal prostate biopsy is performed. During this procedure, which is often performed under sedation, the biopsy needle is inserted through the perineum (area between the scrotum and the anus) into the prostate.''A biopsy procedure is usually uncomplicated, with just some numbness, ''pain'', or tenderness in the area for a short time afterward. Occasionally, a patient has some ''blood in the urine'', ''stool'', or the ejaculate after the procedure. Rarely, the patient may develop an infection after a biopsy procedure (''urinary tract infection'', prostate infection, testis infection) or be unable to urinate. If one develops a ''fever'' after the procedure, has continued blood in the urine or ejaculate, or has troubles urinating, further evaluation by the performing doctor is needed.' The urologist may have you stop medications such as blood thinners (for example, warfarin [Coumadin]),Clopidogrel, Xarelto, Eliquis, aspirin, ibuprofen [Advil, Motrin], and certain herbal supplements) before the biopsy. An antibiotic is often prescribed to help prevent an infection related to the procedure. Some urologists may actually place a small swab into your rectum a week or so prior to the procedure to determine the best antibiotic to give you (selective target antibiotic prophylaxis). You may be asked to do a cleansing enema at home before the biopsy appointment and will be instructed to take the antibiotic 30 to 60 minutes prior to the biopsy to prevent an infection. On the day of the biopsy, the doctor will apply a local anesthetic by injection or topically as a gel inside the rectum over the area of prostate gland. You will be asked to lie on your side with your knees pulled up to your chest. Sometimes you may be asked to lie on your stomach. An ultrasound probe is then placed in the rectum. This device uses sound waves to take a picture of the prostate gland and helps guide the biopsy device. The device used is a spring-loaded needle that allows the urologist to remove tiny cores of tissue from the prostate gland. Usually, 12 cores are obtained, six from each side. Two cores are taken from the upper, middle, and lower portions of each side of the prostate gland. The cores are examined under the microscope by a pathologist (a doctor who specializes in examining tissues to make a diagnosis). Results may take several days."
Prostate cancer biopsy results,"""The result of the pathologist's analysis of the biopsy cores under the microscope is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer. The prostate biopsy technique samples many areas of the prostate but rarely the biopsy can miss small areas of prostate cancer in the prostate. Thus, if the initial biopsy results are negative but the urologist is still suspicious based on the results of the examination, the ultrasound images seen during the procedure, or the PSA, additional biopsies or tests may be recommended.""""The pathologist's report on the biopsy sample showing prostate cancer will contain much detailed information. The size of the biopsy core and the percentage of involvement of each core will be reported. Most importantly the prostate cancer present will be assigned a numerical score, which is usually expressed as a sum of two numbers (for example, 3 + 4) and is referred to as the Gleason Score. This characterizes the appearance of the cancer cells and helps predict its likely level of aggressiveness in the body. A Gleason score of 6 or less indicates a low grade prostate cancer, whereas scores of 8-10 indicate a high-grade prostate cancer. A new prostate cancer grading system was developed in 2014 to help assess risk and assign a Gleason grade group. This grade group is particularly useful in Gleason score 7, where the predominant cell type could be a 4 or a 3, which may impact prostate cancer risk.""'The Gleason score and the extent of involvement of the biopsy core expressed as a percentage, as well as the PSA level as well as your general state of health and otherwise estimated life expectancy, all help to allow doctors to make their best recommendations for you regarding how your cancer should be treated.' Gleason grade group 1: Gleason score < 6 Gleason grade group 2: Gleason score 3+4= 7 Gleason grade group 3: Gleason score 4+3 = 7 Gleason grade group 4: Gleason 4+4 =8, 3+5 = 8 and 5+3 = 8 Gleason grade group 5: Gleason score 9 and 10"
How accurate is the PSA test?,"'The PSA test is a tool for use by your doctor, but it is not a perfect way to tell whether or not a patient has prostate cancer because is not sensitive enough to pick up all ''prostate cancers''.''Nevertheless, it accurately measures the amount of PSA in the blood at the time that it is drawn. Once a single PSA test has been obtained, the level of the PSA on follow-up tests is not as important as the rate of change of the PSA (how quickly it is increasing).'""The interpretation of the PSA result must be done with care. PSA results must be, for example, interpreted in the context of the patient's age.""'Prostate cancer risk increases as men age.''Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of ''prostate cancer screening'' and having PSA testing if you are 40 years of age with a family history of prostate cancer (or age 50 if you do not have a family history), or are of African-American ancestry. The test results should be considered in the context of the prostate size, family history of prostate cancer, race and ethnicity, and rectal examination findings. Further there should be attention given to the pattern of change in his serial PSA measurements.''Numerous different ways to refine the use of PSA testing have been attempted. Some of these include evaluations of the''The lower the percentage of free PSA, the higher the risk of cancer.''In prostate cancer patients whose PSA was initially elevated, the PSA is an excellent tool to assist in decisions about care and in follow-up both during and after treatment.''Other tests that may help evaluate risk for prostate cancer and need for biopsy are used to decide treatment.''Several prostate cancer risk calculators have been developed to help determine the risk of having prostate cancer using multiple factors.''The use of ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'""), multiparametric MRI, to select individuals who need a prostate biopsy or to guide needle placement during the biopsy, is controversial. Currently, the NCCN does not recommend that MRI alone should be used to decide whether a biopsy should be performed and notes that a negative MRI does not indicate that a biopsy should be deferred in a man with indications for a first-time biopsy. The NCCN also doesn't uniformly support the use of this study to direct prostate biopsy needle placement at this time.""'Biomarkers have been developed to help define the probability of prostate cancer prior to proceeding to biopsy. The goals of the biomarker tests are to decrease the risk of unnecessary biopsies and increase the likelihood of cancer detection without missing a significant number of prostate cancers.''At present, no test has been established to be superior to another. Prior to having such studies done, it is advisable to ensure that your insurance company covers these tests.' It is not specific enough in that it may be elevated in people without prostate cancer, such as those whose prostate glands are infected, inflamed, or enlarged but not cancerous. The PSA level can be affected by medications used to treat benign enlargement of the prostate (BPH), 5 alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), which lower the PSA by approximately 50% within 6 months to a year of being on this medication. It is also elevated for several days after a digital rectal exam or after ejaculation. Younger men (under 70 years of age and definitely under 60 years of age) may have either more aggressive prostate cancers or live long enough to experience the adverse effects of undetected/untreated prostate cancer. Conversely, men over 70 often have more indolent or slow-growing prostate cancers or other medical conditions that may be greater threats to their lives over the next 10 years than may prostate cancer, and thus less aggressive evaluation and treatment may be warranted. It is estimated 16% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and yet only 3% will die of it. Many men likely have small prostate cancers present by the time they are over 60 years of age, with estimates ranging from 30%-40% having prostate cancer cells in their prostates. The risk of developing these small cancers also likely further increases with age. Most of these cancers are not life-threatening. They are very slow-growing and not aggressive in their tendency to spread as they are never discovered or symptomatic during the men's lives. Diagnosing these prostate cancers may only increase the cost and result in treatment-related complications in these men. PSA doubling time, which refers to how long it has taken for the PSA to double; PSA velocity, which looks at how rapidly the PSA values have changed over time; PSA density, which looks at the PSA result and considers the prostate gland volume as determined on ultrasound evaluation; and PSA fractionation, which is another test that measures the amount of free PSA versus protein-bound PSA in the bloodstream. Some of these risk calculators include Sunnybrook-, ERSPC-, and PCPT-based risk calculators. The calculators determine the risk of having prostate cancer on biopsy by combining several factors including age, family history of prostate cancer, race, DRE, and PSA. These calculators may help determine the need for biopsy but should be used in conjunction with your doctor's clinical judgment and patient preferences. The biomarker tests may be most useful in men with PSA levels between 3 and 10 ng/mL. Currently, the NCCN recommends consideration of percent free PSA (%fPSA), Prostate Health Index (PHI), and 4Kscore in patients with PSA levels > 3 ng/mL who have not had an initial prostate biopsy. For individuals who have had at least one negative prostate biopsy but who are thought to be at higher risk for prostate cancer (increasing PSA), the NCCN recommends %fPSA, PHI, 4Kscore, PCA3, and ConfirmMDx. Select MDx is a biomarker that can be obtained prior to initial biopsy and after negative biopsy."
What specialists identify and treat prostate cancer?,"'There are several different types of specialists involved in the identification and treatment of prostate cancer.''Often urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists work together in a multidisciplinary team to review your case and you may meet with one, two, or all of these physicians at some point during your prostate cancer treatment.' The primary care provider (PCP) may be the initial medical doctor to discuss prostate cancer screening and/or become concerned about the risk of prostate cancer (because of abnormal rectal examination and/or elevated PSA or family history of prostate cancer [brother or father or multiple family members diagnosed with prostate cancer at < 60 years of age]) during your routine evaluations or due to symptoms and refer you to a urologist for further evaluation. Urologists are the specialists who will initially be involved in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and will perform the prostate biopsy. Depending on the grade and stage of the prostate cancer at the time of the diagnosis, additional specialists may be involved in your care. Urologists perform surgical-based treatments for prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy), minimally invasive treatments (cryotherapy, brachytherapy), and prescribe medications (hormonal therapy). Medical oncologists are doctors who specialize in the treatment of cancer. Medical oncologists treat prostate cancer with a variety of medical therapies, including chemotherapy, immune/vaccine, and hormonal therapy. Radiation oncologists are specialists who treat cancer with ionizing radiation. This radiation may be given externally (external beam radiation therapy) or internally through the placement of small radioactive pellets into the prostate (brachytherapy)."
What is an infraorbital nerve block?,"'Infraorbital nerve block is a type of anesthesia used for numbing parts of the face. There is an infraorbital nerve on each side of the face, which is responsible for sensation to the skin on the side of the face, of the lower ''eyelid'', the side of the nose, and the upper lip.''This type of anesthetic nerve block is mainly used for ''wound'' repair of the face, nose, and lip.' "
Where is the infraorbital nerve located?,"'The sensory area of the infraorbital nerve is located on the face, under the eye, on the side of the nose, and down the nasolabial fold to the upper lip. The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the 5th cranial nerve (called the trigeminal nerve), which provides sensory input to the face.\xa0''The trigeminal nerve divides into the maxillary nerve, and exits the skull and enters the face through the infraorbital canal (infraorbital foramen), becoming the infraorbital nerve.\xa0' "
What is an infraorbital nerve block used for?,'Infraorbital nerve block is used for:' Laceration and wound repair Pain relief Anesthesia to clean out chronic wounds or ulcers (debridement) Patients who need facial surgery but cannot receive general anesthetic May be used in some plastic surgery procedures on the face
How do doctors perform an infraorbital nerve block?,"'There are two approaches to performing infraorbital nerve block, through the mouth (intraoral) and outside the mouth (extraoral).\xa0''For an infraorbital nerve block performed through the mouth (intraoral):''For an infraorbital nerve block performed from outside the mouth (extraoral):''For either the intraoral or extraoral approach, the local anesthetic’s (usually ''lidocaine'') effect lasts between 30 minutes and two hours.\xa0' Topical anesthetic is applied to the inner part of the upper lip and gums  The doctor feels for the infraorbital canal (foramen) in the middle of the cheek An anesthetic is injected into the area around the infraorbital canal using a small needle from inside the upper lip After a few minutes, the area of the infraorbital nerve becomes numb and the procedure can be performed The skin over the cheek is cleansed with antiseptic The doctor feels for the infraorbital canal (foramen) in the middle of the cheek An anesthetic is injected through the skin of the cheek into the area around the infraorbital canal using a small needle  The doctor firmly massages the area for 10-15 seconds After a few minutes, the area of the infraorbital nerve becomes numb and the procedure can be performed"
What are risks and complications of an infraorbital nerve block?,'Complications that may result from an infraorbital nerve block can include the following:' Bleeding Bruising Allergic reaction to anesthetic Systemic reaction to too much anesthetic  Infection Unintentional injection into artery or vein Insufficient anesthetic use Nerve damage Eyelid swelling
How long is a cold or flu contagious?,"'Both colds and the ''flu'' are ''contagious'' and are caused by ''viruses''. However, the ''viruses'' that cause colds (for example, rhinoviruses) are not the same as those that cause the ''flu'' (''influenza'' ''viruses''). Although the typical incubation period for ''influenza'' is about one to four days, some adults can be ''contagious'' from about one day before onset of symptoms for up to two weeks. Other people who develop complications, such as ''pneumonia'', may extend the ''contagious'' period for a week or two. For colds, most individuals become contagious about a day before ''cold'' symptoms develop and remain contagious for about five to seven days. Some children may pass the ''flu'' viruses for longer than seven days (occasionally for two weeks).''Colds are considered ''upper respiratory infections''. The flu may also cause lower respiratory infections.' "
How do you know if I have a cold or the flu?,"'For both the ''cold'' and the flu, early symptoms may be similar. Symptoms and signs include a ''cough'', ''runny nose'', and feeling tired. If you know you have had contact with someone with a ''cold'' or the flu in the past few days, you should suspect you may have become infected. However, ''flu symptoms'' generally are more intense than cold symptoms. People with flu can develop ''fever'', body ''aches'', ''chills'', and ''headaches'', and some develop ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Cold symptoms are much milder and usually do not require medical care. However, if you suspect you have the flu, you should seek medical care. The flu often can be diagnosed with rapid tests available to most physicians.' "
How are cold and flu viruses spread?,"'A ''common cold'' and the flu are easily spread from person to person, the flu most often by droplets produced by ''coughing'' and ''sneezing''. Cold viruses in droplets are spread mainly hand to hand. These droplets contain the infectious viruses. Occasionally, these droplets land on various surfaces and, depending on the survivability of the virus type, can be transferred when an uninfected individual touches the contaminated surface and subsequently touches his/her mouth or nose.' "
How do you know if the flu or cold is gone?,"'In most instances, individuals with a cold will resolve their symptoms without medical intervention in about one week, although sometimes the ''cough'' may last longer. However, at this point in time, the ''cough'' is not spreading contagious virus. When cold symptoms and signs resolve, a person is cured of a cold. The flu is similar except that the symptoms are more severe and, in some individuals, medical intervention may be required (for example, antiviral medications). However, depending upon the ''influenza'' strain and the severity of infection, some individuals may require hospitalization. The cure for these individuals occurs when symptoms resolve and the patient is discharged from the hospital.''The ''stomach flu'' is not caused by cold or by flu viruses. The term ''stomach flu'' is a nonspecific term that describes symptoms of ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Although these symptoms may occur with the flu, the flu is a ''respiratory infection''. In most individuals with only ''stomach flu'', the causes are usually non-flu type viruses. Similarly, ''cold sores'' are not actually caused by cold viruses but by herpesviruses.' "
When should someone seek medical care for a cold or the flu?,"'Unless the person has medical problems, such as a ''depressed'' immune system, most individuals do not need to seek medical care for a cold. However, individuals with the flu may need to seek medical care under the following conditions:''If there is any question as to whether or not you have a cold or the flu, especially during flu season, you should seek medical care.'   Fever that is continual or becomes high Shaking chills Coughing that produces bloody sputum and/or a greenish-yellow color Difficulty breathing Chest pain or chest pressure Repeated nausea and vomiting Confusion Facial pain"
How long can a person live with multiple myeloma?,"'Multiple myeloma'' is a ''cancer of bone'' marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside the long bones.\xa0''In this ''cancer'', plasma cells (a type of white blood cell) accumulate in the bone marrow, giving rise to tumors in multiple bones of the body. Normal plasma cells make antibodies that help the body fight against infection and various diseases. An increase in the number of multiple ''myeloma'' cells crowds out the normal cells and destroys them.''Multiple myeloma is discovered through routine blood screening when patients are being evaluated for other problems such as frequent infections.\xa0''Since 2000, the percentage of patients living five years after diagnosis has been on the rise. With improved treatment, survival results are likely to be better.\xa0''According to the American ''Cancer'' Society, the median survival rates are as follows:''Remember, these survival rates are only estimates. They cannot predict the exact period you can live with multiple myeloma. How long you can survive depends upon your body’s response to ''cancer'' therapy. Discuss with your doctor to better understand your specific situation.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma?,"'Multiple myeloma can be without symptoms, with multiple symptoms or can have complications that require emergent treatment. Presenting signs and ''symptoms of multiple myeloma'' include the following:''Multiple myeloma can cause ''hypercalcemia'' (increased blood calcium levels) whose signs and symptoms are:''In one-third of patients, multiple myeloma is diagnosed after the patient complains of frequent fractures. Two-thirds of patients complain of bone ''pain'', commonly ''lower back pain''.\xa0' Fractures Bone pain Weakness Exhaustion  Bleeding Easy bruising Anemia Frequent infections Weight loss Nerve damage Bowel or bladder incontinence Loss of appetite Nausea or vomiting Feeling thirsty Frequent urination Constipation Feeling very tired Muscle weakness Restlessness Confusion or trouble thinking"
What causes multiple myeloma?,"'The exact cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. But you are at slightly higher risk if you have:''Contact with chemicals used in rubber manufacturing, woodworking, or firefighting or in herbicides' Age >65 years Male gender African American lineage Family member history of multiple myeloma Obesity Exposure to radiation Exposed to certain viruses"
What are the complications of multiple myeloma?,"'Multiple myeloma can cause such problems as the following:' Renal failure is seen in 25% of patients with multiple myeloma. Anemia, neutropenia (low white blood cell count), or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) due to the abnormal growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow.  Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot inside the blood vessel. Raynaud phenomenon is a condition resulting in discoloration of the fingers and/or the toes after exposure to changes in temperature (cold or hot) or emotional events. Severe bone pain Spinal cord compression: As many as 20% of patients develop spinal cord compression at some point of their disease. Symptoms typically include back pain, weakness, or paralysis and numbness in the legs.  Bacterial infection is the leading cause of death in patients with myeloma. The highest risk is in the first two to three months of chemotherapy. Hyperviscosity syndrome (thickening of the blood): Easy bruising, bleeding in the eye, heart problems, seizures, and confusion may occur because of hyperviscosity syndrome. Hypercalcemia may cause increased urination (polyuria) and increased thirst (polydipsia), muscle cramps, constipation, and a change in the patient’s mental status."
What is PRK surgery?,"'PRK (''photorefractive keratectomy'') is a type of laser surgery used to correct refractive errors such as ''myopia'', ''hyperopia'', and ''astigmatism''. PRK was the first type of ''laser eye surgery'' for vision correction. ''LASIK'' was introduced after PRK and became more popular than PRK.\xa0PRK has several advantages over ''LASIK'' for some patients but it takes longer to recover from PRK than LASIK.''The ''cornea'' and natural ''lens'' of the eye bend and focus light on the retina and create images on the retina for vision. This bending and focusing of light are also known as refraction. Refraction is affected in refractive errors, causing blurred or distorted vision. PRK replaces the need to use ''eyeglasses'' or ''contact lenses''.''PRK\xa0surgery may be done to correct one of these refractive errors:' Nearednsightess(myopia): Difficulty seeing distant objects.  Farsightedness (hyperopia): Difficulty with near vision.  Astigmatism: Curvature of the cornea or lens is uneven, leading to distorted or blurred vision."
How is PRK surgery performed?,'The procedure is done under local anesthesia using anesthetic eye drops and a mild sedative may be administered. The procedure is short and takes around 15 minutes for both eyes. The surgeon uses a programmed excimer laser beam over the eye. The laser energy removes small microscopic amounts of tissue from the top layers of the cornea is ablated (removed) and the cornea is reshaped. There is no ''pain'' or discomfort during the procedure except a feeling of pressure in the eye. The treated cornea is covered with a bandage contact lens for a few days till the cornea heals.\xa0' 
How long after PRK does vision improve?,"'It can take up to three months for the vision to be completely clear, sharp, and stable. Most patients achieve 20/20 vision.''A vision reaches 20/40 or better during this time in most patients.''Patients are advised to wear anti-glare ''sunglasses'' for at least a year after surgery when exposed to bright light and outdoors during the day.\xa0' Immediately after the procedure: Patients can go home soon after the procedure, once the sedation wears off, but should not drive.   Antibiotic and anti-inflammatory eye drops are prescribed. Pain killers may be prescribed.  The patient is advised to rest the eyes for a few hours at home. They may also take a nap.  Watching television or reading should be avoided Makeup and skincare products should be avoided over the skin around the eyes Patients may take a shower 24 hours after surgery. The doctor may suggest a special shield to be worn to protect the eyes  Patients may continue to experience pain and discomfort which can be relieved by over-the-counter painkillers. Patients continue wearing the bandage contact lens to protect your cornea as it heals.  Patients should avoid exercising and excessive sweating, as sweat may enter the eye. Even mild exercise can delay healing. Patients begin to experience side effects of the procedure:Watering of eyesSensitivity to lightForeign body sensation in the eye Blurring of visionDryness of eyesItching Watering of eyes Sensitivity to light Foreign body sensation in the eye  Blurring of vision Dryness of eyes Itching The bandage contact lens would be removed by the doctor if healing is satisfactory Once the bandage contact lens is removed, patients notice an obvious improvement in the vision, depending on the severity of refractive error before surgery. Vision continues to improve over the next several weeks. Patients may resume work depending on their comfort level and nature of the job, after consulting with the surgeon. Patients can resume driving again if comfortable, Patients may experience glares (difficulty in seeing in the presence of bright light), halos (bright circles around a light source), starbursts, haziness, and difficulty seeing in the dark. These usually resolve seven to 10 days after surgery.  Patients can use wear makeup and other skincare products 10 days after surgery.  Patients should avoid strenuous, high-impact, or contact sports, like running, soccer, football, basketball  or wrestling because they increase the risk of injury to the eye, infection, and delay healing.  Patients should avoid using a jacuzzi, swimming or any activity other than showering that might get water and chemicals like chlorine in the eye.  The eyes should be protected from dust and pollutants. Activities that increase the risk of pollutants in the eye should be avoided like gardening, cleaning, construction sites, etc.  Vision continues to improve.  The doctor may prescribe eye drops to be used in the first month to reduce the risk of corneal haze, a common side effect from PRK  The eyes may still feel dry, but most other side effects, resolve by this time."
Why is a stress test done?,"'The doctor may recommend a stress test for the following:' Diagnosis of coronary artery disease: Coronary arteries are the major blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, hence delivering oxygen and nutrients to the heart. Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary arteries get damaged or diseased, especially due to the accumulation of cholesterol and other substances (plaques) in the artery. Diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia: Arrhythmia is a problem with the heart rhythm. The heartbeat may be too fast, too slow, or irregular. Arrhythmias occur due to improper coordination of the electrical impulses that help the heart function normally. Guide treatment of heart disorders: If a patient has already been diagnosed with a heart condition, an exercise stress test can help the doctor assess the progression of the heart condition and the effects of treatment, which can help establish the treatment plan accordingly. A stress test can also help plan cardiac surgery if necessary. Similarly, it may be done after six weeks of heart revascularization procedure to see how much stamina the heart has recovered. Diagnose cardiovascular health: A stress test is sometimes done in patients with diabetes and those who suffer from erectile dysfunction. The microscopic damage to small blood vessels in both these conditions may be an indicator of poor heart reserve as well."
How is a stress test performed?,"'Before a stress test:'' The doctor obtains a detailed history and performs a physical examination. The doctor would advise certain pre-procedure instructions. You may have to skip certain medicines on the day of the test.''During a stress test:'' Your entire stress test, including the prep time, would take about 45 minutes to an hour. The actual test takes only around 15-20 minutes. The patient would have to walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bicycle. As time passes, both the treadmill slope and speed increase at a fixed time interval.''Any patient who is unable to exercise would receive ''drugs'' through veins that would mimic the effects of exercise by increasing blood flow to the heart.''The nurse or technician will place electrodes on the chest, legs, and arms. Some areas of the body may need to be shaved to help the electrodes stick. The electrodes are connected to an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'') machine, which records the electrical signals from the heart. A cuff is placed on the upper arm to monitor blood pressure during the test. Throughout the test, your blood pressure, ECG, and heart rate are recorded.''The patient continues exercising till the heart rate reaches the target set or till any of the following signs and symptoms occur (Your target heart rate is calculated by the system based on your age and weight.):''The test is safe and performed under supervision. The patient may stop anytime they feel uncomfortable.''After a stress test: ''After the patient finishes exercise, they may be asked to stand still for several seconds and then lie down for some time while still being monitored. The doctor would observe for any abnormalities in heart rate and breathing while returning to normal. Once a stress test is complete, the patient can return to their normal activities unless they are advised otherwise. Studying the results of the stress test would help the doctor make a diagnosis and advise an appropriate treatment plan.'

What is a pacemaker?,"'A pacemaker or an implantable ''cardioverter''-''defibrillator'' is a small, battery-operated medical device that electrically stimulates the ''heart'' muscles. Its function is to restore the normal heart rhythm. Pacemaker surgery is a procedure in which the pacemaker is implanted. It can be performed in children (pediatric cases) and adults. The pacemaker senses the heart rhythm and paces (regulates) the heart only when needed, i.e., when the heart rhythm is abnormal (too slow, too fast, or irregular).' "
Why would a child need a pacemaker?,"""A child may require a\xa0pacemaker if the heart's natural\xa0pacemaker\xa0(the sinoatrial or SA node) is not working normally. Cases where the heart rhythm is abnormal or if the electrical pathways originating in the heart are blocked may also need a pacemaker.""'The heartbeat normally originates at a part called sinus node or sinoatrial (SA) node in the ''right atrium'' (right upper chamber) of the heart. In some developmental anomalies, the sinus node may be present at a different location or there may be another focus of electrical activity. Such anomalies cause an abnormal heart rate or rhythm and need pacemaker implantation.''Pacemaker surgery helps to restore the normal heart rhythm and improve ''heart function'' and blood circulation through the body. Pacemaker implantation is indicated in the following conditions:' The most common indication for pacemaker surgery is SA (sinoatrial) and/or AV (atrioventricular) nodes dysfunction. In children, the cause of SA or AV node dysfunction is usually congenital heart defects (birth defects). SA or AV node dysfunction may occur following certain surgical procedures.  Abnormally fast heart rates. Heart valves that leak (regurgitation). Abnormal thickening of the heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).  Poor heart function. "
How is pacemaker surgery performed?,"'Pacemaker implantation is performed under general anesthesia.\xa0''A pacemaker system consists of three main parts: the pulse generator, pacing leads, and electrodes.\xa0''The pacemaker stimulates the heart by suppressing all other foci of electrical activity in the vicinity. Once the surgeon sees that the pacemaker functions properly, he ''sutures'' (''stitches'') the incision site.' The pulse generator contains the battery which regulates the pacemaker. It is small that measures approximately 2"" × 2"" × 0.25” and weighs around 20-30 g. It is placed under the skin below the left collar bone. The pacing leads are flexible, insulated wires that carry electrical impulses from the pulse generator to the heart and vice versa. They are inserted through the blood vessels leading to the heart.  Electrodes are found at the end of each wire and deliver the electrical impulses to the heart. "
What happens after pacemaker surgery?,"'Postoperatively, patient is administered with ''pain'' killers and antibiotics. The patient’s vital parameters like heart rate, ''blood pressure'', and heart functions are monitored. Most patients are discharged 24 to 72 hours after surgery.\xa0''The pacemaker cannot be felt and does not cause ''pain''. The generator of the pacemaker system is placed under the skin and maybe felt initially, but once the surgical incisions heal, there is usually no discomfort.\xa0''Patients are advised to avoid close contact with devices that produce magnetic fields like ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'') machines and other electrical devices such as cell phones or household appliances like microwave ovens.\xa0' "
What are the complications of pacemaker surgery?,"'Though the risk of complications because of pacemaker surgery is low, some complications that may be encountered include:' infection bleeding displacement of leads or electrodes"
What about the peeing frequency in bottle-fed infants?,"'The amount of urine that the newborn produces depends on the amount of fluid they drink.''If the baby’s feeding frequency goes up to more than 2 ounces of formula every 3 hours, they may urinate more, and the mother may see more wet diapers. If the baby is sleepy and consumes less liquid, the urination frequency gets lower.' "
What causes a newborn to pee less?,"'The newborn may urinate less if''Highly concentrated urine (due to less liquid intake) can cause the urine to appear pink and make the mother mistake it for ''blood in the urine''. In such cases, mothers need not worry if the baby is wetting at least four diapers a day.' It is summer. The climate is extremely cold. They have a fever. They are not drinking enough liquids (breast milk or formula milk). The darker the color, the more concentrated is the urine."
When to call the doctor?,"'The inability of the baby to communicate makes it difficult for the mothers to recognize the troubles that the baby is facing. Hence, it is necessary to either call the child specialist (pediatrician) right away or visit them if the mother spots certain signs in the baby that include:''Signs of ''dehydration'':''The pediatrician assesses the child completely to see if the problem is due to a ''urinary tract infection'' or some other abnormality.' Fewer than four wet diapers in 24 hours Dark yellow/orange/pink/red, concentrated, smelly urine that is also less in quantity Actual red spot on the diaper Dryness of lips and tongue The sinking of the soft spot (known as sunken fontanelle) on top of the baby's head Poor feeding"
What is a percutaneous drain?,"'A percutaneous drain is a small ''plastic'' tube that is sent into the body through the skin on the abdomen. This is typically performed through a very small incision. The procedure is usually done under the guidance of X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or ''ultrasound'' (sound waves). Placing the drain using live images is much safer and involves less recovery time than conventional surgery. Some reasons why percutaneous drain may be required include:' Percutaneous drain help in removing fluid from the intestine, pancreas, bile ducts, or the urinary tract if leaks are diagnosed It helps in resolving blockage in the urinary system, which may cause kidney problems, infections, or both. It helps in draining infected blood under the skin. It also helps in draining abscess (pockets of fluid that are infected or may become infected)"
How is the percutaneous drainage procedure performed?,"'The percutaneous drainage procedure may vary depending on why it is required.''Risks and complications:\xa0' Usually, the patient may be placed under local anesthesia to numb the pain. Patient vitals are monitored throughout the procedure. The radiologist will clean the skin with antiseptic to help avoid infection. A small cut is made and the tube is inserted under the guidance of radiological equipment, such as X-ray, CT, or ultrasound. Most of the time, a guidewire will be placed into the abscess to allow the correct positioning of a drainage tube (catheter). This will be connected to a drainage bag. The pus or fluid may simply be drained through a needle or plastic tube, which is then withdrawn altogether. Alternatively, it may be necessary to place a larger drainage tube into the abscess or fluid and attach it to the skin so that it can continue to drain for some days. The procedure may be completed within an hour depending on the patient’s condition. Generally, placing the catheter in the affected area only takes a short time, and once in place, it should not hurt at all. Post-procedure, the patient’s vitals are monitored until the anesthesia effect subsides. The patient may need to stay inward bed for a few hours until they recover If the drainage catheter has been left in the body for the time being, then it may be attached to a collection bag. It may need to be emptied occasionally so that it does not become too heavy. Percutaneous drainage is normally a safe procedure; however, every procedure has its own risk, which may include: Anesthesia risks like allergy, vomiting, or dizziness Pain Infection at the site of the procedure Excessive bleeding Damage to adjacent structures or underlying nerve (very rare) Shivering attack (a rigor) The tube may come out and the patient may remove it intentionally or unintentionally, which may require the repair procedure."
What does altitude sickness do to your body?,"'AMS happens if the body is not able to adjust to the low air pressure and low oxygen at high altitudes. The low oxygen (''hypoxia'') levels in the air and blood cause the blood vessels of the brain to swell (dilate). The dilated blood vessels in the brain may cause ''headaches'' and swelling of the brain. The swelling puts pressure on the brain, squeezing it against the skull.\xa0''Altitude sickness may rarely advance to a more severe form of the illness called high altitude cerebral ''edema'' (HACE). HACE occurs when brain swelling becomes severe manifesting as ''headache'', ''confusion'', lethargy, lack of coordination, irritability, ''vomiting'', ''seizures'', ''coma'' and eventually death if untreated.''Severe altitude sickness may cause the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in the ''lungs'' to become swollen and leaky. This leads to an accumulation of fluid in the air sacs of the lungs. This condition is known as ''high altitude pulmonary edema'' or HAPE. HAPE severely decreases the exchange of oxygen in the lungs which may cause ''breathing'' difficulties and even death. If left untreated it may progress to severe breathlessness even at rest, a persistent ''cough'' sometimes with blood, ''chest tightness'' and severe ''weakness''. Ultimately, it advances to confusion, unconsciousness and death.' "
What are the first signs of altitude sickness?,"'The initial symptoms of altitude sickness are:''These initial symptoms, if left untreated, may progress to severe breathlessness, ''cough'', ''vomiting'', confusion and unconsciousness.' Headache Nausea Feeling uneasy or sick Shortness of breath Tiredness or fatigue Dizziness"
Does drinking extra water prevent altitude sickness?,"""While staying hydrated is essential at high altitudes, drinking water over your requirement may not help you. Practically, you may only need an additional liter to a liter and a half of water at altitude. Too much water can harm you by diluting your body's sodium level (""'hyponatremia''). This may lead to weakness, confusion, ''seizures'' and eventually ''coma''. An easy way to assess hydration is to check your urine. If the urine is clear or pale yellow, it indicates adequate hydration. ''Dark urine'' suggests ''dehydration'' and the requirement for drinking more water.''You may prevent altitude sickness by:' Moving slowly towards a higher altitude. This may help your body acclimatize or get adjusted to the decreasing air pressure and oxygen with altitude. Staying hydrated Taking adequate rest Avoiding strenuous workout for the first 24 hours Avoiding smoking and alcohol Avoiding alcohol or sleeping pills Taking preventive medications such as acetazolamide or nifedipine  Following the dictum “Climb high and sleep low,” meaning if you climb more than 1,000 feet in a day, come down to sleep at a lower altitude Include more than 70% carbohydrates in your diet."
What is a biliary stent?,"'A biliary ''stent'' is a ''plastic'' or metal tube inserted into a bile duct. Biliary stenting is a procedure that opens the obstructed bile duct. Obstructed bile duct leads to the accumulation of bile in the ''liver'' resulting in yellowing of the skin (''jaundice''), ''dark urine'', light stools, ''itching'', ''nausea'' and poor appetite.\xa0''The following may cause bile duct obstruction:' Pancreatic cancer Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Gallstones Radiation therapy Injury to abdomen Cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts)"
When should a biliary stent be avoided?,'Insertion of a biliary stent should be avoided in patients with the following conditions:' Bleeding disorder Ascites (accumulation of fluid in the liver) Uncooperative patients Patients intolerant to pain
How is a biliary stent placed?," Refrain from eating or drinking for at least six hours before the surgery to ensure that the stomach and the intestine remain devoid of food.  Inform the physician about your medical and medication history, especially an allergy to iodine. Stop taking the following medicines before the surgery:Coumadin (warfarin)AspirinClopidogrelArthritis medications Coumadin (warfarin) Aspirin Clopidogrel Arthritis medications Antibiotics will be given before the surgery and continued afterward for several days. The stent might be placed a few days after the biliary drainage procedure.  Stent placement can be achieved simultaneously with an uncomplicated percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography surgery. An introducer sheath or a short plastic tube carrying the stent delivery system is passed into the biliary system using a stiff wire.  The stent delivery system is then passed along the wire, and the stent is placed.  Balloon dilation helps to achieve sufficient expansion. After the procedure, you will be monitored for signs of complications.  You need to lie on your right side for at least six hours to reduce the risk of bleeding.  To ensure the proper functioning of the stent, you will be frequently assessed for changes in stool or urine color, jaundice, itching and abnormal liver functions, which indicates a narrowing of the bile duct. "
How long can you leave a biliary stent in?,"'A biliary stent needs replacement after three to six months to avoid inflammation of the bile ducts (Cholangitis). Biliary ''stents'' staying more than three years can result in serious repercussions, which can be managed by surgical intervention only. A stent that has been left in the biliary system hardens over time and can result in''Hence, it is necessary to replace the stent in the stipulated time.' Foreign body reaction around the stent, resulting in biliary stones Stent blockage Pancreatitis Stent moving from its inserted position "
Do biliary stents cause pain?,"'Occasionally, stents can cause discomfort when placed, which might disappear after a few days. However, the stent may sometimes result in inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). This can result in ''back pain''.' "
What is ALS?,"'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease) is a progressive and fatal disease, attacking the cells in the nervous system (neurons) that control voluntary movement. Jean-Martin Charcot, a French ''neurologist'', discovered the disease in 1869.''The nerve cells that control the voluntary movement are called motor neurons. This disease affects and kills motor neurons over time. Neuronal death results in the inability of the brain to control the muscles of the body. This leads to a progressive decline in the ability to talk, write, pick up or hold things, swallow, and ultimately breathe (processes controlled by the muscle).\xa0''Presently there is no cure for ALS. People with this disease have a shortened lifespan and may die within a few years of diagnosis. ALS most commonly affects whites, males, and people over the age of 60 years.' "
How does a person get ALS?,"'ALS has two types:''Sporadic ALS (SALS)'' is the most common form of the disease in the United States. It accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases of ALS. The cause of sporadic ALS is unknown. Various factors implicated in the causation of ALS are:''Familial ALS or (FALS)'' is seen in 5 to 10% of all ALS cases in America. People with familial ALS inherit the disease through genes. In the families with ALS, there is a 50% chance each child will inherit the gene carrying the disease and may develop ALS.' Sporadic ALS (SALS) Familial ALS (FALS).  Glutamate: built up of a substance called glutamate damages the nerve cells. Smoking Exposure to environmental toxins (e.g., in soldiers during the war) Exposure to heavy metals like lead Oxidative stress (substances released during the wear and tear of the body damage the body if accumulated over long time) Immunity problems: The body makes proteins and mounts an attack against the proteins of its own."
Can ALS be prevented?,"'There is no definitive ''prevention'' method for ALS. People with ALS, however, may participate in ''clinical trials'', the National ALS Registry and the National ALS Biorepository. Through their participation, they can help researchers learn about the likely causes and risk factors for ALS.\xa0' "
Can ALS be cured?,"'There is no cure available for ALS presently. The disease essentially has a progressive and fatal course. Once the disease process begins there is a continuous decline in the ability to talk, write, pick up or hold things, swallow, and ultimately breathe. Research is being actively done the world over to develop more treatment options and a definite cure for ALS.\xa0''Currently, four ''drugs'' are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat ALS:''Although these drugs cannot cure ALS, they can help improve a person’s life expectancy and quality of life.''People with ALS may experience a better quality of life by seeking care in multidisciplinary ALS clinics. These clinics provide specialty care to people living with ALS. Care provided through the multidisciplinary ALS clinics may also increase the lifespan of people living with the disease.''Additionally, participating in support groups for ALS can also help in improving the quality of life for ALS patients.\xa0' Riluzole Nuedexta Radicava Tiglutik"
What is end-stage cystic fibrosis?,"'End-stage cystic fibrosis is characterized by fluid-filled sacs (''cysts''), pus-filled pockets (abscesses), and hardening (fibrosis) of ''lungs'' and airways. At this stage, you have to rely on external oxygen support to breathe adequately. Lung transplantation can offer a ray of hope in this condition to improve your chances of survival and quality of life. There are 50% chances that you will survive for at least five years after the transplant.' "
What are the main treatments for cystic fibrosis?,"'There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a range of treatments can help ease the symptoms and help you live a ''longer life'' with improved quality.

You can participate in one if you are looking for better treatment options.' Airway clearance: Certain airway clearance techniques, also known as chest physical therapy, can help loosen thick, sticky mucous and help you to cough up easier. Medication: Your doctor may prescribe many medications to prevent or fight infections (antibiotics), help your lungs clear sticky mucus (inhaled bronchodilators), lessen the swelling in your lungs (anti-inflammatory drugs), and for some people, help correct the underlying cause of the disease (medicines that target genetic mutation). Fitness plan: This is a part of pulmonary rehabilitation and includes physical exercises that improve your muscle strength, cardiovascular and respiratory fitness, as well as your mood. Nutritional therapies: These include a high-calorie, high-protein, and energy-dense unrestricted diets to replenish the lost nutrients due to poor absorption by the digestive system. You may have to take pancreatic enzymes supplements to improve your digestive capacity and nutritional intake. Vaccinate yourself regularly (such as taking annual flu vaccine) Maintain hygiene (by washing your hands frequently) Quit smoking Take time to learn about cystic fibrosis Spend time with your family and friends Find a cystic fibrosis support group"
What are heart valve diseases?,"'The heart has two upper (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). There are certain structures, called valves, present in the heart to regulate the flow of blood into, within, and out of the heart. These valves are flaps present at specific junctions in the heart. They help maintain the flow of blood in the heart in one direction. In ''valvular heart disease'', the heart valve may become narrow (valve stenosis) or weak (valve regurgitation). Both stenoses as well as regurgitation increases the load on the heart.''Heart valve disease'' may be seen at birth or it may develop later in life due to age-related changes in the heart. Valvular ''heart disease'' (VHD) comprises a number of heart conditions that account for 10% to 20% of all cardiac surgical procedures in the United States.''The valvular heart diseases include:''The valvular ''heart disease'' may also result from infections like ''rheumatic fever'', which may be seen in childhood ''cancer'' survivors, who had chest ''radiation'', or after a ''heart attack''.''Mild valvular ''heart disease'' often goes unnoticed.

How long can you live with HIV?,"'There is no generalized definitive period for which a person with ''HIV'' can live. In the case of an untreated ''HIV'' infection, the overall mortality rate is more than 90%. The average time from infection to death is eight to ten years. This may; however, vary from person to person. Many factors affect survival:''With the increasing use of antiretroviral\xa0therapy (ART) and the introduction of better antiviral regimens, survival with HIV infection has increased over time. The survival, however, is not yet equivalent to that in uninfected individuals.' Genes Mental health Drug or alcohol abuse Superinfection with another HIV strain Nutrition Age Treatment"
What are the four stages of HIV?,"'HIV infection can present in the following four stages:''Acute HIV infection''Chronic HIV infection''Moderately symptomatic stage''AIDS' This is the earliest stage of HIV infection. It appears generally within two to four weeks after HIV infection. The symptoms during this stage include:FeverHeadacheRashBody acheSore throatHeadacheSwollen lymph nodes (glands that protect from infections; they can be felt when swollen in the armpits, groin and neck) Fever Headache Rash Body ache Sore throat Headache Swollen lymph nodes (glands that protect from infections; they can be felt when swollen in the armpits, groin and neck) In the acute stage, the virus multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body. HIV targets and destroys the CD4 cells (the infection-fighting cells of the immune system); in this stage of HIV infection, the level of HIV in the blood is very high. The high levels increase the risk of HIV transmission or spread. This is the best stage to start ART because this stage gives significant health benefits. This is the stage of asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency. In this stage, the symptoms of stage one go away but the HIV infection continues to multiply in the body, though at very low levels. The symptoms subside as the virus overpowers the immune system and progressively kills the CD4 cells to destroy the body’s immunity. If ART is not given, a chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer. In some people, however, it may advance faster. If ART is administered, the person may stay in this stage for several decades. Although it is still possible to transmit HIV to others during this stage, taking ART exactly as prescribed will maintain an undetectable viral load in the person. So, they have an effectively negligible risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex. In this stage, due to disease progression, certain symptoms appear:Weight loss that is greater than 10% of the person’s total body weightProlonged (more than one month) of unexplained diarrheaTuberculosis and other severe infections of the lungs, kidney, brain, bones, and jointsYeast infectionsMouth ulcersSwollen and painful gums Weight loss that is greater than 10% of the person’s total body weight Prolonged (more than one month) of unexplained diarrhea Tuberculosis and other severe infections of the lungs, kidney, brain, bones, and joints Yeast infections Mouth ulcers Swollen and painful gums Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the final and most severe stage of HIV. In this stage, HIV reduces CD4 cell counts to very low levels (less than 200 units), which severely damages the immune system. The weak immune system cannot fight bacteria, viruses and fungi that are unable to cause diseases in other healthy people (opportunistic infections). Opportunistic infections are infections and infection-related cancers that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in people with healthy immune systems. Once a person progresses to AIDS, they have a high viral load and can transmit HIV to others very easily. In the absence of treatment, people with AIDS typically survive for about three years."
What is the window period for HIV?,"'The window period refers to the time after the HIV infection, when the presence of HIV in the blood cannot be detected by a diagnostic test. It takes a different amount of time for HIV to show up on different HIV tests. The length of the window period depends on the type of test a person takes. The advanced tests (called the fourth-generation tests) can give an accurate result within four weeks of the infection, while others may take two to three months.' "
What is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)?,'An implantable ''cardioverter''-''defibrillator'' (ICD) is an electronic device that tracks the ''heart'' rate and restores a normal rhythm if required. It is the first-line treatment for patients who are at risk of ''sudden cardiac death''. ICD is useful in reducing the death rate amongst patients suffering from:' Cardiac arrest Heart failure Reduced ejection fraction (reduced amount of blood pumped out of heart’s chambers) Specific structural heart diseases
Why do I need an ICD?,"'ICD is recommended if you had the following conditions:' Life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm or risk of having it Genetic disorders that affect the heart such as cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, or Long QT syndrome Heart failure previously Cardiac arrest Congenital heart disease"
How is an ICD implanted?,"'An ICD consists of:' A battery-powered pulse generator, which is about the size of a matchbox, is inserted in a pouch under the skin of the chest or abdomen. Electrode leads, which are connected to your heart through the veins"
How does an ICD work?,"'It detects and corrects the abnormal rhythm of the heart. It works 24 hours a day. ICD works in the following ways:' For slow heartbeats, it works as a pacemaker (to help control abnormal heart rhythms) and sends small signals to the heart. For faster heartbeats, it sends one or more large shocks (defibrillation) to correct the abnormal rhythm. New devices of ICD offer sophisticated functions and better control of heartbeats."
How long can you live with an implanted defibrillator?,"'You need to live with an ICD for the rest of your life. Hence, it is important to have regular check-ups and monitoring every three months to ensure the proper functioning of an ICD. You can resume a near-normal lifestyle.''You have to be aware of machines or activities that can affect your ICD (e.g., airport security machines or TENS (''transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'') machines. Machines with strong magnetic fields can disturb an ICD.''Ask your physician regarding the dos and don’ts after an ICD implantation.' "
What are the side effects of a defibrillator?,"'The side effects of placing an ICD are:' Arteriovenous fistula (an abnormal connection between the artery and the vein) Blood clots in the arteries or veins Injury to the lung, a collapsed lung, or bleeding in the lung cavities Developing a hole in the blood vessels Infection of the system Bleeding from the pocket Death High defibrillation shock or failure to defibrillate Rejection phenomena Oversensing or undersensing the heartbeats can lead to shocks or failure in treatment respectively Surgical complications at the incision site such as bleeding, infection, inflammation, and blood clots Obstruction of the major vein (superior vena cava) of the heart"
How long can you live with liver cancer?,"'Survival of ''cancer'' patients depends on the stage of ''cancer''. The overall survival rate of ''liver cancer'' patients is low, due to other underlying medical conditions, such as ''cirrhosis''.\xa0''Generally, a five-year survival rate for all stages of ''liver'' ''cancer'' is only 15%. However, the five-year survival rate can vary depending on the extent of cancer spread.\xa0''The five-year survival rate of cancer confined to the liver (localized liver cancer) is 28%, whereas, for cancer spread to nearby organs (regional liver cancer) and cancer spread to distant organs or tissues (distant liver cancer) is 7% and 2%, respectively.'

What are the treatment options for liver cancer?,"'The treatment options depend on the stage and type of liver cancer. The most common treatment options include:' Surgery: This option may be useful in removing part of the liver affected by cancer. Complications of surgery include bleeding, infection, or pneumonia. Liver transplant: This involves replacing the cancerous cells with healthy liver cells from a donor. Rejection of the liver transplant is the major complication of this method. Ablation therapy: This procedure involves using heat or laser to destroy the cancerous cells. Embolization: This technique uses a catheter to inject particles or beads into the blood vessels supplying the cancer cells to block it. This kills the cancerous cells. Radiation therapy: Radiation of high frequency destroys the cancerous cells. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses medications to kill cancerous cells."
What is stiff person syndrome?,"'Stiff person syndrome''/Moersch–Woltmann syndrome or SPS is an extremely rare and progressive neurological disorder that impacts the nervous system of the body. The disorder generally impacts the spine and extreme lower parts of the body. The disorder is often stimulated by emotional ''stress''. In some cases, the muscles of the neck, trunk, and shoulders may also be involved. SPS may begin as recurring (intermittent) episodes of stiffness and spasms, often precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact. Symptoms may occur gradually, spreading from the back and legs to involve the arms and neck. Abnormal postures, often hunched over and stiffened, are characteristic of the disorder; other signs and symptoms include:''Causes:' Heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch, and emotional distress Anxiety Deprived sleep and rapid eye movement due to pain Muscle stiffness in the trunk and limbs that comes and goes Back stiffness or pain An exaggerated upright posture Stiff-legged walk Severe muscle spasms in the arms and legs when the person is startled, touched, upset, or anxious Lordosis (curved lower back) and deformed joints in the body, over time Falling during sudden muscle spasms (may cause additional related problems) Abnormally slow and wide gait pattern in an effort to maintain balance The appearance of an emotionless mask (rare in SPS) Limited chest expansion, leading to difficulty breathing The cause of SPS is unknown, but it is an autoimmune disorder (malfunction of the immune system, where the body produces antibodies against its own tissues). Most patients with SPS have antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme involved in the production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an enzyme largely found in the central nervous system. GAD is a GABA-synthesizing enzyme, with two primary iso-forms GAD-65 and GAD-67. GAD-65 is primarily associated with SPS; it is also associated with diabetes mellitus, cerebellar ataxia, and limbic encephalitis. When GAD is inhibited by the anti-GAD in SPS, GABA becomes less readily available, thus reducing GABA’s inhibitory effect. This process leads to continuous stimulation of muscles by motor neurons, resulting in muscle rigidity."
How is stiff person syndrome treated?,"'Physical therapy\xa0and occupational therapy play an important part in managing stiff person syndrome (SPS) and may help with side effects of medications (such as ''weakness'') in addition to controlling symptoms of the disease. Treatment aims to control symptoms and improve mobility and function. Treatment options depend on the symptoms and severity of each person and may include:' Benzodiazepines: They are generally considered the best initial therapy for SPS. Examples include diazepam and clonazepam. These usually slow down the nervous system and may relieve muscle spasms and anxiety. Baclofen, a muscle relaxant, may be used for people in whom benzodiazepines are not effective or not well-tolerated. Some people benefit from using baclofen in addition to benzodiazepines. Corticosteroids: These are reportedly effective but have many long-term adverse effects. Immune-modulating therapies: These are usually considered in people with severe symptoms who do not experience relief with benzodiazepines and baclofen. Options may include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), and rituximab. However, studies supporting the effectiveness and safety of these therapies for SPS are limited."

Silver fillings (amalgams): These last for at least 10 to 15 years.Advantages of silver fillings: They are durable and usually outlast composite (tooth-colored) fillings. They can withstand strong forces. They are less expensive than gold and composite fillings.Disadvantages of silver fillings: Patients may not find silver fillings aesthetically pleasing. They may create a grey discoloration on the surrounding tooth. Healthy parts of the tooth also need to be removed to fit and hold silver fillings. Silver can cause the tooth to crack because generally, all teeth expand and contract in the presence of hot and cold foods and liquids. Some people may develop allergic reactions to the 1% mercury in silver amalgam fillings. Advantages of silver fillings: They are durable and usually outlast composite (tooth-colored) fillings.

Glass ionomer fillings: These last around 5 years. They are made of acrylic and a specific type of glass. They are mostly used in children and for filling below the gum line. Glass ionomers release fluoride, which can help protect the tooth from further decay. Indirect fillings: Indirect fillings are similar to tooth-colored fillings and they are created in a dental laboratory. They usually require two clinic visits before being placed. Indirect fillings may be used when there is not enough healthy tooth structure remaining to support a filling. During the first visit, decay or the old filling is removed and an impression/mold is taken of the teeth to create the indirect filling in the lab. A temporary filling is placed to protect the tooth until the filling is made in the lab. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed and the indirect filling is placed permanently.There are two types of indirect fillings. They both last over 30 years and are more durable than traditional fillingsInlays: These are similar to fillings but they lie within the tooth cusps over the chewing surface of the tooth.Onlays: These are more extensive and involve one or more tooth cusps.

The treatment can be medicinal creams or ointments, procedures, or injectables.''Medicinal creams/ointments (to be applied at home)''The following are available on a doctor’s prescription:''Procedures (to be done at a doctor’s office during the visit)''A dermatologist may perform one of these procedures that may require several sessions. These procedures include:''Antiviral injectable''If all other treatments fail, injections of an antiviral medicine (''Interferon'') are given directly into warts.''HPV'' is a chronic illness, and getting genital warts is only one of their signs. You can get rid of warts, but once you get an HPV, it stays with you forever.' Resolves warts faster. Reduces the odds of spreading the virus. Relieves any pain and itching. Podofilox (halts the growth of warts and after some time the wart falls off) Imiquimod (increases the immunity to fight off the virus) Green tea extract (contains an antiviral agent, sinecatechins)  Excision: Cutting out warts from their base. Electrocautery: Burning warts and destroying them by passing an electric current through them. Cryosurgery: Freezing warts with liquid Nitrogen till they are destroyed. Laser treatment: Destroying warts with laser light."
How often do genital warts recur?,"'Most genital warts will recur within 3 months of infection, even after getting the appropriate treatments. Once you are infected with the virus, whatever treatments you take, it never goes away from your body.''The intervals in which genital warts recur depends on' Whether you have been vaccinated (with HPV vaccine). The strength of your immunity. The virus type (strain) you have. The amount of virus in your blood."
How can you prevent the spread of genital warts?,"'You can reduce your risk of getting HPV and genital warts by taking a few preventive steps. Here is what you can do:' Get an HPV vaccine: This vaccine is for males and females between ages 9 to 26 years. This is given as three shots over 6 months, this vaccine can also help prevent certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer in women. Use a condom during sex: Wearing a latex condom may help reduce the risk of getting genital warts from infected partners. Since it does not cover the entire area, the uncovered areas can still infect you. Discuss each other’s (partner’s) health in sexual relationships: Ask your partner if they have any STDs, and you too need to discuss with them if you have any. Refrain from smoking: There is evidence that smokers have more chances of getting genital warts than non-smokers."
What is a kidney transplant?,"'A ''kidney transplant'' refers to the surgical placement of a healthy kidney from a donor into your body when your kidneys are not functioning properly. Your kidneys are vital organs involved in performing several important functions in the body such as:''Almost one-third of the adults in the United States are at risk of developing kidney diseases. Over 37 million American adults have ''kidney disease'', and most are not aware of it. Thus, by the time they are diagnosed, a lot of irreversible damage would have already occurred, and they are left with two options: ''dialysis'' or a kidney transplant. During a kidney transplant, the malfunctioning kidney is surgically removed and replaced with a healthy kidney from a donor. The donor may be a living or deceased. A kidney transplant serves several advantages such as improving the quality of life, increasing longevity, and decreasing the various dietary restrictions a person with malfunctioning kidneys has to follow. The person with the transplanted kidney generally starts feeling better after two weeks of the surgery. They will, however, need medications throughout their life to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney.'

What actually are thrombosed external hemorrhoids?,"'Hemorrhoids'' are swollen veins in the lower area of the anus/rectum. Hemorrhoids can occur inside the lining of the anus or rectum (internal hemorrhoids), or one may form at the anal opening (external hemorrhoids). A thrombosed hemorrhoid happens when ''blood clots'' become trapped inside hemorrhoid. It is a common complication of hemorrhoids. Generally, external thrombosed hemorrhoids look like dark bluish lumps. The color is due to a blood clot inside a blood vessel. Symptoms that accompany a thrombosed hemorrhoid are often more severe than normal and may include:''External thrombosed hemorrhoids may develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum. As an individual ages, the risk of external thrombosed hemorrhoids increases because the tissues that support the veins in your rectum and anus can weaken and stretch. Other causes may include:' Intense itching Burning Severe pain Redness Swelling Severe injury near the anal area Having anal intercourse Regular heavy lifting Being pregnant Being obese Straining during bowel movements Sitting for long periods of time on the toilet Having severe diarrhea or constipation Being overweight or having obesity Eating a low-fiber diet"
How are thrombosed external hemorrhoids treated?,"'If the blood clot has formed within the past 48-72 hours, the doctor may remove it from within the hemorrhoid. This is a simple procedure that may relieve pain. Patients may be under local anesthesia during the procedure. The doctor makes a small incision in the skin and removes the blood clot. ''Stitches'' are generally not needed. If more than 72 hours have passed, the doctor may suggest home treatments.' In the first 24 hours, applying an ice pack to the area can help limit the size of the clotted blood and associated discomfort. After 24 hours, gentle warmth may be applied to the area in an attempt to melt the blood clot. This will aid the body in its efforts to disintegrate the clot and resolve the lump. Use a stool softener or gentle laxatives such as fiber or Miralax (or generic) to avoid constipation. Warm baths, ointments, suppositories, and witch hazel compresses may be helpful. Over-the-counter (OTC) topical medications (acetaminophen and ibuprofen) can bring temporary relief from symptoms. These products include creams and ointments. The doctor may also prescribe additional steroid foams and suppositories. Persistent bleeding or painful hemorrhoids may require banding, ligation, or removal (hemorrhoidectomy). Surgery to remove hemorrhoids may be done if other treatments don't work. Adding fiber to your meals and drinking more water may help in faster healing."
What is the outlook of thrombosed external hemorrhoids?,"""Thrombosed hemorrhoids may most likely get better after a couple of days and resolve on its own. If it doesn't seem to be resolving, there are various treatment options to get rid of the discomfort and get back to your life. Although it is a very painful condition, it is not serious and resolves without specific\xa0treatment\xa0over several days to a week or two. No further special evaluation or\xa0treatment\xa0is needed. Rarely, if the hemorrhoid\xa0is very large, the doctor may remove some of the clot under local anesthesia.

What is a percutaneous cholecystostomy procedure?,"'A percutaneous cholecystostomy is a procedure to place a drainage catheter in the gallbladder through a tiny entry hole made in the stomach wall. The drainage tube will be connected to a collection bag which can be periodically emptied. The procedure is minimally invasive, performed with imaging guidance such as ultra-sonar scan and continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy).' "
Where is a cholecystostomy tube placed?,"'A cholecystostomy tube is placed inside the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a green, hollow, pear-sized organ beneath the ''liver''. The gallbladder stores and concentrates the bile produced by the liver. Bile fluid helps the intestine digest the ''fats'' and fat-soluble ''vitamins'' in the food.''After a meal, the gallbladder squirts the bile through ducts into the small intestine, in response to signals from the vagus nerve. After it releases the bile it becomes empty and flat, similar to a deflated balloon.' "

How long does a cholecystostomy tube stay in?,"'Cholecystostomy may be the only treatment required for cholecystitis without ''gallstones'' or any other complications. The drain will be removed, after the inflammation is resolved. The doctor usually removes the tube in about two to three weeks, after ensuring there is no further leakage.''In patients who later need a cholecystectomy, the bile drain may remain in place until the patient is stabilized and prepared for a surgery.''In some patients the drain may be left permanently in place. The drainage tube will have to be changed every six to eight weeks.' "

Detail any past medical and medication history. The patient will be given anesthesia to remain unconscious throughout the procedure. An outline or stencil to match the shape of the defect is placed on the forehead and marked. The flap from the forehead is cut out and then placed upside-down over the defect of the nose using fine stitches. To enhance the visual appearance of the reconstructed nose, the surgeon might remove bulky tissue if the flap seems too heavy or bulky. Avoid applying excessive pressure. Wound care, including cleaning with diluted hydrogen peroxide. Protection from sunlight exposure for at least six months."

What are the common symptoms of hangover?,"'Hangover'' is the combination of unpleasant symptoms experienced after ''alcohol'' consumption. The symptoms of hangover usually start the next day, and are at their worst when the alcohol level in the body first falls to zero. A few common unpleasant symptoms are as below:' Headache  Sensitivity to light and sound Rapid heartbeat Dizziness Nausea Weakness Anxiety"
What are the severe symptoms of hangover?,"'These symptoms are also called alcohol poisoning and are a medical emergency. These require hospitalization.' Continuous vomiting Slow or irregular breathing, or fewer than 8 breaths per minute A low body temperature Very pale or blue-tinged skin Confusion Fits or seizures Unconsciousness"
How long does a hangover last?,"'Symptoms generally last from 24 hours to 72 hours. They may differ from person to person. During this period, an individual may have severe mental and physical ''stress'' due to ''alcohol withdrawal''.' "
What are the seven best hangover cures?,"'There is no cure for a hangover, but there are few ways to reduce or relieve the symptoms. According to the research, seven common ways to treat a hangover include:' Drinking sufficient fluids: After severe alcohol intake and withdrawal, the body is dehydrated.  Alcohol intake induces excessive urination at best, and may also cause diarrhea, sweats and vomiting.  Getting sufficient sleep: Excessive alcohol intake can impair sleep quality and duration, which may contribute irritation and weakness on the next day. Getting plenty of sleep after heavy drinking can help the body recover. Eating carbohydrates: Alcohol causes the blood sugar levels to drop. This may cause a person to feel dizzy and weak. Drinking fruit juice with bread, rice or other foods with lots of carbohydrates may ease hangover symptoms.  Choosing the right alcohol: Whisky, red wine and tequila are dark-colored beverages which can cause severe hangover. Some research shows avoiding dark colored alcohol beverages helps in reducing hangover symptoms in a marginal way. Taking a painkiller: Aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, other brands), and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help with the headache and the overall achy feelings, but it is not recommended to take Tylenol as it induces alcohol toxic effects on liver.  Drinking coffee or tea: Taking caffeine can stimulate the brain and make us function normally, however excessive caffeine intake is not recommended.  An “eye opener” is a drink of alcohol which paradoxically reduces the effects of hangover. This habit is dangerous, and often seen in alcohol dependence. The extra dose of alcohol simply pushes the hangover/withdrawal symptoms until later. Hence such an eye-opener is discouraged."
How can we prevent hangovers?,"'The best way to prevent hangovers is to avoid alcohol entirely or drink in moderation, giving the body plenty of time to process the alcohol before consuming more. A person can limit the risk of a hangover by drinking plenty of water alongside any alcoholic beverages, or eating a meal after drinking alcohol. It is important to stay hydrated, eat nutritious food, and get plenty of rest to prevent the symptoms of hangover.' "
How long does a hysteroscopy take?,"'Hysteroscopy'' is a procedure performed by a gynecologist to inspect inside of the uterine ''cavity'' using a thin tube with a light and camera attached to it. This device is called a hysteroscope. A hysteroscopy may be performed as a diagnostic procedure to diagnose pathologies in the uterus or method for surgical treatment for uterine pathologies. This is called surgical or operative hysteroscopy. If a ''hysterectomy'' is only performed for diagnostic purposes, there is usually no ''pain'' besides mild discomfort. Hence, no anesthesia is required. Anxious patients may receive intravenous sedation. If a hysterectomy is done to perform surgical procedures, intravenous sedation or general anesthesia would be administered. Hence there would be no ''pain'' during the procedure. Patients may experience pain and discomfort after the procedure when the anesthesia wears off. Painkillers would be prescribed for this. Hysteroscopy can take anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes or longer if a surgical procedure is being performed at the same time. Surgical procedures to treat uterine pathologies can take between 30 minutes to 2 hours as well, depending on the procedure.' "
When is hysteroscopy done?,"'Hysteroscopy gives the doctor information about the patient’s ''reproductive health''. It helps the doctor study the reproductive organs of a woman up close to identify abnormalities. A sample of abnormal tissues and masses would usually be taken for testing. This procedure is called a biopsy. Sometimes, an additional surgical procedure may be performed in certain conditions.''Hysteroscopy is indicated in the following situations' To confirm the diagnosis of abnormalities that are suspected based on clinical assessment and other radiological tests, such as endometriosis, uterine adhesions, etc. Abnormal pap smear results Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding Dysmenorrhea (severe pain and cramping during periods) Intermenstrual bleeding (bleeding between periods) More than one miscarriage (loss of pregnancy) Difficulty getting pregnant Bleeding after menopause To evaluate the uterus prior to performing an abortion To diagnose and aid in the removal of uterine fibroids, uterine polyps and scarring of the uterus To undergo surgery for permanent sterilization If the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) is displaced from the uterus"
What happens during a hysteroscopy?,"'The anesthesia used in hysterectomy depends on whether the procedure is done for diagnosis or to perform a procedure. If the procedure is only performed for diagnostic purposes, no anesthesia is required. Anxious patients may receive intravenous sedation. If the procedure is performed to take a biopsy or to perform more invasive procedures, intravenous sedation or general anesthesia would be administered.''The doctor first spreads the cervix with a tool called a speculum like in a routine gynecological exam. The doctor then inserts the hysteroscopy device through the vagina, the cervix and then into the uterus. A liquid (saline) or carbon dioxide ''gas'' is passed into the uterus through the device to clean and inflate the uterus to make the diagnostic\xa0 or surgical procedures easier to perform. The procedure may take anywhere between 5 to 30 minutes depending on the procedure.' "
What happens after a hysteroscopy?,"'The recovery time after a hysteroscopy depends on why it was performed. If patients have not received anesthesia or just local anesthesia, they would be able to go home in 1 to 2 hours. Those who receive intravenous sedation or general anesthesia would have to stay in the hospital until they recover from the anesthesia, which may take a few hours to 24 hours. Painkillers and antibiotics may be administered. After the procedure, the patients may experience the following' Pain and discomfort Cramps Vaginal bleeding (usually mild) or spotting for 1 to 2 days Pain radiating to the shoulder (if carbon dioxide gas was used) Nausea Lightheadedness or giddiness"
Is hysteroscopy safe?,"'Hysteroscopy is a relatively safe procedure with minimal complications. Though rare, like any procedure there is a risk of complications, which include' Bleeding Infection Injury to the cervix or uterus Scarring of the uterus Reaction to the liquid used to clean the uterus Reaction to anesthesia"
What is open left hemicolectomy?,"'The colon or the large bowel is a part of the ''large intestine''. The colon is typically divided into:''Left hemicolectomy (left colectomy) is the surgical removal of the left side of the colon along with the fat and the surrounding ''lymph nodes''. This surgery is mostly performed for ''cancers'' of the left colon.''Other conditions where left hemicolectomy is performed include:''The left hemicolectomy surgery can be performed via the open or the laparoscopic approach:\xa0' The left half of the transverse colon (the middle straight part of the colon) The descending colon that  connects to the sigmoid colon The sigmoid colon which connects to the rectum Perforation (hole) of the colon due to trauma (e.g., gunshot injury to the abdomen) Chronic diverticular disease (small bulges in the colon) Sigmoid volvulus (twisting of the sigmoid colon) Ischemic colitis (the death of the intestinal cells because of reduced blood supply) Lower intestinal bleeding due to various causes Precancerous conditions of the colon Laparotomy (open surgery): A large incision is made into the abdomen to perform the surgery. Laparoscopic surgery: Four to five small incisions are made into the abdomen, and a long camera (laparoscope) is inserted in one of the incisions to visualize the internal structures and perform the surgery."
What makes you unfit for open left hemicolectomy?,'A surgeon will recommend you against open left hemicolectomy if you' Have severe medical comorbidities making you unfit for the surgery. Are critically ill.
What is done before left hemicolectomy?," Your surgeon will take your complete history and examine you physically.  They will ask you to undergo computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis and X-ray of the chest.  You may be asked to undergo a test known as full colonoscopy where a long tube-like camera will be inserted in your anus to visualize your colon. You will be counseled about the risks and complications of the surgery. You will be given enema either on the previous night before the surgery or on the morning of the surgery. You will be advised to have only a clear-liquid diet the day before and nothing at all for 12 hours before your operation. Only the essential medications are allowed, with a sip of water, on the morning of the operation. Your doctor will put you on antibiotics and fluids via intravenous route (IV) on the day of operation. A tube-like structure known as Foley catheter will be inserted into your bladder through your urethra to collect urine."
How long does a left hemicolectomy take?," A left hemicolectomy usually takes about two to four hours, but it may take longer depending on any complications during the procedure.   For open left hemicolectomy, an incision of about six inches is made on the left side of your abdomen. The surgeon will retrieve your left colon and cut (resect) it.  The open end of the remaining colon will be connected to the rectum (end-to-end anastomosis), or it will be opened through an incision on the skin (colostomy) which is connected to a colostomy bag for emptying of stool. The surgeon then staples or sutures and bandages the surgical wound."
What happens after the open left hemicolectomy procedure?," You are not allowed to eat for 24 hours after the surgery.  Intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotics are continued for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, you are allowed to have clear liquids as tolerated. The Foley catheter is removed on the next day of the procedure.  You will be encouraged to walk and move around after two days. You will be given a soft diet (foods that are easy to chew and swallow) as soon as you pass gas and stools. Depending upon how well you tolerate the soft diet and how fast your bowel function returns to normal, you will be discharged after three to seven days of your surgery. Follow-up is usually scheduled 10-14 days after discharge."
Is a hemicolectomy major surgery?,'A hemicolectomy is a major surgery. You may not be able to get back to normal activities for four to six weeks or even more afterward if you suffer from any of its complications.''The possible complications of open left hemicolectomy include:' Excessive bleeding  Wound infection Urinary tract infection Deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the leg) Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) Wound dehiscence (reopening of the surgical wounds) Leaking from the colon Paralytic ileus (loss of muscle functioning of the colon) Tumor recurrence Bowel obstruction  Sexual or urinary problems 
What happens during a liver biopsy?,"'A ''liver'' biopsy is a medical procedure in which a small piece of liver tissue is collected and examined under the microscope. This is the most accurate procedure to diagnose medical conditions related to the liver. Percutaneous liver biopsy is the commonest method for liver biopsy in which a long needle (called biopsy needle) is inserted through the skin of the abdomen to collect liver tissue. The tissue is examined in a laboratory under the microscope.''Before the procedure'': Your doctor may:''During the procedure:' Order some blood tests and imaging studies.

How is a median nerve block performed?,"'A median nerve block is performed as an outpatient procedure and often in an emergency room. A hand surgeon usually performs a median nerve block for surgical procedures involving the hands.''The anesthetic agents commonly used for a median nerve block are ''lidocaine'' and ''bupivacaine'' depending on the length of time that anesthesia is required. The injection is administered between the two flexor tendons in the middle of the wrist.''The doctor''The doctor will instruct the patient on caring for the hand because anesthetized extremities are at a greater risk of injury, especially with long-lasting anesthetics.' The patient lies flat with the hand appropriately positioned. The doctor does a physical examination of the hand to assess its neurovascular function. The injection site is sterilized with an antiseptic solution. May use ultrasound guidance to position the needle. Inserts the needle up to 2 cm into the skin at a perpendicular angle. Aspirates the needle to ensure that it is not inside a blood vessel. Injects 3-5 ml of the anesthetic solution. Injects another tiny quantity of anesthetic in the tissues under the skin to form a small bump (wheal) while withdrawing the needle. Massages the injection site gently to help the solution spread in the tissues. Waits for up to 10 minutes for the nerve block to take effect."
How long does a median nerve block last?,"'The duration of the median nerve block’s effects depends on the kind and quantity of anesthetic agent used.\xa0''Approximate duration of effects:''The patient may experience tingling, discomfort or pain as the median nerve block wears off.

What are the different types of miscarriage?,"'Different types of miscarriages include:' Threatened miscarriage: The symptoms of threatened miscarriage include light bleeding and cramping. With medical care, the patient may be able to prevent miscarriage. For threatened miscarriages, doctors may recommend bed rest or hormone injections or address other medical conditions in an effort to save the pregnancy. Inevitable miscarriage: Bleeding, spotting, and cramping indicate that a miscarriage is inevitable. Missed miscarriage: This is when an embryo dies but no tissue leaves the body. The patient may not even realize that they had a miscarriage until medical tests are done. Incomplete miscarriage: In this condition, an embryo dies, and some fetal tissue is passed but some remain in the womb. This may cause a lot of bleeding and cramping. Incomplete miscarriages usually require medical intervention to remove the remaining pregnancy tissues. Medication or a surgical procedure can remove the lingering material if it doesn’t leave the body naturally. Complete miscarriage: This is when the body has released all tissues related to the pregnancy. There may still be bleeding and cramping as the uterus empties. Septic miscarriage: It is a rare condition, but an untreated miscarriage could develop into a serious infection of the uterus. Recurrent miscarriage: Some women experience multiple miscarriages (this is also rare). It’s best to discuss repeated pregnancy loss with the doctor to identify possible causes and determine a treatment plan."
Can miscarriage be prevented?,"'Below are a few common ways to prevent miscarriages:' Avoid drugs, alcohol, and too much caffeine. Get regular checkups throughout the pregnancy. Address any health issues that may impact your pregnancy. Take prenatal vitamins. Make healthy lifestyle choices: Eat nutritious foods, get plenty of sleep, move your body regularly, try to manage your stress levels, and follow doctor’s recommendations on maintaining a healthy pregnancy weight. Make sure to take only the medications recommended by doctors. Any over-the-counter medicines and supplements should be prescribed by the doctor.

May intubate some patients to provide oxygen. The cardiologist Injects local anesthetic to numb the catheter insertion site in the groin. Makes a tiny incision in the skin, punctures the femoral vein and inserts the catheter. Advances the catheter gently through the vein up till it goes into the right atrium of the heart, with the guidance of ultrasoundcan images. Injects a dye to scan the heart and the coronary blood vessels through continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) images. Inserts the catheter into the left atrium through a tiny hole made in the atrial wall (septum). Inserts the catheter into the mitral valve, and inflates and deflates the balloon several times to widen the valve opening. Withdraws the catheter back through the vein and out of the puncture site. Stops bleeding at the insertion site and applies a bandage. Is monitored for a few hours in the recovery room. Will be able to resume most normal activities within a day or two. Must avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting. Will be required to undergo follow-up tests. May have to make permanent changes in diet and lifestyle."
How long does a mitral valvuloplasty last?,"'The effects of a mitral valvuloplasty may last a minimum of about two years. The procedure offers immediate relief from symptoms and improves blood flow, but is not a cure for mitral valve disease, which must be managed with regular checkups, medication and good lifestyle practices.''In otherwise healthy patients, mitral valvuloplasty may postpone mitral valve surgery for up to 10 years.

What is pneumonectomy?,"'Lungs'' are a part of the respiratory system that removes oxygen from the air and pass it into your blood. Every individual has two lungs; these lungs connect to mouth through a series of tubular structures. A pneumonectomy is a type of surgery to remove one of the lungs. It is done as a treatment for ''cancer'', injury, or infection. One lung can provide enough oxygen and remove enough carbon dioxide from the body.''Extrapleural pneumonectomy is a surgery to resect (remove) the affected lung along with its pleura (covering), ''lymph nodes'' (draining channels) of the affected side along with half the ''diaphragm''.\xa0' "
When is pneumonectomy required?,"'Lung cancer'' is the most common reason for a pneumonectomy. Sometimes a pneumonectomy is also needed for other lung diseases, some of these include:' Severe lung injury Lung tuberculosis  Infections of the lung Bronchiectasis (a disease in which there is a permanent enlargement to the bronchial tubes) Birth-related lung abnormalities Airway blockage Pulmonary metastases (cancer that has spread to the lungs from another site in the body)"
Who performs pneumonectomy?,"'Pneumonectomy is usually performed by a team of surgeons or doctors who specialize in lung operations (pulmonary surgeons/pulmonologists). During the procedure patient will lie on the side on an operating table with the arm above the head, they may probably get antibiotics to help prevent infection.' The patient will be given general or epidural anesthesia before the surgery.  The surgeon makes a cut several inches long between two ribs. The cut will go from under the arm to around the back, on the side of the lung that is being removed. The surgeon separates two ribs. In some cases, the surgeon might remove a small part of the rib. The surgeon deflates the affected lung and removes it. The surgeon may remove some nearby lymph nodes. These may help show how advanced cancer might be. The surgeon will close the ribs, muscles, and skin. A dressing will be applied over the incision. Most of the time, a chest tube will remain in the pleural space from where the lung was removed. This can later be removed when the condition improves."
What are the risks of pneumonectomy?,"'Many people who have a pneumonectomy do very well. But it is fairly high-risk surgery. Some possible complications are:' Respiratory failure A blood clot in the lung (pulmonary embolism) Infection in the lungs (pneumonia, emphysema)  Shock Complications from anesthesia (headache, drowsiness, and nausea)  Bleeding Abnormal heart rhythms Reduced blood flow to the heart Pain at the site of operation Cardiac tamponade (collection of large amounts of fluid around the heart, hampering its beating) If the patient has emphysema or chronic bronchitis (common diseases among smokers), they might experience shortness of breath during certain activities. Herniation of the heart  Bronchopleural fistula (an abnormal connection between lung and its covering)"
What is the recovery time after pneumonectomy?,"'Patients may get easily tired after the surgery. But will slowly start to recover strength. It may take several weeks to a month before they recover completely.

What is popliteal nerve block used for?,'Popliteal nerve block is used\xa0' to control pain before or after surgery in the area below the kneecap (patella) and as a regional nerve block to numb the leg in cases of severe trauma or large lacerations to the area that need to be repaired. 
How do doctors perform a popliteal nerve block?,"'Popliteal nerve block is performed by injecting local anesthetic (usually ''lidocaine'' or ''bupivacaine'') with a small needle behind the knee.\xa0''Sometimes an ''ultrasound'' machine is used to locate the nerve that runs behind the leg.\xa0''Injecting an anesthetic in the area of the nerve behind the knee will numb all the structures served by that nerve, which include the calf, shin, fibula, ankle, and foot.\xa0''The following are the usual steps for performing a popliteal nerve block:' The patient is positioned laying prone on the stomach.  An ultrasound machine is sometimes used to find the location of the nerve at the knee.  The area to be anesthetized behind the knee is draped with sterile drapes and prepped with a cleaning solution, usually betadine or chlorhexidine.  The anesthetic (usually lidocaine or bupivacaine) is slowly injected into the area around the nerve, being careful not to inject directly into the nerve or the vascular structures nearby.  After a few minutes, the patients will notice numbness in the area of the lower leg, ankle, or foot.  The area where the anesthetic was injected is cleaned again, and a sterile bandage is placed over the area.  The anesthesia (numbness) from the nerve block can last from 30 minutes to 36 hours, depending on the anesthetic used."
How long does popliteal nerve block last?,"'Popliteal nerve block performed with a short-acting local anesthetic can last between 30 minutes to one\xa0hour. When performed with long-acting local anesthetics, the nerve block can provide between 12 to 36 hours of pain relief after foot surgery.' "
What are the risks and complications of a popliteal nerve block?,"'Complications of a popliteal nerve block procedure include:' Infection: Any procedure that involves injecting medications into the skin has the potential to cause infection. This can occur if the injection site is not properly cleaned prior to the procedure.  Nerve injury: If the anesthetic medication is injected into the nerve itself, it may result in temporary or permanent damage to the nerve. The patient may have numbness, tingling, or pain, at the site of the injection if this occurs.  Allergic reaction: Most anesthetic blocks are safe and rarely cause allergic reactions. When allergic reactions occur, they can range from delayed hypersensitivity (mild itching and swelling) to full anaphylactic shock. If you have a known allergy to injectable anesthetic medications such as lidocaine or bupivacaine, discuss this with your doctor prior to receiving a popliteal nerve block.  Bleeding: Because a popliteal nerve block is performed with injectable medication, bleeding under the skin (bruise or hematoma) may occur."
What is a single-port surgery?,"'A single-port surgery is a surgery that is performed through a single port or incision (cut) in the navel. It is a minimally invasive surgery compared with traditional laparoscopic surgery.

What is a single-port cholecystectomy?,'A single-port cholecystectomy involves the removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) using a single-port laparoscopic surgery. This surgery results in less pain and a shorter hospital stay. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ situated below the ''liver'' on the upper right side of the abdomen. The main function of the gallbladder is to collect and store bile—a digestive fluid produced in the liver.' 
Why is a single-port cholecystectomy done?,'Physicians may recommend a single-port cholecystectomy to treat the following conditions:' Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) Cholelithiasis (gallstones in the gallbladder) Gallbladder polyp (a cancerous or noncancerous tumor in the gallbladder) Biliary dyskinesia (the gallbladder does not empty bile correctly) Biliary colic (dull pain in the middle to the upper right area of the abdomen)
How is a single-port cholecystectomy performed?,"'Before the procedure''During the procedure''A single-port cholecystectomy is generally performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes a 2-cm incision through the center of the navel. The surgeon accesses the abdominal ''cavity'' and blows carbon dioxide into the abdominal ''cavity''.

The bag is removed, and the incisions are closed.''After the procedure' Enlist all your medical and medication history to the physician. You need to refrain from eating eight hours before the surgery. Moreover, stop taking certain medications before the surgery. You may feel pain at the incision site, which is very common. You can take pain-reliever medications to relieve pain. You may feel nauseated or throw up after the surgery. You can resume your normal activities about a week after the surgery."
How serious is gallbladder surgery?,'The overall risk of this surgery is very low. A single-port cholecystectomy is generally safe and effective.

May use ultrasound guidance during the procedure for accurate positioning of the needle. Inserts the needle and injects a small amount of anesthetic into the tissue under the skin to raise a bump (wheal). Advances the needle through the skin wheal deeper and close to the tibial nerve. Aspirates the syringe to make sure it is not inside a blood vessel. Slowly injects the anesthetic in the space between the tibial artery and the posterior tibial nerve avoiding direct contact with the nerve. Withdraws the needle and massages the injection site gently to help the solution spread in the tissues. Waits for up to 10 minutes for the nerve block to take effect. If there is a fracture and hematoma, may also administer an injection into the hematoma."
How long does a posterior tibial nerve block last?,'The duration of the posterior tibial nerve block’s effects depends on the kind and quantity of anesthetic agent used.

What is scleral buckling?,"'Scleral buckling is a surgical procedure performed to treat ''retinal detachment'' or retinal tears. The retina is a layer inside the eye that transmits visual information to the brain. Due to some disease or ''trauma'', the retina may separate from the structures that provide it with blood supply. This is called retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is a medical emergency because it can cause irreversible ''vision loss'' if left untreated. The sclera is the white outer part of the eye and supports the eyeball. In this procedure, the surgeon attaches a piece of silicone or a sponge from the sclera to the site of retinal detachment or retinal tear. The scleral buckle works by pushing the sclera toward the retinal tear or detachment, thus repairing it. Scleral buckling may be combined with other procedures that are used to treat retinal tears and detachments like laser photocoagulation and cryopexy.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of retinal detachment?,'The signs and symptoms of retinal detachment include:' A sudden increase in the number of eye floaters Small specks are seen in the field of vision Flashes of light in the field of vision Reduced or loss of peripheral vision
How is scleral buckling performed?,"'Before surgery:''Patients are advised not to eat or drink anything for at least 6 hours before the surgery. The surgeon may also advise the patient to temporarily discontinue certain medications, such as ''anticoagulants'', as they increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery.''During surgery:''Laser photocoagulation: ''A laser beam is used to create thermal energy to ''burn'' tissue, which creates ''scar tissue'', helping seal a tear or stop fluid leakage.''Cryopexy:'' Extreme low temperature is used to freeze the outer surface of the eye, which causes ''scar'' tissue formation and seals tears and leaks.''After surgery:' Scleral buckling takes place in a surgical setting, in the operation room. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia or IV sedation along with local anesthesia administered to the eye. The surgery takes around 45 to 60 minutes. The pupils are dilated (made bigger) with eye drops. A cut is made over the outer layer of the eye, the sclera. The scleral buckle is then surgically stitched (sutured) and fixed around the sclera. The buckle supports the retina and pushes the sclera toward the middle of the eye, pushing the retina, reattaching the detached retina, and closing retina tears. To prevent a further tear or detachment of the retina, the surgeon may perform other procedures that are used to treat retinal tears and detachments like laser photocoagulation and cryopexy to reinforce the results of scleral buckling: Any excess fluid accumulated behind the retina is drained. Antibiotic eye drops are applied to prevent infection. Antibiotics and painkillers are administered The patient can go home the same day after surgery once the anesthesia wears off An eye patch may need to be worn for a few days Ice packs may be used to reduce pain and swelling Antibiotic eye drops may be prescribed for 6 weeks Pain, redness, and swelling resolves in 1-2 weeks Protective eyewear should be worn while showering to prevent soap or shampoo entering the eyes Sunglasses need to be worn during the day Excessive screen time, exercise, sports, swimming, driving, and resuming work should be avoided for a few weeks until the doctor approves Air travel and high-altitude treks should be avoided until the eye heals because high altitudes can increase eye pressure Recovery time is anywhere from 2-8 weeks."
What are the complications of scleral buckling?,"'The surgery provides good outcomes; however, there are risks associated with the surgery, which include:' Infection Diplopia (double vision) Cataract (opacification of the lens) Bleeding Glaucoma (increased eye pressure) Recurrence of retina, detachment New retinal tears"
What does D&C mean?,"'Dilatation and curettage or D&C is a short surgical procedure that is done to remove tissues from your womb (uterus) after an abortion or ''miscarriage'' or diagnose the reason for your heavy bleeding.''In the suction curettage, the doctor uses a suction machine, and the contents of the uterus are suctioned out at the pressure of 60-65 cm Hg.' "
Why does the doctor suggest D&C?,"'Your obstetrician may suggest D&C for several reasons. It is performed to' Remove remaining tissues from your womb during or after a miscarriage or abortion to avoid infection and heavy bleeding. Remove placental tissue from your womb after childbirth, thereby avoiding infection and heavy bleeding. Diagnose or treat unexplained or abnormal heavy vaginal bleeding due to fibroids, polyps, hormonal imbalances, or cancer of the uterus. The sample of womb tissue will be checked under a microscope in the laboratory for any abnormalities (biopsy). Remove a molar pregnancy (tumor)."
What happens during the procedure?,"'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:''Postprocedure care:' You will be informed not to take anything by mouth for at least 6-8 hours. You may receive sedation to put you to sleep for a short time if the procedure is performed in the hospital. If the procedure is performed in clinical settings, then you may receive some injections that will numb your cervix and will make it easier to open. Your obstetrician will place a device known as a speculum to widen the opening of your uterus (cervix) that may cause cramping. After dilating (opening) the cervix, the tissues from inside the uterus will be removed with a scraping instrument known as a curette, a suction tube, and other specialized tools. Your doctor may insert a special scope with an attached camera known as a hysteroscope, which provides a magnified view of the inside of the uterus. This is especially used when you are not pregnant and have abnormal bleeding. You may need someone to take you home. If you have received general anesthesia, then you may feel dizzy or feel nauseated and you may vomit. You may have mild cramping or slight bleeding (spotting) for a few days, which is normal. You may receive pain relievers, such as Ibuprofen or Paracetamol. You can resume daily activities within 1 or 2 days unless your doctor instructs you. Delay sex and use of tampons until your doctor instructs you to. It is normal to have some vaginal bleeding for a few days after the procedure. There may be cramping for the first few days after a D&C. You may get your periods after 4-6 weeks of the procedure."
What are the possible complications?,"'Mostly, D&C is a safe procedure, but there are some possible complications, such as' Tear or rupture of the uterus (womb) Infections Scar tissue formation Reactions to anesthesia Tears in the cervix Uterine bleeding"
What is a superficial peroneal nerve block?,"'A superficial peroneal nerve block is a procedure to anesthetize a portion of the lower leg and the upper (dorsal) foot. A line of anesthetic injections are administered at the lower end of the front of the leg at the level of the bony projections (malleoli) on either side of the ankle. The anesthetic solution blocks the nerve from transmitting ''pain'' signals from the foot to the brain.''The superficial peroneal nerve is a branch of the common peroneal nerve, also known as the common fibular nerve, which arises from the ''sciatic nerve''. Above the ankle the superficial peroneal nerve divides into two branches fanning over the upper foot.''The superficial peroneal nerve and its branches provide sensory and motor function to the lower third of the shin on the outer side, and the top of the foot and toes, except the web space between the big and its adjacent toe.'

What is a supraclavicular nerve block?,"'A supraclavicular nerve block is a procedure to block the sensation in the arm below the shoulder. An anesthetic injection is administered in the area above the collarbone (clavicle) close to the network of nerves (brachial plexus) that provides sensation to the upper extremities. An alternative to supraclavicular nerve block, the interscalene nerve block, is also used to anesthetize the same array of nerves. In an interscalene block, the injection is administered in the neck, closer to the nerve roots.''An interscalene block provides more effective anesthesia to the shoulder but may not effectively block some parts of the hand and fingers. With sufficient anesthetic, a supraclavicular nerve block can diffuse to the shoulder area as well.''A supraclavicular nerve block is the quickest and most effective block for the entire arm because the nerves are tightly packed in the targeted anatomical region (brachial plexus). This approach also carries less chances of blocking the phrenic nerve, which is responsible for the ''diaphragm''’s function that is crucial for ''breathing''.''History and development''The supraclavicular nerve block was first introduced in 1911. Originally, however, the procedure carried a high risk for ''lung collapse'' (''pneumothorax'') because the lung is near the injection site. With the use of ''ultrasonography'' for visualizing the needle tip, blood vessels in the region, and the lung’s protective membrane (pleura), ''pneumothorax'' risk is now greatly reduced.' "
Why is a supraclavicular nerve block performed?,"'A supraclavicular nerve block is usually performed prior to surgeries and for post-operative ''pain'' relief (analgesia) in the upper extremities. It may be combined with a wrist block for increased effect in the hand and fingers.''The supraclavicular nerve block may also help manage ''chronic pain'' from rheumatoid and ''degenerative arthritis''. Along with painkillers, steroids can be injected to reduce inflammation.''A supraclavicular nerve block is avoided in the following situations:' Infection in the injection site Allergy to local anesthetics Presence of splint, cast or dressing in the area Bleeding disorder Systemic infection"
How is a supraclavicular nerve block performed?,"'A supraclavicular nerve block may be performed as an outpatient procedure for chronic ''pain management''. Supraclavicular nerve block performed before surgery and for post-surgical ''pain'' may involve hospitalization for a day or two, depending on the complexity of the surgery.''The doctor, who may be a hand surgeon or general surgeon' The patient lies flat or semi-reclines, with their face turned away from the side where the nerve block is administered. The injection site is sterilized with antiseptic. Mild sedation may be administered. The patient’s heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen levels are monitored. Uses ultrasound guidance during the entire procedure for accurate positioning, angle of the needle, and administration of the anesthetic. May use a nerve stimulator to confirm the correct location of the nerve by producing a tingling sensation (paresthesia). Inserts the needle and injects anesthetic. Aspirates the needle to ensure the needle has not punctured a blood vessel. Tells the patient to take a deep breath to make sure the pleura is not punctured. Advances the needle close to the brachial plexus, making sure to avoid hitting the nerve directly. Injects the anesthetic slowly. Withdraws the needle and waits approximately 10 minutes for the nerve block to take effect. Inserts a thin flexible tube (catheter) through the needle, to provide continuous post-surgical pain relief, if required for more extended periods. The patient will be monitored for a few hours. Recovery will depend on the type of surgery performed."
How long does a supraclavicular nerve block last?,"'The duration of the effects of a supraclavicular nerve block depends on the type of anesthetic agent used.' During surgery, mepivacaine provides fast-acting anesthesia, which sets in within five minutes and lasts up to three hours. For post-surgical pain relief, ropivacaine or bupivacaine is used, which may take up to 20 minutes to take effect but lasts for more than 12 hours. For chronic pain relief associated with inflammation, a combination of methyl prednisolone and bupivacaine may provide relief for months."
What are the risks and complications of a supraclavicular nerve block?,"'Complications include the following:' Pneumothorax, though this risk is very low with ultrasonography Hematoma Infection at the injection site Nerve injury resulting in neuropathy Injury to blood or lymphatic vessels Hoarse throat because of accidental block of the laryngeal nerve Local anesthetic systemic toxicity Anesthetic spreading to sympathetic nerves, leading to Horner syndrome, a condition affecting one side of the face with symptoms such as:Drooping eyelidConstricted pupilLocalized lack of sweating Drooping eyelid Constricted pupil Localized lack of sweating Paralysis of the diaphragm Phrenic nerve palsy (asymmetrical elevation of the diaphragm)"
What is a supraorbital nerve block?,"'A supraorbital nerve block is a procedure to provide regional anesthesia to the area of the face from the upper ''eyelid'' to the top of the head.

These tests include''Cystometry: ''This involves inserting a long tube known as a urinary catheter into the urethra and sometimes into the rectum as well. The catheter contains a pressure-measuring device known as a manometer. The patient will be asked to empty the bladder followed by filling the bladder with warm water through the catheter.\xa0''Leak point pressure measurement:'' This test is done during the cystometry test wherein the pressure at the point of leakage is checked. It measures the amount of abdominal pressure required to cause leakage of urine from the bladder/urethra.''Postvoid residual measurement: ''The doctor inserts the catheter through the urethra up into the bladder to remove and measure the amount of remaining urine.''Electromyography: ''This test uses electrode patches known as sensors, placed on the skin near the urethra, or a catheter inserted through the urethra. These sensors record the activity of the nerves and muscles.\xa0''Uroflowmetry: ''The patient will be asked to urinate privately into a special toilet or funnel that has a container for collecting the urine and a measuring scale. The scale is connected to a computer that will measure the amount and flow of the urine.''Video urodynamic tests:'' While the patient empties their bladder and it gets filled with water via a catheter inserted into the urethra, the entire process is recorded on an X-ray or ''ultrasound'' machine.''The catheter and the sensors will be removed as soon as the measurements are recorded.'

How to fasten the healing process?,"'Quicken the duration by:' Avoid heavy work or prolonged standing after this procedure. Wash the vulvar skin with plain warm water after you pass urine to soothe the area and pat dry, or you can wipe the area as normal. After passing the bowel, rinse the skin fully gently and make sure you wipe the skin in a direction away from the vulva to keep the biopsy site as clean as possible. Take a quick bath but rinse thoroughly after that and dry the area thoroughly after washing. Continue to wash the vulvar skin every day as normal with water alone. Avoid baths, hot tubs, and swimming pools for the first two to three days until the wound has healed completely. Given the difficulty of keeping a dressing in place, most vulvar biopsies are not covered. A panty liner may be useful to protect the area and absorb any ooze or bleeding. Avoid sexual intercourse and cycling until your discomfort has resolved, which usually takes three to five days. Wear loose cotton underwear and avoid tight pants to reduce friction at the site."
What does a vulvar biopsy mean?,"'A vulval or vulvar biopsy is a surgical procedure in which your doctor/gynecologist will remove a small piece of tissue from the vulval skin or mucosal membranes for laboratory investigation.''If you have ''pain'', ''itching'', ulcer, or lump or ''blister'' or ''rash'' in the vulval area, sometimes, it becomes very difficult to judge the disease of the vulva just by looking or taking a blood test or swab test. Therefore, your gynecologist often suggests a vulval biopsy to help make a correct diagnosis and suggest suitable treatment.''Types of a vulvar ''skin biopsy'' are as follows:' Shave or snip biopsy: In this, tissue samples are taken by shaving and sniping the lesion using a scalpel or curved scissors. Punch biopsy: In this, tissue samples are taken using a cylindrical dermal punch. Incisional biopsy: In this, the lesion is removed by making an incision using a scalpel and closed with sutures. Excisional biopsy: In this, the tumor is excised by using a scalpel and the wound is sutured."
When does your doctor suggest a vulvar biopsy?,"'Your gynecologist may suggest a vulvar biopsy when''Typical vulval conditions that may require a biopsy include:' Cancerous growth is suspected. An immune system disorder causing blisters is suspected. Lesions have atypical color, texture, or vascular patterns. Your disease does not resolve with standard treatment. Results have implications for the diagnosis and management of systemic illnesses such asBehcet disease (a rare disorder that causes inflammation in the blood vessels).Crohn's disease (a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the digestive tract lining). Behcet disease (a rare disorder that causes inflammation in the blood vessels). Crohn's disease (a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the digestive tract lining). Removal of a lesion is requested for functional or for better appearance. Lichen sclerosis (thin, white patches of the skin, usually in the genital area) Lichen planus (swelling and irritation of the skin and mucous membranes) Abnormal growth of squamous cells on the cervix surface Squamous cell carcinoma (cancer of flat, thin cells of the vulva) Melanoma (dangerous, spreading cancer)"
What are the possible complications?,"'Complications include:' Pain Swelling Redness Infection Bleeding Hematoma (bleeding beneath the skin) Bruising  Scarring  Discoloration of the area Darkening of the area Skin allergies to topical antiseptic, anesthetic, suture material, or dressings Persistence or recurrence of vulvar lesions"
What is an allergic reaction?,"'Allergic'' or hypersensitive reaction is excessive sensitivity exhibited by your immune system to a conventionally harmless substance such as ''pollen'', dust and certain foods. These substances are not dangerous in the majority of the people, but when they trigger allergic reactions, they are called allergens. Allergic reactions occur when the allergens contact the skin, are inhaled, swallowed or injected.\xa0''Allergic reactions are quite common and may happen seconds to hours after contact with the ''allergen''. Though many allergic reactions are mild, others may be dangerous or life-threatening. They may be localized, involving a small part of the body or may affect a large area orthe whole body.''One example of such a reaction is the ''rash'' associated with certain metal jewellery or footwear, or the application of certain ''cosmetics''. Such ''rash'' is called ''contact dermatitis''.\xa0\xa0''Sometimes people with ''allergies'' sneeze uncontrollably on exposure to dust or pollen. This is called ''allergic rhinitis''\xa0''An ''allergic reaction'' begins with touching, inhaling or swallowing an allergen. In response to this trigger, the body starts making a type of protein called IgE or immunoglobulin E. IgE leads to the release of some chemicals (such as histamine) in the body. These chemicals cause the inflammatory symptoms of allergic reactions such as rash, ''itching'' and ''sneezing''.\xa0' "
What are the typical symptoms of an allergic reaction?,"'The symptoms of allergic reactions vary depending upon whether the allergen came in contact with the skin, was inhaled, swallowed or injected.\xa0''The typical symptoms of allergic reactions are:''Although most allergic reactions are mild, some may need urgent medical intervention. ''Anaphylaxis'' is the most severe form of hypersensitive reactions. This is a medical\xa0 emergency because it can lead to a sudden choking caused by narrowing of the wind-pipe. People with anaphylaxis have\xa0 extreme difficulty in breathing, swelling, ''low blood pressure'', bluish skin, and ''shock''. It might be fatal if not treated.' Itching Skin rash, redness or hives Sneezing Running/blocked nose Swelling of lips and tongue Difficulty in breathing Wheezing or noisy breathing Coughing Itchy, red eyes Watering from the eyes Swelling of limbs  Nausea/vomiting Dizziness"
How do you manage an allergic reaction?,"'The most effective management of allergic reactions is preventing them. Avoid the allergens whenever possible. For example, if you get ''rashes'' on wearing a certain type of jewellery or using certain cosmetics, you must avoid them. Similarly, if you are allergic to certain foods, it’s prudent to remove them from your ''diet''.''Patients who have a tendency to ''food allergies'' must be cautious while eating and preferably keep ''EpiPen'' with them, which is an automatic epinephrine injector used to prevent anaphylaxis in emergencies.''Your doctor may prescribe any of the several medications available to\xa0help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including:' Avoiding allergens is important because repeated exposure may make the allergic reaction worse and more difficult to manage. Taking a shower or applying a cool compress may ease skin rash. It may also help to wash away any allergen clinging onto your skin.  Do not rub yourself with a towel, pat dry and apply a gentle soothing gel or moisturizer.  Wear breathable and loose clothes. Over-the-counter hydrocortisone or calamine lotion may help in relieving skin itching and burning. If your symptoms do not get better or become worse, you should seek medical help. Antihistamines  Medicated lotions and creams Steroid medications as sprays, drops, inhalers, tablets or creams Decongestants Severe reactions may require an EpiPen. Immunotherapy for long term management of severe, unmanageable allergic reactions"
How long does an allergic reaction last?,"'Allergic reactions may last for varying lengths of time. They may take a few hours to a few days to disappear. If the exposure to the allergen continues, such as during a spring pollen season, allergic reactions may last for longer periods such as a few weeks to months.\xa0''Even with adequate treatment, some allergic reactions may take two to four weeks to go away.' "
How long does an electrophysiology study take?,"'An electrophysiology (EP) study is a test performed to determine the cause of abnormal ''heart'' rhythm and it usually takes about one to four hours to complete. However, it may take longer if additional treatments such as catheter ablation are performed at the same time by your heart surgeon. An EP study is usually performed by a heart specialist doctor known as\xa0 an electrophysiologist.' "
What is an EP study?,'An electrophysiology (EP) study is a test your heart doctor/specialist/heart surgeon will order to look at your heart’s electrical activity in more detail. This test can stimulate and diagnose your ''abnormal heart rhythms''.' 
What can an EP study show?,"'This test\xa0' Shows the electrical activity of your heart to identify the affected location of your heart that is generating the arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat). Allows your heart doctor to diagnose and treat a wide range of arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Allows you and your doctor to decide on further treatment plans for your heart condition, which are sometimes performed at the same time, including Insertion of a pacemakerInsertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)Performing cardiac catheter ablation (destroys the areas inside the heart causing an abnormal rhythm) by heat (radiofrequency ablation) or freezing (cryogenic ablation)Performing a heart surgery Insertion of a pacemaker Insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) Performing cardiac catheter ablation (destroys the areas inside the heart causing an abnormal rhythm) by heat (radiofrequency ablation) or freezing (cryogenic ablation) Performing a heart surgery"
What happens during an EP study?,"'This test is usually performed at a hospital or clinic in a room with special equipment known as an electrophysiology (EP) laboratory or a catheterization (cath) lab by doctors (heart specialists) and nurses. You’ll be informed not to eat or drink anything for a few hours beforehand.''During the test''If the type and location of arrhythmia is identified, then your heart surgeon/specialist will decide on an appropriate therapy. Cardiac ablation or insertion of a pacemaker or ICD will be performed during or immediately after the EP study.' An intravenous (IV) line will be inserted in your arm and sedative will be infused to make you relax. A nurse will clean and shave the part of your body where the doctor will be working (usually the groin, arm or neck). A local anesthetic solution will be given to you to make that area numb. Your doctor will insert a needle into the vessel and puncture it. They will insert a sheath (small straw-like tube) into your vessel (artery/vein). Your doctor will gently guide several flexible tubes (specialized EP catheters) into your blood vessel (vein, usually the groin) through that sheath and pass them up into your heart. You may feel some pressure in the area where the sheath was inserted. A camera on the top of the catheter will show the position of the catheters on the video screen. Your doctor will send small electric pulses through the catheter to make your heart beat at different speeds. You may feel palpitations (faster heartbeat). Sometimes, you may feel light-headedness or discomfort in your chest, which you should report to the doctor/nurse. Electrical signals produced by your heart will be tracked and recorded by a special catheter, which is known as cardiac mapping. It helps your doctor locate the area responsible for generating abnormal heartbeats. Your doctor will remove the catheter and the IV line. Your nurse will put firm pressure on the puncture site to stop the bleeding."
What happens after the EP study?, You will be moved to a recovery room. You will be informed to rest for a few hours while keeping the arm or leg which was used for the test straight. Your nurse will check if there is any bleeding or swelling at the puncture site. Your doctor will convey the test results to you after the sedative effects wear off.
What do you do after the EP study?,"'After discharge' Follow the instructions given by your nurse and doctor about medications. Usually, you can start eating or taking medicines within four to six hours after the test. Usually, you can resume your daily activities the day after the test. You must avoid driving for at least 24 hours. You may feel soreness at the puncture site for several days or have a small bruise, which is quite normal and subsides within a short span. If you find bleeding, lie flat and press firmly on top of it or call the doctor or electrophysiology (EP) lab. You must limit your activity for the first 24 hours. If traveling home takes several hours, take a break every hour, stretch your legs and walk a few minutes to inhibit blood clotting. If you find new blood on your dressing, press firmly on the incision site for about 20 minutes. Call your doctor or visit the nearest emergency room if the bleeding continues. Do not lift any heavy objects that weigh more than 10 pounds for the first week. Remove the dressing the day after the study. You may see a bruise or a small lump under the skin at the insertion site, which may disappear within three to four weeks."
What are the complications?, Hematoma (bleeding under the skin) Bruising Damage to the heart’s normal electrical pathways (rare)
How is an epidural nerve block performed?,"'An epidural nerve block is a procedure to block ''pain'' by injecting anesthetic medication into the epidural space of the spine. The procedure numbs the relevant nerve region thereby blocking the transmission of ''pain'' signals from those nerves to the brain. An epidural nerve block may be administered in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar or the caudal (lowermost) region of the spinal column.''The epidural space is the area between the inner wall of the backbone (vertebral column) and the outermost of the three membranes (dura mater) that surround and protect the spinal cord. The space between the inner two membranes is filled with cerebrospinal fluid that supplies nutrients to the spine and acts as a ''shock'' absorber.''An epidural nerve block may be performed to''An epidural nerve block is usually an outpatient procedure when performed as treatment for ''chronic pain''. Steroids can also be administered to reduce inflammation. A ''pain management'' specialist performs the procedure that may take up to 30 minutes.''When an epidural nerve block is performed for anesthetic purposes during surgery or for pain relief post-surgery, the procedure will require hospitalization.

An IV line is attached to the patient for medication and fluids. Uses an antiseptic solution to sterilize the injection site in the relevant level of spine. Inserts the needle into the skin and administers a local anesthetic to numb the tissues under the skin. Inserts the spinal needle between two vertebrae in the midline of the spinal column or laterally, using ultrasonography and continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) for guidance. Attaches the syringe to the needle and slowly advances it into the space between the vertebrae. Stops advancing the needle once the needle reaches the epidural space. Aspirates the syringe and checks there is no blood or cerebrospinal fluid to ensure the needle has not punctured a blood vessel or the spinal cord membrane.

How long does an epidural nerve block last?,"'The anesthetic effects of an epidural nerve block may last up to a day or more depending on the medication and dosage administered.''For chronic pain management steroids are usually administered to reduce inflammation and remove the pressure on the nerve roots. The anesthetic medication produces pain relief within 10 minutes, but the steroid may take two to five days to take effect.''In an epidural nerve block procedure, typically a series of three injections are administered two to three weeks apart. The effects of the epidural nerve block vary with individuals. Pain relief may last for months, or even permanently for some, but others may not find any relief.' "

What is an SMAS facelift?,"'A ''facelift'' is a type of ''cosmetic surgery'' to provide a younger, firmer appearance to your face. Superficial musculo aponeurotic system (SMAS) is the group of facial muscles and tissues that tend to become saggy with ''aging''. It is a layer of tissue that occurs under the skin of your face and provides facial elasticity and support.\xa0''The SMAS facelift technique is especially suitable for people seeking to improve cosmetic changes in their faces and necks due to ''aging''.' "
Who should receive an SMAS facelift?,'The surgery is useful for patients who have' Sagging or hollow cheeks Deepening of the crease between the nose and lips Prominent skin around the lower jawline (jowls)
What happens during the SMAS facelift surgery?," Your surgeon will rehearse the operative steps on your face before the surgery. They will grasp your skin to understand how much skin tightening needs to be done to get the best results. They will make markings on your face to guide surgical cuts. Your face will be cleaned with antiseptic solution and drapes will be applied. After you have been prepared for the procedure, you will be given anesthesia. Because the facelift is a long surgery, local anesthesia with regular monitoring helps to ensure you are comfortable and pain-free during the entire procedure. The surgeon will then make surgical cuts on your skin. Then, they will lift the facial tissue and muscle beneath the skin. The lifted muscles and skin will be rearranged into a more desirable position, and excess skin will be removed.  The surgeon will stitch the skin on your face to minimize and camouflage scarring. Finally, dressing and drainage tubes are placed. "
Are results of SMAS facelift beneficial?,'Patients usually report satisfaction with the results of an SMAS facelift and rarely need revision surgery or touchups. Some even seek more facelift surgery in several years as they age.' 
How quick is the recovery from and SMAS facelift?,"'Recovery is reasonably swift after a SMAS facelift. The patient typically can take a shower during the first postoperative evening. The ''stitches'' in front are removed on the fifth day and those behind them around the eighth day. Even the need for painkillers is usually minimal.\xa0''The patient’s activity increases with each passing day.\xa0''The patient will need to visit the doctor weekly for the first five weeks.\xa0''Thereafter, three monthly follow-up visits are required, followed by annual visits.'

What is bronchial thermoplasty?,"'Bronchial thermoplasty\xa0is a procedure used to treat severe ''asthma''. It involves controlled delivery of therapeutic radiofrequency energy to the walls of the lung airways\xa0 (bronchi). During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose\xa0 and mouth into the trachea (wind pipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes called bronchus (bronchi). The bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''.\xa0''Bronchial thermoplasty heats the bronchi to reduce the amount of smooth muscle present in the ''airway'' wall, reducing the capacity of the immune system to cause the kind of bronchoconstriction that leads to ''asthma'' attacks.\xa0''Bronchial thermoplasty is normally used in patients with severe, persistent ''asthma'' who do not respond well to medical treatment. The treatment is relatively safe and effective.' "
What are the benefits of bronchial thermoplasty?,"'Bronchial thermoplasty provides significant improvement of symptoms in patients with asthma, but it does not completely cure asthma. The benefits include the following:' Reduction in asthma attacks Reduction in emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms Reduction in days lost from work, school or other daily activities due to asthma symptoms Reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms"
When can bronchial thermoplasty not be done?,'Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended in following conditions:''Factors that increase post-procedure risk include the following:' Psychologically unstable patient Poor cardiac (heart) status Coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) Consumption of high-dose steroids Severe underlying medical conditions Advanced age Coronary artery disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma Extensive lung resection  Immunocompromised status Morbid obesity Smoking history
How is bronchial thermoplasty performed?," The surgeon performs a complete physical assessment, along with radiological tests (X-ray, computed tomography scan, angiography) and laboratory tests.  The patient is advised to quit smoking tobacco before surgery, as smoking delays the healing process.  The patient is required to fast for up to 12 hours before surgery. Consent for the procedure is obtained prior to surgery. Bronchial thermoplasty is performed using a flexible bronchoscope during three separate outpatient procedures three weeks apart.  Radiofrequency energy is delivered to a wire basket attached to the top of the catheter, in which thermal energy warms the lining of targeted airways to reduce airway smooth muscle mass.  It helps to reduce, debulk, or partially eliminate smooth muscle tissue.  The duration of each treatment lasts for about an hour. Patients are administered painkillers and antibiotics.  Patients can go home the same day, three to four hours after the procedure. "
What are the complications of bronchial thermoplasty? ,"'The procedure is relatively safe, and complications are rare. Some possible complications are:' Transient increase and worsening of respiratory symptoms Recurrent Atelectasis (collapse of the part of the lung) Lung abscess Hemoptysis (coughing blood)  Anxiety Headaches  Nausea"
How long does the effect of endometrial ablation last?,'Endometrial ablation is done to reduce excessive menstrual bleeding that has not subsided with medications.''The expected effect of endometrial ablation usually shows up in a few months and usually lasts for a longer time in most women.''About 3 in 10 women will see a significant reduction in their menstrual bleeding.''Nearly 50% of women who undergo this treatment will have their menstrual periods stopped permanently.' 
Can you have a baby after endometrial ablation?,"'This procedure is recommended for those women who no longer plan to have a baby. You can still become ''pregnant'' after endometrial ablation because all other reproductive organs are still intact. However, if you get pregnant, the risk of ''miscarriage'' or the fetus being implanted in the fallopian tube (''ectopic pregnancy'') is extremely high. Such a ''pregnancy'' can be fatal for the mother. Hence, it is recommended to either use contraceptives or plan for a sterilization surgery after the procedure.''Your doctor will recommend other options for you if you are planning to have your baby in the future (like surrogacy).'

How is endometrial ablation performed?,'Endometrial ablation removes the entire thin layer of the ''endometrium'' by heating or freezing it. It can be performed either in a doctor’s office as an outpatient or in the operative room during a hospital stay.''The surgeon can perform endometrial ablation using any of the following methods:' Cryoablation: It is freezing the endometrium with the help of liquid nitrogen. Radiofrequency ablation: It is the use of radiofrequency waves to vaporize the endometrium. Hot fluid: It is circulating heated saline fluid within the uterus. Heated balloon: It is the insertion of a balloon device into the uterus and inflating it with hot liquid. Microwave energy: It is the use of a slender wand to emit microwaves that heat the endometrium. Electrosurgery: It is the use of electric current passed through wires to burn the endometrium (requires general anesthesia to make you sleep throughout the procedure).
How do you prepare for endometrial ablation?,"'Your surgeon will discuss with you all the benefits and risks of the procedure. Usually, you will be asked\xa0''Make sure that you follow all these and any other instructions given by your doctor. You can also make a list of all doubts you have before the surgery and get it cleared by your doctor.' If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. If you have an intrauterine device (IUD) fitted inside the uterus. If you are allergic to any medicines. About all medicines that you are on. If you are particularly taking any blood-thinning medications (such as aspirin, heparin, and warfarin). This will be discontinued for a few days before and after the surgery. To take some medicines several weeks before the procedure. These medicines will make the endometrium thin enough to get ready for the surgery. To stop eating and drinking (fast) after midnight (generally in case of general anesthesia)."
What happens after endometrial ablation?,"'After endometrial ablation, you might experience' Frequent urination: You may feel like peeing more than usual in the first 24 hours of the surgery.  Abdominal cramps: These are usually similar to the cramps that you typically experience during your periods. They usually last for a few hours to a few days and can be relieved by over-the-counter pain medications. Minimal vaginal bleeding and vaginal discharge: Most bleeding subsides within a few days followed by a clear, watery discharge, that stays up to two weeks. Nausea."
What is the recovery period for endometrial ablation?,"'Being a minor procedure, recovery takes a few days to a week. It might take two weeks in some patients. You might be able to resume all your activities immediately after the surgery. Strenuous activities can wait for a week. Make sure to ask your doctor how long the recovery period will be for you.' "
What are the possible complications of endometrial ablation?,"'Endometrial ablation carries relatively fewer risks than major surgical procedures such as a ''hysterectomy''. Although minimal, the possible complications are as follows:' Infection Internal bleeding’ Injury to the uterus and surrounding organs (such as the ureter) Damage to the vagina, vulva, or bowels from excess cold or heat Fluid overload (due to absorption of liquid in the blood vessels)"
What is genioplasty surgery?,"'Genioplasty is a form of ''cosmetic surgery'' to change the size, shape or positioning of the chin. Historically, various materials have been used to change the appearance of the chin, including paraffin and ivory. Silicone polytetrafluoroethylene and polyester mesh implants are popular today. An implant can also be harvested from the patient’s own body. Such implants are called “autografts” and may include tissue from the patient’s rib cage, hip bone, and nose.' "
Who is a candidate for genioplasty surgery?,'Patients who are not satisfied with the appearance of their chin may seek genioplasty. The candidates for the surgery include those with the following problems:' Overly large or small chin Protruding chin Receding chin Misaligned chin As a part of other cosmetic surgeries
What are the types of genioplasty?,"'There are three main types of genioplasty, sliding genioplasty, alloplastic augmentation, and mentum reduction.' The sliding genioplasty can be done in inpatient or outpatient settings. General anesthesia is usually preferred. The surgeon pulls down the patient’s lower lip to make cuts below the teeth of the lower jaw. This gives the surgeon access to the chin bone. Cuts are made on the chin bone to align it for the desired changes. The aligned bones are then fixed with screws and metal plates to ensure they stay in the desired position. The surgeon will close the surgical cuts in layers to minimize and camouflage scarring. Finally, dressing is done. The duration of the procedure ranges from 15 minutes to two hours. In this procedure, the surgeon changes the appearance of the chin by attaching implants to the patient’s chin bone. The surgeon will access the chin by making cuts below the chin or inside the mouth of the patient. They will insert the implant through the cut and attach it to the chin. Finally, cuts are stitched and the wound dressed. The procedure takes around 15 minutes to complete. The purpose of the surgery is to achieve a reduction of a prominent chin. Unlike sliding genioplasty, instead of advancing the lower part of the chin bone, the surgeon recedes and secures it. The procedure can be done by making cuts below the chin or inside the mouth. The reduction of the lower border of the jawbone may also be done."
How long does genioplasty take to heal?,"'The patients are advised to stay on a soft ''diet'' and to rinse frequently with saline solution until the first postoperative visit. Follow-up visits are scheduled with the patient on the seventh and 14th postoperative days. Because bone is operated on in genioplasty, complete healing takes at least 6-8 weeks. The time to heal depends on these factors:' General health of the patient Type of the procedure Presence of complications Extent of surgical changes"
Is genioplasty safe?,"'Genioplasty is a commonly performed surgical procedure. Although genioplasty has minimal chances of complications, it is associated with the following risks:' Infection Bleeding Pain Nerve injury Bone loss or displacement Under correction Overcorrection Swelling Tooth damage Allergy to implant material Implant displacement Lip drop Scarring Healing delay or failure"
What is a stye?,"'A ''stye'', also known as a hordeolum, is mainly caused due to a bacterial infection. It is a red, painful bump that forms either inside or outside the ''eyelid''.''There are two kinds of styes:''A stye may be sometimes confused with a ''chalazion''. A ''chalazion'' is a painless bump that is on the eyelid. A chalazion, unlike a stye, is not caused by a bacterial infection.' External stye: A stye looks like a pimple and begins at the base of the eyelash. Internal stye: A stye that begins in the oil-producing gland (lubricates the eye) in your eyelid."
How do you get an eye stye?,"'An eye stye is usually caused due to a bacterial infection; however, certain factors can make you more likely to get a stye.''Some of the risk factors for developing eye styes are:' Blepharitis: A condition resulting in inflamed eyes Stress and hormonal changes Diabetes Acne rosacea: A skin condition that causes redness and pus-filled red bumps in the central part of the face Eye makeup Skin cancer"
How will I know if I have a stye?,'Signs and symptoms of eye styes:' Painful red bump along the edge of the upper or lower eyelid Swelling of the eyelid Light sensitivity Eye soreness Tearing of the eye Constant itching of the eye Eye pain or discomfort The crustiness of the eyelids (formation of a hard layer on the eyelids)
How long does it take for a stye to go away?,"'A stye usually resolves in about seven days. However, some cases of stye require medical help.' "
How are eye styes treated?,"'To reduce ''pain'' and swelling, various treatment options are available:''If a stye does not resolve on its own or recurs frequently, a physician would prescribe:' Place a warm washcloth over the eyelid for 10 to15 minutes for three to five times a day. If pain persists, reapply as needed. Gently wash the eyelid with mild soap or shampoo, or wipe the eyelids with eyelid wipes. Never squeeze or try to pop a stye, as this can spread infection. Avoid using eye makeup or contact lenses until the eyelid has healed. Gently massage the swollen area to help drain the clogged gland. Antibiotics for a persistent infection. Steroids for swelling. Surgery to drain the pus from the stye."
Are eye styes contagious?,"'Styes are a local infection of the eyelids. They are not ''contagious'', and in most cases, resolve without antibiotics. However, some styes may advance to significant eyelid infection.' "
What can you do to lower the chances of getting a stye?,"'To prevent the formation of an eye stye, you should follow these best practices:' Cleanse your contact lenses before putting them into the eye. Wash your hands thoroughly before touching your face. Wash your face to remove dirt before going to the bed. Discard all expired eye makeup products. Never use anyone else’s makeup. Wipe off all your makeup before going to bed."
What is trabeculectomy?,"'Trabeculectomy, also known as filtration surgery, involves surgical removal of a mesh of tissue from ‘angle of the eye.’ The angle is the space between the ''iris'' (colored part of the eye) and sclera (white of the eye). Trabeculectomy reduces the ''intraocular'' pressure-formed due to ''glaucoma''.' "
Why is trabeculectomy indicated?,"'Trabeculectomy may be indicated to treat the following conditions:''Glaucoma is a condition that damages the ''optic nerve'' in the eye due to the buildup of the pressure. It is the leading cause of ''blindness'' for people above 60 years of age. There are two major types of glaucoma:''Open-angle glaucoma: ''This is the most common form of glaucoma. In this condition, the drain structure (trabecular meshwork) in the eye is fine, but it doesn’t drain the fluid completely.''Angle-closure glaucoma:'' Also called acute or chronic angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma, the drain space between the iris and ''cornea'' of the eye becomes too narrow to drain the fluid.''Secondary glaucoma: ''Conditions, such as ''diabetes'' or ''cataract'', cause added pressure to the eye leading to secondary glaucoma. They can be of two types:''Normal-tension glaucoma:'' Blind spots in the vision or optic nerve may build eye pressure.''Pigmentary glaucoma:'' A tiny portion of pigment from the iris, which is the colored part of the eye, travels through the fluid in the eye and clogs the drainage canal.' Primary open-angle glaucoma Primary angle-closure glaucoma not responsive to laser surgery Secondary open-angle glaucoma Secondary angle-closure glaucoma Childhood glaucoma (glaucoma present at birth) Secondary open-angle glaucoma Secondary angle-closure glaucoma"
When should be trabeculectomy avoided?,"'Trabeculectomy should be avoided in the conditions where the risks outweigh the potential benefits.''Generally, trabeculectomy is avoided in:' Previously failed trabeculectomy Severe scarring of tissues that line the inside of eyelids and white (sclera) of the eyes Neovascular glaucoma: It is a type of secondary glaucoma, where a new blood vessel closes the angle of the eye. Uveitic glaucoma: This glaucoma is caused due to inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (uveitis). Eyes with no sight"
How is trabeculectomy performed?,"'The surgery is done under local or general anesthesia depending on the person’s age and ''anxiety'' levels.''The eyeball is fixed in place and the surgery is done using a microscope, surgical tools, and cautery.''In this surgery, the physician creates a small opening in the angle of the eye by removing a piece of tissue from the area where the colored part of the eye (iris) and sclera (whites of the eye) meet. This new opening allows the drainage of fluid, which bypasses the clogged drainage channels.''As the fluid drains through the new openings, the pressure inside the eye reduces.''Sometimes, a thin tube may be placed at the site of the cut to facilitate proper drainage of fluid. ''Stitches'' may be placed at the site of the cut. These are removed in the second or third follow-up.' "
What to expect after trabeculectomy surgery?,"'Antibiotics may be injected under the ''conjunctiva''. The eye doctor will examine your eyes the day after surgery and may schedule follow-up visits 1 or 2 weeks apart. In follow-up visits, the doctor will screen your vision and check for ''wound'' healing. Eye pressure will be checked as well.''The vision may remain blurry for 6-8 weeks after the surgery. You may have slight ''pain'' or discomfort in the eye for a few days. If the ''pain'' is unbearable and the eye appears red, contact the doctor immediately.''You may have to use an eye shield for a month after the surgery. The application of ''corticosteroids'' for about 1-2 months after the surgery would be recommended by the physician. No ''swimming'', contact sports, or extreme workout should be done. You must not rub your eyes at any point.' "
What is marsupialization?,"'Marsupialization involves the opening of Bartholin’s cyst or ''abscess'' and then closing it at the edges to form a permanent open pocket or pouch for continuous drainage.''The Bartholin glands are essential organs of the female genitals. They are located on each side of the vaginal opening and are invisible. The main function of the Bartholin glands include:''The Bartholin’s gland is prone to infections and pus formation. The opening of these glands may become obstructed, causing the accumulation of fluid in the gland, which results in the development of the cyst (swelling) in the gland. If the cyst gets infected with bacteria, it may lead to the collection of pus (abscess) surrounded by pus.''Bartholin cyst affects 2% of women, and in rare cases, it may also lead to ''cancer''.' Secrete mucus Lubricate the vulva and vagina"
When is marsupialization indicated?,"'Marsupialisation is indicated in individuals with the following conditions:' History of recurrent Bartholin gland cyst or abscesses Considerable pain or discomfort No tolerance to alternative treatments Failure of other therapies in cyst treatment A large cyst that may interfere with walking, sitting, or sexual activity"
How is marsupialization performed?,"'Marsupialization may be performed under local anesthesia to minimize postoperative discomfort. The physician may make you lie down with the legs separated, flexed, and supported in a raised position (lithotomy). The physician might apply an antimicrobial solution, such as Betadine on the operation site. Next, the physician grasps the cyst with an instrument that prevents blood flow (hemostats). A vertical incision of 1.5-3 cm long is made to drain the infected gland. The physician turns out the cyst wall and moistens it with saline. The edge of the cyst wall is closed to form a permanent open pocket or pouch for continuous drainage. The procedure takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete.' "
What are the potential complications of marsupialization?,'Complications of marsupialization include:' Dyspareunia (painful sex) Hematoma (pooling of blood near the incision) Infection Recurrent abscesses Scarring Neuropathy (nerve dysfunction)
How long does it take to get lead poisoning?,"'Lead poisoning'' usually takes months or years of exposure to a small amount of lead at home, work or daycare. When exposed to large amounts of lead, it can quickly lead to ''lead poisoning'' (acute poisoning).' "
What is lead poisoning?,"'Lead poisoning is caused by the accumulation of lead in the body. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Small children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning, as lead may affect the developing brain and nerves. This may severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can cause ''seizures'', unconsciousness and even death.''Lead circulates to the brain, ''liver'', kidney and bones and accumulates in the ''teeth'' and bones over time. During ''pregnancy'', if there’s high lead content in the bones, the fetus may be affected. Lead exposure at any level is harmful, but it is preventable.' "
What are the symptoms of lead poisoning?,"'Lead is a naturally occurring toxic metal found in the earth’s crust. Excessive lead buildup in the body can cause lead poisoning. Although lead poisoning primarily affects children, it can also prove dangerous in adults. ''Lead poisoning signs'' and symptoms include''Children are four to five times more likely to absorb lead. They are at the highest risk of lead poisoning, as it affects the physical and mental development in the body. Exposure to low levels of lead can lead to irreversible damage to brain development. The warning signs in children include''In newborns' High blood pressure Joint and muscle pain Headache Difficulties with memories or concentration Abdominal pain Mood disorders Reduced sperm count and abnormal sperm Miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth in pregnant women Pain or tingling in feet Weakness Loss of appetite Constipation Tiredness Irritability Kidney and nervous system damage Seizures Unconsciousness Death Developmental delay Learning difficulties Loss of appetite Irritability Weight loss Abdominal pain Vomiting Hearing loss Constipation Seizures Laziness and fatigue Pica (eating things that aren’t edible)  Premature birth Significant low birth weight Slow growth"
What are the sources and routes of lead exposure?,"'People can be exposed to lead through environmental and occupational sources, which may include' Lead-based paints Mining Burning fossil fuel Lead pipes, brass plumbing fixtures and copper pipes soldered with lead Lead solder in food cans Lead-contaminated soil released from gasoline or paint settle Household dust containing lead from the lead paint chips Glazes in some ceramic or chinaware Toys and other products Tiro, an eye cosmetic Some traditional herbal medicines and folk remedies Lead bullets at firing ranges Tamarind used in Mexican candies Auto repair, battery manufacturing and construction industries"
How is lead poisoning diagnosed?,'The physician may carry out the following tests to confirm lead poisoning''The physician may also ask the patient about:' Physical examination Blood tests to to measure lead levels in the blood Symptoms Medical history Potential environmental exposure to lead Diet Any learning or behavioral problems especially in children
How is lead poisoning treated?,"'Treatment of lead poisoning involves''Before the commencement of treatment, it is necessary to measure the blood lead level. Lower blood lead levels don’t require treatment. However, concentrated blood lead levels require treatment. In individuals with severe lead poisoning, the physician may prescribe chelating medicines that bind to lead and pass out through urine. Medications may be given either orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of the lead poisoning. Medicines that get rid of lead also get rid of other vital nutrients. Hence, it is necessary to replenish the lost nutrients with ''dietary supplements'' and good ''nutrition''.''After treating the patient, it is necessary to identify the source of lead poisoning and remove it.' Removing the source of lead Good nutrition"
What is mononucleosis?,"'Infectious mononucleosis'', also called “''mono'',” is a ''contagious'' infection most commonly caused by a ''herpes'' virus called Epstein-Barr (''EBV''). Teenagers and young adults are more commonly affected by mononucleosis.\xa0''\xa0It is commonly known as the kissing disease because of the way it gets transmitted.''The mononucleosis virus is transmitted mainly through:' saliva or kissing sharing glass or food utensils blood transfusions coughing or sneezing sexual contact organ transplants"
How do you know if you have mononucleosis?,"'Once you are infected with the EBV, it can take four to six weeks for the symptoms to turn up. When the symptoms appear, they tend to be mild, especially in young children. Symptoms develop gradually and may not occur at once.''The most common symptoms include:''Swollen liver or enlarged spleens are rare; however, in some, these symptoms may continue even after their ''fatigue'' ends.''Most of the symptoms of mononucleosis decline within two to four weeks, but fatigue may last longer. It generally takes two to three months to completely heal from mononucleosis. Occasionally, the symptoms of mononucleosis can last for six months or longer.' Extreme fatigue Fever Sore throat Head and body aches Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits Swollen liver or spleen or both Rash Lack of appetite Weakness and sore muscles"
What are the causes of mononucleosis?,"'EBV is the most common cause of ''infectious mononucleosis''; however, other ''viruses'' may also cause this disease. Certain infections and viruses responsible for causing the symptoms of mononucleosis to include:' Toxoplasmosis Rubella Human immunodeficiency virus Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Adenovirus"
How is mononucleosis treated or managed?,"'There isn’t a ''vaccine'' or cure for mononucleosis. Antibiotics or antiviral medicines may not work against mononucleosis. Management of mononucleosis includes:' Wash your hands regularly Getting adequate rest to fight infection Drink plenty of fluids for hydration Pain killers may be recommended for fever, inflammation, headaches, and muscle aches. Some of the common painkillers include Aleve (naproxen), Tylenol (acetaminophen), and Advil (ibuprofen).  Gargle with salt water and use throat lozenges for calming a sore throat Avoid contact sports and strenuous exercise to prevent the risk of spleen rupture."
How to prevent mononucleosis?,"'Avoid the following activities to prevent the infection from spreading:' Kissing or having sexual contact with the infected person Sharing of glass, utensils, silverware, and toothbrushes with the infected person Receiving blood from unauthentic sources Coughing or sneezing without covering the mouth Eating without washing the hands"
What is HIV?,"'HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'')'' is a virus that attacks and damages the cells of the immune system in the body. Impaired immunity makes an individual susceptible to other infections.''HIV'' infection is a lifelong condition with no cure and can lead to fatal complications. With appropriate treatment, it is now possible to manage the disease and live a long life.''If left untreated, ''HIV'' can lead to\xa0''AIDS'' (''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'')'' disease. ''AIDS'' is the final stage of HIV infection which occurs when the body’s immune system is severely damaged because of the virus and unusual infection result. Untreated, HIV infection has a mortality of 90%.' "
What are the types of HIV?,'The virus is classified into two main types:\xa0HIV-1\xa0and\xa0HIV-2.\xa0' HIV-1Discovered first and is prevalent worldwide. Discovered first and is prevalent worldwide. HIV-2It is less virulent and is mostly found in West Africa. Infection is slowly progressive and takes longer than HIV-1 to develop symptoms. It is less virulent and is mostly found in West Africa. Infection is slowly progressive and takes longer than HIV-1 to develop symptoms.
How long does it take to notice signs of HIV?," It may take a few weeks to several months for the virus to multiply, attack the immune system, and cause symptoms. Symptoms appear sooner in HIV-1 and progress faster than HIV-2."
How do you get HIV?,"'HIV is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, ''breast milk'', and vaginal and rectal fluids. HIV can be transmitted by the following:''HIV does not spread through:' Sexual intercourse (anal sex has a higher risk of transmission than vaginal sex) Sharing of infected needles (intravenous drug abuse) or razors Unsterilized tattoo needles Pregnancy and childbirth Breastfeeding Exposure to infected blood (e.g., needle stick injuries) Contact between open skin wounds Casual contact/skin-to-skin contact Saliva, tears and sweat Sharing food, drinks and utensils Insect bites"
What is the first sign of HIV?,"'The earliest symptoms of HIV are:' Fever and flu-like illness Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin Rashes Generalized body pain Headache Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Throat pain Fatigue Loss of weight"
What are the other signs and symptoms of HIV?," Frequent infections. Poor wound healing. Increased susceptibility to serious infections such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs), meningitis (infection of the brain), tuberculosis, fungal infection. Symptoms of other disease would be more severe in HIV patients than normal patients because of the weakened immune system."
How is HIV diagnosed?," History and physical examination by the physician Complete blood investigation, including specialized blood tests to detect the presence of the virus, immune status, and treatment progression. Specialized blood and radiological investigations to diagnose superadded infections."
How is HIV treated?, Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the HIV Antibiotics to treat additional infections Precautions to prevent other infections Vaccinations for infections that have a vaccine Eating healthy
What is the HIV prognosis if not treated?,"'If untreated, HIV infection will progress to ''AIDS'' and the mortality rate is 90 percent. Though it cannot be cured, with appropriate treatment and precautions, patients can live up to a normal life expectancy (more than 70 years).''The cause of death in HIV is usually due to serious complications from unusual “opportunistic” infections because of a weakened immune system or side effects of antiviral therapy.' "
How can HIV be prevented?," Practice safe sex by using the barrier method of contraception such as condoms. Avoid sharing needles and razors. Avoid touching spilled blood. Ensure tattoo parlors use sterile needles. Transmission from mother to baby can be prevented by starting antiviral therapy early during pregnancy. With needle stick injuries, immediately wash and disinfect the area and visit a doctor."
What is usually the first sign of HIV?,"'The initial presentation of an ''HIV'' infection is a ''flu-like'' illness which includes:' Fever Body ache Sore throat Headache Rash Swollen lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are a part of the body’s immune system that helps get rid of bacteria and viruses. An HIV infection, like many other infections, can cause the inflammation of lymph nodes, which can be felt as round or nodular swellings in the armpit, groin, and neck. The swelling is often associated with aches and pains in these areas."
How long does it take to see the signs of HIV?,"'The signs and symptoms of ''HIV'' may first appear within two to four weeks of infection. The stage in which the symptoms appear is called the stage of ''acute HIV infection''. The symptoms appear due to the resistance or fight of the immune system against HIV. In the initial stage, the virus multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body. It targets and destroys the CD4 cells (the infection-fighting\xa0cells of the body). As a result, the level of HIV in the blood and the chances of transmission at this stage are very high. It is crucial to recognize the early signs and seek medical help, since early diagnosis and treatment of HIV gets the best results.' "
What are the tests for detecting HIV?,"'Various tests may be used for HIV detection:' HIV antibody test: This test detects the antibodies produced (within two to 12 weeks of infection) in the body in response to HIV. Antigen test: This test can be done at an earlier stage than an HIV antibody test. It measures a protein called p24 antigen, present in the virus and produced in high amounts after the infection. Nucleic acid test (NAT): It is also called an RNA test. It is a very specific test that looks for the virus itself and can detect HIV as early as about 10 days of infections. In-home test kits: Although less accurate than the laboratory-based tests, home-based kits have the advantage of testing in the privacy and comfort of the home. Only FDA approved home-based kits should be used. Viral culture: This involves using the patient’s sample and growing the virus in the lab. It takes longer to get the results and is not the most preferred test for HIV."
How do you get HIV?,"'HIV infection can occur in the following ways:' Unprotected sexual intercourse, especially receptive anal intercourse Multiple sexual partners Sexually transmitted diseases: Chlamydia and gonorrhea infections increase the HIV transmission risk by three times; syphilis raises the transmission risk by seven times and genital herpes raises the infection risk by 25 times during an outbreak Sharing IV (intravenous) needles or injections Receiving HIV infected blood products (this does not occur in the US since the screening of blood donors for HIV began in 1985) Needle-stick injuries Maternal HIV infection (for newborns, infants and children): The risk of transmission can be reduced at birth by practices like cesarean delivery and prenatal (before childbirth) antiretroviral therapy in the mother, and antiretroviral therapy in the newborn immediately after birth"
What is lung cancer?,"'Lung cancer'' is ''cancer'' that originates in the lung cells.''Cancer'' is an abnormal and uncontrolled growth of the cells in the body. These abnormal cells kill the normal cells of the body and disrupt the normal body functions.''Lung cancer'' may spread to the ''lymph nodes'' or other organs in the body that commonly include the ''liver'', bones, brain and adrenal glands. When ''cancer'' cells spread from one organ to another, it is called metastases.' "
How long does lung cancer take to develop?,"'The time taken for lung cancer to develop is variable. It takes several years for cancer to develop in the ''lungs''. Early lung cancer does not alert obvious physical changes. Moreover, patients can live with lung cancer for many years before they show any signs or symptoms.\xa0''For example, it takes around eight years for a type of lung cancer known as ''squamous cell carcinoma'' to reach a size of 30 mm when it is most commonly diagnosed.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of lung cancer?,"'Most often, lung cancer does not show any signs and symptoms until it has advanced to higher stages when it becomes difficult to treat. The signs and symptoms vary among patients but may include the following:' Cough that remains unrelieved and gets worse over time  Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or reddish spit Chest pain that worsens on breathing or laughing Hoarseness of voice Weight loss Persistent chest pain Frequent lung infections"
What are the different stages of lung cancer?,"'The four stages of lung cancer (based on a grading system) are known as TNM classification. The TNM grades have been derived from diagnostic tests such as''Knowing the stage of the lung cancer helps the oncologist select the right treatment.''In the increasing order of severity, the stages of cancer are as follows:' blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, bronchoscopy, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, etc. Stage 0: This stage describes cancer in situ, which means “in place”. Stage 0 cancers are still located in the place they started and do not spread to the nearby tissues. This stage of cancer is often highly curable, usually by removing the entire tumor with surgery. Stage I: This stage is usually a small tumor that has not grown deeply into the nearby tissues. It is often called early-stage cancer. Stages II and III: At these two stages, lung cancer has grown more deeply into its adjacent tissues. Lung cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes. Stage IV: This stage means that lung cancer has spread or metastasized in other organs. This is usually known as the advanced stage of lung cancer. "
How long does menopause last?,"'Some ''symptoms of menopause'' such as ''hot flashes'' (a sudden feeling of warmth in the upper part of the body) usually last for one to two years. However, they can continue for 10 years or longer.''Menopause'' is the normal phase in a woman’s life that starts from her ''last menstrual period'' up to at least a year with no menstrual cycles. Menstrual periods stop permanently and she can no longer conceive. To say that a woman has reached her ''menopause'', her periods should not have occurred for at least 12 months after her last period.''Menopause'' can happen anytime between 45 and 55 years of age. The average age for menopause in the United States is 52.''The transition (or time) from the beginning of irregular menstrual periods to the last ''menstrual period'' is known as ''perimenopause'' and the time after menopause is termed ''postmenopause''. ''Perimenopause'"" usually starts in a woman's mid to late 40s and can last anywhere between one and four years before menopause strikes. Women who have undergone menopause are referred to as ""'postmenopausal'' women.''Menopause that sometimes occurs early is known as ''premature menopause''. This happens after the surgical removal of the ovaries (''oophorectomy'') or uterus (''hysterectomy''). It can also be due to an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system of the body attacks the body’s own cells.\xa0' "
What happens during menopause?,"'As a woman enters her 40s, her body starts producing low levels of the hormones estrogen and ''progesterone''. Decreased levels of these hormones give rise to physiological and emotional changes in her body during menopause. A woman’s risk of some health conditions such as cardiac problems and ''diabetes'' also increases.\xa0''In some women, the symptoms of menopause might either start at once or creep up slowly over time. Some of the symptoms that happen while transitioning to menopause include' Irregular periods Breasts feel tender Periods that are shorter or longer than they were before Periods that are heavier or lighter than before Hot flashes/flushes  Vaginal itching and burning (due to vaginal dryness) Trouble sleeping Mood swings or irritability Forgetfulness Urinary incontinence (trouble holding the urine when the urge comes) Pain during sex Loss of interest in sex"
How is menopause diagnosed?,"'The doctor usually diagnoses menopause after taking the menstrual history of the patient that includes gaps between two periods, the amount of blood flow during periods and the time passed since the last period.\xa0''A blood test that measures the levels of follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) can also help the doctor ascertain the diagnosis of menopause. However, for many women, a blood test is not necessary. Most of the time, their menstrual history is enough to diagnose menopause.' "
How to deal with menopause?,"'Meet the physician and discuss the symptoms that\xa0 are occuring.''Healthy eating patterns and being physically active can help with many menopausal symptoms such as ''weight gain'' and mood swings.''Herbal ''supplements'' such as ''soy'' milk and ''red clover'' may help with some ''menopause symptoms''. These contain an estrogen-like compound. However, one must discuss with their healthcare provider before starting any herbal ''supplements''. These are to be avoided in women who take ''hormone replacement therapy''.''Hormonal and nonhormonal treatments can help with some symptoms. Women need to discuss potential treatments with their doctor.' "
What is ovulation?,"'A woman’s complete ''menstrual cycle'' is usually 24 to 37 days long, although some women may have somewhat shorter or longer cycles.''Ovulation'' is your ''fertile'' phase of each month. During this phase, your ovaries (a woman’s reproductive organs) release an egg (ovum). The likelihood of conceiving is at the maximum during this period. A woman’s ovary releases an egg (ovulate) only once during menses; therefore, if you are planning to get ''pregnant'' or want to avoid it, tracking your period (menses) and finding out when your ovaries are releasing eggs is very essential.' "
How long does ovulation last each month?,"'Ovulation takes place only once a month and the ovum stays alive for 12 to 24 hours.''Your ovaries release one mature egg any time from day 7 to 21 of your cycle depending on the length of your cycle. This is called the ovulation phase. The released egg is picked by the uterine tube (fallopian tube). If you have sex during this time, there is a higher chance that the egg may get fertilized by the sperm (semen) here and travel down to the womb and you may get pregnant. Hence, these are your best days to get pregnant.''Very rarely, a second egg may be released within 24 hours from when the\xa0 first egg was released from the ovaries.\xa0''For some women, it is difficult to determine exactly when they will release eggs (ovulate) because of irregular periods or various other factors. Many factors such as hormonal problems may contribute to an inability to release the egg. If you are ''breastfeeding'' a baby, there are very few chances for you to get pregnant.\xa0' "
What are the natural signs and symptoms you observe during ovulation?,"'There are three main signs you may see during your ovulation/fertile period''You can identify your early nonfertile, fertile and late fertile phase of your cycle by observing, recording and interpreting the aforementioned three signs. However, you should not use these signs to determine the exact day of release of an egg.''Women usually do not release an egg and are not able to conceive during the breastfeeding period (time) and after delivery if they do not have menses (most likely for six months). However, this may not be always true.' Cervical mucus: You may feel wet in this phase. A fluid of varied consistency comes out of the cervix. It becomes slippery and stretchy and has the consistency of a raw egg white. This is due to the changes in your hormones. This fluid allows the sperm (semen) to travel and live in the woman’s system for three to five days. The changes in the cervical mucus can be seen at the beginning and end of your fertile days. Basal body temperature: You may experience a slight increase in body temperature during your ovulation (fertile) days. The temperature readings can be used to determine the timing of egg release and your fertile days. Mittelschmerz: Some women may have cramps on the side from where the egg is released. Some may even have some spotting when they ovulate."
How can you track your ovulation?,"'Tracking and knowing when you are releasing eggs (the fertile window) will help you to know the best timing/days of the months to have sex with your partner and get pregnant. There are certain methods such as' Ovulation calendar: Writing down when your period starts each month and how long it lasts may help you to determine your fertile days. Ovulation predictor kits: The World Health Organization recommends home-based ovulation predictor kits to increase your chances of getting pregnant. It is a urine test kit that checks your luteinizing hormone (LH). Devices and apps: There are popular devices and apps available to assist you to monitor your menses, predict the release of the egg, the best time to conceive and your next menses. However, this may be inaccurate because every woman has varied natural signs of the fertile period."
Why is pelvic exenteration done?,"'The surgery is most commonly indicated for recurrent ''cervical cancer'', but patients with recurrent uterine, vulvar, or vaginal cancers may also benefit from pelvic exenteration. Pelvic exenteration is not ideal to treat ''ovarian cancer'' because ''ovarian cancer'' is often associated with distant spread across the body (''metastasis''). Pelvic cancers usually require multimodality treatment, including surgical resection and ''radiation''. Pelvic exenteration is usually indicated when other surgical procedures, radiation, and ''chemotherapy'' fail to completely cure the ''cancer'' and there is recurrence.' "
How is pelvic exenteration performed?,"'The surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The surgery is long, takes over 8 hours, and usually involves a team of surgeons.''There are three types of pelvic exenteration:''Following pelvic exenteration, reconstructive surgery would be performed. There would be the placement of ostomies (holes) connected to an external pouch for urination and defecating. The women may have surgery to reconstruct a vagina. The new vagina is called a ""neovagina.”' Anterior pelvic exenteration: Removal of all the reproductive organs and the bladder. Posterior pelvic exenteration: Removal of all the reproductive organs and the bowel. Total exenteration: Removal of all the reproductive organs and the bladder, urethra, rectum, anus, and colon."
What happens after pelvic exenteration?,"'Patients typically stay in the hospital for 7 to 10 days after surgery. Medications to prevent ''blood clots'', infection, ''pain'', and ''constipation'' would be prescribed. Early ''walking'' and chest physiotherapy would be performed to prevent blood clots in the blood vessels and ''pneumonia''. If vaginal reconstruction is done, the patient would be unable to sit for 6-8 weeks but they would be able to lie on the side or stand. Surgical incisions should be kept clean and dry. The patients are advised to wear loose-fitting clothes made of breathable materials like cotton. Patients may walk and do simple activities that they can tolerate. Patients should avoid housework, lifting, sexual intercourse sports, and ''exercise'' including ''yoga'' or ''Pilates'' until the doctor approves. Complete recovery can take around 6 months or longer.''When to see a doctor:''The following require immediate medical attention:' Fever Nausea or vomiting New or worsening pain Worsening swelling or redness Discharge Wound opening Vaginal bleeding Urinary problems like burning or inability to pass urine through the pouch Constipation Wound pain, swelling, redness, discharge, and opening"
What are the complications of pelvic exenteration?,'Pelvic exenteration is major surgery. Some possible complications that may be encountered are:' Blood loss Blood clots Edema (swelling) Blood clots with the blood vessels Infection Reaction to anesthesia Fistula (abnormal communication between two body structures) Bowel obstruction Blood clots Necrosis (tissue death) of flap used for reconstruction A decrease in quality of life
What is pleurisy?,"'Pleurisy is a medical condition which causes ''chest pain'' and ''shortness of breath''. It is swelling and irritation of the tissue between the ''lungs'' and chest wall/ rib cage. Pleura is a thin two-layer protective membrane that covers the lungs and also lines the inside of the chest wall. The two layers of pleura are normally lubricated by a thin layer of fluid between them, which helps them slide easily over each other when we breathe in and out.' "
What are the causes of pleurisy?,"'Pleurisy is often caused by an infection. The infection may be viral or bacterial. The other common causes include:' Asbestos-related disease (from home or work exposure) Certain cancers (lung, lymphoma, and mesothelioma) A blood clot that travels to the lung Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus (an autoimmune disorder) Reactions to certain medicines or cancer treatments Injury to the lung, for example from a fractured rib"
What are the common symptoms of pleurisy?,"'The most common symptom of pleurisy is\xa0''chest pain''\xa0that may start suddenly. The ''pain'' is often described as a stabbing sensation that may be severe at times. It worsens with ''breathing''. Other symptoms of pleurisy may include:' Rapid, shallow breathing because of the pain Dry Cough Extreme weakness Chills and fever Shortness of breath or respiratory distress due to large amounts of fluid in the pleural space (known as pleural effusion) making it difficult for the lungs to expand."
How pleurisy is usually diagnosed?,"'The following tests are usually helpful for diagnosis pleurisy:' Chest X-rays Chest CT scan Thoracocentesis: If there is fluid build-up in the pleural space (pleural effusion), the doctor may drain the fluid and send it to be tested to help determine the cause of the pleurisy. Sputum samples or throat swabs, and blood tests help diagnose infectious causes (viruses or bacteria)."
How pleurisy is usually treated?,"'Treatment for pleurisy usually involves relieving the pain and, treating the underlying cause.''Treatment for pleurisy may include:' Chest pain: A physician may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen to ease the pain and fever. Underlying cause: If your pleurisy is caused by a viral infection, it'll usually get better on its own after a few days, however in few conditions antiviral drugs may be needed if the symptoms are severe or the patient is already in poor health. Bacterial infection may be treated with antibiotics. Patients may need to be admitted to the hospital in very severe cases where the medications are usually given through injections or intravenously. Pleural effusion: Sometimes pleurisy causes a build-up of excess fluid around the lungs called pleural effusion. In this condition, the patient may develop shortness of breath. The fluid may need to be drained by inserting a needle or tube through the chest wall under general or local anesthesia. Anti-inflammatory medications, pain killers, antibiotics, antiviral drugs and steroids Draining off the excess fluid  Medications to stop the fluid from building up again."
What to expect after pleurisy?,"'If the underlying cause is diagnosed and treated early, a complete cure is possible. Symptoms may sometimes recur after the first round of treatment, hence routine medical checkups are recommended. The doctor may recommend few lifestyle modifications such as giving up ''smoking'' and taking sufficient rest. Sometimes patients affected by bacterial pleurisy may develop complications and hence such patients may require long time antibiotics. The long term complications of severe pleurisy include:' Lungs that may be blocked or can’t expand the way they should (atelectasis) Pus in your pleural cavity (emphysema) A sudden drop in blood flow (shock) A dangerous reaction to infection (sepsis) Inflammation can also make fluid buildup in your pleural cavity. This is called pleural effusion.  Sometimes, pain may not be a major complaint, but there may be breathing difficulty. In such cases, the doctor might give medications like diuretics, or might have a procedure to drain the fluid regularly."
What is a retrobulbar block?,"'Retrobulbar block is an anesthetic procedure used for eye surgeries.\xa0''Usually, ''lidocaine'' with epinephrine is injected into the retrobulbar space, which is the area located behind the eyeball (globe). It numbs the muscles around the eye by blocking cranial nerves II, III, and VI. This numbs the eye and also paralyzes the eye muscles temporarily so the eye does not move during the procedure. Retrobulbar block also helps numb the eye’s ''cornea'', uvea, and ''conjunctiva'' by blocking the ciliary nerves.''Retrobulbar block was the standard procedure for anesthetizing the eye, however, another technique called peribulbar anesthesia (PBA) is becoming the preferred method because there is less chance of injuring the eye and the structures behind the globe (''optic nerve'' and eye muscles) during the procedure.\xa0' "
What is a retrobulbar block used for?,"'Retrobulbar block is used for any type of eye surgery or procedure requiring eyeball (globe) anesthesia and eye muscle ''paralysis'', such as:' Cataract surgery Corneal surgery Refractive surgery Glaucoma surgery Certain oculoplastic surgeries (surgeries on the eyeball) Eye muscle surgery (such as that to correct strabismus)  Retinal surgery Repair of traumatic injuries to the eye (ruptured globe)"
How do doctors perform retrobulbar block?,"'To perform the retrobulbar block:''There are alternatives to using the retrobulbar block, including:' The patient is first placed laying on their back, staring up at the ceiling Mild sedation such as propofol or midazolam is often administered intravenously  The surface of the eye is numbed with topical anesthesia (usually tetracaine or similar medications) A local anesthetic (lidocaine, also frequently used in a mixture with bupivacaine) is injected behind the eyeball (globe)  To decrease the chance of bleeding, ocular compression (the doctor applies pressure to the eyeball) may be performed a few seconds at a time for up to two minutes Topical anesthesia using drops applied to the surface of the eye is commonly used in cataract surgery.  Peribulbar block is similar to the retrobulbar block but the anesthetic is administered in a different area of the eye and is less likely to damage important eye structures.  Sub-Tenon block involves the use of topical anesthetic drops and an anesthetic injection to the eye.  General anesthesia is rarely used for eye surgeries except in complex cases."
How long does retrobulbar block last?,"'Depending on the type of anesthetic used, a retrobulbar block may be short-acting, lasting about 30 minutes, or long-acting, lasting about 6-8 hours.' "
What are risks and complications of retrobulbar block?,"'Retrobulbar block is generally well-tolerated. When complications do occur, they can include:' Retrobulbar bleeding Infection Optic nerve injury  Eye redness Eye pain Dilated pupils/light sensitivity Allergic reaction to anesthetic  Ocular perforation  Respiratory depression or arrest Stroke in the eye Seizure Slow heart rate Eyelid drooping Double vision Corneal abrasion Subarachnoid or intradural injection (very rare) "
What is sinusitis?,"'Sinuses are air-filled ''cavities'' in the skull that surround the nose. They are present in the forehead, cheeks, and near the eyes. These are closed spaces in the skull with a small opening. ''Sinus infection'' (sinusitis) occurs when the opening gets blocked and ''mucus'' gets trapped in the sinuses and starts accumulating. This causes ''viruses'', bacteria, or fungi to grow easily because of the moist and stagnant environment. This is also called'' acute sinusitis.''Chronic sinusitis'' occurs when the tissue lining and spaces get inflamed for three months or longer. Chronic sinusitis usually involves nasal ''airway'' inflammation (''rhinitis'') as well. Hence, it is also called ''chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)''. Chronic sinusitis usually occurs as a result of recurrent episodes of acute sinusitis that haven’t been managed appropriately. CRS is typically noninfective and occurs mainly due to ''allergy'' or medical conditions such as ''cystic fibrosis'', where mucus clearance is impaired. In CRS, normal mucus drainage is impaired, and there is inflammation and swelling of the tissues in the nose and sinuses causing nasal discharge and obstruction.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of acute sinusitis?,'Symptoms of a sinus infection include:' Nasal obstruction Postnasal drip (dripping of the mucus from the nose to throat) when the person is lying down Headache Facial pain Cough Fever Fatigue Halitosis (bad breath) Pain over the upper teeth
What are the signs and symptoms of chronic sinusitis?,"'Common signs and symptoms of chronic sinusitis include:' Itching of the nose Thick white or yellowish-white (yellowish discharge indicates superimposed bacterial infection) discharge from the nose Postnasal drip (constant drainage of the mucus through the back of the nose and down the throat) causing discomfort and throat irritation Nasal obstruction (nose block) or congestion Pain, tenderness, and swelling around your eyes, cheeks, nose, or forehead Reduced sense of smell and taste Change in voice Pain in the upper jaw and teeth, especially around the canines  Cough Recurrent clearing of the throat  Recurrent episodes of a sore throat because of mouth breathing as a result of nose block and postnasal drip Halitosis (Bad breath) Disturbed sleep Inability to concentrate  Fatigue"
How is acute sinusitis treated?,"'Treatment options include:''Medical treatment:''Supportive treatment:' Over-the-counter medication such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can help relieve symptoms such as pain and fever. Nasal decongestant sprays such as oxymetazoline can reduce swelling and congestion, relieving the nasal obstruction. Antibiotics may be prescribed to get rid of the infection faster. Humidifiers to add moisture to the air that reduces dryness, softening the dried mucus Nasal irrigation Nasal irrigation with saline using products such as a neti pot that can flush out excess mucus, bacteria, and crusts, reducing nasal congestion Steam inhalation that can moisten the dried mucus and crusts, reducing nasal congestion Adequate rest and hydration Applying a warm compress over the face that can help reduce the pain and nasal congestion"
How is chronic sinusitis treated?,"'Treatment options for chronic sinusitis include:' Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may be prescribed in the form of local nasal sprays or oral medications or as injections. Steroids help to suppress allergy, reduce inflammation, and shrink tissue growth. Examples include fluticasone, mometasone, and beclomethasone. Saline nasal irrigation: The nose may be irrigated with nasal sprays or solutions. This helps to clear the airway by flushing out mucus, crusts, and pollutants. Aspirin desensitization treatment: Those who have allergic reactions to aspirin causing sinusitis can be treated by administering increasing doses of aspirin under a doctor’s supervision until aspirin tolerance increases. Antibiotics: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is typically not infective. However, antibiotics may be used to treat secondary bacterial infections. The role of antibiotics is to get rid of a biofilm (a thin layer of fluid containing germs) that lines the sinus lining. Immunotherapy: CRS be treated with immunotherapy. Dupilumab is one such drug that can help suppress the body's immune cells to reduce reaction to specific allergens. Polyps: Polyps around the sinus openings may cause obstruction of the sinuses. These need to be managed by medicines or surgery. Surgery: An endoscopic sinus surgery may be done in patients resistant to medical treatment or medication. An endoscope (a thin, tube with an attached light and camera) and surgical instruments and inserted into the nose to perform surgery under anesthesia."
What is the stomach flu?,"'Stomach flu'' or viral ''gastroenteritis'' is an infection caused by a virus that infects your stomach. Although the term has ''flu'' in it, it is not a true flu. You may experience the following symptoms''If you come in contact with an infected person, ingest contaminated food or water or share your personal items such as plates and toothbrushes, you are likely to contract a stomach virus.''If you are otherwise healthy, you will probably recover without complications.''Although it is often called stomach flu, it is not caused by ''influenza'' ''viruses''. Stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis) is caused by various viruses including''Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, may also make you sick. In many cases, the virus is passed through the fecal-oral route.' Watery diarrhea Abdominal cramps/pain Nausea Vomiting Occasional muscle pain Headache Sometimes low-grade fever Weakness Noroviruses: This is the most common cause of foodborne illness in both children and adults worldwide. It can spread through families and communities. It is likely to spread among people who live in confined spaces. Mostly, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water, although person-to-person transmission is also possible. Rotaviruses: This  is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children and babies who put their fingers and other contaminated objects in their mouths. The infection is most severe in newborn babies and children. Adults infected with rotavirus may not show any symptoms; however, they still can spread the infection."
How long does the stomach flu last?," Symptoms that include vomiting and diarrhea, fever and stomach pain can last for one to three days depending on the cause. Diarrhea may persist longer, for up to 10 days, after the disappearance of other symptoms. Even if you are feeling better and even if your symptoms subside, you can be still contagious from a few days up to two weeks or more, depending on which virus caused your stomach flu. Because the symptoms are similar, viral diarrhea can be easily confused with diarrhea caused by other bacteria (bacteria that cause cholera or diarrheal illnesses). Your infection may range from mild to severe. If you are healthy and drink enough fluids to replace fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhea, then it will not cause any problems in recovery. However, if you have complications such as dehydration (severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals), it may require more attention. Babies, veterans and people with a low immune system (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], cancer, or other severe illnesses) may become severely dehydrated when they lose more fluids than they can replace. Sometimes, hospitalization may be required to replace the lost fluids through intravenous fluid supply. Dehydration can be fatal, but it is rare."
Who is more susceptible to stomach flu?,"'Worldwide, people of every age, race and background are affected by stomach flu (gastroenteritis); however, the following people are more susceptible to it' Newborn babies and children, especially in childcare centers and elementary schools, are more vulnerable to catch these infections. Older adults tend to catch the infection due to a weakened immune system.This applies especially to veterans in nursing homes who are more vulnerable and they can pass the infection on to other close contacts. Anywhere where groups of people come together in close quarters can be an environment for transmission of intestinal infection. People with a weakened immune system because of diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and cancer or due to chemotherapy are at risk of infection. In the northern hemisphere, rotavirus and norovirus are most active between October and April."
How do doctors diagnose stomach flu?,"'Your doctor will likely diagnose gastroenteritis based on''Your pediatrician may assess your child for the degree of dehydration by checking\xa0' Your symptoms A physical examination The presence of similar cases in your community A rapid stool test to detect rotavirus or norovirus or to rule out other possible bacterial or parasitic infections Blood pressure, pulse, heart rate Skin turgor Fontanelle (soft part) on the frontal head Mucous membranes such as the tongue and eyes for tears Mental status (consciousness, cry and response) Urine output and thirst"
What is a trachea?,"'A trachea, ''also called a windpipe, is a tube about 4 inches long and less than an inch in diameter in most people. This tube connects the larynx (voice box) to the ''lungs''. The trachea begins just under the voice box (larynx) and runs down behind the breastbone (sternum). The trachea then divides into two smaller tubes called the bronchi, which is then divided into the lungs. The trachea widens and lengthens slightly with each breath in, returning to its resting size with each breath out.' "
What is tracheal resection?,"'Tracheal resection'' is a surgical procedure of the windpipe. The procedure involves removing a part of the windpipe and stitching back the remaining part. Tracheal resection is most commonly performed in cases of ''cancers'' involving the windpipe or secondary to injury or sometimes after an incision in the windpipe made to relieve an obstruction to ''breathing'' (''tracheostomy''). Patients present with signs of ''airway'' obstruction particularly when lying flat.''Up to 50% of the tracheal length can be removed by a simple surgery, and the remaining ends can be connected. Only occasionally, an artificial reconstruction of trachea may be required.' "
When does an individual require tracheal resection?,"'Tracheal resection is performed when there is significant narrowing in the windpipe. Narrowing of the windpipe can cause life-threatening conditions. Below are some common causes for tracheal resection:' Windpipe deformities by birth Tumors, lesions, and cancers (aggressive and nonaggressive) Windpipe scarring Injury to the windpipe Severe breathing difficulties Chest infections Swallowing difficulties"
How long does tracheal resection take?,"'Tracheal resection is a major surgery and usually takes approximately eight hours. The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia or intravenous sedation.\xa0' After administering anesthesia, the surgeon monitors the patient’s oxygen and heart rate throughout the procedure. The surgeon makes an incision in the middle of the chest, which exposes the heart, large blood vessels entering and leaving the heart, and the windpipe, which is located behind these. Once the surgeon locates the windpipe and identifies the narrow section, they will connect a bypass machine, which will take over the function of the heart and lungs. The surgeon can then cut the windpipe, removing its narrow section. The surgeon will stitch back together the cut ends of the windpipe. Usually, the surgeon uses a flexible tube called bronchoscope to look inside the windpipe, which ensures the repair has been successful. Once ready, the surgeon disconnects the bypass machine and withdraws the bronchoscope. The surgeon closes the chest with stitches and inserts drain tubes to drain away any blood and allow antiseptic fluid to flow around the site of surgery, reducing the risk of infection."
What is the outcome after tracheal resection?,'The vast majorities of patients who undergo this procedure do very well and require very little ongoing care in the long term. Tracheal resection allows patients to lead a normal life without any breathing or swallowing difficulties.' 
What happens after tracheal resection?,"'After the procedure, the patient may be on several tubes and have wires connected to them. These are necessary to keep them hydrated, comfortable, ''pain'' free, and to avoid any complications. Antibiotics, painkillers and anti-reflux medicines are given to the patient to avoid any infection and ''pain''.\xa0''The tubes and wires may be removed in the next few days as the healing process starts. The ''breathing tube'' is often removed one or two days after the surgery. Sometimes, it may take longer to remove the tube, depending on how the patient is coping.\xa0''It is often necessary to repeat ''bronchoscopy'' and bronchography before and after the breathing tube has been removed to ensure there is no floppiness or narrowing of the airway. Once the tube has been removed, a speech and language assessment will be performed to ensure that the patient can swallow normally and that it is safe for them to start feeding by mouth.\xa0''Once this happens, and any other outstanding issues are addressed, the patient may be discharged home. Antibiotics are continued to prevent any chest infections.' "
What are the risks involved in tracheal resection?,"'There are risks associated with any surgical procedure, and these are usually explained to the patient and their family. The risks include the following:' Infection and bleeding after the procedure Damage of nearby organs during the procedure Blood clots Leak from the joint of the windpipe Decrease in oxygen levels that may be sometimes be life threatening Scar formation from the operated site Narrowing of the windpipe"
When is vaginal hysterectomy done?,"'Vaginal hysterectomy is indicated when other treatment modalities are ineffective and if the condition can’t be managed conservatively or by other less invasive procedures. Vaginal hysterectomy may be performed in the following conditions:' Cancer of the reproductive organs: Hysterectomy is the choice of treatment when there is a cancer of any of the reproductive organs. Most other gynecological conditions may be treated by other less invasive treatment modalities. The choice between vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy for cancer depends on the extent of cancer and the parts of the reproductive system involved. Uterine prolapse: The muscles and ligaments of the pelvis weaken causing the uterus to prolapse into the vagina. Hysterectomy is the choice of surgery for uterine prolapse. It may be combined with pelvic floor repair to repair the weakened tissues of the pelvis. Endometriosis: The inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus, involving the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and other organs in the pelvis. Endometriosis can cause adhesions as well. Vaginal hysterectomy is done when less invasive procedures like laparoscopic or robotic techniques are not possible. Fibroids: Fibroids are benign tumors arising in the uterus. Hysterectomy is a permanent solution to treat fibroids, especially if they are large or multiple in number and the signs and symptoms associated with fibroids. Large fibroids may require an abdominal hysterectomy. Adenomyosis: In this condition, the inner tissue lining of the uterus grows into the uterine wall leading to an enlarged uterus with heavy and painful periods. Abnormal uterine bleeding: Very heavy, painful, irregular periods when medication and/or other less invasive procedures don’t help."
How is a vaginal hysterectomy performed?,"'During surgery''The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia (the lower half of the body is numbed). The surgeon makes an incision inside the vagina to reach the uterus. The uterus is detached from the upper portion of the vagina, fallopian tubes, ovaries, the surrounding blood vessels, and bands that support it and then removed through the vaginal opening. The cervix may be removed as well. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may also be removed along with the uterus if indicated. All the ''sutures'' (''stitches'') used are usually absorbable. There are no external or visible incisions.''After surgery''Patients are usually discharged 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Painkillers and antibiotics would be prescribed. Patients experience bloody ''vaginal discharge'' for a few days to weeks after surgery, so the patient would need to wear sanitary pads. The postoperative recovery period after vaginal hysterectomy is usually shorter and less painful compared to abdominal hysterectomy. Patients are advised to avoid lifting heavy objects, vaginal intercourse, or vigorous ''exercise'' for up to 6 weeks. Complete recovery may take 6-8 weeks. After a hysterectomy, the patient would no longer be able to get pregnant and their periods would stop as well.' "
What are the complications of vaginal hysterectomy?,"'Vaginal hysterectomy is relatively safe. However, like any surgery, there is a risk of complications. They include:' Bleeding Infection Blood clots in the blood vessels Damage to surrounding organs, muscles, and other tissues Reaction to anesthesia"
What is pediatric appendectomy?,"'Pediatric ''appendectomy'' is the surgical removal of the ''appendix'' in children. The vermiform appendix is a small sac in the lower right abdomen, attached to cecum, the beginning part of the colon. The appendix produces a protein that helps fight infection, however, its presence is not essential for survival.' "
Why is a pediatric appendectomy performed?,"'A pediatric ''appendectomy'' is performed when a child’s appendix gets inflamed (''appendicitis''), or perforated from the infection. An appendectomy may be:' Emergency appendectomy: An immediate surgery for appendix removal upon diagnosis of appendicitis. Interval appendectomy: Appendectomy performed eight to 12 weeks after the initial episode of appendicitis, after treatment of the acute inflammation with medications. This method is followed if the perforation of the appendix is localized and the child is clinically well otherwise."
Emergency versus interval appendectomy,"'Studies indicate that emergency appendectomy reduces the:''Some studies indicate that 80% of children with a mass in the appendix without a rupture may not need an interval appendectomy after medical treatment of appendicitis. The benefit of interval appendectomy over early appendectomy, however, remains controversial and requires further trials.' Incidence of post-procedural adverse events Recovery period before return to normal activities Hospital charges and costs"
Is an appendectomy a major surgery?,"'Pediatric appendectomy is a routinely performed, relatively minor surgical procedure with minimal risks. The removal of appendix is a simple procedure unless extensive infection is present due to rupture of the appendix.' "
What are the types of pediatric appendectomy?,"'A pediatric appendectomy may be:''Laparoscopic appendectomy is more favored over an open surgery because of its advantages which include:' Open appendectomy: The surgeon makes a single two- to three-inch incision to access and remove the appendix with standard surgical instruments. Laparoscopic appendectomy: The surgeon makes one to three tiny incisions and uses flexible tubes and inserts a tiny lighted camera (laparoscope) to visualize the appendix, and tiny instruments to perform the surgery. Reduced post-operative pain Lower risk for wound infection Shorter hospital stays Faster wound healing and return to normal activities Useful in obese patients and patients whose appendicitis diagnosis is in doubt Ability to evaluate the entire abdomen, which is useful in adolescent girls in whom gynecological conditions can imitate appendicitis."
How is a pediatric appendectomy performed?,"'A pediatric surgeon performs a pediatric appendectomy with the child under general anesthesia. The surgery typically takes about an hour.' The child first undergoes tests and an ultrasonography or CT scan to decide between immediate surgery and interval surgery after non-operative treatment. Unless it is an emergency surgery, the child has to avoid eating and drinking for a few hours prior to the surgery. The surgeon administers fluids and antibiotics to treat and prevent infection. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and continuously monitors the child’s vital functions during the procedure. In an open surgery, the surgeonMakes a single incision in the abdominal skin and muscle over the appendix.Clamps the base of the appendix and excises it.Sutures the appendix stump.Identifies and removes all signs of infection, if the appendix is perforated, and irrigates the area with saline solution to clear all contamination.Closes the incision with sutures. Makes a single incision in the abdominal skin and muscle over the appendix. Clamps the base of the appendix and excises it. Sutures the appendix stump. Identifies and removes all signs of infection, if the appendix is perforated, and irrigates the area with saline solution to clear all contamination. Closes the incision with sutures. In a laparoscopic surgery, the surgeonDecompresses the stomach and bladder.Blows gas into the abdominal cavity.Makes a single incision or three incisions in the abdomen, depending on the specific laparoscopic technique.Removes the appendix with laparoscopic instruments and sutures the stump close.Irrigates (rinses with sterile solution) the area if the appendix is perforated.Releases the gas, and closes the incisions with sutures or staples. Decompresses the stomach and bladder. Blows gas into the abdominal cavity. Makes a single incision or three incisions in the abdomen, depending on the specific laparoscopic technique. Removes the appendix with laparoscopic instruments and sutures the stump close. Irrigates (rinses with sterile solution) the area if the appendix is perforated. Releases the gas, and closes the incisions with sutures or staples. Post-surgical care involves weaning the child off anesthesia, administration of painkillers and monitoring vital signs for a few hours."
How long does it take for a child to recover from an appendectomy?,"'Most children will be able to go home within a day after an appendectomy if the appendix is not ruptured. After appendectomies involving rupture and severe contamination, the child will require IV administration of antibiotics with hospital stay extended from five to seven days.''Post appendectomy, the children should return for a follow-up one to two weeks after discharge. Return to normal activity may take two to six weeks depending on the severity of appendicitis and the type of surgery.' "
What are the risks of a pediatric appendectomy?,"'Pediatric appendectomy is a low-risk procedure, but a few complications may arise, especially with a perforated appendix. The risks of pediatric appendectomy include:' Side effects of general anesthesia such as:NauseaVomitingDisorientationReactions to medicationWound infection Nausea Vomiting Disorientation Reactions to medication Wound infection Abscess in the abdomen which can lead to:SepsisIleus (transient paralysis of the bowels)Bowel obstruction Sepsis Ileus (transient paralysis of the bowels) Bowel obstruction Pylephlebitis (block by blood clot in the liver’s portal vein due to infection) also known as septic portal vein thrombosis, which can lead to:FeverJaundiceAbscess in the liver Fever Jaundice Abscess in the liver"
How long is a Bakri balloon left in?,"'Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) ''is a serious life-threatening complication of delivery. It can occur after vaginal or\xa0Cesarean delivery. It is associated with risks to the mother’s life. The\xa0''Bakri\xa0balloon''\xa0is indicated to manage postpartum hemorrhage occurring within 24 hours of delivery. This procedure is called ''intrauterine balloon tamponade.'"" The balloon is inflated with about 500 ml of sterile liquid, such as sterile water, saline or Ringer's lactate solution. The Bakri balloon is left in the uterus for a maximum of 24 hours.""'Based on the cause of postpartum hemorrhage, it is managed by several medical and conservative methods and invasive procedures. These include arterial embolization (block the artery to avoid bleeding); uterine compression ''sutures'' (stitch up the part of the womb that is bleeding) and uterine artery ligation (tie off the bleeding artery). A ''hysterectomy'' (surgical removal of the uterus) may be indicated if all other measures to control the bleeding fail. Intrauterine balloon tamponade has been found to be an effective, easily administered and minimally-invasive treatment option to control uterine bleeding. There are many types of balloons, including the Bakri balloon, BT-cath balloon tamponade catheter, Foley catheters, Rusch balloon, ''condom'' catheters and Sengstaken-Blakemore tube. The Bakri balloon and the BT-cath balloon tamponade catheter\xa0are the only ones that are specifically designed for postpartum hemorrhage. They are also the only devices approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PPH.''Causes of postpartum hemorrhage' Uterine atony (inability of the uterine muscles to contract): This is the most common cause of PPH (up to 80% of the cases). Retained placenta Rupture of uterus Genital tract trauma Clotting disorders"
How is the Bakri balloon used?,"'The Bakri balloon is used for temporary control or reduction of postpartum hemorrhage when only conservative management of uterine bleeding is sufficient. Uterine atony is the most common indication for the Bakri balloon. Bleeding due to genital tract injury or retained product of ''conception'' is excluded before attempting Bakri balloon. When uterotonics (medications) and other medications fail to cause appropriate uterine contractions and reduce bleeding after delivery, the Bakri balloon can be effective in decreasing or arresting PPH.''The use of a Bakri balloon may be a successful and definite treatment in many cases, but may also serve as a temporary measure to decrease bleeding while waiting and preparing the mother for other definitive treatments like uterine artery ligation, uterine compression suture, hysterectomy or uterine artery embolization. A Bakri balloon may also be used to temporarily control bleeding if the patient needs to be transferred to another center with more resources and experience.' "
What are the advantages of the Bakri balloon?,"'Advantages of the Bakri balloon include' It is made of silicone, which is a nonreactive material, and is beneficial to those with a latex allergy. The shape is similar to that of the normal uterine cavity. The risk of uterine perforation is lower. It comes presterilized. It is ready to use and quick to administer, hence saving time compared to other techniques."
When is the Bakri balloon not used?,'The use of the Bakri balloon is contraindicated in the following conditions' Heavy bleeding that requires more invasive treatments Cervical cancer Anatomical abnormalities of the uterus (abnormal structure) Uterine pathologies like fibroids that affect the shape and size of the uterus Uterine rupture or suspected rupture Genital tract injuries and bleeding from lacerations Infection of the reproductive tract Allergy to silicone (balloon material)
How long is a cold or flu contagious?,"'Both colds and the ''flu'' are ''contagious'' and are caused by ''viruses''. However, the ''viruses'' that cause colds (for example, rhinoviruses) are not the same as those that cause the ''flu'' (''influenza'' ''viruses''). Although the typical incubation period for ''influenza'' is about one to four days, some adults can be ''contagious'' from about one day before onset of symptoms for up to two weeks. Other people who develop complications, such as ''pneumonia'', may extend the ''contagious'' period for a week or two. For colds, most individuals become contagious about a day before ''cold'' symptoms develop and remain contagious for about five to seven days. Some children may pass the ''flu'' viruses for longer than seven days (occasionally for two weeks).''Colds are considered ''upper respiratory infections''. The flu may also cause lower respiratory infections.' "
How do you know if I have a cold or the flu?,"'For both the ''cold'' and the flu, early symptoms may be similar. Symptoms and signs include a ''cough'', ''runny nose'', and feeling tired. If you know you have had contact with someone with a ''cold'' or the flu in the past few days, you should suspect you may have become infected. However, ''flu symptoms'' generally are more intense than cold symptoms. People with flu can develop ''fever'', body ''aches'', ''chills'', and ''headaches'', and some develop ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Cold symptoms are much milder and usually do not require medical care. However, if you suspect you have the flu, you should seek medical care. The flu often can be diagnosed with rapid tests available to most physicians.' "
How are cold and flu viruses spread?,"'A ''common cold'' and the flu are easily spread from person to person, the flu most often by droplets produced by ''coughing'' and ''sneezing''. Cold viruses in droplets are spread mainly hand to hand. These droplets contain the infectious viruses. Occasionally, these droplets land on various surfaces and, depending on the survivability of the virus type, can be transferred when an uninfected individual touches the contaminated surface and subsequently touches his/her mouth or nose.' "
How do you know if the flu or cold is gone?,"'In most instances, individuals with a cold will resolve their symptoms without medical intervention in about one week, although sometimes the ''cough'' may last longer. However, at this point in time, the ''cough'' is not spreading contagious virus. When cold symptoms and signs resolve, a person is cured of a cold. The flu is similar except that the symptoms are more severe and, in some individuals, medical intervention may be required (for example, antiviral medications). However, depending upon the ''influenza'' strain and the severity of infection, some individuals may require hospitalization. The cure for these individuals occurs when symptoms resolve and the patient is discharged from the hospital.''The ''stomach flu'' is not caused by cold or by flu viruses. The term ''stomach flu'' is a nonspecific term that describes symptoms of ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Although these symptoms may occur with the flu, the flu is a ''respiratory infection''. In most individuals with only ''stomach flu'', the causes are usually non-flu type viruses. Similarly, ''cold sores'' are not actually caused by cold viruses but by herpesviruses.' "
When should someone seek medical care for a cold or the flu?,"'Unless the person has medical problems, such as a ''depressed'' immune system, most individuals do not need to seek medical care for a cold. However, individuals with the flu may need to seek medical care under the following conditions:''If there is any question as to whether or not you have a cold or the flu, especially during flu season, you should seek medical care.'   Fever that is continual or becomes high Shaking chills Coughing that produces bloody sputum and/or a greenish-yellow color Difficulty breathing Chest pain or chest pressure Repeated nausea and vomiting Confusion Facial pain"
What are the signs and symptoms of COVID-19?,'Symptoms may appear\xa02-14 days after exposure\xa0to the virus.\xa0Some common symptoms that may occur in COVID-19 include (researchers would continue to update this list as more discoveries are made about COVID-19):''The following warning signs require emergency medical care:' Fever Chills Throat pain Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Loss of smell Loss of taste Headache Runny nose Nose block Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Inflammation of the eye Skin rashes Discoloration of fingers or toes Difficulty in breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest Worsening of symptoms Onset of confusion Drowsiness Inability to wake up Bluish discoloration of lips or face
Who is at risk?,"'Anyone can be at risk of contracting the disease if exposed but certain factors increase the risk of serious illness and complications (but this is not a rule as healthy, low-risk individuals have also experienced severe illness and serious complications):' Elderly people Children Pregnant women Heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart) Cancer Lung diseases, such as chronic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema Diabetes Obesity Smoking Chronic kidney disease Blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease Weakened immune system due to medication like steroids and medications for HIV, diabetes, or other illnesses Liver disease Brain and nervous system conditions Hypertension (high blood pressure)"

How is COVID-19 caused?,"'Infection with the new coronavirus (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' coronavirus 2, or ''SARS''-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).''The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when an infected person ''coughs'', sneezes, breathes, sings, or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person nearby; this is called droplet transmission. The virus may also stay in the air for several minutes or hours; this is called airborne transmission. The virus may also spread if a person touches a surface or object contaminated with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eyes. Less commonly, reinfections with the virus may also occur. The risk of spread is when there is close contact (within 6 ''feet'', or 2 meters) with\xa0a COVID-19 patient or being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person.' "
How to prevent COVID-19?,"'There is no ''vaccine'' available to prevent\xa0COVID-19 at present, but there is ongoing research. The following measures can reduce the risk of infection:' Avoiding close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick, has symptoms, or if their health status is not known. Maintaining the social distance between oneself and others (about 6 feet). Washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and/or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Wearing a face mask, with or without a face shield in public spaces. Surgical masks may be used if available. N95 makes may be used by healthcare providers, high-risk individuals, or in crowded places (for example, during flight travel). Covering the mouth and nose with the elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing. The used tissues should be discarded properly, and hands should be washed or sanitized right away. Avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth without washing or sanitizing. Avoiding sharing food, dishes, glasses, towels, bedding, and other household items with anyone who might be sick or friends and family whose health/exposure status is unknown. Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, switches, electronics, and counters, regularly. Staying home from work, school, public transportation, taxis, and other public areas if one is sick. To get medical care, it is advised to drive if possible or call for an ambulance."
Symptoms of pneumonia,"'Pneumonia is a common but serious lung infection that affects ''breathing'' capability in an individual. Pneumonia makes an individual weak because oxygen in the bloodstream decreases. In this infection, the air sacs in the ''lungs'' become swollen and fill up with fluid or pus. Pneumonia may be caused by bacteria, a virus, or fungi. The common ''symptoms of pneumonia'' include:' Cough, usually with phlegm (a slimy substance from deep in the lungs) Fever Chills Shortness of breath Chest pain  Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Weakness Generalized body aches and headaches"
How does pneumonia spread?,"'Usually, patients affected with pneumonia may ''cough'' or sneeze, which creates small respiratory droplets that contain the disease-causing organism. Other people may get infected if they breathe in those droplets. Most people who spend a short amount of time with someone who is sick may not get infected. However, the disease often spreads between people who live together because they spend a lot of time together such as schools, college residence halls, military barracks, ''nursing'' homes, and hospitals.' "
What are the different causes of pneumonia?,"'Bacteria are the most common cause. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including:''Viruses'' that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks but sometimes may become serious and need immediate medical attention. An individual with viral pneumonia is usually also at risk of getting bacterial pneumonia. Different viruses that can cause pneumonia include:''Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include:' Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila (often called Legionnaires' disease) Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Some common cold and flu viruses Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) Coccidioidomycosis, which causes valley fever Histoplasmosis Cryptococcus"
How is pneumonia treated?,"'Pneumonia treatment depends on the type of disease-causing germ. It may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more.' Antibiotics are considered the treatment of choice for pneumonia because they can treat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. However, they may not work for viral pneumonia. Antiviral medicines such Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) are prescribed for viral pneumonia. Antifungal medicines such as Diflucan (fluconazole), Sporanox (itraconazole), Ancobon (flucytosine), and Nizoral (ketoconazole) may be prescribed to treat other types of fungal pneumonia. Patients may be treated in a hospital if symptoms are severe or if they are at risk of complications such as a low blood oxygen level. Patients may need oxygen therapy in a few cases."
What is shingles?,"'Shingles (''herpes zoster'') is a viral disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. It is characterized by a painful ''rash'' on certain body parts.''After the first ''chicken pox'' infection, the virus may lie in the nerve tissue in an inactive state. It reactivates years later as singles.''Risk factors for shingles''If patients have had a history of chickenpox, the risk of shingles includes' Physical or emotional stress Weakened immune system due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cancer Diabetes mellitus Long-term steroid treatment or immunosuppressant treatment Transplant patients Poor nutrition and health Major physical injury"
What are the signs and symptoms of shingles?,"'The shingles ''rash'' typically occurs over one side of the face or body. Common signs and symptoms include:' Pain (usually the first symptom in shingles and can vary in intensity) Burning sensation, numbness or tingling and itching Multiple blisters that appear in a cluster pattern (an area of redness may accompany the rash) Blisters contain fluid and they break open with crusting Fever, chills, fatigue and body ache Headache Photophobia (sensitivity to light) (only if the face is involved) Fatigue"
How does a shingles rash look?,"'The typical shingles red rash or blisters follow ''pain'', ''itching'' and tingling. It is usually limited to one side of the face and body.\xa0''Rash and blisters of shingles appear on one side of the face extending to the scalp, ear and inside the mouth.

What are the complications of shingles?,"'Shingles can have complications that last long after the rash is gone. Complications can also occur if the infection has not been treated appropriately.' Postherpetic neuralgia: Pain that lasts long after the infection resolves. Facial nerve paralysis causing disfigurement of the face. Loss of vision if the cornea is infected. Loss of hearing and balance problems. Systemic spread of the virus to the brain in case of poor immunity (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], transplant patients). Bacterial infection of the skin causes increased swelling, redness, warmth, pain, tenderness and pus formation."
How long is the surgery for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Ectopic pregnancy'' surgery can be either laparoscopic (via camera and smaller ''cuts'') or via laparotomy (surgery by opening the belly). If the physician prefers laparoscopic surgery, it will take about 30 minutes to 1 hour. However, if the physician chooses laparotomy, it might take longer to complete. The patient should return to the ward within 1 to 2 hours.' "
When is the surgery for ectopic pregnancy indicated?,"'Ectopic pregnancy'' is a condition where the embryo implants outside the uterus, especially in the fallopian tubes.''Surgery for ectopic ''pregnancy'' is indicated when''However, the surgery would be avoided when' The patient is not fit for medical therapy. There is a failure of medical treatment. The patient has both ectopic pregnancy and intrauterine pregnancy. The patient’s vitals are abnormal or unstable (irregular, lower or high pulse; poor oxygen levels and; low blood pressure) The patient has an ectopic pregnancy, which is treatable with medicines. The patient has an underlying medical condition that would make the surgery difficult."
How is surgery for ectopic pregnancy performed?,"'The physician either chooses a ''laparoscopy'' or laparotomy to resolve the ectopic pregnancy. The surgery is generally performed under general anesthesia. For ectopic pregnancy that hasn’t ruptured, the physician attempts to remove the products of ''conception'' present in the ampulla region of the fallopian tube (salpingotomy). In some cases, the physician identifies the tube that contains the ectopic pregnancy and separates it from the surrounding structures (salpingectomy). In laparoscopic surgery, the physician makes two to three cuts in the lower belly. Next, the physician inserts a laparoscope and small surgical tools to access the pelvic organs. The physician makes a cut about 1 to 2 cm long on the fallopian tube. Fluid under pressure is injected into the tube to dislodge the pregnancy. The physician may also perform an open surgery in the case of severe bleeding or when the laparoscopic technique has been a failure.' "
What should I do after surgery for ectopic pregnancy?,"'The patient should follow these instructions after the surgery''If the patient observes the following symptoms, she should call her physician immediately' Rest for a week after the surgery, even if she feels better sooner. Avoid lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kg), which would strain the incision. Avoid exercises or strenuous activities until the doctor says so. Climb the stairs slowly with a pause after every step. Don’t attempt driving for a few days after the surgery. Walk as often as she can. Avoid standing for long periods. Don’t engage in sexual activities unless the physician says it is safe to do so. Continue with deep breathing exercises taught in the hospital. Prevent constipation byDrinking six to eight glasses of water every day.Eat fruits, whole grains, vegetables and leafy green vegetables.Use a laxative or a mild stool softener.

What is gastric bypass surgery?,"'Gastric bypass surgery'' is a ''weight loss surgery''. In this surgery, a surgeon makes changes to the stomach and small intestine to alter the way you absorb and digest the food. Gastric bypass helps in ''weight loss'' by:' Restricting the amount of food the stomach holds. Limiting the amount of calories and nutrients the body absorbs. Changing gut hormones, which keeps the stomach full for longer. Contribute to hunger suppression. Reversal of obesity."
Can gastric bypass be done laparoscopically?,"'Gastric bypass is usually performed laparoscopically, it involves making five to six small incisions in the abdomen\xa0through which are inserted a small video scope and surgical tools.\xa0' The surgeon staples the top portion of the stomach so it is separated from the bottom to create a small stomach pouch.  This pouch restricts food intake.  A section of the small intestine called the jejunum is then attached to the small stomach pouch permitting food to bypass the lower stomach (duodenum).  This bypass reduces the amount of calories and nutrients the body absorbs and thus contributes to weight loss. "
How long does laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery take?,"'The camera scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view inside the belly while doing the operation, which usually takes two to three hours under general anesthesia' "
What are the possible side effects after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery?,"'There are potential short-term and long-term complications from having\xa0''weight loss'' surgery which include:' Constipation  Sagging skin Wound infections: It can happen up to three weeks after surgery. Symptoms include redness and warmth, pain, or thick drainage (pus) from the surgical wound. Wound infections require antibiotics and sometimes further surgery. Dumping syndrome: This happens after eating high-sugar meals after weight loss surgery. Sodas or fruit juices are often to blame. The sugary food rushes through the stomach and can cause nausea, vomiting, and weakness. Gallstones: Up to 50% of patients will develop gallstones after gastric bypass surgery, but these are usually harmless. Sometimes, gallstones can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. About 15% to 25% of people need surgery to remove their gallbladder after gastric bypass surgery. Sometimes, gallstones can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  About 15% to 25% of people need surgery to remove their gallbladder after gastric bypass surgery. Blood in stool: Blood in stool appears as reddish or black stools, which may be serious. Immediate medical attention is required for this side effect. Blood clots to the lungs: This side effect is rare, happening less than 1% of the time. They can be life-threatening. But blood clots can usually be prevented with blood-thinning drugs and frequent activity. Leaks in the new connections made by the weight loss surgery are rare, but serious. They usually occur within 5 days of the surgery. Abdominal pain and feeling ill are common symptoms."
What are the advantages of laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery?,"'Laparoscopic gastric bypass can provide long-term weight loss. It can also improve ability to perform routine daily activities, which could help improve quality of life. Below are few other advantages of laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery:' Laparoscopic gastric bypass has short recovery time. Most people stay in the hospital for two to three days, and get back to normal activities in three to five weeks. In addition to weight loss, gastric bypass surgery may improve or resolve conditions often related to being overweight, including heart disease, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and osteoarthritis (joint pain)."
What is laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication?,"'Laparoscopic Nissen ''fundoplication'' is a minimally invasive procedure to treat severe ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD''). Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication helps to strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter muscle by reducing the potential for stomach acid to move back up into the ''esophagus''. In a Nissen fundoplication the top part of the stomach (fundus) is wrapped 360 degrees around the lower esophagus and sutured.\xa0''Nissen fundoplication is named after Dr. Rudolf Nissen, who first designed the procedure in the 1950s, as a treatment for severe reflux ''esophagitis'' (inflammation of the esophagus). It is now a common treatment for severe ''GERD'' and often accompanied by a repair of ''hiatal hernia'', which is common in GERD patients.' "
Why is laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication performed?,"'GERD is a condition in which the stomach acid flows backward up into the esophagus, irritating the lining and causing symptoms such as''GERD is caused by dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter muscle. In a healthy person, this muscle acts as a valve that opens to let food pass into the stomach and closes to prevent the stomach contents coming back into the esophagus.''Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is performed to strengthen the sphincter muscle to prevent ''acid reflux''. The procedure is performed in situations such as:' Heartburn Chest pain Burning at the back of the throat Acidic taste in the mouth Chronic hoarseness, cough and sore throat Medications, diet and lifestyle changes do not provide relief Requirement of long-term treatment with medications Complications from GERD such as Barrett’s esophagus (abnormal cells in the esophagus) Peptic stricture (narrowing of esophagus) Development of GERD-associated hoarseness, cough or asthma Development of hiatal hernia Chronic esophagitis"
How is a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication performed?,"'Nissen fundoplication is a commonly performed laparoscopic surgery. The surgeon performs the procedure using tiny surgical instruments inserted through a flexible tube (laparoscope). Surgeons access the stomach through five tiny incisions made in the upper abdominal region. The surgeon is guided by images transmitted from a lighted camera in the laparoscope inserted through one of the incisions.''Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is performed under general anesthesia in an operation room. The procedure may take up to three hours.''Prior to the procedure a patient may be required to' Undergo physical examination, blood, urine and imaging tests Undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy test to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract, along with a biopsy Undergo esophageal manometry test to test the muscular function of the esophagus Undergo impedance monitoring test to evaluate the movement of food down the esophagus Undergo a gastric emptying study Undergo 24-hour monitoring for pH value (acidity) assessment Drink only clear liquids for 24-48 hours before the procedure, according to the doctor’s advice. Avoid eating or drinking anything for eight hours prior Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications Inform the doctor of any allergies An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient will be intubated to assist breathing. The patient will have an IV line for medication. The surgeon makes five tiny incisions in the upper abdominal area. The surgeon inflates the abdomen with carbon dioxide for improved visibility. Using tiny instruments inserted through the incisions, the surgeon grasps the fundus portion of the stomach. The surgeon then wraps the fundus over the lower esophageal sphincter and sutures it. If a hiatal hernia is present, the surgeon repairs the hernia. The surgeon arrests any bleeding present and lets the gas out. The instruments are removed, and the incisions are closed with dissolvable sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia, administered painkillers and monitored in the recovery room for a few hours."
How long does it take to recover from a fundoplication?,"'A laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication may require hospital stay of two days. Most people are able to resume normal activities after two or three weeks. The patient may have to be on a soft food or ''liquid diet'' until the esophagus heals, and avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities.' "
How long does a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication last?,"'For a majority of patients, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is reported to have resulted in lasting relief. The procedure improves quality of life and is superior to being on lifelong medication. A small percentage of people may have persisting symptoms. Some may have to repeat the surgery due to complications from the fundoplication or other underlying conditions.' "
What are the risks and complications of a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication?,"'Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is a surgical solution for serious GERD, but there are a few risks associated with the procedure, which include:''Side effects of anesthesia such as\xa0''Risks of surgery such as' nausea headache confusion wound infection pneumonia bleeding blood clots damage to internal organs, blood vessels or nerves Pain and/or difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia) Stomach fullness or discomfort after eating Gas and bloating Collapse of lung (pneumothorax) Infection and sepsis Late complications Persistent gas and bloating Persistent dysphagia Lack of relief from GERD symptoms Scar formation leading to adhesions Incisional hernia Requirement of redo procedures due to complications"
How is laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery done?,"'A laparoscopic ''inguinal hernia'' (rupture in the abdominal wall)\xa0repair is a routine surgery and may take up to two hours. A general surgeon usually performs the surgery in an operation theater. The patient is placed under general anesthesia during the procedure.' Prior to the surgery the patient Undergoes blood, urine and imaging tests. Must avoid eating and drinking 8 hours prior to the procedure. Must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Must inform the doctor of any allergies, or if pregnant. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The surgeon makes three incisions in the skin below the navel, in the inguinal region. The surgeon inflates the abdomen with carbon dioxide. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope through one of the incisions and uses the other incisions for inserting the surgical tools. Guided by the images from the laparoscope the surgeon gently pushes the protruding tissue or intestine back in place. The surgeon checks for other weak spots as an inguinal hernia might occur on one side or both sides. In case of incarcerated or strangulated hernia the surgeon may remove the hernial sac and repair the area with stitches. The surgeon fixes a mesh in the weak area to prevent the hernia from recurring. The surgeon strengthens the weak spot in the abdominal muscle wall with stitches if it is a direct hernia. The surgeon closes the inguinal ring with sutures in case of an indirect hernia. The incision is then closed with sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia, administered pain medication, and monitored in the recovery room until vital functions are stable."
How long does it take to recover from a laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery?,"'Most patients will go home the same day or a day after the laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. Generally, people will be able to resume normal activities within two weeks, but will have to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities.' "
What are the risks and complications of a laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery?,"'Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is one of the simplest and safest surgeries, but like any surgical procedure, carries certain risks.''Anesthetic side effects such as:''Surgical risks such as:' Headache Nausea Confusion Infection Pneumonia Bleeding Blood clots Injury to nearby organs, blood vessels or nerves Fluid (seroma) or blood (hematoma) in the scrotum, inguinal canal or stomach wall Damage to the spermatic cord (the cord that carries sperm from the testicle to the penis), which may affect fertility Pain in the spermatic cord or testicle Bladder injury and/or difficulty in urination Scar tissue (adhesions) Incisional hernia Injury to the testicle Recurrence of inguinal hernia"
How is a gastrojejunostomy performed?,"'A gastrojejunostomy is a surgical procedure performed under general anesthesia by a gastrointestinal surgeon. The surgeon produces a direct connection (anastomosis) between the stomach and the jejunum, part of the small intestine.''Prior to a gastrojejunostomy a patient may be required to''A precautionary course of antibiotics may be given to the patients. Stabilization of patients with severe gastric outlet obstruction may be done prior to the surgery. Treatment may be undertaken for problems such as' Undergo blood, urine and imaging tests. Avoid eating or drinking 8 hours prior to the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Inform the doctor of any allergies. Dehydration -- with IV saline Low potassium -- with supplemental potassium Anemia from bleeding -- with blood transfusion Residual stomach contents -- with stomach pumping (gastric lavage) An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient will be intubated to provide oxygen. The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the abdomen depending on the type of surgery. In case of removal or bypass of the stomach outlet (pylorus) and duodenum, the surgeon makes a surgical outlet in the stomach (stoma) and connects the jejunum directly to the stomach (anastomosis). If the surgeon removes a part of the stomach, the remaining portion of the stomach will be connected to the jejunum. The anastomosis may be closed with sutures or staples. The abdominal muscles and the incision are closed with sutures. The patient will be brought out of anesthesia and administered painkillers for post-surgical pain. The patient will be monitored in the recovery room for several hours. Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy does not require general anesthesia. The doctor may use local anesthetic and mild sedation. Guided by ultrasound imaging the doctor inserts a needle along with a guiding wire, in the stomach wall. The feeding tube may be placed in the jejunum either by pushing through the stomach wall, or passing the tube through the nose, down the upper digestive tract to the jejunum and pulled out of the stomach wall. The needle and guiding wire are withdrawn. Endoscopic gastrojejunostomy is a minimally invasive procedure. A light sedation may be used along with painkillers. A flexible viewing tube (endoscope) is advanced through the nose, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum into the jejunum. The procedure will be guided by images on the monitor. If there is obstruction in the duodenum and the scope cannot get through, a needle is used to puncture the stomach and enter the jejunum. A self-expanding metal stent is placed in the jejunum. The endoscope is gently withdrawn."
How long does it take to recover from a gastrojejunostomy procedure?,'The recovery time depends on the type of procedure and the patient’s underlying condition.''With percutaneous and endoscopic gastrojejunostomy the patient may be able to recover within 24 hours. Temporary procedures will require reversal. Complete recovery depends on the underlying condition of the patient.' For an open surgery the patient may require 10 or more days of hospitalization. Laparoscopic surgery may require hospitalization of two to three days. Complete recovery from the surgery may take up to six weeks during which period the patient may be required tofollow a specific dietavoid spicy and acidic foodsavoid heavy liftingavoid strenuous activities follow a specific diet avoid spicy and acidic foods avoid heavy lifting avoid strenuous activities
What are the risks and complications of a gastrojejunostomy?,"'Surgeons routinely perform gastrojejunostomy and it is a relatively safe surgery.

How long does it take to recover from a LEEP procedure?,"'LEEP'' is a procedure to remove cancerous tissue from the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus located at the top of the vagina. The cervix takes about 4 to 6 weeks to recover from a LEEP procedure. During the healing process, the individual should not insert anything in the vagina, such as tampons or douches. Refrain from sexual intercourse for at least 4 weeks after the procedure.''Contact the health care professional if you have any of the problems' Heavy bleeding Bleeding with clots Severe abdominal pain Fever of 101° F or more Chills Any unexpected or unexplained problems"
What is a LEEP procedure?,"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure'' (LEEP) is a procedure that uses a wire loop heated by an electric current to get rid of abnormal tissue or cells in the vagina or cervix. If Pap tests and ''colposcopy'' biopsies confirm the presence of abnormal cells, the physician may recommend LEEP to get rid of the abnormal tissue.''Abnormal tissue may be the areas of ''cervical dysplasia'', which is a condition characterized by an abnormal growth on the surface of the cervix. Cervical dysplasia, if left untreated, can worsen and lead to ''cancer''.' "
Why might I need a LEEP?,"'If Pap tests and colposcopy biopsies confirm the presence of abnormal cells, the physician may recommend LEEP to get rid of the abnormal tissue. LEEP is also useful in detecting cervical or ''vaginal cancer''.''LEEP is also recommended in' Detecting cervical dysplasia or precancerous cells that may develop into cancerous cells Diagnosis and treatment of the following conditionsPolypsGenital warts may indicate an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), a risk factor for developing cervical cancerDiethylstilbesterol (DES) exposure in women whose mothers took DES during pregnancy Polyps Genital warts may indicate an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), a risk factor for developing cervical cancer Diethylstilbesterol (DES) exposure in women whose mothers took DES during pregnancy"
How do I prepare for a LEEP procedure?,"'Before the procedure, you should take care of the following things' Don’t take aspirin or any medications that have aspirin in it. Inform the physician about allergy to any medicines, latex, tape, iodine or anesthesia. Inform the physician about all the medicines that you take. Do not use tampons, vaginal creams, douching or have sexual intercourse before the procedure. Inform the physician about any history of bleeding disorders. This procedure is usually done when you are not on a menstrual period. Inform your doctor if you are pregnant."
What happens during the LEEP procedure?,"'During a LEEP procedure' You may be asked to take a urine pregnancy test before the procedure. The physician may ask you to lie on your back and position your legs as you do during a regular pelvic examination. The physician inserts a lubricated tool (speculum) into the vagina to spread the walls of the vagina apart to expose the cervix. To magnify the tissues, the physician will use an instrument known as a colposcope, which is placed at the opening of your vagina. With the help of a colposcope, the physician identifies the areas of abnormality in the cervix or the vagina. To highlight the abnormal tissues, the physician cleanses and soaks the cervix with a dilute acetic acid solution. This solution highlights the abnormal tissue by turning it white. The physician then numbs the cervix with local anesthesia, after which an electrically charged loop made of thin wire is inserted through the speculum up to the cervix. It removes any abnormal cells. Hemostasis (cessation of blood loss) is achieved."
What can I expect after the procedure?,"'After the procedure you may observe''You should also limit strenuous activities or heavy lifting after the surgery. Take painkillers for relieving ''cramps'' or soreness. During the healing process, the individual should not insert anything in the vagina, such as tampons or douches. Refrain from sexual intercourse for at least 4 weeks after the procedure.' A watery, pinkish discharge Mild cramping A brownish-black discharge"
What is a triple arthrodesis surgery?,"'A triple arthrodesis is a surgical procedure that fuses three joints of the ankle. It is used to relieve ''pain'' from arthritic, deformed, or unstable joints.\xa0''Generally, surgeons try to avoid the fusion procedure by treating the ankle joints with alternative methods. However, when the ''pain'' is so severe, a triple arthrodesis remains the only option.\xa0''Most of the time, a triple arthrodesis offers satisfactory results in the long term as well. In one study that followed patients for 44 years after their triple arthrodesis, it found that 95% of patients were satisfied with the outcome.' "
Why is a triple arthrodesis performed?,"'A triple arthrodesis is performed for patients with the following conditions:''Many of these conditions may be treated using other procedures. Only when the nonsurgical treatments fail, the surgeon considers a triple arthrodesis. After examining the patient’s condition and disease progression, the surgeon decides whether to perform a triple arthrodesis.' Rheumatoid/degenerative arthritis (severe arthritis of ankle) Ankle deformity Ankle instability  Severe flatfoot Abnormal connections between bones Excessively high arches Joint instability due to neuromuscular disease such as poliomyelitis"
What is done before a triple arthrodesis?,'Two to three ''X-rays'' of each foot will be taken from different angles to understand the ankle problem and how to go about the surgery.''The patient will be admitted the night before the surgery and asked not to eat or drink anything for the next 12 hours before the surgery.' 
What is the technique used in a triple arthrodesis?,"'A triple arthrodesis is performed by an orthopedic surgeon.' The patient might be given general anesthesia that makes them sleep throughout the procedure or spinal anesthesia that numbs their entire leg. Additionally, an injection in the back of the knee or ankle joint may also be given to ease the pain. Next, the orthopedic surgeon makes one incision (cut) on each side of the foot. Further, the surgeon removes the elastic structure over the joint surfaces (cartilage), followed by the roughening of the bony surfaces and filling of the bony defects with bone grafts. Next, the surgeon attaches the bones with the help of hardware such as screws. This will eventually result in healthy fusion. The surgeon then sutures the incisions and covers the surgical wound with a bandage."
What is done after a triple arthrodesis?," The patient is observed for several hours after the surgery. Analgesics are given, and the leg is elevated to reduce the postoperative edema and pain in the ankle. The patient is discharged after one to three days. Instructions are given about which activities need to be restricted. While at home, leg elevation should be continued for the next five days, and ice should be applied over the ankle around three to four times a day. The patient should visit the hospital after one week to change the wound dressing. A short leg cast is applied after the edema has disappeared to restrict the movements in the ankle joint and allow healthy fusion of the joints.  Sutures are removed after two weeks."
What are the complications of a triple arthrodesis surgery?," Nonunion/malunion (bones may not fuse, or they may fuse abnormally) Degenerative joint disease (ankle arthritis due to wearing of the surrounding structures) Delayed wound healing Nerve injury Avascular necrosis (Damage to the adjacent blood vessels leading to the destruction of the ankle bone) Lateral instability (inability to move the ankle sideways)  Stiff foot"
How long does it take to recover from a triple arthrodesis?," The patient wears a plaster cast, wrapped around the ankle and foot, for the first 12 weeks following the surgery. Crutches can be used to move around and avoid weight bearing on the ankle. Gradual weight bearing is allowed until full weight bearing is reached. This usually takes around three months. The cast is removed and replaced by a removable walker boot. X-rays are obtained at approximately 12 weeks. If stable fusion is observed, the patient can switch from the walker boot to normal shoes. Physical therapy is required to restore strength and mobility in the ankle joint. It usually takes around ten 10 months to become pain-free and recover from the surgery. The patient can experience maximum improvement one year after the surgery."
What is laparoscopic surgery?,"'A laparoscopic or keyhole surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery that can be done to diagnose as well as treat medical conditions. It is called minimally invasive since it involves small incisions (surgical ''cuts'') on the abdomen as compared to the conventional “open” surgeries that involve bigger incisions. Since small incisions are used in this type of surgery, the recovery is generally faster. The surgery also has added advantages, such as less ''pain'', bleeding and scarring after the procedure. Laparoscopic surgeries involve the use of a thin, long flexible device called a laparoscope. It has a light source and camera on one end, which enables the surgeon to get a view of the inside of the abdomen and the pelvis on a television screen. Besides the incision for introducing the laparoscope inside the body, the surgery involves making 2 to 3 more incisions on the abdomen through which special kinds of laparoscopic surgical instruments are introduced to carry out the procedure.' "
How long does it take to recover from laparoscopic surgery?,"'The time it takes to recover from a laparoscopic surgery depends on many factors, such as''When done purely for a diagnostic purpose, the patient generally resumes their routine activity within 5 days.''When done for the treatment of medical conditions, the recovery may vary depending on the type of treatment. After a major surgery, such as a laparoscopic ''hysterectomy'' (removal of the uterus), removal of the ovaries or removal of a kidney for the treatment of ''cancer'', it may take up to 12 weeks to recover. The patient may be able to resume their activities within 3 weeks of a minor laparoscopic surgery, such as an ''appendix'' removal.''The surgeon will be the best person to tell the patient about the approximate recovery time after the surgery, which may vary if complications arise.' Purpose of the surgery (whether it is done for diagnosis or treatment) General health of the patient Age of the patient Presence of any other medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease"
What happens during laparoscopic surgery?," Laparoscopic surgery is performed under general anesthesia, which means the patient will sleep through the procedure and would not feel any pain or discomfort. The surgeon cleans the area to be operated on with antiseptic solutions and makes small incisions on the abdomen, which are generally 0.5 to 1 cm long. The number of incisions depends on the purpose of the surgery. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope (camera) inside the patient’s belly through one of these small incisions. For a better and wider view of the area to be operated on, a nonreactive gas, such as carbon dioxide, is pumped into the abdomen. The surgeon inserts the surgical instruments through the other incisions and removes or repairs the organ of concern. After completing the surgery, the laparoscope, instruments and gas are removed from the abdomen. The incisions are closed with stitches and dressing is applied. The patient is allowed to go home the same day or the next day after the procedure."
What are the complications of laparoscopic surgery?,'Laparoscopic surgery is a commonly performed procedure with a low risk of serious complications. Some of the risks of this surgery are' Pain Nausea/vomiting Difficulty in passing urine Bleeding and bruising Delayed wound healing Wound infections Urinary tract infection (UTI) Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the deep veins of the legs or the lungs) Injury to the bladder/bowel Blood vessel injury Reactions to general anesthesia Risk of gas embolism (entry of gas bubbles inside the veins or arteries)
What is an arthroscopy of the wrist?,"'Arthroscopy'' of the wrist involves surgical visualization to diagnose and treat disorders of the wrist joints. The use of a ''fiber''-optic instrument, known as an arthroscope, helps the surgeon to visualize the inner parts of the joints. The wrist is a complex joint that consists of eight bones and various connecting ligaments.' "
When is wrist arthroscopy indicated?,"'Wrist arthroscopy is indicated in diagnosing and treating several conditions as follows:' Chronic wrist pain Ligament (a band of the tissue that connects two bones) tears  Wrist fractures Ganglion cysts (a noncancerous lump that develops in the joints of the wrist and hands) Carpal-tunnel release (a nerve that passes through certain bones and tissues gets swollen and inflamed) Triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear (tear of TFCC, a cartilage area in the wrist)"
How to prepare for wrist arthroscopy?,"'You need to follow the below instructions before the surgery:' Provide your medical and medication history to the physician Stop taking blood thinners, such as aspirin, Advil (ibuprofen), and Aleve (naproxen), and other medicines Refrain from alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking before the surgery Inform your physician about illness such as cold, flu, fever, or herpes breakout, or other illnesses"
How is wrist arthroscopy performed?,"'Wrist arthroscopy is generally performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia. The physician inserts the arthroscope through a small incision in your wrist. The scope is connected to a video monitor.\xa0''As the scope advances, the physician examines all tissue—cartilage, ligaments, and bones. If there is damage in the joint, the physician inserts other tools to repair it. Finally, the physician gently withdraws the instruments, closes the incision, and covers it with a bandage.' "
What to expect after wrist arthroscopy?,"'After wrist arthroscopy, you' Can go home the same day of the surgery Should elevate your wrist for two to three days after the surgery, apply ice packs to relieve swelling, and keep the bandage clean and dry Should take some pain medications to relieve pain Should wear a splint for one to two weeks to keep the wrist stable"
What are the complications of wrist arthroscopy?,"'Complications of wrist arthroscopy are as follows:' Wrist weakness Tendon injury (injury to the tissue connecting the muscle to bone) Infections Excessive pain Skin peeling Tourniquet neurapraxia (temporary loss of sensory function due to blocked nerve conductions) Neuroma (nerve tumor) Compartment syndrome (a life-threatening condition, where pressure builds up in the arms) Finger joint injury Excessive swelling Bleeding or scarring"
How long does it take to recover from wrist arthroscopy?,"'Wrist arthroscopy uses small ''cuts''. Hence, recovery would be faster. You can resume your normal activities in a few days.\xa0''However, if the surgery was complex and involved too much repairing, then healing would take several weeks. Gentle exercises of the hand and fingers can restore normal functions of the wrist.' "
What are the healthier ways of losing weight?,"'A slow and steady weight loss is a healthier and sustainable weight-loss strategy than rapid weight loss.''Instead of simply keeping a check on calorie intake, concentrate on making smart dietary changes and following ''exercise'' regimes that support a healthy body and weight.''Here is what you can do:''The American ''Heart'' Association recommends moderate physical activities of 30 minutes for 5 days in a week or 150 minutes of activities spread over the week. To lose more weight, you can stretch it to 300 minutes a week. To spice it up and stay motivated, you can perform a combination of various exercises or physical activities that are dispersed throughout the week.''Chronic ''stress'' that is poorly managed may lead to elevated cortisol levels that stimulate your appetite. This may cause you to gain weight or make losing weight difficult for you. Activities like deep ''breathing'', ''yoga'', and meditation are proven stressbusters that can help you shed that extra weight.''You can stay in touch with a healthcare provider or a certified dietician to counsel you throughout your weight loss journey. This method has been shown to accelerate the weight loss program than trying to manage it all alone.' Substitute high-calorie, low-nutrition food with low-calorie, high-nutrition food Opt for food containing whole-grain cereals instead of the processed, packaged foods, such as white bread Choose boiled, roasted, or baked chicken over the fried chicken Cut back on soft drinks and instead replace them with fruit smoothies or unsweetened fruit juices Look for the fat content in dairy milk and go for low-fat milk Aerobic activities (also known as cardio exercises, endurance activities): These include brisk walking, jogging, cycling, dancing, Zumba, and swimming. Strength training: Gaining one pound of muscle through strength-training exercises will help you burn 5-10 extra calories a day."
What is the axillary dissection of the lymph node?,"'Axillary dissection is a surgical procedure that involves the opening of the axilla to identify, examine, or remove the lymph nodes.''It has been the standard technique used for the treatment of ''breast cancer'' affecting the axilla.''Traditional axillary dissection usually removes nodes in levels I and II. Traditional axillary dissection combined with ''mastectomy'' is an ideal option for invasive breast ''cancer''.' "
When is axillary dissection indicated?,'Axillary dissection is indicated in patients with a proven axillary disease. It is indicated:''There is no special caution for this surgery. The only requirements are patients who can tolerate the procedure and are appropriate for anesthesia.' If the previous sentinel node biopsy has revealed that three or more lymph nodes are affected by cancer cells If the surgeon can feel swollen underarm or collarbone lymph nodes before the surgery or during any diagnostic tests If cancer has spread to the outside of the lymph nodes If sentinel node biopsy shows positive for cancer cells postchemotherapy sessions to shrink the tumor cells.
How to prepare for axillary dissection?,'The physician recommends a full range of shoulder exercises before the surgery. You need to avoid heavy lifting with the arm affected by cancer to prevent the risk of swelling in one of your arms or legs.' 
How is axillary dissection performed?,"'The axillary dissection is performed simultaneously during a mastectomy surgery and is usually carried out under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes an incision under the arm and removes 10-40 lymph nodes from level I and II. The surgeon usually doesn’t remove level III axial lymph nodes because it affects the survival rate of the patient. However, the formation of lumps or bigger nodes may force the surgeon to remove the level III lymph nodes. Finally, the surgeon places a small tube and closes the incision with ''stitches'' or staples. A drainage bag attached to the end of the tube helps in the collection of fluid and ''prevention'' of fluid buildup.''Following the surgery, the patients may be given:' Antibiotics to prevent infection Pain relievers Information about shoulder range exercises Instructions about the caring and dressing of the wound Instructions about the type and range of activities to be performed Information about complications and side effects of the surgery, which includes: Signs of infection, such as pain, redness, or pus Discomfort and soreness around the wound site Hematoma (pooling of blood) Swelling and bruising over the breast or axilla Seroma (fluid accumulation under the skin in the armpit) Shoulder stiffness Lymphedema (swelling of one of the arms or legs) Numb patch on the upper arm"
What exactly is an ileostomy stoma?,"'An ileostomy stoma is an artificial opening over your abdomen that the surgeon creates during an ileostomy. It allows the ''stool'' and gases to pass out of the body bypassing the lower part of your gut. The stoma protrudes an inch or so above the skin of the abdomen. A normal stoma looks red, swollen, and moist. It may become smaller over the 6-8 weeks after surgery.\xa0The stromal surface is painless and may bleed a little during cleaning.''A stoma is attached to an ileostomy pouch with the help of a clamp. It needs manual emptying daily. It fills when the gut generates waste or stools.' "
How do I empty my ileostomy pouch?,"'This procedure is done in the privacy of the washroom. Wash your hands and put on gloves. You may have someone to help you if you need. Place a toilet paper into the commode before emptying the pouch. This will reduce the splashing of the pouch contents. Now, remove the clamp that holds the pouch to the seal. Hold the pouch by the bottom end and drain it into the toilet pan by squeezing the contents. You may rinse the pouch once done.\xa0Replace the clamp and fix it back.''Bad smell and ''gas'' are common worries for any individual with an ostomy. However, most ostomy pouches are odor proof. It will only smell when the pouch is being emptied.' "
What changes do I have to make in my lifestyle after an ileostomy?,"'It is normal to be anxious before and after an ileostomy procedure. With an honest discussion with your doctor and a bit of modification in your ''diet'', you can lead a wholesome personal and professional life. An experienced ostomy nurse can provide proper advice regarding the size of the pouch and its care.' Dietary changes: The most important change is increasing the daily water intake by 500-750 mL. You may need to drink more during periods of diarrhea or heavy sweating. Preferred fluids include water, broth, and vegetable juices. Oral rehydration solutions may be acceptable as well. Learn to spot the signs of poor hydration and increase water intake appropriately. Solids: You must completely avoid gas-producing foods like beans, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and asparagus. Discuss better eating options with your doctor. Over the counter gas reducing medicines like Beano and Gas-X may help to reduce flatulence. You may practice the ‘Muffling’ measures by exerting light pressure against the stoma with your hand. The pouching systems with filters that deodorize flatus can also help to deal with gases and odor. Physical activity: Most activities like bathing and changing can be performed with the temporary removal of the ostomy pouch. There is no restriction on walking, jogging, and driving. Weightlifting for work-related or recreational reasons must be discontinued or reduced because it may put pressure on the pouch, causing leaks. Extreme contact sports are not allowed. Swimming may be done using the waterproof seals on the pouch. Sexual activity: The ostomy does not affect organic sexual function. If you feel conscious about the stoma, you and your partner can undergo counseling to re-establish intimacy. You should empty the pouch before engaging in sexual activity. Lingerie or a cummerbund to conceal and secure the pouches are available in the market. Travel: Always carry extra ostomy supplies and place them in the carry-on luggage. Ensure the pouches are not exposed to extremes of temperature. Drink only boiled or bottled water when you travel."
What is a factitious disorder?,"'Factitious disorder is a psychological condition in which a person acts as if he or she has a physical or mental illness. In this condition, the person makes up symptoms or exaggerates the symptoms deliberately. They may even tamper with medical tests to convince others that treatment is needed. A factitious disorder comes under mental illnesses because they are mostly associated with severe emotional difficulties.

What are the causes of the factitious disorder?,"'The exact cause of the factitious disorder is unknown; however, researchers believe that certain biological and psychological factors may play an important role in the development of this disorder. Factors associated with the development of factitious disorder include:''History of ''child abuse'' or neglect' History of illnesses that requires the individual to frequently visit hospitals Trauma Family dysfunction Social isolation Early chronic medical illness Depression Low self-esteem Work in the healthcare field Loss of a loved one through death"
How is factitious disorder treated?,'The initial goal of treatment is to alter the person’s behavior and reduce their access to medical resources. Proper medical and psychiatric treatments are essential for preventing serious injury and even death.''Treatment options for factitious disorders include:' Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) Cognitive-behavioral therapy (changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder) Family therapy (a therapy that helps in teaching family members not to reward or reinforce the behavior of the person) Medications may be used to treat accompanying anxiety or depression
What is a mid-forehead brow lift?,"'A mid-forehead brow lift, commonly known as a brow lift, is a procedure that involves surgical correction of eyebrow sagging. It also helps:''Eyebrows and eyelids droop for various reasons:''Complaints frequently noticed in people with eyebrow sagging are:' Eliminate the wrinkle lines that appear between the eyebrows.

How is brow lift surgery done?,"'Patients should consider the following before undergoing surgery:''The anesthesiologist administers general anesthesia.''The cosmetic surgeon' Discuss with the physician their goals and expectations. Undergo medical and lab tests. Refrain from cigarette smoking. Stop certain medications such as Vitamin E, aspirin, and other anti-inflammatory medications a week before the surgery to prevent bruising or bleeding during surgery. Remove all makeup and jewelry before surgery. Makes an incision in the forehead. Retracts the skin to access the muscle. Weakens the muscles to eliminate the crease or wrinkles. May remove the muscle completely. Closes the incision with sutures. Dresses the forehead, which may be removed and reapplied if necessary. Initial wound healing takes 10 to 14 days. Patients can return to work after 10 to 14 days. Patients need to keep their head elevated and restrict physical activity. Patients should not apply ice or heat compress to the operated area."
What should I expect after a brow lift surgery?,"'With advanced technology, the success rate has improved with minimal scarring. Complications such as facial nerve injury, blood loss, ''itching'', scarring, and the inability to close the eyes completely (lagophthalmos) may occur. Most of the patients are satisfied with the immediate outcome. The incision and swelling will fade over time.' "
Why do you need a mouthguard?,"'Mouthguards help protect teeth, other structures of the oral ''cavity'', ''braces'', and ''dental implants'' from damage.''Mouthguards may be recommended for the following:''Wearing a mouthguard reduces the risk of the following:' Bruxism (grinding of teeth) Playing sports, especially contact sports like wrestling, basketball, hockey, football, or soccer, where there is an increased risk of injury to the face. Noncontact sports or activities, such as cycling, gymnastics, rollerblading or ice skating, and other activities, with high risks of falls, can also benefit from mouthguards. Chipping of teeth Losing teeth Nerve damage to the tooth Damage to other structures of the oral cavity, such as gums, tongue, and inside of the cheeks"
What are the types of mouthguards?,"'Different types of mouthguards are used for different purposes. They look different from each other and are made from different materials.''There are two main categories of mouthguards: Mouthguards designed to protect the teeth and the rest of the oral cavity from any injury due to sports or activities and mouthguards designed for patients with ''teeth grinding''. The types of mouthguards include:' Custom-fitted mouthguards: The dentist uses a mold to take an impression of the teeth to make a custom-fit mouthguard that comfortably fits in the person’s mouth. They are more expensive than other types of mouthguards, but they provide the best comfort and protection. They may be used for protection from injuries or can be used at night for those who have teeth grinding. Boil and bite: They are mouthguards made of a thermoplastic material that can be shaped by the person at home to fit their teeth. The mouthguard is softened by placing it in hot, but not boiling water. The softened mouthguard can then be placed in the mouth. The mouthguard is then pressed onto the teeth with the fingers, when the position feels right, the person has to bite down for about 20 seconds. The mouthguard is then removed and is kept under running cold water to set the shape. This process can be repeated multiple times with the device to reshape it to achieve the best fit. Adjustable over the counter mouthguards: There are several over the counter adjustable mouth guards to be worn at night, such as sliding pieces to fit the mouth. One size fits all mouthguards: There are ready to wear mouthguards available over the counter. They are cheaper than other types of mouthguards, but they rarely fit well and are produced in bulk. They provide the least protection compared to other types of mouthguards."
How long do mouthguards last?,"'The longevity of mouthguards depends on how frequently the mouthguard is used and the material. Custom-fitted mouthguards usually last the longest; they last for several years with proper care. The dental professional would be able to provide advice on how to take care of implants, making them last longer. Regular follow-up with the dentist is advised in the case of custom-fitted mouthguards. Over the counter, mouthguards are not very durable and may need to be replaced every few months. Children and young adults may have to get their mouthguards replaced more often as their teeth and mouth grow.' "
What is a neck lift surgery?,"'A neck lift surgery or lower rhytidectomy is a cosmetic procedure to provide a more defined and youthful appearance to the neck by removing excess skin and fat around the jawline. It is often done as a part of ''facelift'' or rhytidectomy surgery. Some people, however, do not prefer a full facelift as they feel that the upper face doesn’t need a correction. In such cases, a neck lift may be done to correct excess wrinkling on the neck skin, a double chin, or jowl lines.''A neck lift may be done with other rejuvenation procedures, such as a brow lift for correcting a sagging or furrowed brow, fat transfer for adding fullness to the cheeks and lips, correcting ''wrinkles'', or ''eyelid'' surgeries for rejuvenating signs of ''aging'' around the eyes.''A neck lift surgery can be done for:''A neck lift may last for years, usually 10 to 15 years. It, however, does not stop the ''aging'' process and rejuvenating procedures may be required again.'

What is double eyelid surgery?,"'Double ''eyelid surgery'' (Asian ''blepharoplasty'') is a ''cosmetic surgery'' for the eyes in which a crease or fold is made in the upper ''eyelid''.\xa0''Asian people who lack a crease in their upper eyelids may seek this surgery because they believe it improves their appearance.\xa0 Some believe their eyes look puffy and tired and thus seek this surgery to get “brighter” eyes.\xa0''The reason many of Asian descent lack an eyelid fold is a genetic difference in the attachment of upper eyelid skin to the muscle that pulls the eyelid up.''Double eyelid surgery in the U.S. costs a little over $3,000, according to the latest averages, not including hospital expenses.' "
Who seeks double eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty)?, Patients seeking cosmetic changes: People with puffy upper eyelids and an absent crease may not like their appearance. They may report problems applying eyeliner. Reducing vision problems: Double eyelid surgery can be done for medical reasons (as opposed to cosmetic) to remove an extra fold of skin causing problems in vision. Part of another cosmetic procedure: As a part of surgery for drooping eyelids (ptosis).
What happens during the surgery?, Your doctor will take relevant measurements and make markings on your eyes. The anesthesiologist administers anesthesia. They will then make surgical cuts on the upper eyelid. Excess fat will be removed. Stitches attach the eyelid skin at an appropriate level on the muscle to create a crease. The skin is closed and dressed.
What are the possible complications of double eyelid surgery?, Asymmetry or unequal appearance of the eyelids Loss of crease Drooping eyelids Scarring Swelling Bleeding Pain Vision problems Dry eyes Infection 
How common is blepharoplasty?,"'Around 50% of people of Pacific Asian descent (Korean, Japanese, Chinese) do not have an upper eyelid crease. Blepharoplasty has been the most common cosmetic surgical procedure of the face among this population. It is performed more often in women than in men.' "
How much does double eyelid surgery cost? ,"'Cosmetic eyelid surgery, on\xa0average, costs $3,163, according to the 2018 data of the American Society of ''Plastic'' Surgeons.\xa0''However, this cost does not include anesthesia, operating room facilities or other related expenses. The fee varies depending on the type of procedure, the geographic location of the hospital and the experience of your operating surgeon. Thus, it is wise to consult with your ''plastic surgeon'""'s office to ascertain your final fee. You should also ask about any available patient financing plans from the doctor’s office.""'The eyelid surgery costs mainly include:' Surgeon's fee Hospital or surgical facility costs Anesthesia fees Medications cost Medical tests"
Will insurance pay for eyelid surgery?,"'Coverage for cosmetic surgeries and their complications is not usually offered by most health insurance. Nonetheless, when eyelid surgery is done to remove the extra skin covering the eyelashes, it may be covered by insurance.' "
Fallopian tube surgery,"'As per research, the cost of fallopian tube surgeries may start from a minimum of $3000 and may go up to $13,000 approximately. The cost of the surgeries depends on the type of surgery, complications, location of the hospitals, clinics, doctors, and insurance. If the procedure is covered under insurance, a patient may not need to pay. In a few situations, both patients and insurance may need to pay the cost (copay). In cases where the procedure is not included in the insurance list, the patient may be responsible for the total cost. Various surgeries of fallopian tubes cost differently.\xa0''Fallopian tubes are an important part of the ''female reproductive system''. The fallopian tubes connect ovaries to the womb where a baby grows. After an egg is released from the ovary, it travels down the fallopian tube to get to the womb. Ovaries usually release an egg every month, and sperm may fertilize it while it’s traveling through fallopian tubes. But if fallopian tubes are blocked, ''fertilization'' may not happen because the sperm and egg can’t meet. Below are a few common procedures of fallopian tubes.' Fallopian tube recanalization: This procedure may cost approximately $3000-$5000. The procedure opens up fallopian tubes if they’re blocked. In this procedure, the patient may not need any cuts or incisions. The doctor usually uses a speculum, to keep the vagina open, and then inserts a small plastic tube or catheter into the womb. A contrast liquid is sent through the catheter, and an X-ray of your womb and fallopian tubes is taken to confirm the blockage. Once the blockage is confirmed, doctors may insert a second, smaller catheter to clear the blockage.  Tubal ligation surgery: This procedure may cost approximately $4000-$100,000. Tubal ligation may be totally free (or low cost) with some health insurance plans, Medicaid, and other government programs. It is a surgical procedure to prevent pregnancy. It has commonly been called female sterilization. During this surgery, both fallopian tubes are blocked or cut. It is usually done in the hospital or in an outpatient surgical clinic. In most cases, you will be able to go home on the day of surgery. After recovery, the patient will still have periods and may have sex normally. Tubal ligation is permanent birth control. Although it may be reversed by another operation, only about 50-80% of women are able to become pregnant after having their fallopian tubes reattached. Tubal ligation reversal surgery: This procedure is rare, and most of the insurance companies usually do not include them in their list. The cost may vary from $7000-$11,000 approximately. In this procedure, the doctor may make small cuts in the abdomen and remove any blocked parts of fallopian tubes and unite the tubes back with absorbable stitches. Even after the surgery, there’s no guarantee of pregnancy. Chances may range anywhere from 40 to 80%, depending on age and other health factors. Salpingostomy: This procedure may be usually done laparoscopically and may cost around $5000-$7000 approximately. This procedure is usually done when a fallopian tube is filled with fluid. During the surgery, the doctor will open the fallopian tube and remove the blockage, and does not disturb the position of the fallopian tube.  Salpingectomy: This is usually considered major surgery and may cost approximately $11,000. In this procedure, the doctor may remove both the fallopian tubes completely depending on the risk factors. There are a few ways the doctor can perform laparoscopic salpingectomy. One way is to use a pre-tied surgical loop and tighten the knot around the fallopian tube to remove it. Another way is to destroy the blood vessels in the fallopian tube. Fimbrioplasty: This procedure may cost around $3000-$4000. This procedure is usually done if the part of the fallopian tube is blocked close to the ovary. "
What is forehead reconstruction?,"'The forehead encompasses one-third of the face and can be subjected to ''trauma''.''The forehead can be divided into several subunits:''Forehead reconstruction is mainly done for the following conditions:''However, medically unfit patients should not undergo this treatment.

What is skin resurfacing?,"'Laser resurfacing'' is a procedure that removes layers of the skin and improves its appearance or treats minor facial flaws such as blemishes or ''acne'' scars by using lasers.''There are various types of lasers used in these procedures such as:' Carbon dioxide (CO2): This type of laser is used to treat wrinkles, scars, and warts on your skin. Erbium: It is used to remove superficial or moderately deep lines and wrinkles on your face, hands, neck, and chest. It has fewer side effects than CO2 lasers. Pulsed-dye laser: These are non-ablative lasers that heat the skin and absorb pigments to reduce redness, hyperpigmentation, broken capillaries, and enlargement of facial blood vessels, giving rosacea (flushed appearance). Fractional laser: It treats only the fraction of the skin in the area by breaking laser energy into thousands of tiny beams. It can be used in ablative or non-ablative procedures. It can be used to treat age-related blemishes. Intense pulsed light (IPL): This treatment does not use a laser but uses a broad spectrum of light wavelength to treat pigmentations of the skin."

What is upper eyelid blepharoplasty?,"'Blepharoplasty'' is ''cosmetic surgery'' of the ''eyelid'' in which excessive eyelid skin is removed with or without the removal or addition of eyelid fat.\xa0''The term blepharoplasty was coined by the German ophthalmologist, von Graefe in 1818 to describe eyelid repair surgery. The word ‘blepharoplasty’ is derived from the Greek blepharon, meaning ‘eyelid’, and plastos, meaning ‘formed’.''It is commonly referred to as eyelid lift. However, the term is a misnomer as the eyelid is not actually ‘lifted’ during the procedure. Blepharoplasty is one of the most common cosmetic surgical procedures of the face. It is performed more often in women than in men, most commonly in their fifties.\xa0''Blepharoplasty typically costs a little over $3,000 for the surgery alone, not counting anesthesia and related hospital expenses, according to the latest data.'

How long does a patient have discomfort after dental implants?,"'On average, a patient may feel discomfort in the treated area,\xa0 face, and jaw\xa0for at least ten days. Patients may expect some swelling but the dentist may give antibiotics and\xa0painkillers\xa0to treat pain and swelling. Swelling and pain start to decrease from the third day after the procedure.\xa0''Within 14 days, the patient may have no pain and the implant may finally be healing nicely. If the pain and swelling are still present on the 14th day, a patient may need to visit a dentist immediately as it may be a sign of infection.\xa0' "
What are the different types of dental implants?,"'Titanium, the metal used to make implants, is proved to be highly compatible with the ''human body''. Below are two main types of implants:''The three phases of a ''dental implant'' include:' Endosteal: These dental implants are placed in the jawbone. Typically made of titanium and shaped like small screws, they are the most commonly used type of implant. Subperiosteal: These dental implants are placed under the gum but on, or above, the jawbone. This type of implant may be used in patients who do not have enough healthy natural jawbones and cannot, or do not want to, undergo a bone augmentation procedure to rebuild it.” Placing the implant: The patient may undergo surgery to have the implant placed in the jaw, where it is covered over with gum tissue and allowed to integrate into the jawbone for three to six months. Attaching the post: The dentist attaches a post (abutment) to the implant and the gum tissue grows up around it. In some cases, the implant and post are placed simultaneously. Whether or not they are placed at the same time, the combination implant and post serves as an anchor for the replacement tooth. Crown attachment: The dentist attaches a customized crown (that looks like a tooth) to the implant post."
What are the advantages of dental implants?  ,"'The advantages of dental implants include:' They help prevent jaw bone degradation that comes with tooth loss.  They are a great way to improve the smile and overall dental health.  Dental implants provide a more natural tooth replacement than dentures because they’re artificial teeth that are attached directly to the jawbone.  They give patients a set of teeth that look real and natural which is strong as well, allowing patients to enjoy favorite foods without any annoyances. Dental implants last a lifetime with proper hygiene Dental implants rarely fail and have an average success rate of 95 to 98 percent."
How to reduce pain and discomfort after dental implants?  ,"'Below are a few common ways to reduce discomfort and maximize the healing process after dental implant:' Strictly follow post-operation instructions recommended by the dentist after the procedure. Instructions may include taking pain medications like Advil or Tylenol as directed and also taking prophylactic antibiotics if prescribed Regularly rinsing gently with a warm saltwater solution may kill germs and promote healing Avoiding hot, spicy, or crunchy foods for the first 10 days may avoid infection Maintaining good oral hygiene is always recommended  Brushing gently near the implant sites may avoid any infection due to injury Using cold compresses as directed will help in controlling the pain Keep appointments with the dentist as directed."
What are the causes of a humerus fracture?,"'The humerus is the upper arm bone that runs between the\xa0elbow and shoulder. Humerus fractures account for a remarkably small proportion of total bone fractures. The causes may include:''An accident or a severe injury is the main cause of humerus fractures. Most injuries result from a direct impact to the body, such as during a fall or motor vehicle crash. Older adults may experience humerus fractures from relatively minor falls due to less bone strength and bone degradation.''Different types of humerus fractures include:''Doctors may diagnose a fractured humerus by' A direct blow or bending force applied to the middle of the humerus Falling onto an outstretched arm Violent muscle contraction in sports such as weightlifting Proximal humerus fractures occur near the shoulder. Mid-shaft fractures are located in the middle of the bone. Distal humerus fractures are located near the elbow joint and are more common in children than they are in adults. Examining the arm and pulses. Taking an X-ray of the affected arm. More sophisticated imagery (in rare cases), such as a computed tomography scan is used to provide a more detailed view."
How is a humerus fracture treated?,"'The humerus is the long bone in your upper arm. When broken, it needs specialized care so that you can cope with the problems it brings. It will take a minimum of 12 weeks to heal. Patients may be on pain relief medications for a longer duration. The plaster that is applied for this injury is heavy; this is to help the fracture stay in the correct position, and patients must adapt their lifestyle to get used to this. Treatment options include:''The recovery process is different for everyone, depending on the severity of the injury and treatment you receive. Most fractures heal in about six weeks, but severe injuries may take longer to heal. Taking calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements'' and increasing protein intake in the ''diet'' can help in hastening the healing process.' If the fractured bones are still in their proper position, a sling or plaster cast can be used. The cast supports and keeps the arm from moving while it heals. This usually takes three months. Most mid-shaft humerus fractures, which have well-aligned bone parts, can heal with immobilization and usually do not require surgery. Doctors may recommend physical therapy depending on bone healing. Therapists will help you move the shoulder joint at first with a passive range of motion exercises. These exercises help improve circulation and reduce stiffness. Patients may then proceed to more advanced exercises to increase strength and motion. If the fractured bones have moved out of position, surgery is recommended. Surgery called an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is used to realign the bones and secure them in position with surgical hardware, such as plates, pins, screws, and wires. Surgery is most frequently used for proximal and distal humerus fractures. For severe proximal humerus fractures, a shoulder replacement surgery is used to remove the damaged bone and insert an artificial implant. Severe proximal humerus fractures may also require reattachment of the shoulder muscles (rotator cuff muscles). Rehabilitation therapy begins as soon as possible."
What is a colonoscopy?,"'The ''digestive system'' processes and eliminates waste after ''digestion''. The colon and rectum are the final portions of the digestive system and are also referred to as the large bowel or ''large intestine''. A ''colonoscopy'' is a diagnostic procedure to evaluate the health of the colon and rectum.\xa0''A colonoscopy is done with a ''colonoscope'', a long, flexible tube with a lighted camera at the end of it. The doctor performing the colonoscopy will be able to view the condition of the colon and be able to take samples for biopsy or remove polyps with the colonoscope.' "
Alternative methods to standard colonoscopy, Virtual colonoscopy: the colon is filled with air through a rectal tube and high-resolution images are taken with a CT scan. Colon capsule endoscopy: The patient swallows a pill-sized capsule with a camera inside that transmits images. High-definition colonoscopy: This method comes with improved detection of small polyps.
Drawbacks of virtual colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy,"'It is not possible to' remove polyps, extract tissue for biopsy, and treat bleeding sites."
Why is a colonoscopy performed?,'A colonoscopy is performed for the following reasons:''To detect the cause for:' To screen for colorectal cancer (Colonoscopy is immensely useful in early diagnosis of colorectal cancer.) blood in stool abdominal pain diarrhea or constipation changes in bowel habits unexplained weight loss To detect and remove polyps To extract tissue for biopsy if abnormality is found in other tests To identify and treat bleeding sites To decompress any twist in the colon
When is a colonoscopy performed?,"'A typical healthy adult should have a colonoscopy at age 50 and continue to have it once every 10 years, more frequently if initially abnormal. People at high risk for ''cancer'' should have colonoscopy at an earlier age and more often.''More frequent colonoscopies are also recommended in individuals who:' have had resection for colon cancer have a genetic condition with cancer risk have polyposis, an inherited condition with increased risk for polyps have inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease have close relatives with colon cancer"
How do you prepare for a colonoscopy?,"'The colon has to be completely cleared before a colonoscopy so the doctor is able to view it without any obstruction. The patient must follow a few steps:' Go on a clear liquid diet one to three days prior, according to the doctor’s advice. Avoid red and purple foods like beets, which might lead to misdiagnosis. Take an oral laxative mixed in a clear drink the night before and the morning of the procedure. Drink large amounts of water to stay hydrated. Some may have to use an enema kit to clear the colon. Check with the doctor before taking any medications. Stop taking blood thinners. Inform the doctor if pregnant. Inform the doctor of pre-existing conditions, diseases or allergies. Inform the doctor if there are any implants."
How is a colonoscopy performed?,"'Colonoscopy is an outpatient procedure generally performed by a ''gastroenterologist''. The patient receives light sedation and some ''pain'' medication. The procedure lasts for thirty to sixty minutes. Some patients might require anesthesia.\xa0''It is unsafe to drive or operate machinery for 8 hours post-procedure, depending on anesthesia.' The patient lies on their side with knees drawn to their chest so the doctor can get a better angle to the colon. The doctor will insert the colonoscope through the anus and guide it gently and slowly through the entire colon. The colonoscope is slowly retracted while monitoring for abnormalities. The doctor may inflate the colon with air to get a better view. The doctor will remove polyps if found, extract tissue for a biopsy, and stop any bleeding. The doctor will then gently withdraw the tube. The patient should be able to leave in an hour and resume normal activities within a day. The results of the colonoscopy help the doctor decide on the future course of treatment."
How painful is a colonoscopy?,"'Most people feel nothing more than slight discomfort during the procedure because mild sedation and ''pain'' medication are part of the procedure. Some people do not feel much pain even without sedation, but some may experience ''cramps'' and pain.' "
What are the side effects and risks of a colonoscopy?,'Colonoscopy is a routine and fairly safe procedure with few side effects and rare complications.''Possible risks and complications:' Possible side effects: Gas and bloating Abdominal cramps Light bleeding Anesthetic side effects Perforation of the colon Persistent rectal bleeding Infection and fever Abdominal distension Abdominal pain Rupture of the spleen Small-bowel obstruction in patients with adhesions Allergic reaction to medication

What is a lumbar puncture?,"'A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure performed in the lumbar region of the spine to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds the spinal cord and brain. The doctor inserts a needle in the space between two ''lumbar vertebrae'' to enter the spinal canal. A lumbar puncture is also called a ''spinal tap'', ''spinal puncture'', thecal puncture, or rachiocentesis.' "
Why is a lumbar puncture done?,"'The cerebrospinal fluid acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord, protecting them from injury. An analysis of CSF is done for diagnosing life-threating conditions such as:''A lumbar puncture may be done for the following reasons:' cancers and tumors of the brain or spinal cord bleeding around the brain inflammatory diseases such as meningitis, encephalitis and syphilis autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis increased fluid pressure from hydrocephalus to collect cerebrospinal fluid for diagnostic purposes to measure the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid to administer anesthesia before a surgery to administer medications for certain conditions to inject dye for imaging and scanning"
How is a lumbar puncture performed?,"'A lumbar puncture is usually performed as an outpatient procedure. Patients lie on their side in a curled or fetal position for a lumbar puncture. This extends the space between the lumbar vertebrae, making the target larger and procedure easier. An LP might also be done while sitting in a bent over position.''The doctor first cleans the area and injects a local anesthetic in the spot chosen for the LP. The LP is most commonly done between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. After the local anesthetic takes effect, they insert a long thin needle, which enters the spinal canal. They can then use the needle with a manometer to measure the spinal fluid pressure, or a syringe to withdraw fluid sample, or inject medication or dye.''It is important for the patient to remain still during the procedure, though the doctor might recommend a slight change of position. After the procedure, the puncture site is covered with a dressing or bandage. Immediately after the procedure, the patient will lie flat and stay still for about an hour or more.' "
How long is the recovery after a lumbar puncture?,"'A lumbar puncture usually takes 30 to 45 minutes. After about one or two hours of monitoring, patients are able to leave the facility, depending on underlying illness. There may be tenderness in the lower back and swelling at the needle site.''About 25 percent of the patients get a ''headache'' after an LP, which might last up to a week. Lying flat and taking painkillers help ease the ''headache''. During recovery, you should:' lie down flat and rest as much as possible, move carefully when you have to, drink plenty of fluids, take painkillers as needed, avoid driving and strenuous activities."
What are the complications and risks of a lumbar puncture?,"'Rarely, other complications besides a ''headache'' might occur. This may depend on the age, health, or underlying medical condition of the individual. Some of the risks involved in a lumbar puncture are:''It is advisable to return to the doctor if any of the following are experienced after a lumbar puncture:' persistent cerebrospinal fluid leak bleeding from the LP site infection at the LP site irritation of nerves or nerve roots brain herniation severe persistent headache that isn’t relieved by a pain reliever fever and chills nausea high blood pressure any other abnormal reaction"
What are the different types of a prostate biopsy procedure?,"'The surgeon can choose any of the three different ways of performing a prostate biopsy. These are as follows:''An ''ultrasound'' or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') is usually used to guide the procedure.' Transrectal method: This is the most common method of performing a prostate biopsy. In this, the surgical instruments are inserted through the rectum (the lowest part of the large bowel). Perineal method: This is done through the area lying between the scrotum and rectum. Transurethral method: A cystoscope (long tube-like camera) is inserted through the urethra (the tube-like structure through which the urine flows from the bladder)."
Why do you need a prostate biopsy?,"'A prostate biopsy is done to confirm or rule out ''prostate cancer''.''The doctor may recommend a prostate biopsy for you if''Sometimes, your doctor may order a repeat biopsy if your previous biopsy shows abnormal prostate cells that were not cancerous or the results of the biopsy were not clear.' Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test shows high blood levels of PSA. Your digital rectal exam (DRE) reveals some growths or abnormalities near the prostate."
How do you prepare for a prostate biopsy?,"'Your doctor will get you tested for ''urinary tract infections'' (''UTI''). If ''UTI'' is detected, the biopsy will be postponed till the infection clears with antibiotics.''You need to stop taking blood-thinning medications such as ''aspirin'' and ''warfarin'' and any other medications as advised by your doctor several days before the surgery.''Your doctor or nurse may instruct you to take an enema before the procedure.

Light bleeding from your rectum. Blood in your urine. Blood in your semen. Develop a fever. Feel pain while passing urine. Experience heavy bleeding through the rectum/urethra."
Is there an alternative to a prostate biopsy?,"'Your doctor only advises you to undergo a prostate biopsy if he feels that all other tests point toward the possibility of ''prostate cancer''. Therefore, if you want to confirm that you have prostate ''cancer'', there is no alternative to a prostate biopsy. To initiate ''cancer'' therapy, it is necessary to confirm prostate ''cancer'' through the biopsy. Surely, there are other screening tests for prostate cancer such as the digital rectal exam (DRE), free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). Discuss with your doctor if you can opt to go for only these tests or any other tests instead of the biopsy procedure.' "
What is bone marrow?,"'Bone marrow is the spongy tissue present within the larger bones such as the hip bone, sternum, ribs, and thighbone.''The bone marrow contains ''stem cells'' also called hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that develop into blood cells:' White blood cells (WBCs): These fight against infection. Red blood cells (RBCs): These carry oxygen and nutrients. Platelets: These are responsible for blood clotting."
What are stem cells?,"'Stem cells ''are specialized cells in the ''human body'' that develop into different types of cells that could be of the skin, muscles, or even brain tissues.''Stem cells can be used in the treatment of various medical conditions to replace damaged tissues (stem cell therapy or stem cell transplant). They arise from various sources based on which they are classified into the following:' Adult stem cells: These are found in few parts of the body such as the bone marrow. They only develop into certain types of cells. Embryonic stem cells: These arise from four- to five-day embryos. They can develop into any tissue.  Induced pluripotent stem cells: These are adult stem cells induced conditions in the laboratory to develop into any tissue. Perinatal stem cells: These are stem cells from the cord blood and amniotic fluid."
What is a bone marrow transplant?,"'A ''bone marrow transplant'' is a medical procedure performed when the bone marrow has been damaged or destroyed due to various conditions. This procedure involves replacing damaged stem cells by transplanting healthy stem cells that promote the growth of new marrow and healthy blood cells, thus helping the levels of white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets to increase to normal levels.''Bone marrow transplants are of two types:' Autologous bone marrow transplant: This uses healthy stem cells from the patient’s own body to replace the damaged tissue.  Allogenic bone marrow transplant: This uses healthy stem cells from a matching donor. There is a risk of stem cell (graft) failure."
Why is a bone marrow transplant done?,"'A bone marrow transplant may be done to treat ''malignant'' (''cancer'') and nonmalignant diseases. The healthy stem cells replace the diseased cells of the marrow, thus curing the condition.''Some malignant diseases treated using a bone marrow transplant are as follows:''Some nonmalignant diseases treated using a bone marrow transplant are as follows:' Chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (cancer arising from the myeloid cells in the bone marrow that form blood cells) Acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia (cancer arising from the lymphocyte cells, a type of white blood cells [WBC] present in the bone marrow) Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) Hairy cell leukemia (cancer of the B-cells, a type of WBC) Multiple myeloma (cancer of the plasma cells or B-cells, a type of WBC) Some solid tumors (testicular and pediatric tumors) Inherited blood disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia and thalassemia) Damage due to chemotherapy or radiation Hereditary storage diseases (genetic defects) Osteopetrosis (a bone disease) Selected autoimmune diseases (body has allergy to its own proteins)"
What is the procedure for a bone marrow donor?,"'A suitable donor is selected based on the donor’s health status and whether matching criteria to the recipient is similar to that of blood donation.\xa0''Before the procedure:''The doctor obtains a detailed medical history, performs a physical assessment and advises complete blood and radiological analysis. Consent for the procedure is also taken.''During the procedure:''The bone marrow is taken from the donor under anesthesia (general or local). During the procedure, the patient does not have much ''pain''. A small incision is made, through which a wide bore needle is inserted into the bone marrow and stem cells are collected in syringes. The donor may experience ''pain'' after the anesthesia wears off. Painkillers may be needed for next few days.''For the recipient, the procedure is relatively painless because the stem cells are injected through a vein.''The'' most common site to obtain stem cells'' is the iliac spine, a projection on the large broad bone forming the upper part of each half of the pelvis/hip (ilium). It is easily accessible and associated with lesser complications. The sternum may be used in some cases.''After the procedure:''Wound'' dressing would remain for 24-48 hours. Normal activities can be resumed in a day or two. Patients may experience pain, swelling, and ''bruising'' that usually resolve in a week. Painkillers and antibiotics may be prescribed.''Donor complications:\xa0''Infection, bleeding, damage to the surrounding nerves and blood vessels, and bone ''fracture''.''Transplant of the stem cells to the patient:''The stem cells are injected into the patient’s blood through the vein, after which they enter the bone marrow.' "
What is the procedure for colposcopy?,"'Colposcopy'' is a simple procedure that takes less than 10 minutes. It is done in an outpatient setting by your doctor.''Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''You will be made to undress and lie down on the table, and your legs will be separated. The doctor will examine your private parts for any ''warts'', ulcers, or masses over the vulva. They will ask you to take deep breaths as they insert a lubricated sterile device called a speculum inside the vagina. The insides and corners of the vagina are checked for any abnormal growths. The doctor will adjust the speculum. Next, they will use a colposcope to take a look at your cervix. A colposcope is an instrument that looks like binoculars on a stand. It has a light at one end. The colposcope does not go inside you. The doctor will look at the cervix with the colposcope. Then they will paint the cervix with a vinegar-like solution using a cotton swab. After 30-60 seconds, the solution highlights any abnormal areas over the cervix that may be cancerous. Sometimes, the doctor may also apply Lugol’s\xa0''iodine'' or\xa0Schiller’s\xa0solution to the cervix. The cancerous areas are not stained by iodine.''If nothing abnormal is seen, the procedure will be terminated. If the doctor finds any abnormal areas, they will take a piece of tissue (biopsy) from that area with special instruments and send it for lab examination under a microscope.' You must abstain from sexual intercourse, vaginal douching, and inserting tampons 48 hours prior to the procedure. Tell your doctor if you are on blood thinners, have any bleeding disorder, or are pregnant."
Who should not undergo colposcopy?,"'Although the procedure is largely safe, some people may have a few complications during the procedure. Individuals who may not be suitable for the tests include those with the following conditions:' Cervicitis: Any active infection can cause the cells to swell and give false-positive results. They can also make the procedure more painful and increase the risk of spreading the infection deeper. Hence, these must be treated completely before the procedure is undertaken. Bleeding disorders or patients on blood thinners: You must always tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners. They may increase the risk of bleeding after the procedure and must be discontinued on the day of the procedure with the advice of your doctor. You must also tell your doctor if you have any bleeding disorder. Pregnancy: A cervix in a pregnant woman tends to bleed heavily on the slightest injury. Additionally, pregnancy changes the cell structure of the cervix making the identification of abnormal cells difficult. Hence, colposcopy must be avoided in pregnancy. Immunosuppression: Patients who have severely compromised immunity and very low white blood levels count are at risk of serious infections during this procedure. This includes patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), post-transplant patients, and those on chemotherapy. Colposcopy should be avoided in these patients in most circumstances."
What is an IUD?,"'An ''intrauterine device'' (''IUD'') is a small T-shaped ''birth control'' device, about the size of a quarter, that is placed inside a woman’s uterus to prevent ''pregnancy''. It is a reversible ''contraceptive'', meaning it can be removed if pregnancy is desired.''IUDs are one of the most popular contraceptive options for women. They prevent pregnancy by preventing the sperm cells from reaching and fertilizing the woman’s eggs. Modern-day IUDs are one of the safest and most effective ''birth control methods''. You can get an IUD put in any time during your ''menstrual cycle''.' "
How does an IUD prevent pregnancy?,'There are two types of IUDs:''They work by either of the following two ways:' Copper IUDs Hormonal IUDs They release a hormone (progesterone) or copper which creates changes in the sticky fluid in the cervix (cervical mucus) as well as changes of the lining of the uterus. These changes kill sperms or make them immobile and make implantation into the uterus less likely if fertilization occurs.
Is it painful to have an IUD put in?,"'Getting an IUD is generally not excessively painful. Before inserting the IUD, your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your medical history. This will be followed by an examination of your vagina, cervix and uterus. You may be tested for any ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'').''The entire procedure takes around five minutes. First, a device called a speculum is inserted in the vagina followed by placing the IUD into the uterus with the help of a narrow inserter.''Pain'' is usually felt when the speculum is inserted and the IUD is being placed inside the uterus. Some women report a sharp cramping ''pain'' which lasts no more than a minute or two. The doctor may advise a pain-reducing medicine before or after the procedure to make it comfortable. They may also inject medicines to numb the cervix so that pain is reduced to a minimum.' "
What can I expect after an IUD insertion procedure?,"'Although the procedure is quick and done in the doctor’s office, some women might feel lightheaded after the IUD is put in. You may ask someone to accompany you so that you can comfortably get back home after the procedure.''Many people feel perfectly fine after they get an IUD, while others need to take rest for some time. Heating pad and ''over-the-counter'' medicines will help with any pain. You may experience occasional cramping and ''spotting'' that resolves within three to six months. Your experience may vary depending on the type of IUD inserted.''The discomfort with the IUDs goes away over time. If the IUD is giving you pain, ''fever'', bleeding, discomfort or any other disturbing symptoms, you should consult with your doctor.' Hormonal IUDs make periods lighter and less painful. You may stop getting periods after some time. This is not a permanent occurrence and your periods regularize after the IUD removal. Copper IUDs in contrast can make you get heavy and crampy periods."
When should I get my IUD removed?,"'You should note the date you received your IUD, as different IUDs are effective for different durations. Some of the common IUDs and the time for which they can be left in your uterus are:' Paragard IUD: 12 years Mirena IUD: Seven years Kyleena IUD: Five years Liletta IUD: Seven years Skyla IUD: Three years"
What is an osteotomy rhinoplasty?,"'An osteotomy ''rhinoplasty'' is a surgical procedure of the nose where a nasal bone is divided or removed. Osteotomy rhinoplasty is not a common procedure. In 2018, for every 213,000 nasal repair surgeries (rhinoplasties) performed in the United States, approximately three were osteotomy rhinoplasties. Osteotomy rhinoplasty is generally performed when nasal deformities are present.''Types of rhinoplasties:' Rhinoplasty, alar cartilage resection Rhinoplasty, Asian Rhinoplasty, augmentation Rhinoplasty, basic closed technique Rhinoplasty, basic open technique Rhinoplasty, maxillary augmentation Rhinoplasty, spreader grafts Rhinoplasty, supratip deformity Rhinoplasty, tip approaches Rhinoplasty, tip surgery Rhinoplasty, tripod theory Rhinoplasty, turbinate reduction"
How is an osteotomy rhinoplasty performed?,"'Detailed history, physical, and lab evaluations are completed prior to the osteotomy rhinoplasty. Before the osteotomy rhinoplasty, a photograph of the patient’s nose is often taken for review during the surgery.''Before the osteotomy rhinoplasty, the patient is asked to avoid:' Aspirin Anti-inflammatory medications:IbuprofenNaproxen Ibuprofen Naproxen Blood-thinning medications or anticoagulants Vitamin E Fish oil capsules Over-the-counter nutritional agents Alcohol Rhinoplasty is followed by the osteotomy, under general anesthesia. A fracture line is made with the osteotome (an instrument used to perform an osteotomy) on both sides, and manual pressure is exerted to fracture the bone. After the completion of the osteotomy, all the incisions are closed, and a splint is applied to keep the nose in place. The splints will be left for one week. A minimal amount of bleeding can be expected. Black blue discoloration around the eye due to bruising caused by the osteotomy rhinoplasty may happen that resolves in one to two weeks. Strenuous and vigorous activities such as jogging, horseback riding and skiing should be avoided for the first six weeks."
How painful is osteotomy rhinoplasty recovery?,"'Mild to moderate ''pain'' after osteotomy rhinoplasty is usual. This typically is managed with oral ''pain'' medications. The patient can expect a reasonable amount of ''bruising'' and swelling of the face immediately after the procedure. Natural healing of the bones will take place. Recovery may proceed for up to a year. Surgeons prefer osteotomy rhinoplasty, since the relapse rates of deformities are lower.' "
What are the causes of breech delivery?,"'The most common causes of breech delivery include:' The mother may have an abnormally shaped uterus Pregnancy is less than 37 weeks along They are part of multiple births (two or more babies) Too much amniotic fluid Not enough amniotic fluid Multipara (the woman has been pregnant before) Presence of uterine abnormalities, such as fibroids The placenta is covering either a part of or all the uterine opening (placenta previa)"
What is the external cephalic version (ECV)?,"'A doctor may try to turn the baby into a head-first position using a procedure called an external cephalic version (ECV). During this procedure, the doctor may put pressure on specific parts of the bump to encourage the baby to move around in the womb. An ECV can be done from 36 weeks onward until early ''labor'' if the water has not yet broken. It\xa0is successful for some women. If successful, the mother will be less likely to need a cesarean delivery or other\xa0medical assistance during ''labor''.' "
What is the 3-Day cardiac diet?,"'The 3-Day cardiac diet is one of the popular fad diets for weight-loss. The diet claims a weight loss of about 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms in a week. The diet makes robust claims of faster and significant weight loss, detox, lowered ''cholesterol'' and increased energy. None of these claims, however, have been scientifically substantiated. The diet is also called the Birmingham Diet because the advocates of this diet claim that it was developed at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. The researchers at the university, however, deny such claims.\xa0''The diet constitutes a three-day diet plan (on days) that provide between 800-1000 calories. This is followed by four days of responsible eating when a person can have a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean meat and nuts. The diet pattern can be followed over and again till the desired weight loss is achieved.' "
What does a 3-day cardiac diet menu contain?,'The 3-day cardiac diet offers an inexpensive but restricted menu. Sticking to the menu is proposed to result in 10 pounds of weight loss in seven days.

What is a blood clot in the lungs?,"'A ''blood clot'' is a solid or semisolid clump of blood. When the tissues of our body are injured, excessive blood loss is prevented by the clotting of blood. When a ''blood clot'' occurs inside the blood vessels it may lead to serious medical conditions. When a blood clot occurs inside the arteries to the ''lungs'', the condition is called ''pulmonary embolism'' (PE). The terms ‘embolus’ (plural: emboli) and ‘embolism’ refer to a blood clot or a part of a blood clot that forms at one site in the body and travels to another site. ''Pulmonary embolism'' is a condition in which this traveling clot lodges itself in the arteries of the lungs.' "
What causes blood clots in the lungs?,"'Pulmonary embolism can be caused by many factors:' Surgery, especially surgery on the abdomen, hip, and knees Bone fracture, especially long bone fractures such as of the thigh bone (femur) A long period of confinement to the bed or a wheelchair Prolonged hospitalization Cancer and chemotherapy Pregnancy and the first six weeks after delivery Heart diseases Stroke Estrogen-containing birth control pills Hormone replacement therapy containing estrogen Being obese or overweight Long hours of sitting, such as on a long air flight Smoking Family history of blood clots"
What are the early signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the lungs?,"'The signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism differ depending on:''Common\xa0signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism are:' Size of the clot  The extent of lung involvement Underlying medical conditions Shortness of breath. Chest pain, which may get worse while breathing. Cough, which may be associated with coughing up blood. Pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, or back. Pale or bluish lips and nails. Excessive sweating. Leg pain or swelling. Lightheadedness, dizziness, or passing out. Palpitations (feeling of racing heartbeat). Wheezing (noisy breathing). Anxiousness."
Can you recover from a blood clot in the lungs?,"'Early treatment of pulmonary embolism is important to prevent serious complications. Treatment aims at preventing:''Treatment options include:' An increase in the size of the blood clot The formation of new clots Anticoagulation medicines (blood thinners): They are the most common treatment for a blood clot in the lungs. Although blood thinners do not make your blood thin. They slow the process of new clots forming and prevent the already formed ones from getting bigger. Blood thinners include:Unfractionated heparin (UFH)Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)WarfarinDirect oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications Unfractionated heparin (UFH) Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Warfarin Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications Thrombolytic therapy (“the clot busters” or “clot dissolvers”) to dissolve the existing clots. Surgery may be needed to remove a very large, life-threatening clot. Compression stockings may be useful to prevent the recurrence of pulmonary embolism, as most of the clots in the lungs originate in the legs.  A vena cava filter may be surgically placed in a large vein of the abdomen called the vena cava. It can ‘filter out’ or catch blood clots from the legs before they reach the lungs. Management of risk factors ( cessation of smoking, weight control, regular exercise). Suitable attention must be given to reduce the risk of bleeding while on anticoagulants. The doctor may advise avoiding certain foods, alcohol, or some over-the-counter medications (such as aspirin and sleeping pills).  People on blood thinners should not overexert themselves during exercises. "
Is a clot in the lung dangerous?,"'Although a clot in the lung may be a life-threatening condition, with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk factors, most people live well.''Some of the complications of pulmonary embolism are:''As treatment of pulmonary embolism involves using anticoagulants, there can be anticoagulant related complications also. These include:' Disorders of heart rhythm (arrhythmias) Shock Heart failure Pleural effusion (collection of fluid around the lungs) Pulmonary infarction (the death of lung tissue) Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs) Sudden cardiac death Excessive bleeding  Blood in vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds Blood in stool or black, tarry stools Headache Sudden vision changes Sudden loss of strength in any of the limbs Confusion Memory loss Fainting"
What is carotid artery surgery?,"'Carotid artery surgery is a surgery to treat ''carotid artery disease''. The carotid artery is the main artery present on both sides of the neck that supplies blood to the brain and face. A buildup of the fatty substance (plaques) can block the blood flow in the carotid arteries entirely or partially, resulting in a ''stroke''. Carotid artery surgery restores proper blood flow to the brain. There are two types of carotid artery surgery:' Carotid endarterectomy Angioplasty with stent placement"
When should you have carotid artery surgery?,"'Carotid artery surgery is ideal in these cases:' When the carotid artery is severely blocked with a previous history of stroke or mini-stroke When there is a moderate blockage in the carotid artery with a history of stroke or mini-stroke When there is a severe blockage, but there is no history of stroke or mini-stroke"
What to expect during carotid artery surgery?,"'Before the procedure:''You should enlist your medical and medication history to the physician. Tell the physician about what ''drugs'' you are taking, even nonprescription medicines or herbs. Before the surgery, you should:''During a carotid endarterectomy:''During an angioplasty:''After the procedure:''After going home:' Ask your physician about the drugs to be taken on the day of the surgery Inform the physician if you are on blood thinners Inform the physician if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any illness Stop smoking a few days before the procedure Stop drinking or eating anything after midnight the night before your procedure Stop taking antiarrhythmic medications several days before the surgery Ask the doctor about any precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator You may receive general anesthesia or local anesthesia along with a sedative to make you relax throughout the procedure You have to lie on your side on the operating table, the side where the blocked artery is present The physician makes a cut in the neck to expose the carotid artery After exposing the artery by shifting the structures of the neck, the physician makes a cut in the artery To divert the blood flow around the surgery, the physician places a shunt After placing the shunt, the physician removes the plaque from the artery Next, the physician removes the shunt and close the artery with stitches Finally, the physician places a small tube in the neck to drain the blood The physician applies a sterile bandage or dressing at the site During an angioplasty, the physician passes a catheter through a small incision (cut) made on the leg, arm, or wrist. A tiny balloon attached to the catheter would blow up and push through the blockage. Finally, the physician places a wire mesh (stent) in this blocked area. The stent is left in the artery to keep it open. The drain will be removed 24 hours after the surgery You may have to stay overnight in the hospital Avoid physical activity for 3-4 weeks Don’t drive for 24 hours Don’t drink alcohol for 24 hours after you leave the hospital Shower immediately"
What is a heart ablation surgery?,"'Heart ablation or cardiac ablation is a procedure done to rectify problems with heart rhythm (arrhythmias). It is a low-risk procedure that involves scarring or destroying the tissue in the heart, which triggers an abnormal heart rhythm. Heart ablation is carried out by the insertion of a catheter through the groin and directed to the heart to injure the tissues with radio waves to reduce the ''fibrillation''.''Types of cardiac catheter ablation include:''Surgical ablation involves an incision in the chest and is of three types:' High-energy radio waves (radiofrequency ablation): The physician inserts a catheter to send a strong radio wave that ultimately scars each vein or a group of veins. Cryoablation: The physician uses a probe with a very cold temperature to freeze the tissue to cause a scar. Microwave ablation: The physician sends energy through a thin probe to scar the tissue. Pulmonary vein ablation: This involves utilizing energy around the connections of the pulmonary vein near the atrium to restore the regular heart rhythm. Maze procedure Mini maze Convergent procedure"
Why is a heart ablation done?,"'Heart ablation may help correct arrhythmias. Ablation isn’t the first line of treatment; however, it may be indicated in people who:' Have failed medication therapy Have serious adverse effects from medications used in the treatment of arrhythmias Have certain types of arrhythmias that respond to ablation Have complications arising from arrhythmias, such as sudden cardiac arrest"
How to prepare for a heart ablation?,"'You should enlist your medical and medication history to the physician. Tell the physician about what medicines you are taking, even nonprescription medicines or herbs. Before the surgery, you should:' Ask your physician about the medicines to take on the day of the surgery Inform the physician if you are on blood thinners Inform the physician if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any illness Stop smoking a few days before the procedure Stop drinking or eating anything after midnight the night before your procedure Stop taking antiarrhythmic medications several days before the procedure Ask the doctor about any precautions if you have a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator"
How is heart ablation surgery performed?," An intravenous line is passed into a vein in the arm for anesthesia and sedative medicines Your groin area will be cleaned and shaved before the surgery To numb the injection site, you will be given a local anesthetic The physician will make a needle puncture through your skin into the blood vessel in the groin After making a puncture, the physician inserts a small straw-sized tube (sheath) into the blood vessel. Through this sheath, the physician gently guides a catheter into the blood vessel. Through this sheath, the physician feeds the heart with several long, thin tubes with wires, known as the electrode catheters. The physician locates the abnormal tissue by sending a small electrical impulse through the electrode catheter. The physician places the catheter at the precise site inside the heart where the unusual tissues are present. Radiofrequency energy is sent through a catheter that destroys the heart muscles in a tiny area, which is responsible for abnormal heart rhythms."
What to expect after a heart ablation surgery?,"'After the surgery, the sheath remains in the leg for several hours. After removing the sheath:''After going home:' The nurse will put pressure on the puncture site to stop the bleeding You should keep your leg straight for 6-8 hours. You may be given Aspirin for 2-4 weeks to minimize the risk of clot formation Avoid physical activity for 3 days Don’t drive for 24 hours Don’t drink alcohol for 24 hours after you leave the hospital"
When is heart catheterization required?,"'Since heart catheterization is an invasive procedure, it’s not the first test doctors use to diagnose a problem. It is often performed in patients who are having a heart attack/''chest pain'' or ''angina''. It is also performed when a patient gets abnormal results from their blood test or ''stress'' test. If the doctor suspects blockage or narrowing of an artery, the patient may benefit from a heart catheterization procedure.' "
What is heart catheterization?,"'Cardiac catheterization is a medical procedure to find out detailed information about the heart and its connected arteries. The procedure is usually performed under local or general anesthesia by making a tiny cut in the groin or wrist. A catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a large blood vessel that leads to the heart. The procedure usually takes less than 1-2 hours.''This procedure helps in diagnosing and treating heart conditions.''Diagnosing heart diseases:''Treating heart diseases:''In possible situations, doctors may use heart catheterization to treat the disease.' Angiogram: It helps in viewing the inside of arteries of the heart, kidney, and lungs, as well as peripheral arteries (arms and legs). Nitrous oxide challenge: It helps in diagnosing a lung disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by measuring pressure in the heart and pulmonary artery (artery of lungs). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS): Examines the inside of arteries using sound waves. Swan-Ganz catheterization: Monitors heart function and blood flow. Angioplasty and stent placement: Open narrowed or blocked arteries by inflating a tiny balloon (also called balloon angioplasty). In many instances, doctors place a stent, which is a small, metal tube in the artery to keep it open. Atherectomy: Removes plaque buildup in blood vessels using a catheter with a sharp blade (metal burr). Atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale repairs: Closes openings in the heart that are there at birth (congenital abnormalities). Coronary thrombectomy: Removes a blood clot from a blood vessel that supplies blood to the heart. Pericardiocentesis: Removes fluid that has accumulated around the heart. Septal ablations: Destroys diseased heart tissue by creating a small, controlled heart attack. Temporary pacemaker implantation: Treats short-term heart problems, such as a slow heartbeat caused by a heart attack, heart surgery, or a medicine overdose. Temporary ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation: Stabilizes someone who’s critically ill until diagnosis and treatment decisions can be determined. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): Replaces the aortic valve in the heart. This offers a minimally invasive alternative to some people who can’t have open-heart surgery. Valvuloplasty: Improves blood flow in the heart by opening the important valves in the heart with a tiny balloon (similar to angioplasty)."
What is the recovery like?,"'In most cases, an overnight stay may be recommended. After the procedure is complete, the patient may be taken to a recovery room for a few hours. If the catheter was inserted in the wrist, the patient can sit upright right after the procedure. If the catheter was inserted in the leg, the patient may need to keep it straight. One week after the procedure, the patient may be able to return to normal activity.' "
What is a liver biopsy?,"'A liver biopsy is a medical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the liver to remove a small piece of the liver tissue and examine it for signs of disease or damage.''There are different types of liver biopsy based on the sample of the liver tissue taken, which include:' Percutaneous liver biopsy: In this type, the doctor inserts a needle through the skin in the upper part of the abdomen to extract a small piece of the liver tissue. Transjugular liver biopsy: In this type, the doctor inserts a needle into the jugular vein (vein of the neck) and passes it to the liver to extract a small piece of the tissue. Surgical liver biopsy: The doctor may perform a liver biopsy during other surgeries."
Why is a liver biopsy performed?,'A liver biopsy is performed to identify:' Liver diseases when a doctor can’t confirm a diagnosis with blood or imaging tests. The extent or severity of liver disease (staging of the disease). The best treatment protocol for liver disease. How treatment for liver disease is working. A mass or a tumor in the liver.
How does a physician perform a liver biopsy?,"'The doctor performs a liver biopsy at a hospital. It may be done during surgery or in an outpatient setting.''Percutaneous liver biopsy:'' Doctors may use an ''ultrasound'' or computed tomography (CT) scan to find the best place to insert a needle in the abdomen. The doctor may make an opening on the right side of the abdomen and insert the special biopsy needle or biopsy gun. Next, the physician may remove a piece of the liver tissue with the biopsy needle or gun. After the biopsy, the doctor will place a bandage on the opening.''Transjugular liver biopsy: ''The doctor uses an ultrasound to locate the jugular vein in the neck. During the procedure, the physician may use fluoroscopy (an imaging technique) to view the veins between the neck and liver. The physician makes a cut over the side of the neck and uses a needle to make a small hole in the jugular vein. Next, the physician inserts a thin, flexible tube or catheter through the veins to the liver. A biopsy needle is guided through the catheter to remove the liver tissue. After the biopsy, the doctor closes the incision.' "
What is a staph infection?,"'A ''Staphylococcus'' ''or ''staph infection'' is caused by a germ that may be found in 30% of healthy people’s noses. Most of the time, these bacteria do not cause any health problems. However, in some people, it may cause skin and other organ infections. ''Staph'' is highly ''contagious'' and sometimes may not respond to antibiotics.' "
How serious is a staph infection?,"'Most often, staph causes minor skin infections such as a ''boil''. However, if it enters into your bloodstream and other organs, it may turn out to be deadly.''Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus'' (''MRSA'') ''is a bacterium that causes staph infections, which is unresponsive to standard antibiotics.. A ''staph infection'' can be dangerous and must be treated with caution.''Staph infections can affect different organs and lead to the following conditions''The infection may have serious complications in people with poor immunity such as individuals with ''diabetes'', ''cancer'' and ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'').' Skin infections including Boils: These are painful pus-filled bumps over the buttocks and skin creases.Impetigo: These red sores are seen over a child’s nose and mouth and they  may crust.Cellulitis: This is swollen, red, painful warm skin with deeper tissue infections.Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome: This is a serious skin condition causing peeling of the skin. Boils: These are painful pus-filled bumps over the buttocks and skin creases. Impetigo: These red sores are seen over a child’s nose and mouth and they  may crust. Cellulitis: This is swollen, red, painful warm skin with deeper tissue infections. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome: This is a serious skin condition causing peeling of the skin. Pneumonia: This is an infection of the lungs. Endocarditis: This is an infection of the inner layer of your heart. Osteomyelitis: This is a bone infection and inflammation. Septic arthritis: This is swelling of the joints with severe pain and fever. Food poisoning: Staph infection is a very common cause of food poisoning. It may lead to nausea, vomiting, dehydration and low blood pressure. The symptoms appear quickly and can be deadly. Toxic shock syndrome: This is a deadly condition due to toxins produced by certain bacteria. It may be linked to the usage of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. You may get a high fever, nausea, vomiting, rashes on palms, muscle aches and stomach pain. Bacteremia (blood poisoning): If the bacteria enters your bloodstream, it may travel to other organs and lead to sepsis (a life-threatening complication that leads to malfunction of all the organs)."
What causes a staph infection?,"'Staph bacteria may pass from person to person through any object and it can survive in dry, extreme temperatures and an acidic environment.''Your risk of staph infections may increase if you' Are sharing personal items such as towels, razors, etc. Have uncovered and oozing wounds Are playing high-contact sports or living in crowded places Have recently stayed at the hospital Are addicted to injectable drugs such as opioids Have undergone a surgery Are exposed to a patient carrying a staph infection Have artificial body parts such as a joint, pacemaker, etc. Have trauma or a puncture wound Have poorly-controlled diabetes Are lacking in proper nutrition Have too little iron in the body Are an alcoholic Have intravenous lines (tubes inserted into your body to insert medicine), catheter (to remove urine) or feeding or breathing tubes Have kidney disease and are on dialysis (treatment to filter and purify blood using a machine) Have a weak immune system due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chemotherapy or organ transplant Have blood disorders such as leukemia (blood cancer) and lymphoma (cancer of lymph glands) Are on medications that may weaken your immune system such as steroids and retinoids (vitamin A compounds)"
How are staph infections diagnosed?," Your doctor may examine you, check the body signs and ask about your symptoms. To further confirm the infection, your doctor may scrape the skin or the affected part to take a sample or swab the throat or nasal passages or check a stool sample. Your doctor may order an imaging test depending on the location of the infection to assess the spread."
What are the different types of anemia?,"'There are different types of anemia depending upon the cause:''The most common type of anemia is due to deficiency of iron in the body, called iron-deficiency anemia.' Iron-deficiency anemia: It is usually due to nutritional deficiencies such as iron, folic acid or B12 deficiency. Your doctor will investigate the cause of iron-deficiency anemia through various tests. Nutritional deficiencies are fixed through changes in diet or by taking supplements. If there is a problem with the absorption of vitamin B12, your doctor may prescribe B12 injections.  Anemia due to chronic disease: If the anemia is due to a chronic condition such as chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism or chronic infections, treatment of the underlying medical condition will often improve the anemia. In certain conditions, such as chronic kidney diseases, the doctor may prescribe other medications such as erythropoietin injections. These medications stimulate the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. Aplastic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when the bone marrow stops producing red blood cells. Treatment for aplastic anemia may include blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant besides other therapy depending upon the root cause and severity of aplastic anemia. Hemolytic anemia: The cause for hemolysis can often be determined by special blood tests and by examining the red blood cells under a microscope. The treatment will depend upon the cause of anemia and may include removing the culprit medication, referral to a heart or vascular specialist, antibiotics or drugs that suppress the immune system."
How does having anemia feel like?,"'A person with anemia generally looks pale or feels week, more tired or ''cold'' than they usually do. This is because their organs do not receive adequate oxygen because of anemia. They may experience the following symptoms:' Fatigue Shortness of breath  Feeling cold Weakness Dizziness Pale skin (Pallor) Dry or easily bruised skin Loss of appetite Headache Sore or inflamed tongue Palpitations (a feeling of racing or pounding heartbeat)"
What are the complications of anemia during pregnancy?,"'Anemia during pregnancy increases the chance of complications, such as:''The demand for several nutrients, including iron, increases during pregnancy. This makes the ''pregnant'' female more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia. The unborn baby depends on the mother for their iron needs.

How do you get chlamydia infection?,"'Chlamydia is the most common ''sexually transmitted infection'' (''STI'') in the United States. It is caused by infection with the bacteria called ''Chlamydia trachomatis''. The infection is transmitted by having unprotected sex with a person who has chlamydia. It has recently emerged as a cause of outbreaks of proctitis (inflammation of the rectum) among men who have sex with men (''MSM''). Chlamydia is transmitted by sexual contact with the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus of an infected partner. The transmission does not need ejaculation to occur. The infection can also pass from an untreated mother to her baby during ''childbirth''.''Chlamydia infection can be prevented by using latex male ''condoms''. These condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce the risk of getting or giving chlamydia. The most definitive way to prevent chlamydia is to abstain from vaginal, anal, and oral sex or to be in a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested for chlamydia and is known to be uninfected.' "
What are the symptoms of chlamydia infection?,"'Symptoms of chlamydia'' infection often go unnoticed. Some people experience symptoms within a few weeks of exposure (unprotected sex), whereas for others, symptoms may take months to appear. Sometimes, the symptoms disappear on their own, but the infection persists (subclinical chlamydia).''The symptoms include the following:''Symptoms in females''Symptoms in males' Vaginal discharge often reported as unusual or foul-smelling Dysuria (Pain while urinating) Pain in the abdomen or pelvic region Dyspareunia (Pain during intercourse) Bleeding through the vagina after sex or between periods Infertility Ectopic pregnancy Premature delivery Pain the in rectum Anal discharge Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Throat pain or discomfort Watery or whitish discharge from the tip of the penis Pain while passing urine Burning or itching in and around the tip of the penis Pain in the testicles Pain in the joints Pain in the rectum Anal discharge Conjunctivitis Infertility Throat pain or discomfort"
What is Crohn’s disease?,"'Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes inflammation in the gut (the digestive tract) and belongs to a group of conditions known as ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''). It can affect any part of the digestive tract that runs from the mouth to anus, but it generally affects the small intestine and initial part of the ''large intestine''.''Crohn’s disease is similar to other types of ''inflammatory bowel diseases'', such as ''ulcerative colitis'' and ''microscopic colitis''.' "
How serious is Crohn’s disease?,"'Crohn’s disease in and of itself is not usually life-threatening, although it can cause serious or fatal complications, which include the following:''Appropriate treatment can augment the possibility of a good recovery.' Bowel obstruction Fistulas (abnormal passages between a hollow or tubular organ and the body surface or between two hollow or tubular organs) Abscesses (pus-filled pocket of infection) Anal fissures (small tears in the anus) Ulcers or open sores in the mouth, intestine, or anus Malnutrition Inflammation around the joints, eyes, or skin"
What causes Crohn’s disease?,"'The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown; however, an autoimmune reaction can incite Crohn’s disease. In an autoimmune reaction, the immune system may attack its healthy cells to cause inflammation of the tissues within the digestive tract.\xa0''Heredity can also play an important role in causing Crohn’s disease.\xa0''Stress'"" and eating certain foods do not cause Crohn's disease; however, they can worsen the symptoms."" "
Who can get Crohn’s disease?,"'People associated with the following certain factors are at a high risk of Crohn’s disease:' Family history Smoking Certain medications such as antibiotics, birth control pills, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) High-fat diet High-risk ethnic backgrounds such as the African-American and Caucasians Age between 15 and 35 years Environmental factors (pollution) "
What are the signs and symptoms of Crohn’s disease?,"'The signs and symptoms vary from individual to individual. In patients with Crohn’s disease, there are times when symptoms worsen (flares) and times when the individual recuperates from the symptoms (remission). The most common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include the following:' Abdominal pain or cramps Persistent diarrhea Urgent desire to defecate The feeling of incomplete bowel emptying Constipation Weight loss Other less common symptoms of Crohn’s disease are as follows: Rectal bleeding Anemia Eye redness or pain Fatigue Fever Joint pain or soreness Nausea or loss of appetite Red, tender bumps under the skin Night sweats Rectal pain"
What procedures and tests diagnose Crohn's disease?,'There are no specific tests or procedures to diagnose Crohn’s disease. The physician evaluates the symptoms and uses information from diagnostic testing to exclude other potential causes.' The common diagnostic tests include: Blood tests X-rays of the upper and lower digestive tract Endoscopy Biopsy of the colon while performing endoscopy Imaging tests (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI])
What are the treatments for Crohn’s disease?,"'Various treatment options help to control the disease and help patients lead a full and rewarding life. Treatment options include''Medications suppress inflammation by reducing the activity of the immune system. They also help in subsiding the symptoms or complications. Mostly antidiarrheals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or antibiotics are used.''Bowel rest involves restricting eating any food by mouth.''Surgery is useful in treating complications and reducing symptoms when other treatments are not useful.''Incorporating the following diet changes will help in reducing symptoms:' use of medications, alterations in diet and nutrition and surgical procedures. Avoiding carbonated beverages Avoiding popcorn, nuts, and high-fiber food Drinking more liquids Eating smaller meals more often"
What are the causes of dilated cardiomyopathy?,"'The causes of dilated ''cardiomyopathy'' are unknown; however, the following are common risk factors that may cause or trigger dilated cardiomyopathy:' Congenital (by birth or sometimes inherited through genes) Severe coronary artery disease, which is the most common cause High blood pressure Diabetes Obesity Amphetamines and Cocaine drugs use or abuse History of heart attack Severe alcohol abuse Swelling of the heart's walls Lack of oxygen in the heart Heart valve disease Cancer and chemotherapy drugs Disturbances of the heart's rhythm or rate Autoimmune illnesses Infections, including those caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites Exposure to toxins, such as lead, mercury, and cobalt Complications of late-stage pregnancy"
What are the treatment options for dilated cardiomyopathy?,"'Treatment options for dilated cardiomyopathy are lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery.''Lifestyle modifications:''Medications:''Surgery and devices:' It starts with minimizing alcohol intake, smoking cessation, minimizing salt in the diet, and reducing caffeine intake. A balanced diet with moderate exercise may help in reducing symptoms by maintaining body weight and increasing the heart functioning mechanism. Diuretics or water tablets may reduce the fluid build-up by encouraging the kidneys to get rid of excess water as urine. ACE inhibitors help in relaxing the smooth muscle around the blood, making it easier for the heart to work. Beta-blockers reduce the rate and force of the heart’s contraction by reducing the stimulation of adrenaline, which would normally make the heartbeat faster. Antiarrhythmic drugs may help in maintaining a normal rhythm. Blood thinners reduce the risk of blood clot formation. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) enlarge the blood vessels, which help to reduce blood pressure, and they may be used if the person is not able to tolerate ACE inhibitors. Ivabradine may be used for people who are unable to take beta-blockers. Sacubitril and Valsartan/Entresto contain the ARB Valsartan and an antihypertensive drug called Sacubitril. It is a relatively new medication and may be used in severe heart failure when a combination of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are not effective. Pacemakers and biventricular pacemakers help in maintaining normal rhythm. This may be recommended for people with some types of arrhythmias. ICDs or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators help in correcting dangerous arrhythmias that may lead to a cardiac arrest. An ICD combined with a biventricular pacemaker is used if both functions are required. The left ventricular assist device is a mechanical device that helps to pump the blood out of the left ventricle (main pumping chamber of the heart) when it is not working properly. Currently, this is only used to support the heart while waiting for a transplant. A heart transplant is a final choice if the heart doesn’t respond to other treatments. This involves removing the failing heart and replacing it with a donor’s heart."
What is the outlook of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)?,"'Many patients with DCM can lead relatively normal lives once the diagnosis has been established and appropriate therapies have been started. The long-term outlook varies depending on the cause, severity, and degree of functional impairment. Patients need to be watched closely for the development of heart failure, ''abnormal heart rhythms'', blood clots inside the heart, and other signs that imply the heart is not able to maintain normal blood flow. Once signs of heart failure or significantly abnormal rhythms appear, aggressive therapy is needed with close monitoring. Patients may recover and stabilize; however, life-threatening conditions including death may not be ruled out.' "
What is mononucleosis?,"'Infectious mononucleosis'', also called “mono,” is a ''contagious'' infection caused by a ''herpes'' virus called Epstein-Barr (''EBV''). Teenagers and young adults are more commonly affected by mononucleosis.\xa0''\xa0It is commonly known as the kissing disease because of the way it commonly gets transmitted.''The mononucleosis virus is transmitted mainly through:' saliva or kissing sharing glass or food utensils blood transfusions coughing or sneezing sexual contact organ transplants"
What are the symptoms of mononucleosis?,"'Once you are infected with the EBV, it can take four to six weeks for the symptoms to turn up. When the symptoms appear, they tend to be mild, especially in young children. Symptoms develop gradually and may not occur at once.''The most common symptoms include:''Swollen liver or enlarged spleens are rare; however, in some, these symptoms may continue even after their ''fatigue'' ends.''Most of the symptoms of mononucleosis decline within two to four weeks, but ''fatigue'' may last longer. It generally takes two to three months to completely heal from mononucleosis. Occasionally, the symptoms of mononucleosis can last for six months or longer.' Extreme fatigue Fever Sore throat Head and body aches Swollen lymph nodes in the neck and armpits Swollen liver or spleen or both Rash Lack of appetite Weakness and sore muscles"
What are the complications of mononucleosis?,"'The complications of mononucleosis include:' Enlarged spleen: If it becomes severe, the spleen may rupture. It can be identified by a sudden, sharp pain in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Seeking immediate medical attention is important at this stage. Swollen tonsils: It results in narrowing of the airway, making it hard to breathe or swallow. Liver disease: Hepatitis or jaundice may be seen in some Hemolytic anemia: Overproduction of red blood cells in the body Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count in the blood Myocarditis: The heart muscles get inflamed Seizures Encephalitis (brain inflammation) Meningitis: Inflammation of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord"
How to get rid of mononucleosis?,"'There isn’t a ''vaccine'' or cure for mononucleosis. Antibiotics or antiviral may not work against mononucleosis. Management of mononucleosis includes:' Wash your hands regularly Getting adequate rest to fight infection Drink plenty of fluids for hydration Pain killers may be recommended for fever, inflammation, headaches, and muscle aches. Some of the common painkillers include Aleve (naproxen), Tylenol (acetaminophen), and Advil (ibuprofen).  Gargle with salt water and use throat lozenges for calming a sore throat Avoid contact sports and strenuous exercise to prevent the risk of spleen rupture."
What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically affects the joints and other body parts, such as the skin, eyes, ''lungs'', ''heart'' and blood vessels.''RA'' is an autoimmune disorder, a condition where the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues.''Osteoarthritis'' occurs as a result of wear and tear of the joints. ''RA'' affects the lining of the joints, leading to inflammation, ''pain'' and swelling that eventually cause bone erosion and joint deformities. ''RA'' causes inflammation and damage in other parts of the body as well. Although new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe RA can still cause physical disabilities.' "
How serious is rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) is a chronic disease where patients suffer from frequent flare-ups of signs and symptoms and periods of remission (asymptomatic periods). Initially, the small joints are affected, especially the joints of the fingers and toes. As the disease progresses, other joints may be affected, like the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. RA also presents with systemic signs and symptoms and other body systems may be affected in 40% of cases. If not diagnosed early and appropriately treated, RA can lead to permanent deformities, disabilities and serious systemic complications.''Signs and ''symptoms of RA'' in the joints include''Systemic signs and symptoms''Complications of RA' Tender, warm and swollen joints Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity Loss of joint function Joint deformities Fatigue Fever  Loss of appetite Weight loss Blue fingertips due to vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) Ulcers Muscle wasting  Anemia  Scleritis: Inflammation of the sclera of the eyes. Pericarditis: Inflammation of the outer covering of the heart. Myocarditis: Inflammation of the heart. Inflammation of the nerves Osteoporosis: Weakening of the bones, making them more prone to fractures. Rheumatoid nodules: Firm bumps of tissue around the pressure points of joints, lungs, etc. Sjögren's syndrome: A disorder that causes dryness in the eyes and mouth. Infections: Systemic infections can occur because of the disease or medications. Weight gain can occur. Carpal tunnel syndrome: Inflammation can compress the median nerve that runs from the forearm into the hand and fingers. Cardiac (heart) complications: Pericarditis (inflammation of the outer covering of the heart) and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) can occur. Lung complications: Scarring of the lungs (fibrosis) causing breathing difficulty. Lymphoma: RA increases the risk of lymphoma (blood cancers that develop in the lymph system)."
What are the causes of rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) is an autoimmune disorder. Certain factors increase the risk of RA. The common risk factors are' Sex: Women are at  an increased risk compared to men. Age: RA most commonly begins during middle age. Family history: A positive family history increases the risk of the disease. Smoking and other environmental exposures to asbestos or silica increase disease risk.  Obesity: Excess weight, especially in women younger than55, increases disease risk."
How is rheumatoid arthritis treated?,"'There is no cure for ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA). It is a lifelong disease with multiple flare-ups and periods of remission (asymptomatic periods). There are various treatment options available to control the progression of the disease and prevent complications. Treatment usually involves a combination of more than one treatment modality. The treatment options are''Medications''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''):\xa0NSAIDs can relieve ''pain'' and reduce inflammation.''Physical therapy''Patients are usually referred for physical or occupational therapy to learn exercises for improving and maintaining joint flexibility and rehabilitation of joints.\xa0''Surgery''Surgical procedures may be performed to help restore joint function and anatomy and reduce pain.\xa0' Steroids: Corticosteroid medications suppress the immune system. They reduce inflammation and pain and delay joint damage.  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These drugs are effective in the treatment of RA. They suppress inflammation and relieve symptoms. They can slow the progression and prevent joint deformities and systemic complications. Some commonly prescribed DMARDs are methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and leflunomide (Arava). Biological modifiers: These are a newer generation of DMARDs and they are usually taken with DMARDs. They suppress inflammation. Some commonly used biological agents are infliximab, rituximab, sarilumab, etc."
What are the causes of ulcerative colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' (UC) is an ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'') affecting the inner lining of the ''large intestine'' (large bowel) leading to erosion and ulcers.

Appropriate treatment and the availability of new treatment options have lowered the risk of colon cancer."
How soon can I take a pregnancy test?,"'You may take a ''pregnancy test'' as soon as you miss a period or if your period is late. You would know the date of your ''missed period'' if your periods are regular. If\xa0 your periods are irregular, or you do not have periods for some reason, you can do a ''pregnancy'' test at least three weeks after sexual intercourse. It is recommended to take a pregnancy test as soon as possible if you miss your period or think you might be ''pregnant''. Knowing about your pregnancy early helps you plan accordingly and seek the necessary care. You must read the instructions in your test kit to know about the accuracy of the test and how and when to perform the test. Some ''pregnancy tests'' claim that they can give results a few days before a missed period. The results of testing this early are often less accurate.''Certain pregnancy tests may detect pregnancy hormones as soon as 10 days after unprotected intercourse. These tests have high chances of lacking accuracy and giving false-positive or false-negative test results.' "
How do pregnancy tests work?,"'Pregnancy tests are a quick and easy means to know whether you are pregnant. Most at-home pregnancy tests work by detecting the levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in your urine. HCG is also known as the pregnancy hormone because the levels of this hormone increase considerably when you get pregnant. This hormone is released when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus (the ''endometrium''). Thus, when you pee or put your urine on the test stick, it detects whether HCG is present in your urine.''Most pregnancy tests can be taken from the first day of your missed period. Because the HCG concentration increases rapidly (doubling every two to three days), taking a test early may not be accurate enough. Refer to the label instructions in your test kit to know the best time to take the test. It is generally advised to take the test the first thing in the morning because during this time the urine will have the highest concentration of HCG. Drinking a lot of water before the test may dilute the HCG levels in your urine, increasing the chance of a false-negative test result.\xa0' "
How accurate are home pregnancy tests?,"'Home pregnancy tests are quite accurate and reliable when you use them correctly. Most home pregnancy tests available at drugstores claim that they work 99 out of 100 times. Their accuracy is similar to that of a urine pregnancy test that you get in a doctor’s office or hospital.\xa0''Because these tests work by detecting the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) hormone in your urine, their accuracy might be lower in early pregnancy or when you have just missed your period. If your pregnancy test comes out negative but you feel that you might be pregnant, repeat the test a week after the date you missed your period. You may want to visit your healthcare provider if you are not confident about the result of your pregnancy test.' "
What is the best way to confirm pregnancy?,"'The best way to confirm pregnancy is to do a blood test measuring the human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) hormone. Women can also take a home pregnancy test. Home ''pregnancy tests'' are fairly reliable but may occasionally be a false-positive. This can occur for a number of reasons, including having a\xa0chemical\xa0or\xa0''ectopic pregnancy'' or even taking certain medications. Following a positive home pregnancy test with a doctor’s visit for a urine or blood test to confirm the pregnancy is the best way to confirm a pregnancy.\xa0\xa0' "
Why is a liver transplant done?,"'Liver transplant is usually performed for chronic liver failure, which may be a result of various conditions, the most common cause being liver ''cirrhosis'' (liver scarring).''Most common causes of liver ''cirrhosis'' leading to liver failure, requiring liver transplant include:' Hepatitis B and C caused by Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively Alcoholic liver disease, due to chronic excessive alcohol consumption Fatty liver disease (accumulation of fat in the liver, causing inflammation and damage of the liver cells) Genetic disorders that affect the liver, such as hemochromatosis (excessive iron build-up in the liver) and Wilson disease (excessive copper buildup in the liver) Diseases of the bile ducts (the tubes that carry bile away from the liver and biliary atresia (commonly seen in children) Liver cancers"
What happens before a liver transplant?,"'A patient requiring a liver transplant is placed on a waiting list, which is decided by a model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. This score is based on blood tests, such as:''The blood tests are repeated regularly, and the MELD score is updated accordingly. There is also a score for children under the age of 12 years, called pediatric end-stage liver disease score. The higher the MELD score, the sicker is the patient; hence, they are placed higher on the list. The success of transplant surgery also depends on a good match with a suitable donor; so, the wait time would also depend on the patient’s body size and ''blood type'', which should match the donor.''If two people with the same MELD scores qualify for a liver transplant and have a suitable match, the person who has been on the waiting list for longer would most likely receive the transplant sooner. A person with acute liver failure may be placed close to the top of the list because they have a high risk of facing death sooner. Though the waiting time for a liver transplant may be a long process, once a match is found, the surgery is coordinated quite fast.''Specific tests, procedures, and consultations advised before the surgery:' The level of creatinine, indicating kidneys function Checking the international normalized ratio (INR), which shows the ability of the liver to synthesize blood-clotting proteins Laboratory tests: Blood and urine tests to assess the health of the organs Radiological tests: Ultrasound, MRI, CT of the liver Cardiac test: To assess heart health General health exam: To assess overall health and rule out other Diet and nutrition consultation with dietitians to ensure liver and body health before and after surgery Psychological support to assess the mental health of the patient and help them cope with their chronic illness Deaddiction counseling: To help patients quit alcohol, drug, or tobacco Financial counseling to help patients and their family understand the cost of surgery and postoperative care"
What happens after a liver transplant?,"'The patient can expect the following after liver transplant surgery:' Patients are usually required to stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a few days after surgery. The patient is closely monitored to ensure their vitals are stable, and there are no postoperative complications. Patients are usually discharged after 7 to 10 days after surgery. Patients are required to follow-up regularly with the surgeon as advised. Patients are usually prescribed certain medications, which may have to be taken for life, such as immunosuppressants that prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted liver. Patients are advised on an appropriate diet and nutrition plan to ensure good liver and overall body health. Patients would be provided with rehabilitation services to help them return to their daily activities. Most patients can resume normal activities, including exercise and return to work, a few months following surgery and after consulting with the doctor. Complete recovery after transplant surgery can take 6 months or longer. Recovery usually depends on how sick the patient was before liver transplant surgery."
What are the complications of liver transplant surgery?,"'Liver transplant surgery has a significant risk of complications, such as:' Bleeding Blood clots Infection Rejection of the transplanted liver Failure of the transplanted liver Mental confusion Seizures Damage to the bile duct Bile duct leaks Recurrence of liver disease in the transplanted liver"
What is epilepsy surgery?,"'Epilepsy surgery'' is a neurosurgical procedure to prevent or reduce the occurrence of epileptic ''seizures''. ''Epilepsy'' surgery involves removal or surgical alteration of the part of the brain from which epileptic ''seizures'' originate.''Epileptic seizures are caused by sudden abnormal bursts of electrical activity in some brain cells, which may then spread to other parts of the brain. ''Epilepsy'' surgeries are performed to remove brain tissue where abnormal electrical pulses begin, or disrupt the pathways by which they travel.' "
Why is an epilepsy surgery performed?,"'Long-term control of epileptic seizures is important for a patient’s wellbeing because uncontrolled seizures can be debilitating and increase the risk for:' Accidental injuries Cognitive decline Status epilepticus, an emergency condition of continuous seizure that lasts longer than five minutes Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) Psychological, social and vocational impairment leading to anxiety and depression"
Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,'Antiepileptic ''drugs'' are the mainstay treatment for epilepsy. Candidates for epilepsy surgery must satisfy certain criteria which include:''Surgical options are limited if the focal ''seizure'' area controls critical functions such as' Antiepileptic drugs do not control seizures effectively or patients are unable to tolerate the side effects of antiepileptic drugs Seizures always arise from the same point of origin (focal epilepsy) Quality of life can be significantly improved with surgery Speech Vision Memory Movement Sensation
What are the types of epilepsy surgery?,"'The type of epilepsy surgery depends on the type of seizures and where they originate. Types of epilepsy surgery include:''Invasive surgeries involve cutting open the skull to access the brain in a procedure known as craniotomy.''Stereotactic radiosurgery'': A procedure that delivers precisely focused beams of ''radiation'' using 3D imaging, to destroy brain tissue in the seizure focus area.''Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT)'': A procedure that uses a laser to eliminate the seizure-causing tissue. This method is useful for people with focal seizures caused by clearly defined small brain lesions. LITT is under ''clinical trials'' for safety and efficacy in patients with seizures associated with mesial temporal sclerosis.' Focal resection: Surgical removal of brain tissue which is the origin of seizures. The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into two halves (right and left hemispheres). Each hemisphere consists of four sections; frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. The temporal lobe is the seizure focus for a majority of patients with focal seizures. Focal resection may be of two types: Anteromedial temporal resection (AMTR): Removal of anterior temporal lobe, the most frequently performed epilepsy surgery. Extratemporal resection: Removal of brain tissue from any of the three lobes other than the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy: Removal of brain lesions that cause focal seizures. Corpus callosotomy: Corpus callosotomy involves severing corpus callosum, a band of nerve fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. Corpus callosotomy prevents communication between the two halves of the brain and is performed in patients who have generalized seizures affecting both hemispheres. Functional hemispherectomy: Hemispherectomy means the removal of an entire brain hemisphere. In functional hemispherectomy (also known as hemispherotomy), doctors remove as little of the brain tissue as possible, but disconnect the hemisphere’s communication with the rest of the brain. Multiple subpial transection (MST): MST involves making fine shallow cuts (transections) in the brain tissue to prevent the flow of seizure impulses. This procedure is used for focal seizures in parts of the brain which have critical functions and are not safe to remove. Neurostimulation: Neurostimulation is a procedure to deliver low-voltage electrical impulses to a nerve or the brain, using a set of implanted electrodes and a battery-operated device that generates the electrical impulse. The mild electric current interrupts the brain’s electrical communication and prevents the flow of seizure impulses.There are three types of neurostimulation:Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): The stimulating device is implanted under the skin in the chest to deliver electric pulses to the vagus nerve, through electrodes implanted near the neck. Vagus nerve is a major communication link between the brain and other internal organs.Responsive neurostimulation device (RNS): The stimulator is implanted under the scalp with leads connecting to electrodes on the surface of the brain’s seizure focus region.Deep brain stimulation: Electrodes are implanted deep in parts of the brain such as amygdala or hippocampus. The stimulating device is placed under the skin in the upper chest.

How successful is surgery for epilepsy?,"'The success of the epilepsy surgery depends on the type of surgery. Patients will usually have to continue taking antiepileptic drugs for at least a year or more. Following are the surgical outcomes as revealed by studies on the efficacy of epilepsy surgery.' Focal resections: People who underwent temporal resection had better outcomes than those who had extratemporal resection. In a randomized trial 52% patients remained seizure-free for five years, apart from simple partial seizures. Corpus callosotomy: Corpus callosotomy generally reduces the frequency and intensity of seizures but does not stop them. Approximately 60% to 70% reduction can be expected in more than 80% of patients. Up to 15% may have no worthwhile benefit. Multiple subpial transection: Outcome with this type of surgery is not entirely clear because many of the patients also have a resection. Some studies have shown complete seizure control in approximately 55% of patients with no significant deficits in neurological functions. Functional hemispherectomy: Functional hemispherectomy had a seizure free outcome of 54% to 90% depending on the type of epilepsy syndrome treated. There was a significant improvement, which included nondisabling seizures, in 80% to 90% patients."
How to avoid triggers of rosacea?,"'To substantiate the results from rosacea treatment, it is essential to avoid the triggers that cause your rosacea to flare-up. Some of the common triggers include sun exposure, emotional ''stress'', hot and spicy foods, ''cold'' weather, and so on.''What you can do is to initially maintain a diary in which you can make daily notes of the foods you consume and activities you do, and then find out if these are the triggering factors for your rosacea. Accordingly, you can try to avoid those triggers by taking steps, such as not venturing out in midday sunlight, using sunscreens while you are outdoors, doing what you enjoy to reduce ''stress'', and so on.''Know how to take care of your skin:' Use a gentle cleanser to wash the face twice a day but do not over wash. Use a sunscreen lotion with SPF 50 at least 15 minutes before going out. Be gentle on your face and avoid scrubbing. Stay away from cosmetics and hair sprays, especially the ones that contain sodium lauryl ethyl sulfate (SLES). Soap, moisturizers, and sunscreens should be free of alcohol or other irritating ingredients (such as menthol, camphor). Gently apply facial moisturizers to avoid drying of the skin."
What is the best home remedy for rosacea?,"'There is no such home remedy that has proven to be the best one for rosacea. However, several reports suggest the added benefit of natural treatments in people who are extremely sensitive to multiple topical therapies. Some of the possible home remedies include:' Apply dilute white vinegar soaks or clean the face daily or weekly using approximately 1-part regular table vinegar to 6 parts water. Diluting the vinegar is extremely important. Apply green tea soaks to the face. Apply oatmeal, niacinamide, feverfew, licorice, teas, coffeeberry, aloe vera, chamomile, turmeric, and mushroom extracts (they have been reported to have a calming effect on rosacea). Massage your face by gently rubbing your skin in a circular motion starting in the middle of your face outward toward your ears. Make sure your hands are cleaned and sanitized before you touch the face. Try to be on an anti-inflammatory diet (such as a Mediterranean diet)."
Does rosacea go away?,"'Rosacea does not go away forever because it has no cure. However, that does not mean it worsens with time. By taking various treatments and applying ''prevention'' strategies against the triggering factors, you can control it.''Some forms of rosacea stay significantly clear for a long time under treatments that include therapy or a combination of therapies: laser, pulse-light therapies, photodynamic therapy, or isotretinoin. Although these are not considered a ""cure,"" you can experience long-lasting results, improve your skin condition, and perhaps stop or reverse the progress of this condition.' "
What happens if rosacea is left untreated?,"'It’s estimated that more than 16 million people in the United States are affected by rosacea, although many may go undiagnosed and even delay seeking treatment.''During early rosacea, facial flushing is transient, lasting for minutes to hours. If rosacea is left untreated, it progresses, and the redness can become permanent. Small, knobby bumps (''rhinophyma'') appear on the nose. Eyes may become red and dry and rarely, may become severely involved. If untreated, the condition can impair vision.' "
Tips how to fall asleep fast,"'Chronic ''insomnia'' affects up to 20% of adults, of which many don’t seek any treatment. If you cannot fall asleep within 20-30 minutes of getting into bed or stay wide awake even after being extremely tired, then here are some tips for you to fall asleep instantly:' Relax your mind and body before going to bed. Try doing simple exercises or some unwinding activities such as reading books or listening to soothing music. Deep breathing or meditation can calm your mind. Dim the lights of your house an hour before sleeping to induce sleep. Keep the sleeping room lights to dim. Dark rooms result in better quality sleep. Turn-off electronic gadgets such as mobile, laptop, tablets, and television one hour before sleeping. The lights emitted via these gadgets disturbs the sleep cycle. This includes e-books as well. Try to fix a time for sleeping to adjust your body’s clock. Follow this every day (weekends included) and even on days when it’s hard to get up in the morning due to lack of sleep. Have an early dinner before 7 p.m. or two hours before sleeping. Have a glass of milk while sleeping to reduce hunger and induce sleep. Milk contains an amino acid (L-tryptophan) which helps in inducing sleep. Stimulants such as nicotine and caffeine (coffee, cola, tea, and chocolate) should be avoided four to six hours before bedtime. Stimulants may interfere with sleep. If you are addicted to caffeine, try to reduce the amount of caffeine gradually to prevent unpleasant reactions such as headaches caused because of the withdrawal of caffeine at once (withdrawal symptoms). Consuming liquor during bedtime is not advisable because it may lead to nightmares and sweating. Although alcohol is a depressant and helps in falling asleep, the body tends to clear it, leading to night awakenings (withdrawal symptoms). Avoid long afternoon naps; however, take a power nap off 15-20 minutes about eight hours after you wake up. Discontinue any tasks one hour before sleeping to reduce anxiety and worry. Do not discuss any emotional issues during bedtime. Progressive muscle relaxation: This involves relaxation of various muscle groups by first tensing muscle and then relaxing them, starting from the feet and slowly moving upwards. Keep a record of your sleep pattern: The number of times you woke up during the night, how much caffeine or alcohol you had during the day. Mention it down in a diary. The bed should be used only for sleeping and intimacy. Avoid eating or working on the bed.  Refrain from watching the clock as it can lead to unnecessary stress and in turn cause less sleep. Make your sleeping time and environment comfortable by maintaining the room temperature at optimum. The mattress and pillow should be comfortable too. The bedroom should be painted in mellow colors.  Avoid drinking too much water during night time to avoid trips to the bathroom during sleep. Pets shouldn’t be allowed on the bed as they can bring allergy triggers like fleas, fur, and pollen."

Also, a patient may choose a product from a pharmacy that is already prepared and ready to mix from packets. Drink warm water to stay hydrated. Drinking warm ginger tea with turmeric may help relieve nasal congestion. Drinking warm water with apple cider vinegar may help in fighting a sinus infection. Apple cider vinegar has antibacterial and antifungal properties and is a good source of vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, calcium, and magnesium which aids in treating sinus infection. It works by loosening up the mucous and clearing nasal passages. Eat a balanced diet that also includes spices, and a diet rich in vitamin C and minerals help build immunity to fight infection. Sleep with the head elevated at night or keep a humidifier running at home to avoid an arid environment may help relieve sinus pressure."

But, they should not be used for too long as long-term use of these sprays can damage the nasal mucosa. Hence, should be used after consulting with a doctor. Antibiotics: Antibiotics may be prescribed by a doctor to get rid of the infection faster and prevent complications. Humidifiers: A humidifier adds moisture to the air which reduces dryness and softens dried mucus, helping the mucus clear out easily. Nasal irrigation: Nasal irrigation with saline using products like a neti pot, a small container with a spout, is used to  irrigate the nose. If saline is not readily available, a mixture of one-half teaspoon of salt and one-half teaspoon of baking soda mixed with two cups of sterile water can be prepared. Nasal irrigation can flush out excess mucus, bacteria and crusts, reducing nasal congestion. Steam inhalation: Steam inhalation can moisten dried mucus and crusts, reducing nasal congestion. Excessive steam inhalation or keeping the face too close to the steamer should be avoided as it could cause dryness. Rest: Getting adequate rest can help the body recover faster.   Hydration: Drinking plenty of clear fluids will help you remain hydrated.

Acne treatment,"'Acne'' is a common skin condition that affects the hair follicles and oil glands on the surface of the skin. The skin has several tiny hair follicles at the base of which the hair starts growing. These hair follicles are connected with small oil glands called sebaceous glands, which secrete an oily substance called sebum. Oil from the sebaceous glands lubricates the skin and hair. ''Acne'' occurs when the tiny hair follicles present on the skin get blocked by oil or dead skin cells. They not only are a cosmetic concern but also make the skin painful and inflamed. ''Acne'' can appear anywhere on the body including the back, shoulders, and chest; however, they most often occur on the face. ''Acne'' usually affects teenagers but can even occur in people in their forties or fifties.

"Stretches, Prevention, and Tips","'Shin splint'' is a common workout injury that aggravates due to overuse or repeated ''stress'' on the lower legs, especially between knee and ankle. It is a general term that many people use to describe ''pain'' along the front portion of their legs. The tibia which is the long bone in the front of the lower leg usually becomes swollen and painful. Sometimes an individual may also have a hairline ''fracture'' or muscle tear in this condition. Overstressed or weak muscles and connective tissues that run through the front of the legs are the culprits behind the ailment. People experience ''shin splints'' in both legs at the same time. The ''pain'' often worsens when a person is ''running'' or ''walking'', and it persists longer than usual.''Most common causes:\xa0''Most common stretches to relieve pain:''Prevention'' tips for shin splints:\xa0''Treatment for shin splints:\xa0' Most people get shin splints from repeated pounding on hard surfaces during activities such as running, basketball, or tennis. Working out harder than usual or training too hard or too fast instead of working up to a training level gradually is the most common cause of shin splints Workout shoes that don't have enough support may also be one of the causes for shin splint. Running or walking on a different surface than you are used to. For example, a person may get shin splints when they switch from running on a trail to concrete or asphalt. Foam Rolling: An individual may kneel on the roller, then gently roll two inches down the front of the shin, then again roll one inch up. This may be repeated all the way from the lower knee to the ankle. Total-leg rolling session one to three times per week is usually recommended Shin Stretch: An individual may sit on feet with the top of the foot and legs flat against the floor (best done on a mat). Slowly lean back to increase the stretch supporting the upper body with arms. Toe Pull Back: A person may sit with legs together, straight out in front of the body. Use a slow controlled motion to pull the toes back towards the torso. If they do this exercise properly, a person may feel the front of the shin tighten. Toe Raise: Balance with heels on the edge of a step, then pull the toes upwards and in towards the shins. They might know if they are doing this exercise right when they feel the front of the leg tighten. Heel Walking: Balance on the heels barefoot and walk around in circles or a figure eight for a set period of time. Start small with only 15-20 seconds then build up to a minute or more. To avoid getting shin splints, people starting a new activity should progress gradually, should not intensify their exercise too quickly and should thoroughly warm up before doing any sports. Wearing proper footwear that can provide enough support to the feet is important, especially for people with flat feet. Shoes should be replaced every 350 to 500 miles. Cross-train in sports such as swimming or cycling, which have a lower impact on the shins, to balance out workout.  Add strength training to workouts to develop the muscles that can prevent shin splints. Don’t overdo it. Runners, and athletes in general, have a habit of pushing through pain, but this could just cause more injury and keep them down for longer periods of time.  Poor foot mechanics and weak muscles tend to contribute to shin splints. In order to prevent it these people will need physiotherapy or wearing custom orthotics. Shin splints may often be treated with rest.  Using ice and compressing the area can help relieve the pain.  Stretching the lower leg muscles may make the shins feel better.  People with shin splint pain can also take anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to reduce pain If self-care measures don’t ease the pain, a doctor may be consulted for fractures and muscle tears. Individuals may make a gradual return to usual activity, after pain-free for two weeks; however, reports show that shin splints may take three to six months to heal completely. People who repeatedly get shin splints may benefit from rehabilitation, orthotics such as insoles, footpads, or heel inserts that help align and stabilize their foot and ankle."

Aggressive efforts to ''lose weight'' faster can damage your joints and reduce your muscle mass.''Here are four simple steps—which if followed religiously—can help you lose weight fast and at the same time help you achieve sustained ''weight loss'' too.''Cut back on ''sugar'' and carbohydrates:'' Sugars are present naturally in fruits. However, the added ''sugar'' in various food items causes sugar ''addiction''. It makes your brain crave more sweets all day, making you overeat. If you want to lose weight, added sugars should not make up more than 10% of your daily ''diet''. For example, if you eat 1800 calories a day, your sugar intake for the day should not exceed nine teaspoons. Added sugars are found in 75% of the packaged foods at the grocery store. Some of the various names that you can find written on the labels include:''Make it a habit to look for the ''nutrition'' section in the labels. If you know how much sugar is present in the packaged foods, you can limit your sugar intake accordingly. Sodas and some sports ''drinks'' contain a very high amount of sugar, so it is wise to substitute such sugary drinks with water to quench your ''thirst''.''Eat a high-protein, low-carb, healthy-fat ''diet'':'' This dietary pattern restricts the number of carbohydrates in your diet by substituting it with protein-rich food and limiting the intake of high-carb foods. The low-carb part can be followed in any of the two ways:''Very low carbohydrate (<10% carbohydrates) or 20-50 gm/day''Low carbohydrate (<26% carbohydrates) or less than <130 gm/day''You also have to limit your portion of refined carbohydrates:''Protein makes you feel full for a longer time and reduces your food cravings. Both of these factors promote ''weight loss''. Additionally, include healthy sources of fat, such as nuts, nut butter (e.g. peanut butter), avocado, olive-oil-based dressings, canola oil, and trans-fat-free margarine for baking.''Eat vegetables and fruits:'' Most fruits and vegetables are naturally low in fat and calories and are filling. You can reduce your calorie intake by substituting the high-calorie foods with fruits and vegetables. Additionally, some fruits and vegetables are also rich in antioxidants such as ''vitamin C'' (cantaloupe, orange, grapefruit, kiwi fruit, and cabbage) that play a role in weight loss.''Exercise'':'' Exercises and diet are no separate issues when it comes to weight loss. You can aim for weight loss with any of the two kinds of exercises:''If you want to lose weight, aim for at least three hours of moderate-intensity ''exercise'' in a week. If you follow a calorie-restricted diet and exercise, you can get away with a minimum dose of 150 minutes (2.5 hours) a week. High-intensity workouts make you lose weight fast.''Remember, fad diets and high-intensity exercises may not be suitable for everyone. Some fad diets may damage the ''heart'' or kidneys in the long run, whereas high-intensity exercises without adequate ''nutrition'' may make you emaciated and fatigued. Hence, it is advisable to discuss with your doctor and gym trainer regarding the most appropriate diet and workouts for you, particularly if you suffer from ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', or kidney problem.'

Cardio exercises: This can be in the form of fast walking, jogging, bicycling, or swimming. Any of these will do. When it comes to burning the most calories, go for cardiovascular exercises."
What is blood pressure?,"'Blood pressure is the force applied by the blood to the inner walls of the arteries. It shows minor fluctuations throughout the day—declining while relaxing and momentarily increasing while being excited or under ''stress''. An increase in the resting blood pressure can ''scar'', stiffen, or harden the arteries.' "
What is high blood pressure (hypertension)?,"'High blood pressure'' or ''hypertension'' is the silent killer that affects 80 million Americans. As many as 16 million Americans are unaware of the condition. Untreated ''hypertension'' can increase the risk of heart diseases or ''strokes''. High blood pressure occurs due to the tightening of very small blood vessels called arterioles. As a result, the heart has to pump harder to overcome the resistance in the narrowed blood vessel bed. This leads to elevated pressure inside the vessels.''High blood pressure is more likely to cause' High blood pressure or hypertension is when readings consistently range from 140 or higher for systolic or 90 or higher for diastolic. Blood pressure readings above 180/120 mmHg are dangerously high and require immediate medical attention. heart attack stroke heart failure vision loss kidney failure dementia erectile dysfunction weak bones"
What are the other ways to lower blood pressure?,"'Lifestyle changes are effective in controlling high blood pressure. A healthy lifestyle can avoid, delay, or reduce the need for blood pressure medications.''Here are some lifestyle changes that may help to lower blood pressure:''Weight loss'':'' ''Obesity'' can increase the risk of high blood pressure. ''Weight loss'' has been the most effective way of reducing blood pressure.\xa0''Daily exercises: ''Daily ''exercise'' is an excellent way to lose fat and reduce high blood pressure. Exercising daily for 30 minutes can bring down the blood pressure by about 5-8 mmHg.''Reduce sodium intake: ''Most Americans consume about 3,400 mg of sodium a day, whereas the recommended daily intake of sodium is 2,300 mg with an optimal limit of less than 1,500 mg for those with high blood pressure.''Eat healthy:'' Avoid foods that contain a high amount of sodium, saturated ''fats'', and ''cholesterol''. This approach to stop hypertension by dietary control is known as dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH).''Increase potassium intake:'' Add more potassium to the diet because it regulates the heart rate and nullifies the effect of sodium in the body. Potassium-rich foods include:''Abstain from heavy ''alcohol'' drinking:'' Alcohol in moderation does not do much harm to the body. Do not exceed one drink a day. Avoid binge drinking.''Quit smoking'':'' ''Cigarette smoking'' can increase blood pressure. Cutting down on ''smoking'' helps the blood pressure return to normal.\xa0''Avoid excess stress:'' Stress hormones or cortisol constrict the blood vessels and can lead to temporary spikes in blood pressure. Stress can also result in overeating, poor ''sleep'', and misusing ''drugs'' and alcohol.''Regular monitoring of blood pressure at home:'' Monitor blood pressure at home because it avoids unnecessary stress that may occur in a clinic setting.' Fruits such as bananas, melons, avocadoes, and apricots Green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale Vegetables such as potatoes and sweet potatoes Tuna and salmon Beans Nuts and seeds"
What is the normal range for blood triglycerides?,"'A standard blood ''cholesterol'' panel includes triglycerides, along with ''HDL'', LDL, and total ''cholesterol''. An advanced ''lipid'' test will include measurement of other particles that carry fat, including VLDL. Triglycerides are associated with VLDL, which are highly associated with ''atherosclerosis'' (""hardening"" of the arteries).''Optimally, levels of triglycerides should be less than 100 for ''prevention'' of ''vascular disease'' and optimal wellness. Standard laboratory ranges of ''triglyceride levels'' are shown below in a triglyceride level chart:''Triglycerides can be extremely elevated in some people. When triglycerides are over 500, you can see actually the ''fats'' in the serum when a tube of blood is drawn. Triglycerides over 300 can be caused by poor dietary habits, but sometimes people can eat very well and still have high triglycerides because of genetics. People with very elevated levels of triglycerides have trouble transporting other lipid particles (specifically VLDLs) out of the circulation. Anyone with triglycerides over 200 should definitely be doing something to lower triglyceride levels. People with triglycerides greater than 200 especially benefit from ''weight loss'' and increasing physical activity. The good news is that triglycerides are very responsive to lifestyle changes such as eating better, drinking less alcohol, and exercising more.' "
Can you lower triglycerides naturally without drugs?,"'Triglycerides can be lowered without ''drugs''. For example, they can be lowered naturally through ''diet'' changes, decreasing consumption of alcohol or sugary ''beverages'', by increasing physical activity, by losing weight, and other ways. As little as 5% to 10% reduction in body weight may lower triglycerides. The table below summarizes how much benefit different changes can effect.' "
Is there a special diet to lower triglyceride levels?,"'A general dietary pattern to lower triglycerides is the ''Mediterranean diet''. This ''diet'' is characterized by a low glycemic load, a high intake of healthy ''fats'' such as olive oil and ''fish oil'', and low intake of processed meats, saturated fats, and trans fats. This dietary pattern is low in total carbohydrates. The carbohydrates that are consumed are largely low in glycemic load – that is, they are largely unprocessed.''To lower triglycerides, some foods should be avoided. Decreasing animal fats (specifically saturated fat) decreases triglycerides and LDL directly. Trans fats, which are identified on food labels as hydrogenated fats and oils, should also be avoided. Decreasing refined carbohydrate (specifically ''sugar'', bread, and other processed foods made with flour and/or ''sugar'') can also help lower triglycerides. These simple sugars are high in ''mono''- and disaccharides, which raise triglyceride levels. Very low carbohydrate diets (less than 35g per day) are very efficient at lowering triglycerides. Fructose can also raise triglycerides; high fructose ''corn'' syrup should be avoided and fruit should be consumed in its whole form, not as juice. Reducing sugars is especially important when a person also has ''insulin resistance''. Added sugars should be no more than 5% of the diet.''Other foods can be added to the diet to reduce triglycerides. ''Cold'' water fish, which are rich in ''omega-3 fatty acids'', help lower triglycerides. Examples of ''omega-3'' rich fish include salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring, tuna, and halibut. Other foods that help lower triglycerides include ''fiber''-rich foods such as oats, flax meal, and beans. Olive oil, especially when substituted for animal fats like butter or lard, is another food that can help lower triglycerides.' "
Can you drink alcohol if you have high triglycerides?,"'There is a dose-dependent relationship between alcohol intake and triglyceride levels. The more a person ''drinks'', the higher their triglycerides. It is estimated that for every 1 oz/day of regular alcohol consumption, triglycerides increase by 5% to 10%. Heavy alcohol use is associated with very high triglycerides. It can also be associated with ''pancreatitis'' because of difficulty metabolizing alcohol and fats together in the liver. For people with very high triglycerides (over 250 mg/dL) abstaining from alcohol entirely may be recommended. For people who have questions about whether their amount of drinking is healthy, a self-assessment and information is available.' "
What vitamins and supplements help lower triglyceride levels?,"'Fish oil'' lowers triglycerides. The dose needed to reduce triglycerides is 1 to 4 grams of EPA/DHA per day. Four grams per day has been shown to reduce triglycerides by 25% to 30%. People with the highest triglycerides benefit most. It is worth noting that non-marine omega 3 fatty acids do not appear to lower triglycerides in the same way. The prescription form of synthetic ''omega-3 fatty acids'', Lovasa, Vascepa, or Epanova are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for people with triglycerides over 500 mg/dL.''Niacin'' is another supplement for lowering triglycerides. Both regular and extended release nicotinic acid have been shown to reduce triglycerides by up to 40% (at a dose of 1500 mg per day). ''Niacin'' has the added benefit of increasing ''HDL'' and lowering LDL. The high doses of niacin needed to lower triglycerides can cause uncomfortable flushing in some people. To avoid this, niacin can be taken with baby ''aspirin'', with food, or an extended release form of niacin/nicotinic acid (one in which the niacin is mixed with an edible wax such as carnauba wax). Inositol-hexanicotinate, marketed as no-''flush'' niacin, is NOT the same thing and contains very little nicotinic acid.''Fibers, such as chia, flax, psyllium or bran, help lower triglycerides. ''Fibrates'', a class of cholesterol-lowering ''drugs'' that have been used for decades, also have a triglyceride-lowering effect through the same general mechanisms.''Alpha lipoic acid, a dietary supplement antioxidant, also has triglyceride-lowering effects. Because alpha lipoic acid has other beneficial effects on overall ''cardiovascular'' and ''diabetes'' risk, this makes it a good option. Several studies have found that 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid is helpful for high triglycerides.''There are other ''supplements'' with limited research supporting their benefit in hypertriglyceridemia. Recent research has shown that ''probiotics'' may play a role in lowering triglycerides. Two ''lactobacillus'' species have been studied and found to lower triglycerides. Some research suggests l-carnitine can benefit triglyceride lowering as well.' "
What other lifestyle changes help lower triglycerides?,"'Lifestyle strategies are a way to lower triglycerides naturally. ''Weight loss'' has a positive effect on triglycerides. For every 5% to 10% weight reduction, triglycerides may be lowered by 20%. Another way to look at this: For every kilogram (2.2 lb) lost, triglycerides may be reduced by 2%.''Increasing physical activity lowers triglycerides. Aerobic activity of any kind, especially when done after a meal, uses up triglycerides that are in the blood ready to be used as fuel. This not only lowers triglycerides but also helps abdominal obesity. ''Exercise'' is most effective for lowering triglycerides when they are very elevated. If triglycerides are optimal (less than 100), ''exercise'' will not further lower the level.''All together, intensive lifestyle strategies can reduce triglycerides by 50% or more over a year. Lifestyle strategies can enable people to effectively reduce triglycerides without medicine or drugs, plus there are many other positive effects on other aspects of health and well-being. This is the recommended approach of the American ''Heart'' Association for anyone with triglycerides greater than optimal (greater than 100 mg/dL).' "
Can you lower triglycerides quickly?,"'It is entirely possible to lower triglycerides quickly. The quickest ways are to make lifestyle changes. A very low carbohydrate diet free from animal fats (a low-''sugar'', low glycemic load Mediterranean pattern) is most efficient. ''Exercise'' is also a quick way to lower triglycerides. ''Supplements'' can lower triglycerides over a period of several months.' "
Do high triglyceride levels affect HDL and LDL cholesterol levels?,"'Triglycerides are involved in the transport of fatty acids to muscles and tissues for energy. HDL particles are involved in the transport of excess fatty acids from the periphery back to the liver for elimination. Because of these competing roles, it is very difficult to increase HDL, the healthy good cholesterol, without first addressing triglycerides. HDL not only transports excess lipid to the liver for disposal, it transports cholesterol to organs such as the adrenals, ovaries, and testes for steroid hormone synthesis. Many of the strategies discussed here that lower triglycerides are also known to raise HDL.' "
How to recognize symptoms of suicidal behavior,"'People who contemplate ''suicide'' see it as a solution to run away from the problems that seem never-ending to them. If they get help in the form of counseling and emotional support at an earlier stage, they can be saved. Some of their words and actions can give you clues if they are at risk of hurting themselves.' "
How do you know if someone is at risk for suicide?,"'Any of the major life events can trigger a ''suicide'' attempt or put a person at risk for suicide. These include''People who want to kill themselves exhibit some warning signs, either through their words or actions. The more the warning signs, the greater the risk.''You can recognize ''suicidal'' behavior in a person if they talk about''Other changes in behavior or certain actions that you can look out for include' Loss of a loved one Considerable financial loss Major failure in career or exams Loss of job Unsuccessful attempts to get married Divorce or breakup Diagnosis of a major illness How they are experiencing unbearable pain How they feel that they have no solution to their problems Their feeling of being a burden to others Thoughts that they do not want to live anymore Their use of alcohol and drugs They keep searching for ways over the internet to end their life They start avoiding activities that they used to enjoy earlier They become less concerned about how they look They suddenly become calm after being depressed for a long time They start distancing themselves family and friends They start sleeping too much or too little They start visiting or calling people to say goodbye They make a legal will They start giving away their prized possessions They become aggressive and behave recklessly They look depressed all the time They get irritated easily They often get angry They look anxious often"
How do you prevent someone from committing suicide?,"'Sparing some of your time and confronting someone you know is thinking about suicide can save a life. Here are some ways of how you can prevent someone from committing suicide''If the above attempts do not work to reduce the suicidal thoughts of the person, you can call 911 or any of the following emergency numbers' Don't hesitate to approach the person who is depressed or thinking about suicide. Remember, your inquiry about thoughts of suicide does not provoke the person to commit suicide. Rather than convincing the person out of suicide, let him or her know how depression is temporary and can be treated. Ask the person if they are seeing a psychiatrist or mental therapist for their depression and suicidal thoughts. If not, you can encourage them to seek professional help. Ask the person often about their well-being and if they want to talk about anything. Studies suggest acknowledging and talking about suicide may help reduce suicidal thoughts. If you are always around that person, try to keep things that they can use to harm themselves away from them. Try to stay in touch with the person after they have been in a crisis or after being discharged from the hospital for any of their major illnesses or psychiatric conditions. The phone number of a trusted friend or relative of the person The non-emergency number for the local police department The Crisis Text Line: 741741 The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK (8255)"
What is a cornea?,"'The cornea is transparent and dome-shaped that covers the front of the eye and protects the pupil, ''iris'', and eye chamber. The cornea plays a key role in a patient’s vision quality and optical health. The cornea works with the lens and anterior chamber of the eye to focus light that helps you see clearly.\xa0' "
How is a contact lens useful?,"'Contact lenses are medical devices worn directly on the cornea of the eye. Contacts provide a safe and effective way to correct vision when used with care and proper supervision. They can offer a good alternative to ''eyeglasses'"", depending on the eyes, age, and lifestyle. A contact lens is usually helpful in correcting refractive errors, and it performs the function by adding or subtracting focusing power to the eye's cornea and lens.""'The following are the conditions in which contact lenses may be considered helpful:\xa0' Myopia (nearsightedness) Hyperopia (farsightedness) Astigmatism (distorted vision) Presbyopia (age-related change in the eye’s ability to focus to see near objects )"
Is it harmful to remove a contact lens using the pinching method?,"""Few people don't slide the lens down, but they just pinch it right off the cornea. This can be done as long as they are confident and gentle. However, the pinching method to remove the lens is not usually recommended to everyone because it may scratch the cornea and cause visual discomfort or impairment."" "
What are the common precautions that should be taken before removing the contact lens?,"'Before handling or removing the contact lens, a person may need to follow a few precautions that include:' Hands need to be clean (use soap or alcohol-based sanitizer) Dry the cleaned hands and fingers thoroughly Decide which hand to use for removing the lens and which eye to start with; preferably, the dominant hand is recommended Always start with the same eye, which makes it harder to mix up right and left lenses. Get comfortable with a mirror in front of you; a magnifying mirror may be helpful Be patient; do not rush while trying to remove lenses If the lens does not come out the first time, or the second, do not panic; stop, take a deep breath, walk away for a few minutes, and try again Practice wearing and removing the lens often till you become confident If the lens seems to be sticking to the eye, take a professional help rather than injuring the eye in the process"
How to remove a contact lens that is stuck in the eye?,"'The most common problem with removing contact lenses is it may get stuck on the eye. This is usually caused due to ''dry eyes''. Below are a few tips to remove contact lens that may have stuck in the eye:' Apply some lubricating drops into the eye Close the eye and move the eyeball in all directions to loosen the lens Try using more drops and blink a lot after the drops have been applied Once the lens is freed, it may be removed with the sliding method Use prescribed eye drops regularly to prevent dry eyes"
What causes coughing?,"'A ''cough'' is a reflex that helps clear your airways of irritants. Nerves in the airways become stimulated by allergens, medical conditions, medications, and other irritants, resulting in a forceful expulsion of air from the ''lungs''.''There are numerous causes for ''coughing''. Common causes of ''cough'' include:''Allergens''Irritants''Medical conditions''Medications:'' ''ACE inhitors''\xa0and\xa0''beta blockers''.''A ''dry ''cough'' ''is usually the result of''A ''wet ''cough'' is often caused by ''cold'' or flu ''viruses'', or ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'').''A ''persistent, or chronic'', cough is one that lasts more than 3 weeks and may be caused by'   pollen, dust, animal dander, and mold. smoking, inhaling secondhand smoke, pollution, chemical fumes, perfumes, and air fresheners. common cold, upper respiratory tract infection, flu, pneumonia, whooping cough, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sinus infections, postnasal drip, acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and heart failure. cold and flu viruses, allergies, acid reflux, ACE inhibitor medications, and irritants such as cigarette smoke. heart disease, asthma, lung disease, bronchitis, and whooping cough."
19 natrual and home remedies to cure and soothe a cough,"'Once the cause of your cough is diagnosed and you have ruled out any serious underlying medical conditions that need to be treated, symptoms of cough often may be treated or cured with home remedies. ''Talk to your doctor before using any herbal remedies or natural ''supplements'' as some may interact with medications you take.'   Stay hydrated: Drink lots of water to thin mucus. Inhale steam: Take a hot shower, or boil water and pour into a bowl, face the bowl (stay at least 1 foot away), place a towel over the back of your head to form a tent and inhale. Stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Note: do not do this if cough is due to asthma, as steam may make symptoms worse. Use a humidifier to loosen mucus. Cough drops or lozenges soothe an irritated throat (do not use in young children). Saltwater gargle clears mucus from the throat. Use an extra pillow to elevate your head at night. Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Avoid inhaled irritants such as dust, perfumes, or pollutants. Use honey. It can be used alone in adults and children over 1 year of age, and acts as a cough suppressant. Ginger tea soothes throat inflammation. Eucalyptus oil: Use it in a vaporizer or rub on your chest to help break up mucus. Mint: Often taken as a tea, it helps loosen mucus in the lungs. Menthol is commonly found in lozenges, and it can soothe a cough. Licorice root acts as an expectorant. Slippery elm coats and soothes the throat. Apple cider vinegar (diluted or mixed with honey) helps thin mucus. Turmeric may help ease digestive problems and can help if cough is caused by GERD. Chicken soup may ease symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Chocolate. And because we saved the best for last...save some  chocolate! Theobromide, and ingredient in chocolate, may actually suppress vagus nerve activity that causes coughing."
What over-the-counter (OTC) products cure and soothe a cough?,"'There are a number of ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) cough medicines available to soothe or cure ''coughs''. There are two main types of cough medicines, 1) cough suppressants, and 2) expectorants. These can be found in tablet or cough syrup form.'   Cough suppressants, also called antitussives, block the cough reflex to relieve cough. A common OTC cough suppressant is dextromethorphan, which can be found in products such asTriaminic Cold and Cough,Robitussin Cough,Delsym, andVicks 44 Cough and Cold. Triaminic Cold and Cough, Robitussin Cough, Delsym, and Vicks 44 Cough and Cold. Expectorants work by thinning mucus. The only OTC expectorant is guaifenesin, found in products such as Mucinex and Robitussin Chest Congestion. Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin are often found in combination products, for example, combined with each other in Robitussin DM. These medications also may be combined with other medicines that help relieve other symptoms of colds such as pain relievers, decongestants, or antihistamines. If your main symptom is cough, it usually is best to avoid products that contain antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or decongestants, such as ephedrine (Sudafed) because these have a drying effect, making mucus thicker and harder to clear from your airways, which can worsen cough symptoms. For cough due to postnasal drip, decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may improve symptoms. Cough that is a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be helped byfamotidine (Pepcid),cimetidine (Tagamet),ranitidine (Zantac)omeprazole (Prilosec OTC),lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid 24-Hour), andesomeprazole (Nexium). famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac) omeprazole (Prilosec OTC), lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid 24-Hour), and esomeprazole (Nexium)."
What prescription drugs cure a cough?,"'When cough is severe, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications and home remedies may not be enough to relieve symptoms, and prescriptions may be needed.''Your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internal medicine specialist, or pediatrician may diagnose and treat a cough. If cough is severe an ''emergency medicine'"" specialist may see you in a hospital's emergency department."" Codeine and other narcotic medications are often prescribed as effective cough suppressants. Many times these are combined with the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, or the expectorant guaifenesin. If cough is due to whooping cough, bacterial pneumonia, complicated bronchitis, or sinusitis it is usually treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporins, or azithromycin (Zithromax). For cough due to allergies, such as hay fever, inhaled nasal steroids may be prescribed. For postnasal drip that does not respond to OTC drugs, nasal inhalers such as ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) can help. If cough is a result of asthma, prescription inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids help decrease inflammation of the airways. Short-term oral steroids, which help reduce inflammation, are sometimes prescribed to relieve chronic cough. When gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes a cough, prescription medications that may help symptoms include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), for exampleomeprazole (Prilosec),rabeprazole (Aciphex), andpantoprazole (Protonix). omeprazole (Prilosec), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and pantoprazole (Protonix). People suffering from chronic or persistent cough may be referred to different specialists depending on the underlying cause. If you have allergies, you may be referred to an allergist. If your cough is due to gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) you may be referred to a gastroenterologist, who specializes in diseases of the digestive tract. If you have lung disease you may need to see a pulmonologist, a lung specialist who treats diseases of the airways. If your cough is due to an underlying heart condition, you will be referred to a cardiologist, a specialist in diseases of the heart and circulatory system."
How can you get rid of a nighttime cough?,"'Many times cough symptoms will worsen at night. This may be due to postnasal drip (from a cold, ''bronchitis'', or ''allergies'') or acid from the stomach backing up into your throat from ''acid reflux''. There are some strategies and home remedies you can use to help ease nighttime cough:'   Use extra pillows for postnasal drip or if you have acid reflux to prop up the head of your bed. When you lay flat, the mucus or acid reflux irritates your throat. Raising your head allows it to drain. Take a steamy shower before bed (note: if your cough is due to asthma, steam may make it worse). Use a humidifier. Moist air can help relieve cough. However, if cough is due to allergies such as dust mites or mold, which thrive in damp air, be careful not to make the room too moist. Keep your bedding clean. If your cough is due to allergies, it is important to make sure dust mites don't have a place to sleep as well. Wash all bedding at least weekly in hot water, and dry in a dryer, not a clothesline. Drink decaffeinated tea with honey before bed. The warmth of the tea will soothe a sore throat and the fluid will help thin secretions. Herbal teas with ginger, peppermint, or licorice root may also soothe cough. Use a vapor rub, such as one with menthol, to help open airways. Keep everything you need near your bed. If you have a cough, make sure you keep your cough medicine, lozenges, a glass of water, or anything else that helps you, on your nightstand for immediate relief. Don't smoke. Avoid using perfume, air freshener sprays, or other irritants in the bedroom. Try (OTC) cough medicines that contain cough suppressants (which block the cough reflex) or expectorants (which loosen mucus). Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a recommendation."
When should you see a doctor for a cough?,"'Cough often is not serious, but in some situations you should see a doctor and not try to treat the cough on your own. If you have a cough and the following symptoms, see your doctor:''These signs and symptoms in addition to cough may indicate a more serious condition that needs treatment by a doctor.' Fever higher than 101 F/38.3 C Coughing up blood Coughing up yellow or green phlegm Shortness of breath Difficulty swallowing Loss of appetite Weight loss Excessive production of mucus Chest pain that is not a result of the cough Wheezing Fatigue Weakness Night sweats Your cough is getting worse when you should be getting better If you know you have been exposed to the flu, whooping cough, or other infections"
What are the signs and symptoms of snoring?,"'Snoring can be a symptom of common conditions such as ''allergies'' or ''asthma''. But it also can be a symptom of a serious medical condition called ''obstructive sleep apnea'' in which a person stops ''breathing'' intermittently during ''sleep''. A person with ''sleep apnea'' may snore loudly or make choking noises as they try to breathe. The body becomes deprived of oxygen, and a person may wake up from it. When severe, this can happen hundreds of times during the night or when sleeping at other times during the day. ''Sleep apnea'' is associated with a higher risk for' high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, obesity, and type 2 diabetes."
How can I get my partner to stop snoring?,"""If you're living with someone who snores, the first step is making sure they know they snore (if they are not awakened by their own snoring they may not be aware of it). Next encourage them to visit a doctor to diagnose and treat the underlying cause. You also can help your partner track their snoring habits if the doctor needs a sleep journal. They may try some of the home remedies mentioned previously to stop snoring. ""'In the meantime, sharing a bed with a snorer can be exhausting. To take care of yourself: '  Use earplugs Try a white noise machine Try going to bed before your partner – 
if you're already asleep maybe you won't hear them Consider sleeping in separate bedrooms. 
This is often a last resort and a personal decision for partners."
What kinds of doctors treat snoring?,"""Many kinds of doctors treat snoring, depending on the underlying cause. You may first consult your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or internist, or a child's pediatrician. ""'For further testing and management of snoring or ''sleep disorders'' such as sleep apnea you may be referred to a sleep medicine specialist. ''Allergies'' may be treated by an allergist, and ''asthma'' may be treated by a lung specialist (''pulmonologist'') or respiratory therapist. If you have nasal deformities such as a ''deviated septum'' or nasal polyps you may see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT, or otolaryngologist), and if you require removal of your ''tonsils'' or adenoids you may be referred to a general surgeon. ''Sometimes an oral appliance is helpful to help stop the snoring. This may be fitted by a dentist. ' "
What is the diagnosis of snoring?,"'The diagnosis of the underlying cause of snoring will depend on the symptoms and the suspected reason for the snoring. The doctor will start by asking about ''allergies'', medications, and whether you drink alcohol or smoke. The mouth, nose, and throat will be examined to see if there are any physical deformities that may be the cause of the snoring.''If sleep apnea is suspected, you may be asked about whether you wake up gasping for breath, if you fall asleep during the day, if your partner notices you snore loudly or stop ''breathing'' while you sleep, and if your sleep is not refreshing. You may need to keep a diary of your sleep habits and snoring.''A sleep study may be necessary to monitor your sleep patterns and diagnose whether you have sleep apnea or any other sleep disorder.' "
What natural home remedies help a person stop snoring?,"'Once you have ruled out sleep apnea as the cause of your snoring, the next step is figuring out how to stop snoring. There are some home remedies and behavior changes that may help reduce or eliminate snoring:' Lose weight. Don't sleep on your back. Avoid alcohol. Don't take muscle relaxants (talk to your doctor before stopping any prescription medication, and ask about alternatives). Quit smoking. Try an anti-snoring pillow. Use nasal strips to open nasal passages. Take a hot shower before bed to open the sinuses. Change sheets frequently if allergies cause snoring (vacuum and dust regularly too.) Use a humidifier or vaporizer. Throat exercises Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Antisnoring apps: For those who love technology, there are several anti-snoring apps available. Download these anti-snoring solutions them onto your phone or tablet, to figure out ways to stop snoring. These apps can help record your snoring, analyze your sleep, and even play a sound to awaken you when they detect a snore."
What anti-snoring aids and devices help stop snoring?,"'When snoring is caused by obstructive sleep apnea, a ''CPAP'' (Continuous Positive ''Airway'' Pressure) is often prescribed. This machine uses air pressure to keep the airways open while you sleep so you do not stop breathing, and it is an effective non-surgical treatment for sleep apnea. There are a few variations of ''CPAP'' devices:''An anti-snoring mouthpiece may be a viable treatment for snoring. Many people snore because airflow as you breathe causes the tissues in the back of your throat to vibrate. Anti-snoring aids such as mouthpieces (also called mouth guards or night guards) help bring the jaw forward to widen the back of the airway, allowing air to pass through without resistance, stopping snoring. Sometimes, these mouthpieces can stop snoring immediately, the first time they are used. There are two main types of anti-snoring mouthpieces: ''A chinstrap will not help reduce snoring.'' A study by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that a chinstrap does not improve sleep disordered breathing and is ineffective in improving snoring.'  Nasal CPAP mask: This covers the nose 
only and is the most common type of CPAP. This type works best for those who 
breathe from their nose and they can operate with higher air pressure settings. 
	It is not good for mouth breathers or those who have allergies or sinus issues.
	 Nasal pillow: These are small prongs 
that insert directly into the nostrils. It is smaller and may be more 
comfortable for some people. It's also good for those with a lot of facial hair 
who cannot get a good seal on a standard CPAP mask, or for those who feel 
claustrophobic with a mask covering their face. They may cause nasal dryness and 
	nosebleeds, or pressure ulcers in the nostrils, and can be less comfortable with 
higher-pressure airflow.  Full face CPAP mask: This covers the 
entire nose and mouth and has side straps to keep the mask in place. It works 
best for those who require high pressure air flow, and prevents air leakage for 
those who sleep on their backs. It is not optimal for stomach sleepers, and can 
be difficult to wear glasses, watch TV, or read while wearing it.  Tongue Stabilizing Devices (TSD) work 
by sucking the tongue forward or downward, increasing the opening at the back of 
the throat, helping to decrease the amount of tissue that can vibrate. Some 
people find them uncomfortable and they may cause increased salivation.  Mandibular Advancing Devices (MAD), 
also called Jaw Advancing Device (JAD) work by moving the lower jaw forward to 
open up the back of your throat and let air pass through more freely. They also 
move the tongue forward. They may cause some discomfort or shifting of your 
	teeth. 
	"
What foods or drinks may help a person stop snoring?,"""It's important to avoid foods that may trigger or increase snoring. For example, if you have ""'food allergies'', avoid these foods as they may cause inflammation in your mouth and throat, restricting the airway and leading to snoring. Alcohol is a relaxant, and it relaxes the muscles in the back of the throat, which can increase the blockage of the throat and make it harder for air to pass through. Foods you might try to help reduce snoring include:'  Non-dairy milk: Dairy can cause some people to have increased mucus, so plant-based milk will help avoid this problem (for example almond or soy milk). Hot tea: If you have a cold or sinus congestion that causes your snoring, hot beverages such as tea (with a little honey) can be soothing. Turmeric: This spice is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Fruit and vegetables: These are full of antioxidants and fiber, and can help you lose weight. Peppermint: Stick with the oil (not the candy) for anti-inflammatory benefits. Horseradish: It can help dry excess mucus. Water: Stay hydrated."
What medical treatments help a person to quit snoring?,"'Medical treatments for snoring include assistive breathing devices such as the CPAP. Sometimes, surgery may be required. If snoring is due to a deviated septum, nasal polyps or other nasal deformities, surgery can correct these problems. Surgery also can reduce bulky tissue in the throat or alter bone structure to reduce or cure your snoring. Types of surgery that may be performed to cure causes of snoring include: ' Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy to 
remove enlarged tonsils and/or adenoids Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) which 
thins and tightens tissue in the throat Thermal ablation palatoplasty (TAP) 
uses radio waves to shrink throat tissues Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty 
(LAUP) uses a laser to shorten the uvula Palatal implants (also called the 
Pillar procedure) involves insertion of implants into the soft palate to help 
stiffen the soft tissue and reduce vibration Somnoplasty uses radiofrequency heat 
energy to remove or stiffen tissues of the uvula and soft palate so they don't 
vibrate"
Can snoring be prevented?,"'Snoring can be prevented by preventing the underlying cause. ' If you are overweight, lose weight. If you have allergies, change sheets 
frequently and keep your bedroom vacuumed and dusted, and take 
doctor-recommended allergy treatments. Don't smoke. Avoid alcohol. Don't take muscle relaxants or 
medications that make you snore. Ask your doctor for alternatives. Never stop 
taking prescribed medication without talking to your doctor first. Sleep on your side."
What are genital warts (HPV infection)? Who gets them?,"'HPV infection (genital warts) is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD, ''sexually transmitted infection'', ''STI'') in the U.S. About 75% of the men and women of reproductive age has been infected with sexually transmitted genital warts at some point. Approximately 6 million people become infected with HPV every year in the US, and approximately 50% of those infected are between the ages of 15 and 25.'""HPV infection is common and does not usually lead to the development of warts, cancers, or even symptoms. In fact, the majority of people infected with HPV have no symptoms or lesions at all. Determination of whether or not a person is infected with HPV involves tests that identify the genetic material (DNA) of the virus. Moreover, it has not been definitely established whether the body's immune system is able to permanently clear the body of an HPV infection. Many people will test positive for HPV infection, and then have negative HPV tests for months to years, only to have a positive test result later. Currently, it is unclear if this is due to a latent (continuing but hidden) viral infection or if the person has become re-infected with the virus.""'Asymptomatic people infected with HPVs (those without HPV-induced warts or lesions) are still able to spread the infections to others through sexual contact.''It is important to note that in the U.S. and other developed countries, screening and early treatment of precancerous changes of the cervix have dramatically reduced the incidence of ''cervical cancer''. In developing countries lacking the medical infrastructure or financial means to implement a screening program, the incidence of cervical ''cancer'' resulting from HPV infection is much higher. In fact, cervical ''cancer'' develops in around 500,000 women each year worldwide, and, in many countries, it is the most common cause of cancer deaths.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of genital warts in women?,"'Women who have genital warts inside the vagina may experience symptoms such as bleeding following sexual intercourse or an abnormal ''vaginal discharge''. Rarely, bleeding or urinary obstruction may occur if the wart involves the urethral opening.'  Genital warts appear as raised, flesh-colored lumps or bumps. They may have a corrugated (cauliflower-like) appearance. Many women with genital warts have no symptoms, but sometimes they may occur at the location of the warts, and include:ItchingBurningTenderness Itching Burning Tenderness Size of the warts may vary, and multiple warts may be present at the same time. They may appear anywhere on body surfaces that are exposed in sexual contact, including the vulva, vagina, cervix, or groin in women and the penis, scrotum, thigh, or groin in males."
Are genital warts painful?,"'Usually, genital warts are not painful, although they may be associated with itching, tenderness or burning at the site of the wart.' "
What is the incubation period for genital warts?,"'The time between exposure or infection with HPV and the development of genital warts is very variable. Because most people who have the infection do not have any symptoms and do not develop warts, it is not possible to determine when the warts will arise after infection. Warts may appear days, months, or even years after the infection has been aquired.' "
How do you get genital warts (HPV infection) and What Are HPV Types?," Over 100 types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect humans. Of these, more than 40 types can infect the genital tract and anus (anogenital tract) of men and women. Sometimes, they cause genital lesions known as condylomata acuminata or venereal warts. A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead to precancerous changes in the uterine cervix and cervical cancer. HPV infection is also associated with the development of other anogenital cancers. The HPV types that cause cervical cancer have been linked with both anal and penile cancer in men as well as a subgroup of head and neck (oropharyngeal) cancers in both women and men. Genital warts and HPV infection are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partner's increases. The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also cause infection. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such as genital warts are termed ""low-risk"" HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found most commonly in cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called ""high-risk"" group of HPVs. Other HPV types infect the skin and cause common warts elsewhere on the body. Some types of HPVs (for example, HPV 5 and 8) frequently cause skin cancers in people who have a condition known as epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). The HPV infection is spread through skin-to-skin contact including sexual intercouse."
Is there a vaccine for genital warts and HPV infection?,"'A ''vaccine'' is available against common HPV types associated with the development of genital warts and cervical and anogenital carcinomas.' This vaccine (Gardasil 9) has received FDA approval for use in females and males aged 9 through 45. It confers immunity against 9 HPV types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. An earlier version of this vaccine (Gardasil) was directed at four common HPV types (6, 11, 16, and 18). Another vaccine directed at HPV types 16 and 18, known as Cervarix, was approved for use in females aged 10 to 15, but was withdrawn from the market in 2016 due to low demand."
Is there a treatment or cure for genital warts? Can they be removed or cured?,"'No treatment will cure genital warts or HPV infection. The only treatment is to remove the lesions caused by the virus. Unfortunately, even removal of the warts does not necessarily prevent the spread of the virus, and genital warts frequently recur. None of the available treatment options is ideal or clearly superior to others.''Available treatments for genital warts lesions, signs, and symptoms include:'  A 0.5% solution or gel of podofilox (Condylox). Alternatively, a 5% cream of imiquimod (Aldara), which is a substance that stimulates the body's production of cytokines, chemicals that direct and strengthen the immune response). Only an experienced doctor can perform some of the treatments for genital warts. These include, for example, placing a small amount of a 10% to 25% solution of podophyllin resin on the lesions, and then, after a period of hours, washing off the podophyllin. The treatments are repeated weekly until the genital warts are gone. An 80% to 90% solution of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloracetic acid (BCA) can also be applied weekly by a doctor to the lesions. Injection of 5-flurouracil epinephrine gel into the lesions has also been shown to be effective in treating genital warts. Interferon alpha, a substance that stimulates the body's immune response, has also been used in the treatment of genital warts. Alternative methods include cryotherapy (freezing the genital warts with liquid nitrogen) or laser surgery. Laser surgery and surgical excision both require a local or general anesthetic, depending upon the extent of the lesions. It is important to note that you should not use home remedies or treatments for common skin warts on genital warts."
What happens if genital warts aren't treated?," In some people, genital warts may go away in their own within months to a few years. In other cases they may persist if not removed and may grow larger and form clusters. Even removal is not a guarantee that the warts will not return at some point."
What if a woman has precancerous changes (dysplasia) of the cervix? Can genital warts cause cancer?,"'Women who have evidence of moderate or severe precancerous changes in the uterine cervix require treatment to ensure that these cells do not progress to cancer. In this case, treatment usually involves surgical removal or destruction of the involved tissue.' Conization is a procedure that removes the precancerous area of the cervix using a knife, a laser, or by a procedure known as LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure, which uses an electric current passing through a thin wire that acts as a knife). LEEP is also referred to as LLETZ (large loop excision of the transformation zone). Cryotherapy (freezing) or laser therapy may also be used to destroy tissue areas that contain potentially precancerous changes."
Will birth control protect against genital warts or HPV infection?," Abstinence from sexual activity can prevent the spread of HPVs that are transmitted via sexual contact. A person who abstains from sex may still become infected with other HPV types, such as those that cause common skin warts. Some researchers have postulated that HPV infection might be transmitted from the mother to her infant at the time of delivery because some studies have identified genital HPV infection in populations of young children and cloistered nuns. Hand-genital and oral-genital transmission of HPV has also been documented and is another means of transmission. HPV usually is transmitted by direct genital contact during sexual activity. The virus is not found in or spread by bodily fluids, and HPV is not found in blood or organs harvested for transplantation. Condom use seems to decrease the risk of transmission of HPV during sexual activity, but it does not completely prevent HPV infection. Spermicides and hormonal birth control methods cannot prevent the spread of HPV infection."
What do you do if you have been exposed to genital warts (HPV infection)?,"'Both people with HPV infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading HPV and the appearance of the lesions. They should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that condoms are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. It is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity.'""Finally, female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular Pap smears to screen for cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix, as precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer. Similarly, men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers, although it is not yet been determined how to optimally screen for or manage early ""'anal cancer''.' "
Is there a test to diagnose genital warts?,"'HPV sometimes can be suspected by changes that appear on a ''Pap smear'', since pap smears identify infected abnormal cells that may be precursors to cancer. HPV infection can lead to precancerous changes in the cervix that are recognized on a Pap smear. If a woman has an abnormal Pap smear, more advanced tests may be performed. HPV also can be seen on biopsy (for example, from a ''genital wart'' or from the uterine cervix).' "
Is there a DNA test for types of HPV infection?," In 2009, the U.S. FDA approved the first DNA tests for diagnosis of the common cancer-causing HPV types in cervical samples. Two tests known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR, are used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with cancer. These are HPV types 16 and 18, as well as other ""high risk"" or cancer-associated HPV types. These tests do not replace standard Pap testing or clinical examination, and they are used in combination with traditional screening methods to help estimate a woman's risk and aid in management decisions."

HPV Virus (Genital Warts ) in Men Introduction,"'Much of the information about ''HPV'' virus (human papillomavirus) centers on women, since having the virus increases their risk of getting ''cervical cancer''. But ''HPV'"" virus in men can cause health problems, too. So it's important for men to understand how to reduce the risks of HPV infection.""""It can increase a man's risk of getting genital ""'cancers'', although these cancers are not common. HPV can also cause ''genital warts'' in men, just as in women. ''More than half of men who are sexually active in the United States will have HPV at some time in their life. Often, a man will clear the virus on his own, with no health problems. ' "
Risks of HPV Virus in Men,"'Some of the 30 or so types of HPV associated with genital cancers can lead to ''cancer of the anus'' or penis in men. Both of these ''cancer'' types are rare. In those with a healthy immune system, they are even rarer. About 1,530 men in the U.S. were diagnosed with ''cancer of the penis'' in 2006, according to American ''Cancer'' Society estimates. About 1,910 men got a diagnosis of ''anal cancer''. ''The risk of ''anal cancer'' is about 17 times higher in sexually active gay and bisexual men than in men who have sex only with women. Men who have ''HIV'' (human immunodeficiency virus) are also at higher risk of getting this ''cancer''. ''Other types of HPV virus rarely cause cancer in men, but they do cause ''genital warts''. At a given point in time, about 1% of sexually active men in the U.S. will have genital ''warts''. ' "
Male HPV: The Symptoms,'The types of high-risk HPV that can cause cancer rarely present any symptoms in men or in women. Genital ''warts'' are the first symptom you may see with low-risk HPV ''strains'' that cause warts but not cancer.' 
Tests for HPV Virus in Men,"""To diagnose genital warts in men, the doctor will visually check a man's genital area to see if warts are present. Some doctors will apply a vinegar solution to help identify warts that aren't raised and visible. But the test is not foolproof. Sometimes normal skin is mistakenly identified as a wart. ""'There is no routine test for men to check for high-risk HPV strains that can cause cancer. However, some doctors are urging anal Pap tests for gay and bisexual men, who are at higher risk of anal cancer caused by HPV. In an anal ''Pap test'', the doctor collects cells from the anus, and then has them checked for abnormalities in a lab. ' "
Treatments for HPV,"'There is no treatment for asymptomatic HPV infection. Instead, doctors treat the health problems that are caused by the HPV virus.''When genital warts appear, a variety of treatments can be used. The patient can apply prescription creams at home. Or a doctor can surgically remove or freeze off the warts. ''Early treatment of warts is discouraged by some doctors because genital warts can go away on their own. It can also take time for all warts to appear. So a person who treats warts as soon as they appear may need another treatment later on. ''Anal cancer can be treated with ''radiation'', ''chemotherapy'', and surgery. The specific treatments depend on the stage of cancer - how big the ''tumor'' is and how far the cancer has spread. ' "
HPV Vaccine for Men?,"'The ''HPV vaccine'' ''Gardasil'', approved for use in women in 2006, is not yet approved for men. ''Studies are still being done to determine if the ''vaccine'' works in males. Eventually, public health experts say, boys and men may be vaccinated. ' "
How to Manage HPV in a Relationship,"""If a man's long-term sexual partner has HPV, chances are good HPV transmission has already occurred and he also has it. HPV in men may clear from the body more easily than in women. Women, in general, often clear the virus in two years or less. ""'The HPV types associated with ''cervical cancer'' usually do not cause health problems for a heterosexual man having sex with an HPV-infected woman. ''If a partner has HPV, it does not necessarily mean they have had sex with someone else recently. The virus can lay dormant in the body for years without causing noticeable symptoms. ' "
How to Prevent Transmission of HPV,"'Abstinence is the only sure way to prevent HPV transmission. Risk of transmission can be lowered if a person has sex only with one person who is not infected and who is monogamous. ''To lower the risk of HPV transmission, men can also limit the number of sex partners and pick partners who have had few or no partners in the past. ''Condoms'"" can provide some protection against HPV transmission. But they aren't 100% effective, since HPV is transmitted primarily by skin-to-skin contact. The virus can still infect the skin uncovered by the ""'condom''. ''In a recent study of young women who had just become sexually active, those whose partners used a condom each time they had sex were 70% less likely to get an HPV infection than were women whose partners used a condom less than 5% of the time.''WebMD Medical Reference''SOURCES: Joel Palefsky, MD, professor of medicine, University of California, San Francisco.

What causes HPV in men?,"'Human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'') is a sexually transmitted virus that infects half of the young adults aged 15-24 years each year in the United States. In general, genital (penis, scrotum) ''HPV'' infection has increased significantly over the past decades.''HPV infection is caused when the HPV gets transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person through oral, vaginal, or anal sex. However, HPV infection can also spread through close genital contact (even without having sex). It can be passed even when an infected person shows no signs or symptoms.''Having multiple sexual partners increases men’s chances of getting an HPV infection.''Those people who have a weak immune system (including those with ''HIV/AIDS'') may be less equipped to fight off the HPV.' "
What are the symptoms of HPV in men?,"'The clinical history and presentation of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection vary according to the affected/infected part (genital, anus, mouth, or throat).''HPV may cause ''warts'' on the body or genitals, depending on the contact with the infected person.''HPV genital infection appears in the form of a small bump or group of ''bumps'', known as ''warts'', on the genital or anal area. These warts can be small or big, raised or flat, or shaped like a cauliflower. However, many people do not exhibit any signs and symptoms when they get infected with HPV. Often, the infection improves without medical treatment.''However, in some people, the infection does not go away and may cause diseases like ''cancer''. The HPV can cause ''cancer of the cervix'' (mouth of the uterus), penis, anus, and throat.' "
What tests help diagnose HPV in men?,"'There are around 100 types of HPV and around 40 types are sexually transmitted. There are tests to detect some of them. If your doctor says that you have ''genital warts'', this means you have an HPV infection, but there are no such tests to confirm it. Also, the type of HPV that causes ''cancer'' is different from the one that causes infection.' "
What is the treatment of HPV in men?,"'There is no single curative treatment for anal and genital (anogenital) warts caused by HPV.''Generally, treatment aims to eliminate as many visible warts until the patient’s immunity becomes strong enough to let warts disappear on their own.''The treatment of most HPV infections involves directly eradicating warts through any of the treatments that include:''These treatments usually need to be done in multiple sessions over several weeks or months.''HPV induced ''cancers'' can be treated if diagnosed at an early stage. A doctor can diagnose them and suggest the most appropriate therapy.' Surgical excision (surgical removal of warts) Chemical ablation (application of a chemical, such as Trichloroacetic acid or TCA that burns warts) Cryotherapy (application of liquid Nitrogen to freeze warts and destroy them)"
How can HPV be prevented in men?,"'Several things can help prevent HPV in men. These include:' Getting HPV vaccination: In most young people (between the age of 9 and 26), HPV can be prevented by getting an HPV vaccine, which is safe and effective. Using condoms: Avoiding direct contact with the virus is the only way to prevent HPV infection. Hence, using latex condoms rightly is an important step that men can take to prevent themselves from getting an HPV infection. It must be remembered that even though condoms reduce the chances of HPV infection, it does not eliminate the risk completely. Staying in a mutually monogamous sexual relationship: Men should have a single sexual partner, who only has sex with them."
Facts and definition of HPV,"  Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) infect human skin and mucous membranes. Certain HPV types, known as high-risk HPV types, are known to cause cervical cancer and other cancers including cancers of the penis, anus, vagina, vulva, and oral cavity. Other HPV types cause genital warts or warts elsewhere on the body. HPV is highly contagious and is spread through close contact, including sexual contact. It is estimated that most sexually active people will become infected with HPV at some point. HPV infection typically does not cause signs or symptoms. In most cases, HPV infection goes away on its own, without long-term problems. Vaccines are available (for example, Gardasil and Gardasil 9) to prevent infection with the most common cancer-causing HPV types and the types that are most likely to cause genital warts. There is no specific treatment that can cure HPV infection, although treatments are available for warts and cancers caused by HPV. Condoms also help prevent the HPV spread."
What is HPV (human papillomavirus)?,"'The human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of over 100 virus types that infect human skin and ''mucus'' membranes.' Most people with HPV never know they are infected and never develop any problems, signs, or symptoms related to the infection, which usually goes away on its own. In fact, HPV infection is so common, it is estimated that most sexually active men and women get the infection at some point in their lives. However, certain types of HPVs may cause health problems in some people. For example, some HPV types cause genital warts and cervical cancers, while others cause typical skin warts. Not every infection with HPV results in health problems, or even produces signs and symptoms. Cancers caused by HPV typically take many years, even decades, to develop."
Is HPV an STD?," Because HPV infection is spread through sexual intercourse, it is classified as a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) or sexually-transmitted infection (STI). HPV is the most common STD and is thought to affect most people at some point in life."
Who gets infected with HPV?,'HPV infection is extremely common. It is estimated that all sexually active men and women acquire an HPV infection at some point in life.' 
Is HPV contagious? How do you get HPV?,"'Yes, HPV is highly ''contagious''. This means that ''common warts'' on the skin or soles of the ''feet'' are contagious, because contact with ''warts'' may spread the HPV infection.'  Genital warts are also contagious. HPV can be spread from person-to-person even when the infected person does not have any signs of symptoms."
How is HPV transmitted or spread?," As mentioned previously, genital HPV infection is spread by sexual contact with an infected person, including vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It can be spread when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. It also take many years for health problems associated with HPV to appear, making it very difficult for some people to know exactly when they became infected. In addition to sexual contact, HPV infection can be spread by any skin-to-skin contact. Spread of HPV infection also is likely to be possible from touching surfaces (such as public shower floors) that have been in contact with an HPV-infected person."
What are the signs and symptoms of HPV in men and women?," HPV infection typically does not produce any signs and symptoms in men, although infection with some HPV types can lead to genital warts, which appear as raised lumps or bumps on the genital areas. Genital warts vary in size from large to small and can be flat or raised. The edges can appear serrated or rough (like a cauliflower). Less commonly, certain types of HPV infection are known to cause cancers of the penis or anus in men. Other cancers that can be caused by HPV infection include oropharyngeal cancers, which are cancers of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils. Typical skin warts are other signs of HPV infection, although the types of HPVs that cause skin warts are not the same as those that cause cancers or genital warts. As with men, HPV in women usually does not produce signs or symptoms. However, in some cases, the HPV infection persists and leads to genital warts (as described previously), skin warts, or cancerous or precancerous changes in the cells that line the uterine cervix. The types of HPVs that cause cancers, genital warts, and skin warts are all different. Papanicolau (Pap) testing of the cervix allows for early detection of HPV-related changes in the cervix and has been used for decades as a tool for screening for cervical cancer. HPV types that cause cervical and other cancer are often referred to as ""high-risk"" HPV types."
What about HPV infection and pregnancy?,"'It is possible to acquire HPV infection ''during pregnancy''. If a woman has an active HPV infection while giving birth, there is a small chance the infection will be spread to the baby. But even if the baby does get the infection, usually it goes away without problems.' HPV infection has not been linked to pregnancy complications such as miscarriage or premature delivery. In very rare cases, babies born to women with active HPV infection and genital warts have developed warts in the back of the throat, a condition known as respiratory papillomatosis. Genital warts can typically be treated safely while a woman is pregnant."
Is there a vaccine against HPV infection in men and women?,"'Vaccines'' are available against the most common types of HPV that cause genital cancers and genital warts. The ''vaccines'' are given as a 3-shot series. HPV vaccination is recommended for preteen boys and girls at age 11 or 12 so they are protected before ever being sexually exposed to the virus. The ''vaccine'' does not contain live virus, so it is impossible to get HPV from the vaccine. Examples of the available vaccines in the US and include' Gardasil, and Gardasil 9."
What are the risks and side effects of the HPV vaccine?,"'The HPV vaccines have been shown to be safe. The most common side effects are ''bruising'', ''itching'', redness, tenderness, or swelling around the injection site.''Women have also uncommonly reported experiencing''These side effects are typically short-lived and go away on their own without treatment. There is a very small risk of an ''allergic reaction'', which can happen with any vaccination.' fainting, dizziness, mild fever, nausea, and vomiting."
Who is at risk for contracting HPV infection?,"'Although HPV is very common and anyone can become infected, there are certain risk factors that increase your chances of getting an HPV infection. Since there are many types of HPV, it also is possible to become infected more than once. Factors that increase the risk of getting an HPV infection include:' Having a number of different sex partners or having sex with someone who has had numerous sex partners. The higher the number of partners, the greater the risk. But HPV infection is still possible even in people who have had only one lifetime sex partner. Having a weakened immune system, such as having HIV/AIDS Cuts, abrasions, or breaks in the skin at the site of contact with an infected person or contaminated surface"
Is there a test for HPV infection?," There is an HPV test available to detect the presence of HPV in the cervix. This test typically is done at the time a woman receives a Pap test (Pap smear) or pelvic examination. However, there is no HPV test that can determine which HPV infections will go away and which will cause problems."
Is there a treatment or cure for HPV?,"'There is no specific treatment that can clear HPV infection, although in most cases, the infection goes away on its own. There are treatments available for the cancers and warts caused by HPV:' Genital warts and skin warts can be removed or treated with medications. Drugs that can be applied to genital warts to destroy the wart include podofilox (Condylox) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Imiquimod (Aldara) is a cream that stimulates the immune system to fight the HPV infection. Other treatments include freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen, cauterizing them with heat or a laser, or surgical removal. Skin warts may be removed surgically, with medications, by freezing, or cautery. Abnormal cervical cells can typically be treated to prevent cervical cancer from developing. Cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers are also most treatable when detected and treated early."
Which specialties of doctors treat HPV infection in men and women?," HPV infection in men and women may be treated by primary care specialists, including internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners. Urologists (for men) and gynecologist-obstetricians (or OB/GYNs, for women) also treat HPV infections. Dermatologists may treat HPV infections that result in skin warts."
Are oral and genital HPV infections the same?," The same types of HPV that infect the genital areas can also cause infection of the oral cavity (throat and mouth). Some types of oral HPV cause cancers of the throat and lining of the mouth, while other HPV types can cause warts in the mouth or throat. Like genital HPV infections, in most cases, HPV infections of the oral cavity go away without problems."
How long is someone with HPV contagious?," As mentioned previously, there are treatments for the conditions and cancers that are caused by HPV infection, but there is no known treatment to rid the body of the virus. Most cases of HPV infection resolve on their own without treatment and do not cause cancers or long-term problems."
Does HPV infection cause cancer?," Most cases of HPV infection do not even cause signs or symptoms and resolve on their own without treatment. However, in some cases, infections with certain HPV types can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva in women; cancers of the anus or cancers of the oral cavity in women or men; and cancer of the penis in men."
What is the prognosis for a person with HPV infection?," Most people who develop HPV infection never have any signs or symptoms from the infection. As discussed in this article, in rare cases, the HPV infection persists and ultimately leads to certain cancers. In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimates about 12,900 women will develop cervical cancer, yet it is estimated that all sexually active people will have been infected with HPV at some point. The reason for vaccination against HPV types that are linked to cancer is that it is currently impossible tell which people will have persistent HPV infection or infection that leads to cancer."
What is menopause?,"'Menopause'"" is the stage in a woman's life when ""'menstruation'' stops and she can no longer bear children. During ''menopause'', the body produces less of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. After ''menopause'', the lower hormone levels cause the monthly menstrual periods to stop and gradually eliminate the possibility of ''becoming pregnant''. These fluctuations in hormone levels can also cause troublesome symptoms, such as hot flashes (a sudden sensation of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing, and often followed by ''sweating'') and ''sleep'' disturbance. Sometimes women experience other symptoms, such as ''vaginal dryness'' and ''mood changes''. ''While many women encounter little or no trouble during menopause, others endure moderate to severe discomfort. ' "
Does menopause cause bone loss?,"'The lower estrogen levels of menopause can lead to progressive bone loss that is especially rapid in the first five years after menopause. Some bone loss in both men and women is normal as people age. Lack of estrogen after menopause adds another strain on the bones in addition to the usual age-related bone loss. When bone loss is severe, a condition called ''osteoporosis'' weakens bones and renders them susceptible to breaking. ' "
What are estrogen therapy and hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Estrogen, in pill, patch, or gel form, is the single most effective therapy for suppressing hot flashes. ''The term estrogen therapy, or ET, refers to estrogen administered alone. Because ET alone can cause uterine cancer (endometrial cancer) (see below), a progestin is administered together with estrogen in women who have a uterus (those who have not undergone a ''hysterectomy'') to eliminate the increased risk. Thus, the term ''estrogen/progestin therapy'', or EPT, refers to a combination of estrogen and progestin therapy, as is given to a woman who still has a uterus. This method of prescribing hormones is also known as combination hormone therapy. ''The term hormone therapy (HT) is a more general term that is used to refer to either administration of estrogen alone (women who have had a hysterectomy), or combined ''estrogen/progestin'' therapy (women with a uterus).''All forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are FDA-approved for therapy of hot flashes are similarly effective in suppressing hot flashes. ' "
What are the side effects and risks of hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Women can experience side effects during hormone therapy; these can be divided into more minor side effects, and more serious side effects. The more minor side effects are more common than the serious side effects, and are generally perceived by women as ""annoying."" These symptoms include:''It is still controversial which of these side effects are due to the estrogen component as compared to the progesterone component. Therefore, if side effects persist for a few months, the doctor will often alter either the progesterone or the estrogen part of the hormone therapy (HT).''Contrary to common belief, recent research has confirmed that women who take commonly prescribed doses of hormone therapy (HT) are no more likely to gain weight than women not taking hormone therapy (HT). This is probably because menopause or ''aging'' itself is associated with ''weight gain'', regardless of whether or not a woman takes hormone therapy.''The more serious health concerns for women undergoing hormone therapy (HT) include:' headaches, nausea, breast pain. Hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of vein clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis ) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolus) by about 2 or 3 fold. However, it is important to remember that these conditions are extremely rare in healthy women. Thus, the true increase in risk for healthy women is minimal. Women with a personal or family history of these blood clots should review this issue when considering hormone therapy (HT). Uterine Cancer (endometrial cancer): Research shows that women who have their uterus and use estrogen alone are at risk for endometrial cancer. Today, however, most doctors prescribe the combination of estrogen and progestin. Progestin protects against endometrial cancer. . If there is a particular reason why a woman with a uterus cannot take some form of progesterone, her doctor will take a sample of tissue from her uterus (endometrial biopsy) to check for cancer annually while she is taking estrogen. Women without a uterus (women who have had a hysterectomy) have no risk of endometrial cancer. Breast cancer: Recent research indicates that hormone therapy (HT), and especially EPT, increases the risk of breast cancer, although the increase in risk is very small. For example, the Women's Health Initiative, a reliable large study of hormone therapy (HT) in menopausal women, predicted that there were approximately eight extra cases per 10,000 women who took hormone therapy (HT) for 1 year, compared to women taking a placebo pill. The increase in risk of breast cancer associated with hormone therapy (HT) likely increases with duration of use and is especially increased with five or more years of use. Heart disease: Even though hormone therapy (HT) lowers the bad LDL cholesterol and raises the good HDL cholesterol, hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of heart attacks in women who already have heart disease, as well as in women who do not have known heart disease. Hormone therapy (HT) does not prevent heart attack based on recent research from the Women's Health Initiative. Abnormal vaginal bleeding: Women on hormone therapy (HT) are more likely than other postmenopausal women to experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. What is called ""abnormal bleeding"" depends on the type of hormone therapy (HT). With cyclic therapy, in which monthly bleeding is expected, bleeding is abnormal if it occurs when it is not expected or is excessively heavy or long in duration. With daily continuous therapy, irregular bleeding can last for six months to a year, therefore, irregular bleeding that lasts for more than a year is considered abnormal. When abnormal bleeding occurs, a doctor usually takes a sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrial biopsy) to rule out an abnormality or cancer in the uterus. This procedure is usually done in the office. After the evaluation is done, if nothing is found to be wrong, hormone therapy (HT) doses will often be adjusted to minimize further abnormal bleeding. Stroke: Hormone therapy (HT) slightly increased the risk of stroke in women studied in the Women's Health Initiative. The WHI predicted that there were 8 extra strokes per 10,000 women taking hormone therapy (HT) for one year, compared to women taking a placebo (sugar pill). Because of the possibility of increased breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease risks, women who have no major menopause symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT). The effects of other types of hormone therapy (HT) (aside from the Women's Health Initiative types) on breast cancer risk are still unclear."
How is hormone therapy (HT) prescribed?,"""Doctors usually prescribe hormone therapy (HT) as a combination of estrogen and another\xa0 female hormone, progesterone. Synthetic progesterone compounds are referred to as progestins. Long term estrogen use without progesterone increases the risk of uterine cancer (endometrial cancer), whereas addition of progesterone counteracts this risk. Therefore estrogen without progestin is usually only recommended for women who have had their uterus removed (hysterectomy). Estrogen is available as pills, tablets, patches, creams, mist sprays, or vaginal preparations (vaginal rings, vaginal tablets, or vaginal cream). The choice of estrogen preparation recommended by the doctor depends on the women's symptoms. For instance, vaginal creams, vaginal tablets, and vaginal rings are used for vaginal dryness, while pills or patches are used to ease hot flashes. Estrogen pills are also useful for vaginal dryness and are sometimes used along with vaginal creams, tablets, or rings.""'Although progestin is usually taken in pill form, it is also available, together with estrogen, in patch form.'""Doctors may prescribe different schedules for taking hormone therapy (HT). Every woman's hormone therapy (HT) treatment and schedule should be individualized based on her particular situation. Below are some standard forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are used:""'Pills (Oral Therapy)''In order to avoid monthly vaginal bleeding, some women choose to take small doses of estrogen and progesterone together every day. This is called ''daily continuous therapy.'' Sometimes, daily continuous therapy can cause some irregular, unexpected vaginal bleeding for the first several months of treatment, especially in younger women entering menopause. For these women, and for some other women, planned cyclic bleeding is more acceptable. In these women, progesterone is usually added to estrogen for the first 12 calendar days of the month.''Patches and spray mists (Transdermal Therapy)''Hormone therapy (HT) skin patches are to be worn on a continuous basis. Newer patches need to be changed once or twice per week. Combination estrogen/progesterone patches are available for women who have not undergone hysterectomy to prevent ''cancer of the uterus''. Patches are as effective as oral hormone therapy (HT) for controlling hot flashes. Spray mists for ET are available as a transdermal spray used once daily.''Vaginal Tablets rings, and Creams''Estrogen vaginal tablets and creams are generally prescribed nightly for 2 weeks, and then reduced to twice per week as a long-term ""maintenance therapy."" There is a low level of absorption of estrogen into the body with the use of vaginal preparations as directed. Circulating blood levels of estrogen are slightly increased from vaginal estrogen use, and the long-term safety of vaginal estrogen rings, creams and tablets has not been clearly established (for example risk of uterine cancer, heart disease, or breast cancer). For this reason, occurrence of vaginal bleeding during any type of vaginal estrogen use should be promptly evaluated.''Vaginal estrogen rings are approved to treat genital dryness and irritation that can occur due to the lack of estrogen in women after menopause. A higher dose vaginal ring is available to treat hot flashes, so the hormone released from this higher dose ring clearly reaches sufficient levels to affect other parts of the body besides the genital area. The vaginal ring remains in place for 12 weeks, after which it can be changed by either the woman herself or her physician. The long-term safety of estrogen rings is not yet clear, but there is a low level of absorption of the hormone into the bloodstream with use of the vaginal estrogen ring.''Bioidentical hormone therapy''There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Who should take hormone therapy (HT)?," Women with hot flashes , especially when they are causing sleep disturbance, can consider hormone therapy (HT). Estrogen given short-term is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, and benefit of short-term (less than 5 years) use outweighs potential risks for most women. Because the risks outweigh the benefits of long-term hormone therapy (HT) for most women, women who are at risk of, or who have been diagnosed with, osteoporosis should talk to their doctors about non-estrogen medications such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), teriparatide (Forteo), and calcitonin (Miacalcin) in preventing and treating osteoporosis. Women with vaginal dryness or itching due to menopause can consider HT. Oral pills, skin patches, gel, or vaginal forms of estrogen can be used. Women who only have vaginal menopause symptoms and are not experiencing hot flashes should pick a vaginal form of estrogen, whereas women with both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms can use any form of ET. Sometimes, if a woman has both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms, both oral and vaginal forms of ET will be prescribed together, especially if vaginal symptoms do not improve with oral ET alone. It is recommended that women who do choose to take hormone therapy should take the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period possible."
Who should not take hormone therapy (HT)?," Contrary to common myth, women with high blood pressure that is controlled by medication can take hormone therapy (HT) because hormone therapy (HT) does not cause significant elevations in blood pressure. A major medical reason for not taking hormone therapy (HT) is a personal medical history of breast cancer or uterus cancer. Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding should have an evaluation prior to embarking on hormone therapy (HT) to exclude the presence of cancer of the uterus. Similarly, routine mammograms and breast examinations are important to exclude the presence of breast cancer. While hormone therapy (HT) may be used in women with migraines or liver disease, certain types of hormone therapy (HT) (often a patch or vaginal form) may be chosen to try to avoid aggravating these conditions. Women should not be taking hormone therapy (HT) to prevent heart disease, and should initiate hormone therapy (HT) only with caution if they already have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (such as past heart attack), as hormone therapy (HT) may be increase the risk of heart attacks. Women with a personal history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) should avoid hormone therapy (HT). Women with phosopholipid antibodies, including cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, should not take HT because of the added risk of blood clotting and thrombosis."
What medical checkups are advised for women on hormone therapy (HT)?,"'\tAll women receiving hormone therapy (HT) should undergo a medical checkup every year. At that time, the doctor or nurse will perform a breast exam and order a ''mammogram'' (a special X-ray picture of the breasts) to check for masses in the breasts that might possibly be cancer. At, or even prior to these check-ups, a woman should discuss her bleeding pattern with her physician to be sure it is within the expected pattern for her specific type of hormone therapy (HT). Other routine screening evaluations may also be performed at this annual check-up.' "
What if a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT)?,"'If a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT), there are other methods to deal with the symptoms of menopause. Although hormone therapy (HT) is by far superior to other medications in relieving hot flashes, other prescription non-hormonal medications can also reduce hot flashes. Likewise, personal lubrication products such as a water-soluble jelly (not petroleum jelly) can be applied to the vagina to reduce dryness.''A woman may also want to ask her doctor about non-hormonal prescription osteoporosis medications. These new treatments appear safe and effective in preventing ''fractures''.' "
What is Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)?,'Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a form of blood vessel inflammation or ''vasculitis''. There are many different conditions that feature vasculitis. Each of the forms of vasculitis tends to involve certain characteristic blood vessels. HSP affects the small vessels called capillaries in the skin and frequently the kidneys. HSP results in a purplish skin ''rash'' (most prominent over the buttocks and behind the lower extremities) associated with joint inflammation (arthritis) and sometimes cramping ''pain'' in the abdomen. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is also referred to as anaphylactoid purpura.'  
What causes HSP?,"""HSP occurs most often in the spring season and frequently follows an infection of the throat or breathing passages. HSP seems to represent an unusual reaction of the body's immune system that is in response to this infection (either bacteria or virus). Aside from infection, ""'drugs'' can also trigger the condition. HSP occurs most commonly in children, but people of all age groups can be affected, including adults.' "
What are risk factors for HSP?,"'The only known risk factors for HSP are exposure to certain ''viruses'' and drugs. The reaction to these agents that leads to HSP is not, however, predictable.' "
"What are HSP symptoms and 
signs?","'Classically, HSP causes a purple-appearing skin rash, pain in the abdomen, and joint inflammation (arthritis). Not all features need be present for the diagnosis. The rash of skin lesions appears in gravity-dependent areas, such as the legs. The joints most frequently affected with pain and swelling are the ankles and the knees. Patients with HSP can develop ''fever''. Inflammation of the blood vessels in the kidneys (nephritis) can cause blood and/or ''protein in the urine''. ''Abdominal pain'' and gastrointestinal bleeding is more common in children than in adults. Serious kidney complications are infrequent but can occur.''Symptoms usually last approximately a month. Recurrences are not frequent but do occur.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose Henoch-Schonlein purpura?,"'HSP is usually diagnosed based on the typical skin, joint, and kidney findings. Throat culture, ''urinalysis'', and blood tests for inflammation and kidney function are used to suggest the diagnosis. A biopsy of the skin, and less commonly kidneys, can be used to demonstrate vasculitis. Special staining techniques (direct immunofluorescence) of the biopsy specimen can be used with microscopic examination to document antibody deposits of IgA in the blood vessels of involved tissue.' "
What is the treatment for HSP?,"'While HSP is generally a mild illness that resolves spontaneously, it can cause serious problems in the kidneys and bowels. The rash can be very prominent, especially on the lower extremities.''The treatment of HSP is directed toward the most significant area of involvement. ''Joint pain'' can be relieved by anti-inflammatory medications such as ''aspirin'' or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''). Some patients can require cortisone medications, such as ''prednisone'' or ''prednisolone'', especially those with significant ''abdominal pain'' or ''kidney disease''. With more severe kidney disease, involvement called glomerulonephritis or nephritis, ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), or ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') have been used to suppress the immune system. Infection, if present, can require antibiotics.' "
What are complications of HSP?,"'HSP can have complications, which generally occur more frequently in children than in adults. These complications include severe ''abdominal pain'' and gastrointestinal bleeding. Adults can have extended kidney problems.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with HSP?,"'The prognosis (outlook) for patients with HSP is generally excellent. Nearly all patients have no long-term problems. The kidney is the most serious organ involved when it is affected. Rarely, patients can have serious long-term kidney damage or an abnormal bowel folding called ''intussusception''. Some patients have recurrences of symptoms, particularly skin rash, for months to a year after the onset of the illness.' "
Is it possible to prevent Henoch-Schonlein purpura?,"'HSP can be prevented only to the extent that one minimizes exposure to viruses and certain drugs that could cause the abnormal immune response. As it is impossible to know who will get HSP, it is not possible to actually prevent it.' "
What does AIDS stand for? What causes AIDS?,"'AIDS is an acronym for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."" The ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (HIV) causes AIDS and represents the most advanced stage of HIV infection.''HIV spreads through\xa0infected blood or fluids such as sexual secretions. Over time, the virus attacks the immune system, focusing on special cells called ""CD4 cells"" which are important in protecting the body from infections and ''cancers'', and the number of these cells starts to fall. Eventually, the CD4 cells fall to a critical level and/or the immune system weakens so much that it can no longer fight off certain types of infections and ''cancers''. AIDS is an advanced stage of HIV infection.''HIV is a very small virus that contains ribonucleic acid (RNA) as its genetic material. When HIV infects animal cells, it uses a special enzyme, reverse transcriptase, to turn (transcribe) its RNA into DNA. (""Retroviruses"" are ''viruses'' that use reverse transcriptase.) When HIV reproduces, it is prone to making small genetic mistakes or mutations, resulting in ''viruses'"" that vary slightly from each other. This ability to create minor variations allows HIV to evade the body's immunologic defenses, essentially leading to lifelong infection, and has made it difficult to make an effective ""'vaccine''. The mutations also allow HIV to become resistant to antiretroviral medications.' "
What is the history of AIDS?,"'Careful investigation has helped scientists determine where HIV came from. Studies have shown that HIV first arose in Africa. It spread from non-human primates to people early in the 20th century, possibly when humans came into contact with infected blood during a chimpanzee hunt. By testing stored blood samples, scientists have found direct evidence of a human being infected as long ago as 1959.''Once introduced into humans, HIV spread through sexual intercourse from person to person. As infected people moved around, the virus spread from Africa to other areas of the world. In 1981, U.S. physicians noticed that a large number of young men were dying of unusual infections and cancers. Initially, U.S. victims were gay men predominately, probably because the virus inadvertently entered this population first in this country and because the virus is transmitted easily during anal intercourse. However, it is important to note that heterosexual activity and contact with infected blood or secretions also efficiently transmits the virus. In Africa, which remains the center of the AIDS pandemic, most cases are heterosexually transmitted. In 1991, the news that Magic Johnson had acquired HIV heterosexually helped the country realize that the infection was not limited to men who had sex with men. Currently in the U.S., approximately 27% of new HIV infections are a result of heterosexual transmission.''Other major factors in the early days of AIDS was transmission from blood by injection ''drug use'' (IDU) with needle sharing and transfusions of blood and blood components. Before the ability to test for the virus in donated blood became available, transfusions infected numerous hemophiliacs and surgical patients.''In the years since people first identified the virus, HIV has spread to every corner of the globe and is one of the leading causes of infectious death worldwide. Statistics from the World Health Organization show that approximately 1.5 million people die each year from AIDS, and 240,000 of these are children. Worldwide, half of HIV-infected people are women. Two-thirds of current cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.''In the U.S., more than 1 million people have HIV infections, and approximately 40,000 are newly infected each year. Over the years, more than 600,000 people in the U.S. have died from AIDS, many of them during what should have been their most productive years of life.' "
What are AIDS symptoms and signs?,"'AIDS is an advanced stage of HIV infection. People with AIDS often develop symptoms and signs of unusual infections or cancers largely due to the destruction of the CD4 cells in the immune system. When a person with HIV infection gets one of these infections or cancers, medical professionals refer to this as an ""AIDS-defining condition."" Examples of AIDS-defining conditions appear in Table 1. Significant, unexplained ''weight loss'' also is an AIDS-defining condition. Because common conditions like ''cancer'' or other viral conditions like ''infectious mononucleosis'' also can cause ''weight loss'' and ''fatigue'', it is sometimes easy for a physician to overlook the possibility of ''HIV/AIDS''. It is possible for people without AIDS to get some of these conditions, especially the more common infections like ''tuberculosis''.''People with AIDS may develop ''symptoms of pneumonia'' due to ''Pneumocystis jiroveci'', which rarely appears in people with normal immune systems. They also are more likely to get ''pneumonia'' due to common bacteria. Globally, ''tuberculosis'' is one of the most common infections associated with AIDS. In addition, people with AIDS may develop ''seizures'', ''weakness'', or mental changes due to ''toxoplasmosis'', a parasite that infects the brain. Neurological signs also may be due to ''meningitis'' caused by the fungus ''Cryptococcus''. A ''yeast infection'' of the ''esophagus'' called ''candidiasis'' may cause complaints of painful swallowing. Because these infections take advantage of the weakened immune system, health care providers refer to them as ""opportunistic infections.""'""The weakening of the immune system associated with HIV infection can lead to unusual cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma develops as raised patches on the skin that are red, brown, or purple. Kaposi's sarcoma can also be present in the mouth, intestine, or respiratory tract. AIDS also may be associated with ""'lymphoma'' (a type of ''cancer'' involving white blood cells).''In people with AIDS, HIV itself may cause symptoms. Some people experience relentless ''fatigue'' and ''weight loss'', known as ""wasting syndrome."" Others may develop ''confusion'' or sleepiness due to infection of the brain with HIV, known as HIV ''encephalopathy''. Both wasting syndrome and HIV ''encephalopathy'' are AIDS-defining illnesses.' "
What are risk factors for developing AIDS?,"'Developing AIDS requires that the person acquire HIV infection. Risks for acquiring HIV infection include behaviors that result in contact with infected blood or sexual secretions, which pose the main risk of HIV transmission. These behaviors include sexual intercourse and injection ''drug use''. The presence of sores in the genital area, like those caused by ''herpes'', makes it easier for the virus to pass from person to person during intercourse. HIV also has been spread to health care workers through accidental sticks with needles contaminated with blood from HIV-infected people, or when broken skin contacted infected blood or secretions. Blood products used for transfusions or injections also may spread infection, although this has become extremely rare (less than one in 2 million transfusions in the U.S.) due to testing of blood donors and blood supplies for HIV. Finally, infants may acquire HIV from an infected mother either while they are in the womb, during birth, or by ''breastfeeding'' after birth.''The risk that HIV infection will progress to AIDS increases with the number of years since a person acquired the infection. If the HIV infection is untreated, 50% of people will develop AIDS within 10 years, but some people progress in the first year or two and others remain completely asymptomatic with normal immune systems for decades after infection. The risk of developing one of the complications that define AIDS is associated with declining CD4 cells, particularly to below 200 cells/ul.''Antiretroviral treatment substantially reduces the risk that HIV will progress to AIDS. In developed countries, use of ART has turned HIV into a chronic disease that may never progress to AIDS. Conversely, if infected people are not able to take their medications or have a virus that has developed resistance to several medications, they are at increased risk for progression to AIDS.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose AIDS?,"'To diagnose AIDS, the doctor will need (1) a confirmed, positive test for HIV (""HIV positive"" test) and (2) evidence of an AIDS-defining condition or severely depleted CD4 cells.''Testing for HIV is a two-step process involving a screening test and a confirmatory test. Current guidelines recommend that the first step is a screening test that looks for a component of the virus, called p24 antigen, as well as antibodies against HIV. Specimens for testing come from blood obtained from a vein or a ''finger stick'', an oral swab, or a urine sample. Results can come back in minutes (rapid tests) or can take several days, depending on the method that is used. If the screening ''HIV test'' is positive, a different test that looks for antibodies to either HIV-1, the most common form of this virus, or to HIV-2, a strain more common in select parts of the World, such as Western Africa, will confirm the results. If one of these tests is positive, it confirms infection with that particular type of HIV. If both tests are negative, then medical professionals perform a test looking for the virus to see if the initial screening assay detected the viral protein at a time when infection was new and antibodies had yet to develop.''Merely having HIV does not mean a person has AIDS. AIDS is an advanced stage of HIV infection and requires that the person have evidence of a damaged immune system. That evidence comes from at least one of the following:''It is important to remember, however, that any diagnosis of AIDS requires a confirmed, positive test for HIV.' The presence of an AIDS-defining condition Measuring the CD4 cells in the body and showing that there are fewer than 200 cells per milliliter of blood A laboratory result showing that fewer than 14% of lymphocytes are CD4 cells"
What is the treatment for HIV/AIDS?,"'Antiretroviral medications are medications that fight HIV. Different antiretroviral medications target the virus in different ways. When used in combination with each other, they are very effective at suppressing the virus. It is important to note that there is no cure for HIV. ART only suppresses reproduction of the virus and stops or delays the disease from progressing to AIDS. Most guidelines currently recommend that all HIV-infected people who are willing to take medications should have them initiated shortly after their HIV diagnosis. This delays or prevents disease progression, improves overall health of an infected person, and makes it less likely that they will transmit the virus to their partners.''There are currently seven major classes of antiretroviral medications: (1) nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), (2) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), (3) ''protease inhibitors'' (''PIs''), (4) fusion inhibitors, (5) integrase inhibitors, (6) CCR5 antagonists, and (7) entry inhibitor. People use these ''drugs'' in different combinations according to their needs and depending on whether the virus has become resistant to a specific drug or class of ''drugs''. Treatment regimens usually consist of three to four medications at the same time. Combination treatment is essential because using only one class of medication by itself allows the virus to become resistant to the medication. There are now pills that contain multiple drugs in a single pill, making it possible to treat many people with a single pill per day.''Before starting ART, medical professionals usually perform blood tests to make sure the virus is not already resistant to the chosen medications. Health care providers may repeat these resistance tests if it appears the drug regimen is not working or stops working. Physicians instruct patients about the importance of taking all of their medications as directed and are told what side effects to watch for. Noncompliance with medications is the most common cause of treatment failure and can cause the virus to develop resistance to the medication. Because successful therapy often depends on taking several pills, it is important for the patient to understand that this is an ""all or nothing"" regimen. If the person cannot tolerate one of the pills, then he or she should call their physician, ideally prior to stopping any medication. Taking just one or two of the recommended medications is strongly discouraged because it allows the virus to mutate and become resistant. It is best to inform the HIV health care provider immediately about any problems so they can prescribe a better-tolerated combination.' "
What is the treatment for HIV during pregnancy?,"'There are two goals of treatment for ''pregnant'' women with HIV infection: to treat maternal infection and to reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. Women can pass HIV to their ''babies'' during ''pregnancy'', during delivery, or after delivery by ''breastfeeding''. Without treatment of the mother and without breastfeeding, the risk of transmission to the baby is about 25%. With treatment of the mother before and during birth and with treatment of the baby after birth, the risk decreases to less than 2%. Because of this benefit, doctors recommended that all ''pregnant'' women undergo routine ''HIV testing'' as part of their ''prenatal care''. Once diagnosed, there are several options for treatment, although woman cannot use some antiretroviral medications during ''pregnancy'' and others have not been studied in pregnancy. For example, recent data suggests that dolutegravir (Tivicay) should be avoided in women who may become pregnant so that exposure at ''conception'' does not occur. Fortunately, there are treatment regimens that have been shown to be well tolerated by most pregnant women, significantly improving the outcome for mother and child. The same principles of testing for ''drug resistance'' and combining antiretrovirals used for nonpregnant patients are used for pregnant patients. All pregnant women with HIV should receive ART treatment regardless of their CD4 cell count, although the choice of drugs may differ slightly from nonpregnant women. In developed countries, women also are instructed not to breastfeed their children.''Compliance with medications is important to provide the best outcome for mother and child. Even though a physician might highly recommend a medication regimen, the pregnant woman has a choice of whether or not to take the medicines. Studies have shown improved compliance when there is good communication between the woman and her doctor, with open discussions about the benefits and side effects of treatment. Compliance also improves with better social support, including friends and relatives.''Patients must continue medications throughout pregnancy, ''labor'', and delivery. Some medicines, such as ''zidovudine'' (also known as AZT), can be given intravenously during ''labor'', particularly for those women who do not have good viral suppression at the time of delivery. Patients need to continue other medications orally during ''labor'"" to try to reduce the risk of transmission to the baby during delivery. If the quantity of virus in the mother's blood (viral load) is more than 1,000 copies/mL near the time of delivery, doctors will perform a scheduled cesarean delivery at 38 weeks gestation to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus during vaginal delivery. Women with HIV should continue taking ART after delivery for their own health.""'If a pregnant woman with HIV infection does not take ART during pregnancy and goes into ''labor'', medical professionals will still give her medications during ''labor''. This reduces the risk of transmission of HIV. After delivery, health care providers will give the infant medication(s) for at least six weeks to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV. If the mother did not take ART during pregnancy or if the mother has a drug-resistant virus, medical professionals will treat infants with multiple medications. Health care providers test infants periodically in the first six months to ensure they have not acquired the virus.' "
What is the treatment for non-HIV-infected people exposed to the genital secretions or blood of someone with HIV?,"'Blood and genital secretions from people with HIV are infectious and the utmost care should be taken in handling them. Fluids contaminated with blood also are potentially infectious. Feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomit are not considered infectious unless visibly bloody.''The most commonly reported occupational exposures are''The average risk of HIV infection after a needle-stick injury is around 0.3% and after mucous-membrane exposure to blood is approximately 0.09%. For abraded skin exposure, the risk is less than mucous membrane exposure. Some factors that may affect the risk for HIV transmission such as the amount of blood from the infected source. Deep injury from a needle, visible blood in/on the needle, or a needle placed in an artery or vein are examples of higher-risk situations. The risk of transmission also depends on the number of virus particles in the blood, with higher viral loads leading to an increased risk of transmission.''If an exposure occurs, the exposed person can reduce the risk of getting HIV by taking antiretroviral medications. Current recommendations suggest three antiretroviral medications. Start medications as soon as possible, preferably within hours of exposure and should be continued for four weeks, if tolerated. People who have been exposed should be tested for HIV at the time of the injury and again at six weeks, 12 weeks, and six months after exposure.''It is important to document that an exposure has occurred or was likely. A needle stick from a person with HIV or a person likely to have HIV constitutes a significant exposure. Medications should be started immediately. If it is unknown whether the person who is the source of the potentially infected material has HIV, health care providers can test the source person. Medications started immediately in the exposed person can be discontinued if the source person does not turn out to carry HIV. Potentially infectious material splashed in the eye or mouth, or encountering non-intact skin, also constitutes an exposure and should prompt immediate evaluation to determine if medications should be started.''Other potential exposures include vaginal and anal sexual intercourse and sharing needles during intravenous drug use. There is less evidence for the role of antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after these exposures. In part, this is because the exposed person usually does not know the HIV status of a sexual partner or drug user. Nevertheless, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends treatment for people exposed through sexual activity or injectable drug use to someone who is known to carry HIV. If the HIV status of the source is not known, the decision to treat is individualized. Concerned people should see their physician for advice. If a decision to treat is made, medications should be started within 72 hours of the exposure.''For every exposure, especially with blood, it is important to test for other blood-borne diseases like ''hepatitis B'' or C, which are more common among HIV-infected patients. Reporting to a supervisor, in the case of health care workers, or seeking immediate medical consultation is advisable. For sexual exposures, medical professionals should test patients for ''syphilis'', ''gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'', and other ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') because individuals with HIV are more likely to have other ''STDs''. Patients also should be counseled about how to prevent exposure in the future.' an inadvertent needle stick (usually when drawing blood from someone with HIV); a cut from a sharp object such as a scalpel that is contaminated with blood; exposure of mucous membranes to infectious fluid (mucous membranes that may be exposed to splashes of material include the mouth, nasal passages, and eyes); exposure of open sores or abraded/inflamed skin to infectious material."
What are the complications of HIV?,"'The complications of HIV infection result mainly from a weakened immune system. The virus also infects the brain, causing degeneration, problems with thinking, or even ''dementia''. This makes the person more vulnerable to certain types of conditions and infections (see Table 1). Treatment with ART can prevent, reverse, or mitigate the effects of HIV infection. Some patients on ART may be at risk for developing ''cholesterol'' or blood-''sugar'' problems.''Although many effective medications are on the market, the virus can become resistant to any drug. This can be a serious complication if it means that a patient must use a less effective medicine. To reduce the risk of resistance, patients should take their medications as prescribed and call their physician immediately if they feel they need to stop one or more drugs.' "
What is the prognosis for HIV infection?,"'Left untreated, HIV is usually a fatal illness with half of people dying within nine months of diagnosis of an AIDS-defining condition. The use of ART has dramatically changed this grim picture. People who are on an effective ART regimen have life expectancies that are similar to or only moderately less than the uninfected population. Unfortunately, many people with HIV deal with socioeconomic issues, substance-abuse issues, or other problems that interfere with their ability or desire to take medications.' "
How can people prevent an HIV infection?,"'Sexual abstinence is completely effective in eliminating sexual transmission, but educational campaigns have not been successful in promoting abstinence in at-risk populations. Monogamous sexual intercourse between two uninfected partners also eliminates sexual transmission of the virus. Using barrier methods, such as ''condoms'', during sexual intercourse markedly reduces the risk of HIV transmission. These measures have had some success in blunting the rate of new cases, especially in high-risk areas such as sub-Saharan Africa or Haiti. As discussed above, medications may reduce the risk of HIV infection if used within hours of an exposure. There also is data that if uninfected people can take antiretroviral medications, in particular ''tenofovir'' disoproxil fumarate plus ''emtricitabine'' (TDF/FTC or ''Truvada'') once daily, that it markedly reduces the risk of sexual transmission. Perhaps the most effective way to reduce HIV transmission is for the HIV-infected partner to be on ART with undetectable levels of virus in their blood. As noted above, a pregnant woman with HIV can reduce the risk of passing the infection to her baby by taking medications during pregnancy and ''labor'' and avoiding breastfeeding. There is now growing data that those consistently suppressed on ART pose virtually no risk of transmitting sexually to their partners.''People can prevent needle-stick injuries by touching syringes with only one hand and by using more modern needles that have retractable sleeves. Use of gowns, gloves, masks, and eye protection can reduce the risk of exposure to infected secretions in high-risk settings. For intravenous-drug abusers, use of clean needles and elimination of needle sharing reduces the risk of transmission.' "
Is there a vaccine for HIV?,"'To date, there is no effective vaccine for HIV. Researchers have made several attempts to create a vaccine but all have failed. This remains an active area of research.' "
What are researchers doing to find a cure for HIV?,"""The search for a cure for HIV began as soon as researchers identified the virus. HIV is probably one of the most studied viruses in history. Scientists have a detailed knowledge of the virus' genes, proteins, and understand how it functions. In fact, researchers chose the combinations of drugs that make up ART therapy because they attack different parts of the virus life cycle, causing it to malfunction. However, ART is not a cure and HIV patients must take the drugs for life. Even when viral levels are low, the virus is still present in the body.""'One of the problems with finding a cure is that the virus can persist in cells throughout the body and potentially hide in areas that are difficult for drugs to reach, like the brain. New research is helping us understand how to treat viruses effectively in these secluded areas of the body. In addition, researchers are studying those infected cells that persist in the body to determine how they can be stimulated to produce virus and/or be targeted for clearance from the body by novel therapies.' "
Where can a person find information about clinical trials for HIV and AIDS?,'There are a large number of studies currently under way that involve HIV-infected patients. These studies are registered in a central database that can be searched at ''http://clinicaltrials.gov''.' 
Cervista HPV Test Facts," A subgroup of the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are known to cause cancers of the uterine cervix and other genital areas, the so-called ""high risk"" HPVs. The Cervista test is used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the ""high-risk"" HPVs in cervical samples. The sample for the test is taken in the same way that a Pap smear test is performed. There are two Cervista tests available, Cervista HPV 16/18, which identified the two HPV types most likely to cause cancer, and Cervista HPV HR, which identifies all ""high-risk"" HPV types. Cervista testing is not recommended for routine screening; rather, it is used in combination with physical examination, medical history, and other testing to help make decisions about management and follow-up on a case-by-case basis."
What is human papillomavirus (HPV)?,"'Of the more than 100 types of papillomaviruses (HPVs) that infect humans, more than 40 types can infect the anogenital tract (genital tract and anus) of men and women and cause ''genital warts'' (known as condylomata acuminata or venereal ''warts''). A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead to ''precancerous'' changes in the uterine cervix and cause ''cervical cancer'' or other genital cancers in women. The HPV types that cause ''cervical cancer'' also have been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men.''The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also infect the anogenital tract. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such as ''genital warts'' and mild dysplasia of the cervix (potentially ''precancerous'' changes in the appearance of cervical cells under a microscope) and are termed ""low-risk"" HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found in the majority of cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called ""high-risk"" group of HPVs. Twelve other HPV types have also been identified as causes of cervical and other genital cancers, although these are less common that HPV-16 and -18.''HPV infections are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partners increase.' "
What is the Cervista HPV test?,"'The Cervista HPV test, manufactured by Hologic, is a test that is used to identify the presence of ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) genetic material, or DNA, in cervical samples, such as samples taken during Pap screening or ''colposcopy''. The Cervista test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March of 2009 and was the first DNA test approved by the FDA for detection of HPV in women.''Two different tests are available, known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR. Cervista HPV 16/18 is used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with ''cancer'', HPV 16 and 18, while Cervista HPV HR is used to diagnose all 14 ""high risk"" or ''cancer'""-associated HPV types. The choice for which test to use depends on what information the patient's physician wants to collect."" "
How is the HPV test done?,"'For the Cervista test, a sample is taken from the cervix in the same way that a sample for Pap testing is obtained. It can be performed at the same time as Pap testing or ''colposcopy''. There is no special preparation needed for the test, although women should try to schedule Cervista and other screening tests about two weeks after their ''last menstrual period'' and try to avoid having the test performed during the ''menstrual period''. Results are typically ready in about the same time as normal Pap screening results.' "
Who should be tested for HPV?,"'The Cervista test is not used for routine screening of all women and is not intended to be a stand-alone test. It is not recommended for testing in women under 30 years of age who have normal cytology (Pap) results. Cervista is designed for use in women age 30 and older or women with unclear or borderline Pap screening results, such as ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). It can provide more information about the risk of ''cervical cancer'' for women who may have precancerous changes of the cervix. ''According to the manufacturer, the Cervista test ""should be used in conjunction with clinical information derived from other diagnostic and screening tests, physical examinations, and full medical history in accordance with appropriate patient management procedures.""' "
How are the results of an HPV test interpreted?,"'A positive test result does not mean that a woman will definitely get ''cervical cancer''.'""The results of the test are used to help estimate a woman's risk of developing cervical ""'cancer'' or to estimate the severity or risk of findings that may not be clear from physical examination and Pap screening. As discussed previously, the results of the Cervista HPV test are not interpreted alone but in combination with Pap testing, medical history, and physical examination. The test gives one more piece of information to help the health care practitioner make the best decisions about further monitoring and management for each woman on a case-by-case basis.'  "
What is Hunter syndrome?,"'Hunter syndrome is a very rare X - linked recessive inherited disease. Hunter syndrome is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient or absent enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S). This causes the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate to accumulate in body tissues. Injury to various organs lead to the symptoms from the disease. Hunter syndrome is also termed Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II.' "
What are the signs symptoms of Hunter syndrome?,"'The symptoms of Hunter syndrome usually are not present at birth, but begin in young children ages about 2-4, and may range from mild to severe. Symptoms include:'   Facial changes such as thickening of 
the lips, nostrils flaring and broadening of the nose Head enlargement (macrocephaly) Tongue protrusion Hoarseness and/or deepening of the 
voice Changes in the bones produces abnormal 
bone size and/or bone shape Joint stiffness Small whitish growths on the skin Enlarged internal organs Distended abdomen Diarrhea Delayed development (for example, child 
does not meet normal development such as talking or normal motor skills like 
walking) Behavior that becomes aggressive Reduced or stunted growth"
What causes Hunter syndrome?,"'The cause of Hunter syndrome is an abnormal gene X chromosome that is inherited from the mother. This genetic abnormality allows mucopolysaccharides to accumulate in large amounts in cells, the blood and in connective tissues. This accumulation causes damage to cells and organs. It is a progressive disease that usually causes a shortened lifespan and major developmental abnormalities. Hunter syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males.' "
Who gets Hunter syndrome?,"'The two major risk factors for Hunter syndrome are a family history of Hunter syndrome, and being male, since predominantly males are affected. Females rarely get the disease because they inherit two X chromosomes so that even if one is defective, the other X chromosome with functioning genes usually can compensate for the abnormality.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat Hunter syndrome?,"'There are a number of physician specialties that may treat Hunter syndrome. Treatment is geared toward managing the symptoms and complications of the disease. There is no cure for this progressive disease. Specialties of physicians that may be involved in caring for persons with Hunter syndrome include pediatric pulmonologists, critical-care specialists, ''emergency medicine'' specialists, orthopedists, geneticists, rheumatologists, internal medicine specialists, neurologists, surgeons and child psychologists. If the child survives to adulthood, similar specialists that treat adults may be consulted.' "
How is Hunter syndrome diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of Hunter syndrome is sometimes difficult because of its slow onset and overlapping symptoms with other childhood problems. Early signs that suggest a diagnosis include facial changes in the child. The pediatrician then usually completes a detailed personal family history and physical examination of the individual. Blood, urine, and/or tissue samples can be tested for either the deficient enzyme or excess mucopolysaccharides. Definitive diagnosis is done by a genetic analysis of the child's X chromosome(s). There is no routine ""'newborn'' screening available to diagnose Hunter syndrome. However, in families with known Hunter syndrome, prenatal testing of the ''amniotic fluid'' or placental tissue may be available and can verify the diagnosis in a fetus.' "
What is the treatment for Hunter syndrome?,"'Currently, treatment is geared toward managing symptoms and complications as there is no cure for this progressive disease. Treatments depend on the organ(s) involved and can include assistance with ''breathing'"", physical therapy to maintain functions, drainage of fluids to build up in the brain and/or spinal cord, heart valve replacement and other treatments such as behavior management. Some physicians utilize specific enzyme therapy to replace child's deficient enzymes. The treatment is termed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using an IV – infused enzyme (Elaprase). It is still being refined along with gene therapy to replace the abnormal part of the X chromosome."" "
What are the complications of Hunter syndrome?,"'Complications of Hunter syndrome are:' Respiratory complications (thickened 
tongue can obstruct breathing) Skeletal problems (abnormal bone 
development and joint problems) Connective tissue (accumulation of 
mucopolysaccharides can cause swelling) Heart (thickened tissue resulting in 
vessel narrowing) Brain (hydrocephalus) Nervous system (thickened membranes 
impede nerve functions) Reduced ability to recover from most 
illnesses"
What is the life-expectancy for a person with Hunter syndrome?,"'The life expectancy the person with Hunter syndrome is reduced and ranges from about 10 to 20 years of age. However, with mild disease, some individuals live into adulthood. Obstruction of breathing or ''heart disease'' are the major causes of death.' "
What are other names for Hunter syndrome?,"'Hunter syndrome is also known as ''Some researchers use subtypes such as MPS IIA and MPS IIB (MPS IIA is severe disease while MPS IIB is mild disease).''There are two other terms that are sometimes confused with Hunter syndrome. ' Mucopolysaccharidosis II,  MPS II, and  MPS 
Disorder II.  The first is Bow Hunter Syndrome, a problem when a person rotates their head and 
causes circulation ischemia in the dominant vertebral artery that produces 
attacks of 
	vertigo, nystagmus and
	ataxia (inability to walk normally). 
	 The 
second term is Hurler Hunter syndrome. This term also is known as Hurler 
syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis I and MPS I), and is closely related to Hunter 
syndrome because it also is an inherited disease that results in a lack of an 
enzyme called alpha- L-iduronidase, which produces similar symptoms and 
outcomes to Hunter syndrome."
What is Huntington's disease?,"'Huntington’s disease is an ''inherited disease'' that causes the progressive dying off, or degeneration, of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. American physician George Huntington wrote the first thorough description of Huntington’s disease (HD) in 1872, calling it “hereditary chorea” to underscore some of its key features. Chorea1 is derived from the Greek word for dance and describes the uncontrollable dance-like movements seen in people with HD. The hereditary nature of HD helps distinguish it from other types of chorea with infectious, metabolic, or hormonal causes. Understanding the hereditary nature of HD eventually enabled modern researchers to pinpoint the cause of the disease–a mutation or misspelling in a single gene.''More than 30,000 Americans have HD. Although the mutation is present from birth, symptoms of HD typically appear in middle age (adult HD), and in rare cases they appear in children (juvenile HD). The disease, which gets progressively worse, attacks motor control regions of the brain, as well as other areas. Chorea, abnormal body postures, and impaired coordination are among the most visible symptoms. But HD also causes changes in emotion and cognition (thinking) that can be devastating for people with the disorder and for their families.''Although there is no cure for HD, treatments are available to help manage its symptoms and other potential treatments are under investigation to slow or stop its course. And there are now genetic tests available for HD, which gives people at risk for the disease the option to plan for their health and the health of future generations.' "
How does Huntington's affect the brain?,"'The most severe loss of nerve cells (also called neurons) occurs in deep brain structures called the basal ganglia, especially in a part of the basal ganglia called the striatum. The basal ganglia have a variety of functions, including helping to control voluntary (intentional) movement. Subsections of the basal ganglia, called the caudate nuclei and putamen, are most severely affected. Another strongly affected area is the brain’s outer surface, or cerebral cortex, which has important roles in movement, as well as thought, perception, memory, and emotion. As HD progresses over time, neuronal degeneration becomes more widespread throughout the brain. In addition to metabolic changes, there is degeneration in areas of the brain that control hormones.' "
How is Huntington's inherited?,"'HD is passed from parent to child through a mutation in a gene. Genes contain the blueprint for who we are, from our outer appearance to the composition and workings of our internal organs, including the brain. The gene responsible for HD lies on chromosome 4.''When a parent has HD, each child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the copy of chromosome 4 that carries the HD mutation. If a child does not inherit the HD mutation, he or she will not develop the disease and cannot pass it to subsequent generations. In some families, all the children may inherit the HD gene; in others, none do. Whether one child inherits the gene has no bearing on whether others will or will not share the same fate. A person who inherits the HD mutation and survives long enough will develop the disease.''To understand the HD gene mutation, it helps to know a little more about what genes are and what they do. Genes contain the instructions for making the approximately one million proteins that run everything in our bodies. The HD gene makes an essential protein called ''huntingtin'', whose function is largely unknown but may be necessary for early nerve cell development. Huntingtin is most active in the brain. Genes are composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a long chain-like molecule. The links in a DNA chain are called bases, or nucleotides, and there are four varieties—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—typically abbreviated as A, T, C, and G. Within each gene, a unique combination of these nucleotides serves as a code that determines the gene’s function; changes in the code—such as through a mutation—can change a gene’s function.''The disease-causing mutation inside the HD gene consists of a three-base sequence repeated many times. This type of mutation, called a triplet (or trinucleotide) repeat expansion, is responsible for dozens of other neurological diseases, but in each case the three-base sequence, or triplet, resides within a different gene. The triplet sequences also vary; in HD, the triplet consists of the bases C-A-G. Most people have fewer than 27 CAG repeats in the HD gene and are not at risk for the disease. Individuals with the disease may have 36 or more repeats. People who have repeats in the intermediate range (27-35) are unlikely to develop the disease, but they could pass it on to future generations.''When HD occurs without a family history, it is called sporadic HD. These cases can occur when one parent has an intermediate range of CAG repeats, sometimes called a premutation. Prior to ''conception'' of a child, the number of repeats may expand into the disease-causing range. Most often, these expansions occur in the father’s sperm cells, rather than in the mother’s egg cells. Each time the father’s DNA is copied to make new sperm, there is a possibility for the number of CAG repeats to expand. This increase in disease severity from one generation to the next—with a younger onset and faster progression—is called anticipation.' "
What are the major symptoms and signs of Huntington's?,"'Early signs of the disease vary greatly from person to person, but typically include cognitive or psychiatric symptoms, difficulties with movement, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of Huntington’s disease include:''Behavioral changes''. The individual experiences ''mood swings'' or becomes uncharacteristically irritable, apathetic, passive, ''depressed'', or angry. These symptoms may lessen as the disease progresses or, in some individuals, may continue and include hostile outbursts, thoughts of ''suicide'', deep bouts of ''depression'', and, rarely, psychosis. Social withdrawal is common.''Cognitive/judgment changes''. HD may affect a person’s judgment, attention, and other cognitive functions. Early signs might include having trouble with driving, problem-solving or decision making, prioritizing tasks, and difficulty organizing, learning new things, remembering a fact, putting thoughts into words, or answering a question. Familiar tasks that were simple to complete when healthy now take longer or cannot be done at all. As the disease progresses, these cognitive problems worsen and affected individuals are no longer able to work, drive, or care for themselves. When the level of cognitive impairment is significant enough to impair daily functioning, it is described as ''dementia''. Many people, however, remain aware of their environment and are able to express emotions. Some individuals cannot recognize other family members.''Uncontrolled and difficult movement''. Movement problems may begin with uncontrolled movement in the fingers, feet, face, or trunk. These movements, which are signs of chorea, often intensify when the person is anxious or distracted and become larger and more apparent over time. HD can also begin with mild clumsiness or problems with balance. Some people develop chorea-related movements. Chorea often creates serious problems with ''walking'', increasing the likelihood of falls. Some individuals with HD do not develop chorea; instead, they may become rigid and move very little, or not at all, a condition called akinesia. Others may start out with chorea but become rigid as the disease progresses. In addition to chorea, some individuals have unusual fixed postures, called ''dystonia''. The two movement disorders can blend or alternate. Other symptoms may include ''tremor'' (unintentional rhythmic muscle movement in a back-and-forth manner) and abnormal eye movements that often occur early.''Physical changes''. Speech becomes slurred and vital functions, such as swallowing, eating, speaking, and especially walking, continue to decline. Many people with HD ''lose weight'' as they encounter problems with feeding, swallowing, choking, and chest infections. Other symptoms may include ''insomnia'', loss of energy, and ''fatigue''. Some individuals with HD develop ''seizures''. Eventually the person will be confined to a bed or wheelchair.''In general, the duration of the illness ranges from 10 to 30 years. The most common ''causes of death'' are infection (most often ''pneumonia'') and injuries related to falls.' "
At what age does Huntington's appear?,"'The rate of disease progression and the age at onset vary from person to person. As a general rule, having a higher number of CAG repeats is associated with an earlier onset and faster course of the disease. A common observation is that the earlier the symptoms appear, the faster the disease progresses.''Adult-onset HD most often begins between ages 30-50. A few individuals develop HD after age 55. Diagnosis in these people can be very difficult. The symptoms of HD may be masked by or confused with other health problems, or the person may not display the severity of symptoms seen in individuals with HD of earlier onset. These individuals may also show symptoms of ''depression'' rather than anger or irritability, or they may retain sharp control over their intellectual functions, such as memory, reasoning, and problem-solving.''There is also a related disorder called senile chorea. Some elderly individuals develop choreic movements, but do not become demented, have a normal HD gene, and lack a family history of the disorder. Some scientists believe that a different gene mutation may account for this small number of cases, but this has not been proven.''Some individuals develop symptoms of HD before age 20. This is called early-onset or juvenile HD. A common early sign of juvenile HD is a rapid decline in school performance. Movement problems soon become apparent, but they differ from the chorea typically seen in adult-onset HD. One common motor symptom in juvenile HD is myoclonus, which involves rapid involuntary muscle twitches or jerks. Other motor symptoms typical in juvenile HD include slowness, rigidity (in which the muscles remain constantly tense), and ''tremor''. This constellation of symptoms can resemble Parkinson’s disease, and is sometimes called “akinetic-rigid” HD or the Westphal variant of HD. People with juvenile HD may also have ''seizures'' and mental disabilities. The earlier the onset, the faster the disease seems to progress. The disease progresses most rapidly in individuals with juvenile or early-onset HD, and death often follows within 10 years.''Individuals with juvenile HD usually inherit the disease from their fathers, who typically have a later onset form of HD themselves. To verify the link between the number of CAG repeats in the HD gene and the age at onset of symptoms, scientists studied a boy who developed HD symptoms at the age of two, one of the youngest and most severe cases ever recorded. They found that he had nearly 100 repeats. The boy’s case was central to the identification of the HD gene and at the same time helped confirm that juveniles with HD have the longest segments of CAG repeats. This correlation has been confirmed in other studies.' "
How is HD diagnosed?,"'A diagnosis of Huntington’s disease is generally based on findings from neurological, psychological, and genetic testing.''Neurological tests''. A ''neurologist'' will interview the individual intensively to obtain the medical history and rule out other conditions. Tests of neurological and physical functions may review reflexes, balance, movement, muscle tone, ''hearing'', walking, and mental status. A number of laboratory tests may be ordered as well, and individuals with HD may be referred to other health care professionals such as psychiatrists, genetic counselors, clinical neuropsychologists, or speech pathologists for specialized management and/or diagnostic clarification.''A tool used by physicians to diagnose HD is to take the family history, sometimes called a pedigree or genealogy. It is extremely important for family members to be candid and truthful with a professional who is taking a family history since another family member(s) may not have been accurately diagnosed with the disease but thought to have other issues.''Genetic tests''. The most effective and accurate method of testing for HD—called the direct genetic test—counts the number of CAG repeats in the HD gene, using DNA taken from a blood sample. The presence of 36 or more repeats supports a diagnosis of HD. A test result of 26 or fewer repeats rules out HD. A small percentage of individuals will have repeats in a borderline range. For such individuals, doctors may try to get a clearer picture of disease risk by asking other family members to come in for examination and genetic testing.''Prior to the availability of the direct genetic test, clinics used a method called linkage testing. This older method requires a sample of DNA from a closely related affected relative, preferably a parent, for the purpose of identifying markers close to the HD gene. A version of the linkage method is sometimes still used for ''prenatal'' testing.''Diagnostic imaging''. In some cases, especially if a person’s family history and genetic testing are inconclusive, the physician may recommend brain imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or, more likely, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''). As the disease progresses, these scans typically reveal shrinkage of the striatum and parts of the cortex, and enlargement of fluid-filled ''cavities'' within the brain called ventricles. These changes do not necessarily indicate HD, however, because they can occur in other disorders. Conversely, a person can have early symptoms of HD and still have normal findings on a structural CT or MRI scan.' "
"What is predictive testing for Huntington's, and how is it done?","'A predictive or presymptomatic genetic test is an option for someone who has a family history of HD but shows no symptoms. Genetic testing makes it possible to predict with a higher degree of certainty whether or not the person will develop HD.''The decision to undergo presymptomatic testing is a highly personal and often difficult one to make. Common reasons that people choose to take the test include planning for marriage, children, education and career decisions, finances, ''stress'', or simply to relieve uncertainty.''Centers across the U.S. offer genetic testing for HD, as well as pre- and post-test counseling. A list of such centers is available from the Huntington’s Disease Society of America at 1-800-345- HDSA (https://hdsa.org/). With the participation of families with HD, researchers and health professionals have developed guidelines for HD genetic testing. A team of specialists will help the at-risk person decide if testing is the right choice, and will carefully prepare the person for a negative, positive, or inconclusive test result. Whatever the results of genetic testing, the at-risk individual and family members can expect powerful and complex emotional responses. Because receiving test results may prove to be devastating, testing guidelines call for continued counseling even after the test is complete and the results are known.''In order to protect the interests of minors, including confidentiality, testing is not recommended for those under the age of 18 unless there is a compelling medical reason (for example, the child is exhibiting symptoms).' "
Prenatal testing for Huntington's disease,"'Prenatal testing is an option for people who have a family history of HD and are concerned about passing the disease to a child. Before requesting a prenatal test, and even before ''pregnancy'', it is a good idea to seek advice from a genetic counselor. Prenatal testing can be done using either the direct method or the linkage method. As with adult testing, the direct method provides higher certainty. However, in addition to revealing the HD gene status of the fetus, the direct method also reveals the status of the at-risk parent.''Hopeful parents who do want to know their own HD gene status may opt for the linkage method, which is also known as prenatal exclusion testing. This test does not look for the HD gene itself but instead indicates whether or not the fetus has ''inherited'' a chromosome 4 mutation from the affected grandparent. If the mutation is present, the parents then learn that the fetus’s risk is the same as the at-risk parent (50 percent), but they learn nothing new about the parent’s risk. If the test shows that the fetus has inherited a chromosome 4 mutation from the unaffected grandparent, then the fetus has not inherited HD.''A person can have early signs of HD and still have normal findings on a CT or MRI scan.''Another option for parents is ''in vitro fertilization'' (''IVF'') and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Briefly, a woman is given ''fertility'' drugs so that she produces many eggs at once, the eggs are fertilized by the man’s sperm in vitro (literally, “in glass”), and embryos are screened at a very early stage to determine if they carry the HD mutation. Embryos free of the mutation are then implanted in the woman’s uterus. Parents can choose not to know the exact results of genetic testing and thus are not forced to confront their own HD gene status. These procedures are available only at some specialized IVF clinics and require extensive counseling, preparation, and expense.' "
What is the treatment for Huntington's disease?,"'A number of medications may be prescribed to help control emotional and movement problems associated with HD. It is important to remember however, that while medicines may help keep these clinical symptoms under control, there is no treatment to stop or reverse the course of the disease.''Most of the medications available for HD symptoms work by modulating neurotransmitters—the chemical messages that shuttle between neurons. For many of these drugs, their mechanisms of action against HD are not fully understood.''Tetrabenazine, which causes depletion of the neurotransmitter ''dopamine'', is prescribed for treating Huntington’s-associated involuntary movements, as is deutetrabenazine.''Antipsychotic drugs, such as ''risperidone'', ''olanzapine'', or ''haloperidol'', or other drugs such as ''clonazepam'', may help to alleviate choreic movements and may also be used to help control ''hallucinations'', ''delusions'', and violent outbursts. Antipsychotic drugs, however, typically do not help with the muscle contractions associated with ''dystonia'' (involuntary muscle contractions that can cause slow, repetitive movement or abnormal postures), and may in fact worsen the condition, causing ''stiffness'' and rigidity.''For ''depression'', physicians may prescribe ''citalopram'', ''fluoxetine'', ''sertraline'', ''nortriptyline'', or other compounds. Tranquilizers can help control ''anxiety'' and ''lithium'' may be prescribed to combat pathological excitement and severe mood swings.''Drugs used to treat the symptoms of HD may have side effects such as ''fatigue'', sedation, decreased concentration, restlessness, or hyperexcitability, and should be only used when symptoms create problems for the individual. For those on medication, it may be difficult to tell if a particular symptom, such as apathy or ''memory loss'', is a sign of the disease or a drug reaction.' "
What kind of care do people with Huntington's disease need?,"'Cognitive problems are often the first changes that are noticed in HD. Evaluations conducted by clinical neuropsychologists, who specialize in cognitive assessment, can be helpful in clarifying an individual’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses, making safety recommendations and monitoring cognitive changes over time. Education about cognitive symptoms is also helpful for individuals and families. As the disease progresses, it is important to maintain regular daily routines for the person and to provide an environment with minimal distractions. Care should be taken not to isolate individuals who have become slow to engage in conversation or respond to questions. Speech therapy and other communication techniques may improve an individual’s ability to communicate and remain active in family and community life.''It is extremely important for a person with HD to maintain physical ''fitness'' as much as the course of the disease allows. Individuals who ''exercise'' and keep active tend to do better than those who do not. A daily regimen of exercise can help the person feel better physically and mentally. Although their coordination may be poor, individuals should continue walking, with assistance if necessary. Wearing special padding may also help reduce injuries in the event of a fall. Wearing sturdy shoes that fit well can help too, especially shoes without laces that can be slipped on or off easily.''Impaired coordination may make it difficult for people with HD to feed themselves and to swallow. As the disease progresses, people with HD may even choke. In helping individuals to eat, caregivers should allow plenty of time for meals. While some foods may require the addition of thickeners, other foods may need to be thinned. Some individuals may benefit from swallowing therapy, which is especially helpful if started before serious problems arise. Suction cups for plates, special tableware designed for people with disabilities, and ''plastic'' cups with tops can help prevent spilling. The individual’s physician can offer additional advice about ''diet'' and about how to handle swallowing difficulties or gastrointestinal problems that might arise, such as ''incontinence'' or ''constipation''.''Proper ''nutrition'' is needed to ensure the individual with HD takes in enough calories to maintain body weight. Sometimes people with HD, who may ''burn'' as many as 5,000 calories a day through involuntary movements, require five meals a day to take in the necessary number of calories. Physicians may recommend ''vitamins'' or other nutritional ''supplements''. When swallowing and nutritional problems become severe, some individuals and their families choose to use a feeding tube.''Individuals with HD are at special risk for ''dehydration'' and therefore require large quantities of fluids, especially during hot weather. Bendable straws can make drinking easier for the person. In some cases, water may have to be thickened with commercial additives to give it the consistency of syrup or honey.' "
What care resources are available to people with Huntington's and their families?,"'Individuals and families affected by HD can take steps to ensure that they receive the best advice and care possible. Advocacy organizations including the Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) and the Hereditary Disease Foundation are excellent resources with information specific to HD. Some organizations support scientific workshops and research and provide information that enables families, health professionals and investigators to exchange information, learn of available services and benefits, and work toward common goals. HD support groups exist in many states across the country. State and local health service agencies can provide information on community resources and family support groups that may exist. Possible types of help include:''Legal and social aid''. Since HD affects a person’s capacity to reason, make judgments, and handle responsibilities, individuals may need help with legal affairs. Wills and other important documents should be drawn up early to avoid legal problems when the person with HD may no longer be able to represent his or her own interests. Family members should also seek out assistance if they face discrimination regarding insurance, employment, or other matters.''Home care services''. Caring for a person with HD at home can be exhausting, but part-time assistance with household chores or physical care of the individual can ease this burden. Domestic help, meal programs, transportation programs, ''nursing'' assistance, occupational therapy, or other home services may be available from federal, state, or local health service agencies.''Recreation and work centers''. Many people with HD are eager and able to participate in activities outside the home. Therapeutic work and recreation centers give individuals an opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests and to meet new people. Participation in these programs, including occupational, music, and recreational therapy, can reduce the person’s dependence on family members and provides home caregivers with a temporary, much needed break.''Group housing''. A few communities have group housing facilities that are supervised by a resident attendant and that provide meals, housekeeping services, social activities, and local transportation services for residents. These living arrangements are particularly suited to the needs of individuals who are alone and who, although still independent and capable, risk injury when they undertake routine chores like cooking and cleaning.''Institutional care''. The individual’s physical and emotional demands on the family may eventually become overwhelming. While many families may prefer to keep relatives with HD at home whenever possible, a long-term care facility may prove to be best. To hospitalize or place a family member in a care facility is a difficult decision that may require professional counseling.''Finding the proper facility can itself prove difficult. Organizations such as the HDSA may have referrals to facilities that have had experience in the care of individuals with HD. Very few of these exist however, and even fewer have experience with individuals with juvenile or early-onset HD who require special care because of their age and symptoms.' "
What is the latest research on Huntington's disease?,"'The mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world. The NINDS conducts and supports research to better understand and diagnose Huntington’s disease (HD), develop new treatments, and ultimately, prevent HD. The NINDS also supports training for the next generation of HD researchers and clinicians, and serves as an important source of information for people with HD and their families.''NINDS-funded research has played a key role in our understanding of HD—helping to localize the HD-causing gene to chromosome 4 and identifying the mutation that causes HD. These findings have proven invaluable for diagnosis and research, and have enabled neuroscientists to create animal models of the disorder. Signs of HD have been reproduced in fruit flies, mice, and non-human primates by giving the animals one or more copies of the HD mutations found in people. These models are used to study mechanisms of the disease, to identify potential therapeutic strategies, and to move forward with those strategies most likely to work and least likely to cause harm for individuals. Just as important, the gene discovery enables neurologists to recruit individuals who carry the HD gene into clinical studies early—before they become ill.''How do mutations in the HD gene lead to neuronal degeneration? The normal functions of the huntingtin (Htt) protein—the product of the HD gene—have yet to be fully defined, but may include regulating the development of the embryo, transport of molecules and organelles inside nerve cells, and controlling factors that support neuronal health. However, there is very strong evidence that the mutant Htt protein gains one or more new and harmful functions. A major focus of research on HD is to understand the toxicity of mutant huntingtin protein and to develop potential drugs for counteracting it.''People with HD have an abnormal, repetitive, greatly expanded three-letter code, called a CAG repeat, in their DNA sequence. DNA uses a threeletter code (or triplet) to prescribe the order and identity of amino acids—a protein’s building blocks. The triplet “CAG” designates the amino acid glutamine. The repeated CAGs in the normal HD gene are translated into a string of glutamines, called polyglutamine. The mutant HD gene codes for an abnormal form of the Htt protein with much longer polyglutamine repeats that are toxic to neurons. Also, the abnormal polyglutamine sequence affects how the huntingtin protein interacts with other proteins. At least eight other inherited neurological disorders are caused by polyglutamine expansions, each in a different gene.''RNA serves as an intermediate between DNA molecules and proteins; the genetic code within DNA is copied into RNA, which is then used as a template for making proteins. The mutant huntingtin protein RNA may itself be toxic to cells; its numerous repeats can attract and bind essential cellular proteins which thus become unavailable to perform their critical function in processing other RNA molecules from other genes.''NINDS is funding cutting-edge research that aims to eliminate or reduce the production of toxic HD-RNA and huntingtin protein. One potential therapy, called RNA interference, involves designing small bits of synthetic RNA to match, target, and destroy specific RNA molecules inside cells. Researchers have designed interfering RNAs that target HD-RNA and block the production of mutant huntingtin protein, and they have found this approach to be beneficial in mouse models of HD. Such synthetic RNA molecules called antisense oligonucleotides are being developed to be delivered into the cerebrospinal fluid. Others are packaging the RNA into ''viruses'' to deliver into the brain. Pharmaceutical companies are now initiating ambitious trials to test whether this approach may help people with HD.''Aberrant regulation of genes in HD. The abnormal interactions between mutant huntingtin protein and other proteins can have many adverse consequences, including altered gene regulation. Humans have approximately 20,000 genes, about one-third of which are active (or expressed) in the brain at some point in life. Precisely when and where these genes are expressed is controlled by a complex machinery within cells—and mutant Htt can upset this system. For instance, DNA in the cells of higher organisms is packed into chromatin—tight coils of DNA and small proteins called histones. Compounds that block gene expression and coiltightening activity of certain histones have been shown to counteract HD in animal models, and are attractive candidates for drug development. Other alterations in chromatin not only keep some necessary genes shut off, but mutant Htt can also inappropriately turn on other genes, such as those driving excessive inflammation, which damages and kills nerve cells in the brain.''Mutant Htt aggregation. Besides sticking to other proteins, mutant Htt has a tendency to stick to copies of itself and accumulate in clumps known as aggregates. These aggregates can pull in and block the activity of other proteins, and grow to form inclusion bodies—protein deposits inside cells that may overburden the cell’s ability to handle and dispose of old or damaged proteins. Neurons from different brain regions may differ in their efficiency of waste disposal. Neurons in the striatum, the brain region most affected in HD, show the slowest mutant huntingtin clearance rates, perhaps explaining their heightened susceptibility to the disease. Compounds that activate cellular waste handling systems have been shown to reduce the toxicity of mutant Htt in animal models. Recent evidence suggests that mutant huntingtin may also move from cell to cell in a person’s brain and induce aggregates and inclusions in neighboring cells, similar to what is seen in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.''Metabolism and mitochondria. Some studies suggest that mutant Htt interferes with the function of the tiny energy factories inside cells known as mitochondria. Others point to reduced efficiency of antioxidant pathways—protective pathways that scavenge harmful byproducts of brain activity that in normal conditions remain at innocuous levels. In HD some of these pathways are disrupted and the toxic byproducts accumulate to damaging levels. Drugs that inhibit the production of these harmful byproducts or accelerate their clearance have been designed and successfully tested in animal models. However, two NINDS-funded trials investigating any benefit of the metabolic ''supplements'' creatine and ''coenzyme Q10'' in people with HD found no improvements in clinical symptoms at the doses tested.''Excitotoxicity, neural circuits, and survival factors. Researchers have yet to determine why Huntington’s disease has its most severe effects on neurons in the striatum, specifically on a cell type called mediumsized spiny neurons. One culprit may be the brain chemical glutamate, which is produced by neurons in the cerebral cortex and transmits information by exciting (signaling them to turn on) medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Excessive glutamate signaling between these cells may lead to overexcitation of medium spiny neurons in HD. Chronic over-excitation is toxic to neurons (called excitotoxity). Several labs are investigating whether drugs that counteract excitotoxicity might help against HD.''Some of the clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by the ultimate malfunctioning of neuronal circuits rather than by the loss of individual cells. Cutting-edge methods such as optogenetics (where neurons are activated or silenced in the brains of living animals using light beams) are being used to probe the cause and progression of such circuit defects in HD.''In addition to communications exchange, neurons may also provide each other with chemical signals (called trophic factors) that support the health and stability of neural circuits. Cortical neurons provide trophic support by releasing Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which supports the survival of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Evidence suggests that mutant Htt suppresses the production of BDNF. Using animal models, researchers hope to restore BNDF-based trophic support to striatal cells and possibly prevent medium spiny neurons from dying.''Stem cells'' are now a useful tool that helps us understand underlying molecular disease mechanisms.''Pluripotency—the ability of embryonic stem cells to become nerve, muscle, bone, and other cell types—depends on a unique genetic program that is typically shut off in adult cells. Scientists have discovered that it is possible to take adult blood or skin cells and, by activating this genetic program, return the cells to a pluripotent state (called induced pluripotent, or iPS, cells). Through an NINDS-funded consortium, individuals with HD have donated skin and blood samples for research, allowing the creation of iPS cell lines and iPSderived neurons for studying HD. Researchers are using cultures of these cell lines to understand why neurons malfunction and die in HD, and to rapidly test potential new drugs. Their aim is increase the efficiency of turning a person’s iPS cells into medium spiny neurons that reflect the human disease, and then to learn from these disease cells how the CAG-repeat expansion damages their function and viability.''Investigators are studying the effects of transplanting nerve cells derived from embryonic or adult stem cells (immature cells that eventually give rise to all of the body’s cell types) or fetal tissue. A number of small studies found no sustained improvement in transplanting fetus-derived cells into the striatum in people with HD.''In theory, induced pluripotent stem cells could be derived from a person with Huntington’s disease and then implanted into the person’s brain after correcting the HD mutation. However, brain function is dependent upon the correct connections between neurons and currently it is not known how to generate cells to form connections appropriately in a disease such as HD.''An alternative to transplanting stem cells into the brain may be to mobilize stem cells that are already there and shown to move into damaged tissue. Research on rodent models of HD suggests it might be possible to reawaken these cells by delivering specific growth factors to the brain. It is not yet clear whether this strategy will work in humans, as those with HD seem to have significantly fewer and less potent brain stem cells than healthy people.''The NINDS-funded PREDICT-HD study, as well as several international studies (such as REGISTRY, BIOHD, and Enroll-HD), seek to identify biomarkers for HD. Biomarkers are biological changes that can be used to predict, diagnose, or monitor a disease; for example, a sustained rise in blood ''sugar'' is a biomarker for ''diabetes''. One goal of PREDICT-HD is to determine if the progression of the disease correlates with changes in brain scan images, or with chemical changes in blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. Another goal is to find biomarkers characteristic of prediagnostic HD; measurable changes in personality, mood, and cognition that typically precede the appearance motor symptoms of HD.''A large and related NINDS-supported study aims to identify additional genetic factors in people that influence the course of the disease. Individuals with the same CAG expansions can differ widely in the age of disease onset and severity of symptoms. Researchers are trying to identify variations in the genomes of individuals with HD that account for those differences. Finding genetic variants that slow or accelerate the pace of disease progression promise to provide important new targets for disease intervention and therapy.''Studies of cognition, emotional functioning, and movement. Studies of motor problems (abnormal eye movements, chorea, and dystonia), psychiatric symptoms (apathy, psychosis, depression, and irritability), and tests of cognitive skills (learning and memory, attention, concentration, and executive functioning such as multitasking, problem-solving, and planning) may serve to identify when the symptoms of HD appear, and help characterize their range and severity as the disease progresses over time.''Clinical trials'' of drugs''. Testing investigational drugs may lead to new treatments and at the same time improve our understanding of the disease process in HD. Classes of drugs being tested include those that control symptoms, slow the rate of progression of HD, block the effects of excitotoxins, provide support factors that improve neuronal health, or suppress metabolic defects that contribute to the development and progression of HD.''Imaging''. Various imaging technologies allow investigators to view changes in the volume and structures of the brain, and to pinpoint when these changes occur in HD. Positron emission tomography (PET, which visualizes metabolic or chemical abnormalities in the brain) allows scientists to learn how HD affects the chemical systems of the brain. Investigators hope to learn if PET scans can reveal abnormalities that signal HD, as well as to characterize neurons that have died and chemicals that are depleted in parts of the brain of people with HD. Investigators are using functional MRI (fMRI), a form of magnetic resonance imaging that measures changes in the flow of blood-born chemicals known to correlate with brain activity, to understand how HD affects the functioning of different regions of the brain.''Brain structure''. Altered brain development may play an important role in HD. Huntingtin is expressed during embryonic development and throughout life. Studies in animals have shown that the normal HD gene is vital for brain development. Adults who carry the mutant HD gene but have not yet displayed symptoms of the disease show measurable changes in the structure of their brain, even up to 20 years before onset of clinical diagnosis. It is not known when in life these changes become evident. One possibility is that the HD gene causes changes in early brain development that remain throughout life, and initially cause only subtle functional abnormalities.''In an effort to better understand how HD affects brain development, an NINDS-funded study is evaluating brain structure and function in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 6-18) who are at risk for developing the disease because they have a parent or grandparent with HD. Participants who carry the expanded gene will be compared to individuals who carry the gene but have CAG repeats of 39 or less, as well as to individuals who do not have a history of HD in their family. Changes in brain structure and/or function in the gene-expanded group may point to a developmental component in HD.' "
What is Huntington's disease?,"'Huntington’s disease is an ''inherited disease'' that causes the progressive dying off, or degeneration, of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. American physician George Huntington wrote the first thorough description of Huntington’s disease (HD) in 1872, calling it “hereditary chorea” to underscore some of its key features. Chorea1 is derived from the Greek word for dance and describes the uncontrollable dance-like movements seen in people with HD. The hereditary nature of HD helps distinguish it from other types of chorea with infectious, metabolic, or hormonal causes. Understanding the hereditary nature of HD eventually enabled modern researchers to pinpoint the cause of the disease–a mutation or misspelling in a single gene.''More than 30,000 Americans have HD. Although the mutation is present from birth, symptoms of HD typically appear in middle age (adult HD), and in rare cases they appear in children (juvenile HD). The disease, which gets progressively worse, attacks motor control regions of the brain, as well as other areas. Chorea, abnormal body postures, and impaired coordination are among the most visible symptoms. But HD also causes changes in emotion and cognition (thinking) that can be devastating for people with the disorder and for their families.''Although there is no cure for HD, treatments are available to help manage its symptoms and other potential treatments are under investigation to slow or stop its course. And there are now genetic tests available for HD, which gives people at risk for the disease the option to plan for their health and the health of future generations.' "
How does Huntington's affect the brain?,"'The most severe loss of nerve cells (also called neurons) occurs in deep brain structures called the basal ganglia, especially in a part of the basal ganglia called the striatum. The basal ganglia have a variety of functions, including helping to control voluntary (intentional) movement. Subsections of the basal ganglia, called the caudate nuclei and putamen, are most severely affected. Another strongly affected area is the brain’s outer surface, or cerebral cortex, which has important roles in movement, as well as thought, perception, memory, and emotion. As HD progresses over time, neuronal degeneration becomes more widespread throughout the brain. In addition to metabolic changes, there is degeneration in areas of the brain that control hormones.' "
How is Huntington's inherited?,"'HD is passed from parent to child through a mutation in a gene. Genes contain the blueprint for who we are, from our outer appearance to the composition and workings of our internal organs, including the brain. The gene responsible for HD lies on chromosome 4.''When a parent has HD, each child has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the copy of chromosome 4 that carries the HD mutation. If a child does not inherit the HD mutation, he or she will not develop the disease and cannot pass it to subsequent generations. In some families, all the children may inherit the HD gene; in others, none do. Whether one child inherits the gene has no bearing on whether others will or will not share the same fate. A person who inherits the HD mutation and survives long enough will develop the disease.''To understand the HD gene mutation, it helps to know a little more about what genes are and what they do. Genes contain the instructions for making the approximately one million proteins that run everything in our bodies. The HD gene makes an essential protein called ''huntingtin'', whose function is largely unknown but may be necessary for early nerve cell development. Huntingtin is most active in the brain. Genes are composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a long chain-like molecule. The links in a DNA chain are called bases, or nucleotides, and there are four varieties—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—typically abbreviated as A, T, C, and G. Within each gene, a unique combination of these nucleotides serves as a code that determines the gene’s function; changes in the code—such as through a mutation—can change a gene’s function.''The disease-causing mutation inside the HD gene consists of a three-base sequence repeated many times. This type of mutation, called a triplet (or trinucleotide) repeat expansion, is responsible for dozens of other neurological diseases, but in each case the three-base sequence, or triplet, resides within a different gene. The triplet sequences also vary; in HD, the triplet consists of the bases C-A-G. Most people have fewer than 27 CAG repeats in the HD gene and are not at risk for the disease. Individuals with the disease may have 36 or more repeats. People who have repeats in the intermediate range (27-35) are unlikely to develop the disease, but they could pass it on to future generations.''When HD occurs without a family history, it is called sporadic HD. These cases can occur when one parent has an intermediate range of CAG repeats, sometimes called a premutation. Prior to ''conception'' of a child, the number of repeats may expand into the disease-causing range. Most often, these expansions occur in the father’s sperm cells, rather than in the mother’s egg cells. Each time the father’s DNA is copied to make new sperm, there is a possibility for the number of CAG repeats to expand. This increase in disease severity from one generation to the next—with a younger onset and faster progression—is called anticipation.' "
What are the major symptoms and signs of Huntington's?,"'Early signs of the disease vary greatly from person to person, but typically include cognitive or psychiatric symptoms, difficulties with movement, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of Huntington’s disease include:''Behavioral changes''. The individual experiences ''mood swings'' or becomes uncharacteristically irritable, apathetic, passive, ''depressed'', or angry. These symptoms may lessen as the disease progresses or, in some individuals, may continue and include hostile outbursts, thoughts of ''suicide'', deep bouts of ''depression'', and, rarely, psychosis. Social withdrawal is common.''Cognitive/judgment changes''. HD may affect a person’s judgment, attention, and other cognitive functions. Early signs might include having trouble with driving, problem-solving or decision making, prioritizing tasks, and difficulty organizing, learning new things, remembering a fact, putting thoughts into words, or answering a question. Familiar tasks that were simple to complete when healthy now take longer or cannot be done at all. As the disease progresses, these cognitive problems worsen and affected individuals are no longer able to work, drive, or care for themselves. When the level of cognitive impairment is significant enough to impair daily functioning, it is described as ''dementia''. Many people, however, remain aware of their environment and are able to express emotions. Some individuals cannot recognize other family members.''Uncontrolled and difficult movement''. Movement problems may begin with uncontrolled movement in the fingers, feet, face, or trunk. These movements, which are signs of chorea, often intensify when the person is anxious or distracted and become larger and more apparent over time. HD can also begin with mild clumsiness or problems with balance. Some people develop chorea-related movements. Chorea often creates serious problems with ''walking'', increasing the likelihood of falls. Some individuals with HD do not develop chorea; instead, they may become rigid and move very little, or not at all, a condition called akinesia. Others may start out with chorea but become rigid as the disease progresses. In addition to chorea, some individuals have unusual fixed postures, called ''dystonia''. The two movement disorders can blend or alternate. Other symptoms may include ''tremor'' (unintentional rhythmic muscle movement in a back-and-forth manner) and abnormal eye movements that often occur early.''Physical changes''. Speech becomes slurred and vital functions, such as swallowing, eating, speaking, and especially walking, continue to decline. Many people with HD ''lose weight'' as they encounter problems with feeding, swallowing, choking, and chest infections. Other symptoms may include ''insomnia'', loss of energy, and ''fatigue''. Some individuals with HD develop ''seizures''. Eventually the person will be confined to a bed or wheelchair.''In general, the duration of the illness ranges from 10 to 30 years. The most common ''causes of death'' are infection (most often ''pneumonia'') and injuries related to falls.' "
At what age does Huntington's appear?,"'The rate of disease progression and the age at onset vary from person to person. As a general rule, having a higher number of CAG repeats is associated with an earlier onset and faster course of the disease. A common observation is that the earlier the symptoms appear, the faster the disease progresses.''Adult-onset HD most often begins between ages 30-50. A few individuals develop HD after age 55. Diagnosis in these people can be very difficult. The symptoms of HD may be masked by or confused with other health problems, or the person may not display the severity of symptoms seen in individuals with HD of earlier onset. These individuals may also show symptoms of ''depression'' rather than anger or irritability, or they may retain sharp control over their intellectual functions, such as memory, reasoning, and problem-solving.''There is also a related disorder called senile chorea. Some elderly individuals develop choreic movements, but do not become demented, have a normal HD gene, and lack a family history of the disorder. Some scientists believe that a different gene mutation may account for this small number of cases, but this has not been proven.''Some individuals develop symptoms of HD before age 20. This is called early-onset or juvenile HD. A common early sign of juvenile HD is a rapid decline in school performance. Movement problems soon become apparent, but they differ from the chorea typically seen in adult-onset HD. One common motor symptom in juvenile HD is myoclonus, which involves rapid involuntary muscle twitches or jerks. Other motor symptoms typical in juvenile HD include slowness, rigidity (in which the muscles remain constantly tense), and ''tremor''. This constellation of symptoms can resemble Parkinson’s disease, and is sometimes called “akinetic-rigid” HD or the Westphal variant of HD. People with juvenile HD may also have ''seizures'' and mental disabilities. The earlier the onset, the faster the disease seems to progress. The disease progresses most rapidly in individuals with juvenile or early-onset HD, and death often follows within 10 years.''Individuals with juvenile HD usually inherit the disease from their fathers, who typically have a later onset form of HD themselves. To verify the link between the number of CAG repeats in the HD gene and the age at onset of symptoms, scientists studied a boy who developed HD symptoms at the age of two, one of the youngest and most severe cases ever recorded. They found that he had nearly 100 repeats. The boy’s case was central to the identification of the HD gene and at the same time helped confirm that juveniles with HD have the longest segments of CAG repeats. This correlation has been confirmed in other studies.' "
How is HD diagnosed?,"'A diagnosis of Huntington’s disease is generally based on findings from neurological, psychological, and genetic testing.''Neurological tests''. A ''neurologist'' will interview the individual intensively to obtain the medical history and rule out other conditions. Tests of neurological and physical functions may review reflexes, balance, movement, muscle tone, ''hearing'', walking, and mental status. A number of laboratory tests may be ordered as well, and individuals with HD may be referred to other health care professionals such as psychiatrists, genetic counselors, clinical neuropsychologists, or speech pathologists for specialized management and/or diagnostic clarification.''A tool used by physicians to diagnose HD is to take the family history, sometimes called a pedigree or genealogy. It is extremely important for family members to be candid and truthful with a professional who is taking a family history since another family member(s) may not have been accurately diagnosed with the disease but thought to have other issues.''Genetic tests''. The most effective and accurate method of testing for HD—called the direct genetic test—counts the number of CAG repeats in the HD gene, using DNA taken from a blood sample. The presence of 36 or more repeats supports a diagnosis of HD. A test result of 26 or fewer repeats rules out HD. A small percentage of individuals will have repeats in a borderline range. For such individuals, doctors may try to get a clearer picture of disease risk by asking other family members to come in for examination and genetic testing.''Prior to the availability of the direct genetic test, clinics used a method called linkage testing. This older method requires a sample of DNA from a closely related affected relative, preferably a parent, for the purpose of identifying markers close to the HD gene. A version of the linkage method is sometimes still used for ''prenatal'' testing.''Diagnostic imaging''. In some cases, especially if a person’s family history and genetic testing are inconclusive, the physician may recommend brain imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or, more likely, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''). As the disease progresses, these scans typically reveal shrinkage of the striatum and parts of the cortex, and enlargement of fluid-filled ''cavities'' within the brain called ventricles. These changes do not necessarily indicate HD, however, because they can occur in other disorders. Conversely, a person can have early symptoms of HD and still have normal findings on a structural CT or MRI scan.' "
"What is predictive testing for Huntington's, and how is it done?","'A predictive or presymptomatic genetic test is an option for someone who has a family history of HD but shows no symptoms. Genetic testing makes it possible to predict with a higher degree of certainty whether or not the person will develop HD.''The decision to undergo presymptomatic testing is a highly personal and often difficult one to make. Common reasons that people choose to take the test include planning for marriage, children, education and career decisions, finances, ''stress'', or simply to relieve uncertainty.''Centers across the U.S. offer genetic testing for HD, as well as pre- and post-test counseling. A list of such centers is available from the Huntington’s Disease Society of America at 1-800-345- HDSA (https://hdsa.org/). With the participation of families with HD, researchers and health professionals have developed guidelines for HD genetic testing. A team of specialists will help the at-risk person decide if testing is the right choice, and will carefully prepare the person for a negative, positive, or inconclusive test result. Whatever the results of genetic testing, the at-risk individual and family members can expect powerful and complex emotional responses. Because receiving test results may prove to be devastating, testing guidelines call for continued counseling even after the test is complete and the results are known.''In order to protect the interests of minors, including confidentiality, testing is not recommended for those under the age of 18 unless there is a compelling medical reason (for example, the child is exhibiting symptoms).' "
Prenatal testing for Huntington's disease,"'Prenatal testing is an option for people who have a family history of HD and are concerned about passing the disease to a child. Before requesting a prenatal test, and even before ''pregnancy'', it is a good idea to seek advice from a genetic counselor. Prenatal testing can be done using either the direct method or the linkage method. As with adult testing, the direct method provides higher certainty. However, in addition to revealing the HD gene status of the fetus, the direct method also reveals the status of the at-risk parent.''Hopeful parents who do want to know their own HD gene status may opt for the linkage method, which is also known as prenatal exclusion testing. This test does not look for the HD gene itself but instead indicates whether or not the fetus has ''inherited'' a chromosome 4 mutation from the affected grandparent. If the mutation is present, the parents then learn that the fetus’s risk is the same as the at-risk parent (50 percent), but they learn nothing new about the parent’s risk. If the test shows that the fetus has inherited a chromosome 4 mutation from the unaffected grandparent, then the fetus has not inherited HD.''A person can have early signs of HD and still have normal findings on a CT or MRI scan.''Another option for parents is ''in vitro fertilization'' (''IVF'') and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Briefly, a woman is given ''fertility'' drugs so that she produces many eggs at once, the eggs are fertilized by the man’s sperm in vitro (literally, “in glass”), and embryos are screened at a very early stage to determine if they carry the HD mutation. Embryos free of the mutation are then implanted in the woman’s uterus. Parents can choose not to know the exact results of genetic testing and thus are not forced to confront their own HD gene status. These procedures are available only at some specialized IVF clinics and require extensive counseling, preparation, and expense.' "
What is the treatment for Huntington's disease?,"'A number of medications may be prescribed to help control emotional and movement problems associated with HD. It is important to remember however, that while medicines may help keep these clinical symptoms under control, there is no treatment to stop or reverse the course of the disease.''Most of the medications available for HD symptoms work by modulating neurotransmitters—the chemical messages that shuttle between neurons. For many of these drugs, their mechanisms of action against HD are not fully understood.''Tetrabenazine, which causes depletion of the neurotransmitter ''dopamine'', is prescribed for treating Huntington’s-associated involuntary movements, as is deutetrabenazine.''Antipsychotic drugs, such as ''risperidone'', ''olanzapine'', or ''haloperidol'', or other drugs such as ''clonazepam'', may help to alleviate choreic movements and may also be used to help control ''hallucinations'', ''delusions'', and violent outbursts. Antipsychotic drugs, however, typically do not help with the muscle contractions associated with ''dystonia'' (involuntary muscle contractions that can cause slow, repetitive movement or abnormal postures), and may in fact worsen the condition, causing ''stiffness'' and rigidity.''For ''depression'', physicians may prescribe ''citalopram'', ''fluoxetine'', ''sertraline'', ''nortriptyline'', or other compounds. Tranquilizers can help control ''anxiety'' and ''lithium'' may be prescribed to combat pathological excitement and severe mood swings.''Drugs used to treat the symptoms of HD may have side effects such as ''fatigue'', sedation, decreased concentration, restlessness, or hyperexcitability, and should be only used when symptoms create problems for the individual. For those on medication, it may be difficult to tell if a particular symptom, such as apathy or ''memory loss'', is a sign of the disease or a drug reaction.' "
What kind of care do people with Huntington's disease need?,"'Cognitive problems are often the first changes that are noticed in HD. Evaluations conducted by clinical neuropsychologists, who specialize in cognitive assessment, can be helpful in clarifying an individual’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses, making safety recommendations and monitoring cognitive changes over time. Education about cognitive symptoms is also helpful for individuals and families. As the disease progresses, it is important to maintain regular daily routines for the person and to provide an environment with minimal distractions. Care should be taken not to isolate individuals who have become slow to engage in conversation or respond to questions. Speech therapy and other communication techniques may improve an individual’s ability to communicate and remain active in family and community life.''It is extremely important for a person with HD to maintain physical ''fitness'' as much as the course of the disease allows. Individuals who ''exercise'' and keep active tend to do better than those who do not. A daily regimen of exercise can help the person feel better physically and mentally. Although their coordination may be poor, individuals should continue walking, with assistance if necessary. Wearing special padding may also help reduce injuries in the event of a fall. Wearing sturdy shoes that fit well can help too, especially shoes without laces that can be slipped on or off easily.''Impaired coordination may make it difficult for people with HD to feed themselves and to swallow. As the disease progresses, people with HD may even choke. In helping individuals to eat, caregivers should allow plenty of time for meals. While some foods may require the addition of thickeners, other foods may need to be thinned. Some individuals may benefit from swallowing therapy, which is especially helpful if started before serious problems arise. Suction cups for plates, special tableware designed for people with disabilities, and ''plastic'' cups with tops can help prevent spilling. The individual’s physician can offer additional advice about ''diet'' and about how to handle swallowing difficulties or gastrointestinal problems that might arise, such as ''incontinence'' or ''constipation''.''Proper ''nutrition'' is needed to ensure the individual with HD takes in enough calories to maintain body weight. Sometimes people with HD, who may ''burn'' as many as 5,000 calories a day through involuntary movements, require five meals a day to take in the necessary number of calories. Physicians may recommend ''vitamins'' or other nutritional ''supplements''. When swallowing and nutritional problems become severe, some individuals and their families choose to use a feeding tube.''Individuals with HD are at special risk for ''dehydration'' and therefore require large quantities of fluids, especially during hot weather. Bendable straws can make drinking easier for the person. In some cases, water may have to be thickened with commercial additives to give it the consistency of syrup or honey.' "
What care resources are available to people with Huntington's and their families?,"'Individuals and families affected by HD can take steps to ensure that they receive the best advice and care possible. Advocacy organizations including the Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) and the Hereditary Disease Foundation are excellent resources with information specific to HD. Some organizations support scientific workshops and research and provide information that enables families, health professionals and investigators to exchange information, learn of available services and benefits, and work toward common goals. HD support groups exist in many states across the country. State and local health service agencies can provide information on community resources and family support groups that may exist. Possible types of help include:''Legal and social aid''. Since HD affects a person’s capacity to reason, make judgments, and handle responsibilities, individuals may need help with legal affairs. Wills and other important documents should be drawn up early to avoid legal problems when the person with HD may no longer be able to represent his or her own interests. Family members should also seek out assistance if they face discrimination regarding insurance, employment, or other matters.''Home care services''. Caring for a person with HD at home can be exhausting, but part-time assistance with household chores or physical care of the individual can ease this burden. Domestic help, meal programs, transportation programs, ''nursing'' assistance, occupational therapy, or other home services may be available from federal, state, or local health service agencies.''Recreation and work centers''. Many people with HD are eager and able to participate in activities outside the home. Therapeutic work and recreation centers give individuals an opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests and to meet new people. Participation in these programs, including occupational, music, and recreational therapy, can reduce the person’s dependence on family members and provides home caregivers with a temporary, much needed break.''Group housing''. A few communities have group housing facilities that are supervised by a resident attendant and that provide meals, housekeeping services, social activities, and local transportation services for residents. These living arrangements are particularly suited to the needs of individuals who are alone and who, although still independent and capable, risk injury when they undertake routine chores like cooking and cleaning.''Institutional care''. The individual’s physical and emotional demands on the family may eventually become overwhelming. While many families may prefer to keep relatives with HD at home whenever possible, a long-term care facility may prove to be best. To hospitalize or place a family member in a care facility is a difficult decision that may require professional counseling.''Finding the proper facility can itself prove difficult. Organizations such as the HDSA may have referrals to facilities that have had experience in the care of individuals with HD. Very few of these exist however, and even fewer have experience with individuals with juvenile or early-onset HD who require special care because of their age and symptoms.' "
What is the latest research on Huntington's disease?,"'The mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. The NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world. The NINDS conducts and supports research to better understand and diagnose Huntington’s disease (HD), develop new treatments, and ultimately, prevent HD. The NINDS also supports training for the next generation of HD researchers and clinicians, and serves as an important source of information for people with HD and their families.''NINDS-funded research has played a key role in our understanding of HD—helping to localize the HD-causing gene to chromosome 4 and identifying the mutation that causes HD. These findings have proven invaluable for diagnosis and research, and have enabled neuroscientists to create animal models of the disorder. Signs of HD have been reproduced in fruit flies, mice, and non-human primates by giving the animals one or more copies of the HD mutations found in people. These models are used to study mechanisms of the disease, to identify potential therapeutic strategies, and to move forward with those strategies most likely to work and least likely to cause harm for individuals. Just as important, the gene discovery enables neurologists to recruit individuals who carry the HD gene into clinical studies early—before they become ill.''How do mutations in the HD gene lead to neuronal degeneration? The normal functions of the huntingtin (Htt) protein—the product of the HD gene—have yet to be fully defined, but may include regulating the development of the embryo, transport of molecules and organelles inside nerve cells, and controlling factors that support neuronal health. However, there is very strong evidence that the mutant Htt protein gains one or more new and harmful functions. A major focus of research on HD is to understand the toxicity of mutant huntingtin protein and to develop potential drugs for counteracting it.''People with HD have an abnormal, repetitive, greatly expanded three-letter code, called a CAG repeat, in their DNA sequence. DNA uses a threeletter code (or triplet) to prescribe the order and identity of amino acids—a protein’s building blocks. The triplet “CAG” designates the amino acid glutamine. The repeated CAGs in the normal HD gene are translated into a string of glutamines, called polyglutamine. The mutant HD gene codes for an abnormal form of the Htt protein with much longer polyglutamine repeats that are toxic to neurons. Also, the abnormal polyglutamine sequence affects how the huntingtin protein interacts with other proteins. At least eight other inherited neurological disorders are caused by polyglutamine expansions, each in a different gene.''RNA serves as an intermediate between DNA molecules and proteins; the genetic code within DNA is copied into RNA, which is then used as a template for making proteins. The mutant huntingtin protein RNA may itself be toxic to cells; its numerous repeats can attract and bind essential cellular proteins which thus become unavailable to perform their critical function in processing other RNA molecules from other genes.''NINDS is funding cutting-edge research that aims to eliminate or reduce the production of toxic HD-RNA and huntingtin protein. One potential therapy, called RNA interference, involves designing small bits of synthetic RNA to match, target, and destroy specific RNA molecules inside cells. Researchers have designed interfering RNAs that target HD-RNA and block the production of mutant huntingtin protein, and they have found this approach to be beneficial in mouse models of HD. Such synthetic RNA molecules called antisense oligonucleotides are being developed to be delivered into the cerebrospinal fluid. Others are packaging the RNA into ''viruses'' to deliver into the brain. Pharmaceutical companies are now initiating ambitious trials to test whether this approach may help people with HD.''Aberrant regulation of genes in HD. The abnormal interactions between mutant huntingtin protein and other proteins can have many adverse consequences, including altered gene regulation. Humans have approximately 20,000 genes, about one-third of which are active (or expressed) in the brain at some point in life. Precisely when and where these genes are expressed is controlled by a complex machinery within cells—and mutant Htt can upset this system. For instance, DNA in the cells of higher organisms is packed into chromatin—tight coils of DNA and small proteins called histones. Compounds that block gene expression and coiltightening activity of certain histones have been shown to counteract HD in animal models, and are attractive candidates for drug development. Other alterations in chromatin not only keep some necessary genes shut off, but mutant Htt can also inappropriately turn on other genes, such as those driving excessive inflammation, which damages and kills nerve cells in the brain.''Mutant Htt aggregation. Besides sticking to other proteins, mutant Htt has a tendency to stick to copies of itself and accumulate in clumps known as aggregates. These aggregates can pull in and block the activity of other proteins, and grow to form inclusion bodies—protein deposits inside cells that may overburden the cell’s ability to handle and dispose of old or damaged proteins. Neurons from different brain regions may differ in their efficiency of waste disposal. Neurons in the striatum, the brain region most affected in HD, show the slowest mutant huntingtin clearance rates, perhaps explaining their heightened susceptibility to the disease. Compounds that activate cellular waste handling systems have been shown to reduce the toxicity of mutant Htt in animal models. Recent evidence suggests that mutant huntingtin may also move from cell to cell in a person’s brain and induce aggregates and inclusions in neighboring cells, similar to what is seen in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.''Metabolism and mitochondria. Some studies suggest that mutant Htt interferes with the function of the tiny energy factories inside cells known as mitochondria. Others point to reduced efficiency of antioxidant pathways—protective pathways that scavenge harmful byproducts of brain activity that in normal conditions remain at innocuous levels. In HD some of these pathways are disrupted and the toxic byproducts accumulate to damaging levels. Drugs that inhibit the production of these harmful byproducts or accelerate their clearance have been designed and successfully tested in animal models. However, two NINDS-funded trials investigating any benefit of the metabolic ''supplements'' creatine and ''coenzyme Q10'' in people with HD found no improvements in clinical symptoms at the doses tested.''Excitotoxicity, neural circuits, and survival factors. Researchers have yet to determine why Huntington’s disease has its most severe effects on neurons in the striatum, specifically on a cell type called mediumsized spiny neurons. One culprit may be the brain chemical glutamate, which is produced by neurons in the cerebral cortex and transmits information by exciting (signaling them to turn on) medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Excessive glutamate signaling between these cells may lead to overexcitation of medium spiny neurons in HD. Chronic over-excitation is toxic to neurons (called excitotoxity). Several labs are investigating whether drugs that counteract excitotoxicity might help against HD.''Some of the clinical symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by the ultimate malfunctioning of neuronal circuits rather than by the loss of individual cells. Cutting-edge methods such as optogenetics (where neurons are activated or silenced in the brains of living animals using light beams) are being used to probe the cause and progression of such circuit defects in HD.''In addition to communications exchange, neurons may also provide each other with chemical signals (called trophic factors) that support the health and stability of neural circuits. Cortical neurons provide trophic support by releasing Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which supports the survival of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. Evidence suggests that mutant Htt suppresses the production of BDNF. Using animal models, researchers hope to restore BNDF-based trophic support to striatal cells and possibly prevent medium spiny neurons from dying.''Stem cells'' are now a useful tool that helps us understand underlying molecular disease mechanisms.''Pluripotency—the ability of embryonic stem cells to become nerve, muscle, bone, and other cell types—depends on a unique genetic program that is typically shut off in adult cells. Scientists have discovered that it is possible to take adult blood or skin cells and, by activating this genetic program, return the cells to a pluripotent state (called induced pluripotent, or iPS, cells). Through an NINDS-funded consortium, individuals with HD have donated skin and blood samples for research, allowing the creation of iPS cell lines and iPSderived neurons for studying HD. Researchers are using cultures of these cell lines to understand why neurons malfunction and die in HD, and to rapidly test potential new drugs. Their aim is increase the efficiency of turning a person’s iPS cells into medium spiny neurons that reflect the human disease, and then to learn from these disease cells how the CAG-repeat expansion damages their function and viability.''Investigators are studying the effects of transplanting nerve cells derived from embryonic or adult stem cells (immature cells that eventually give rise to all of the body’s cell types) or fetal tissue. A number of small studies found no sustained improvement in transplanting fetus-derived cells into the striatum in people with HD.''In theory, induced pluripotent stem cells could be derived from a person with Huntington’s disease and then implanted into the person’s brain after correcting the HD mutation. However, brain function is dependent upon the correct connections between neurons and currently it is not known how to generate cells to form connections appropriately in a disease such as HD.''An alternative to transplanting stem cells into the brain may be to mobilize stem cells that are already there and shown to move into damaged tissue. Research on rodent models of HD suggests it might be possible to reawaken these cells by delivering specific growth factors to the brain. It is not yet clear whether this strategy will work in humans, as those with HD seem to have significantly fewer and less potent brain stem cells than healthy people.''The NINDS-funded PREDICT-HD study, as well as several international studies (such as REGISTRY, BIOHD, and Enroll-HD), seek to identify biomarkers for HD. Biomarkers are biological changes that can be used to predict, diagnose, or monitor a disease; for example, a sustained rise in blood ''sugar'' is a biomarker for ''diabetes''. One goal of PREDICT-HD is to determine if the progression of the disease correlates with changes in brain scan images, or with chemical changes in blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. Another goal is to find biomarkers characteristic of prediagnostic HD; measurable changes in personality, mood, and cognition that typically precede the appearance motor symptoms of HD.''A large and related NINDS-supported study aims to identify additional genetic factors in people that influence the course of the disease. Individuals with the same CAG expansions can differ widely in the age of disease onset and severity of symptoms. Researchers are trying to identify variations in the genomes of individuals with HD that account for those differences. Finding genetic variants that slow or accelerate the pace of disease progression promise to provide important new targets for disease intervention and therapy.''Studies of cognition, emotional functioning, and movement. Studies of motor problems (abnormal eye movements, chorea, and dystonia), psychiatric symptoms (apathy, psychosis, depression, and irritability), and tests of cognitive skills (learning and memory, attention, concentration, and executive functioning such as multitasking, problem-solving, and planning) may serve to identify when the symptoms of HD appear, and help characterize their range and severity as the disease progresses over time.''Clinical trials'' of drugs''. Testing investigational drugs may lead to new treatments and at the same time improve our understanding of the disease process in HD. Classes of drugs being tested include those that control symptoms, slow the rate of progression of HD, block the effects of excitotoxins, provide support factors that improve neuronal health, or suppress metabolic defects that contribute to the development and progression of HD.''Imaging''. Various imaging technologies allow investigators to view changes in the volume and structures of the brain, and to pinpoint when these changes occur in HD. Positron emission tomography (PET, which visualizes metabolic or chemical abnormalities in the brain) allows scientists to learn how HD affects the chemical systems of the brain. Investigators hope to learn if PET scans can reveal abnormalities that signal HD, as well as to characterize neurons that have died and chemicals that are depleted in parts of the brain of people with HD. Investigators are using functional MRI (fMRI), a form of magnetic resonance imaging that measures changes in the flow of blood-born chemicals known to correlate with brain activity, to understand how HD affects the functioning of different regions of the brain.''Brain structure''. Altered brain development may play an important role in HD. Huntingtin is expressed during embryonic development and throughout life. Studies in animals have shown that the normal HD gene is vital for brain development. Adults who carry the mutant HD gene but have not yet displayed symptoms of the disease show measurable changes in the structure of their brain, even up to 20 years before onset of clinical diagnosis. It is not known when in life these changes become evident. One possibility is that the HD gene causes changes in early brain development that remain throughout life, and initially cause only subtle functional abnormalities.''In an effort to better understand how HD affects brain development, an NINDS-funded study is evaluating brain structure and function in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 6-18) who are at risk for developing the disease because they have a parent or grandparent with HD. Participants who carry the expanded gene will be compared to individuals who carry the gene but have CAG repeats of 39 or less, as well as to individuals who do not have a history of HD in their family. Changes in brain structure and/or function in the gene-expanded group may point to a developmental component in HD.' "
How do hurricanes form?,"'A hurricane is an intense low-pressure weather system with winds of 74 or more miles per hour. It is a type of cyclone that generally forms in the tropics. Thunderstorms accumulate into a tropical ''depression'' which begins to rotate as it gets bigger over warm tropical water. The tropical ''depression'' grows bigger and gains strength, eventually turning into a hurricane. These storms are defined by high wind speeds, with accompanying rain, possible storm surges, flooding and tornadoes.' "
How are hurricanes categorized?,"'Hurricanes are categorized according to wind speeds based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The weakest hurricanes are Category 1, defined by wind speeds starting at 74 miles per hour and storm surges of 4 to 6 ''feet''. The scale ranges to a Category 5 where wind speeds are in excess of 155 miles per hour, and storm surges can reach 18 feet or more.' "
How dangerous are hurricanes?,"'All hurricanes are dangerous. Even the lowest category hurricanes can produce flying debris, standing water hazards, and tornadoes.' "
What is the National Hurricane Center's role?,"'The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is a division of The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that predicts, names, and tracks tropical weather systems. They issue watches and warnings during the Atlantic and northeast Pacific hurricane seasons, and make predictions on tropical weather outlooks for those areas.''When a tropical storm or hurricane is possible within 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center issues a watch, indicating that storm conditions may occur in the area. When a tropical storm or hurricane is expected within 36 hours, the NHC issues a warning, indicating storm conditions are expected for the area. Watches and warnings are given by The National Weather Service and on NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards (NWR).' "
How are hurricanes named and tracked?,"'A tropical storm that may become a hurricane is a type of weather system that is tracked to help minimize loss of life. When wind speeds reach 39 miles per hour (tropical storm wind speed), these weather systems are named. Naming helps facilitate warning and tracking services communicate storm information to the public, and reduces ''confusion'' when there is more than one storm occurring at the same time. If the named tropical storm reaches 74 or more miles per hour, the tropical storm is reclassified as a hurricane.'""In 1953, the National Hurricane Center originated a naming list, which is now maintained by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization. The lists are alphabetical, alternating between men's and women's names. The lists rotate every 6 years. If a hurricane results in significant damage or death, the name is usually retired and not used again. A complete list of hurricane names is available at the ""'National Weather Service National Hurricane Center''.'""Hurricanes are tracked by the National Hurricane Center. There are many factors that go into tracking a hurricane, including atmospheric conditions, water temperatures, and even historical information. Computer models use this data to predict what track a storm will take. Tracking has become more precise over the years and usually predictions are relatively accurate 24 hours prior to the storm. Many computer-generated models attempt to predict a hurricane's path up to five days prior. However, beyond a day or two, these predictions become less accurate. Individuals living in an area that may be impacted by a hurricane should heed all local warnings."" "
How do you prepare for a hurricane?,"'The best way to prepare for a hurricane is to have a plan before hurricane season starts, so you will know what your family needs to have, where to go if you need to evacuate, and what you need to do to protect your home. Below are suggestions for your family hurricane plan and supplies.' "
Have a family plan for a hurricane,"'The National Hurricane Center suggests having a family disaster plan that is written down and discussed with all family members before a storm approaches. Create a checklist for all the things you will need to do in the event of an approaching storm.' Know how vulnerable your home may be to storm surge, flooding and winds. Make sure you have flood insurance. Know your Zone. In areas that can be affected by hurricanes, local emergency management assigns Zones (areas of a city or county, often based on zip codes) in the event evacuation is suggested (or required). Usually the first to evacuate are those closest to the water (storm surge susceptible: for example, Zone A) and those in mobile homes. If you are not required to evacuate, know which rooms in your house are safest to weather out the storm (usually interior rooms without windows). If you must evacuate, determine in advance your evacuation route and where you will go. If you need to evacuate, plan ahead in regard to what to do with your pets. If you need to evacuate, most hurricane shelters do not permit animals, and those that do often require advance registration. Have a family emergency communication plan if your family separates. The Office of Homeland Security has a communication plan outline. If you are not in an evacuation zone and you decide to stay in your home, make sure you have enough food, medications, pet supplies, water, and other items you will need for at least three days in case you lose power and water and you are unable to leave your area due to blocked roads or flooding. Consider purchasing a portable generator you can use in the event of power loss. Prepare your home: trim or remove tree limbs, secure rain gutters, reinforce your roof and doors, and put up shutters over the windows or install hurricane-proof windows. Stock non-perishable emergency supplies and a Disaster Supply Kit (see Supply Kit information). Use a NOAA weather radio and make sure you have extra batteries (preferably fresh or new ones still in the package). Take locally offered or Internet based First Aid, CPR, and disaster preparedness classes."
What supplies do I need for a hurricane supply kit?,"'A hurricane supply kit should be prepared in advance of the storm season, should be easily accessible in case you need to evacuate, and should contain items you will need to ride out a storm, no matter where you are.''The National Hurricane Center suggests the following:' Water: at least 1 gallon daily per person for 3 to 7 days Food: for 3 to 7 days. Include non-perishable items, food for infants Blankets and pillows Clothing First Aid Kit 
	Prescription drugs: (enough for at least one to two weeks) Toiletries (toothbrushes, 
	toothpaste, deodorant, soap, etc.) Flashlight, radio, fresh batteries Telephones: Fully charge cell phones before the storm in case of power outage, with an extra battery if you have one Cash (including small bills) and credit cards: Banks and ATMs may not be available for extended periods of time after the storm Keys to the home, vehicles, sheds Toys, books, and games for children to keep them occupied Important documents in a waterproof container or watertight resealable plastic bag Tools: keep a set of tools with you during the storm Vehicle fuel tanks filled Pet care items (see list in this article)"
Where can I go to be safe during a hurricane?,"""Part of your hurricane preparedness plan should include where to go in the event you need to evacuate your home. Follow instructions of local authorities and evacuate if required. If possible, leave the area before officials issue an order to evacuate, to avoid traffic delays. Ideally, safe places are out of the storm's predicted path, in a structure certified safe against hurricane-force winds (in case the storm path shifts), and are not susceptible to the high tides and storm surges associated with hurricanes; the structure should have emergency food, water, and a backup power source available.""""Make sure your vehicle's ""'gas'' tank is filled beforehand as traffic jams are common, and in the past people have abandoned their vehicles because they ran out of gas and no available gas stations were open for business.''If you plan to stay in a hotel (see above requirements for safe places to stay), keep in mind those closest to your area may fill up quickly. Book ahead and leave early, before the storm begins or before the hotel assigns the booking to someone else because you were late for check-in.''If you plan to stay with friends or family, discuss plans ahead of time, before hurricane season starts.''As a last resort, go to a hurricane shelter. Remember, shelters will be crowded and are not designed for comfort. Bring your disaster kit supplies with you. Most shelters do not accept pets.''During a storm, it is never safe to leave a protective shelter because of the high probability of being hit by flying debris or being knocked off your feet by winds or water surges; continue to listen to the emergency radio broadcasts as they will indicate when it is safe to go outside. Although venturing outside is tempting if the storm\'s ""eye"" or center passes over (the eye contains much calmer wind conditions), the storm\'s furious conditions can be back in a matter of minutes as the eye moves away from your location and you could be cut off from returning to your shelter.' "
How do I secure my home during a hurricane?,"'The best thing you can do to reduce damage to home and property is to protect areas where wind can enter. If you have hurricane shutters, install them before the storm. Never go outside during a storm to put up shutters. ''Reinforce roofs, straps, shutters, doors, and garage doors. If possible, you can reinforce these areas when doing other home improvement or renovation. Check local building codes. For more information on retrofitting your home, visit ''The National Hurricane Center''. '""Flood damage is usually not covered by homeowners insurance in some areas.

What to do after a hurricane (hurricane aftermath health concerns),"'How can I store food safely?''A refrigerator will keep foods cool for about 4 hours without power if it is unopened.''Thawed food can usually be eaten if it is still ""refrigerator ''cold'',"" or re-frozen if it still contains ice crystals. Discard any food that has been at temperatures greater than 40 F (4.44 C) for 2 hours or more, and any food that has an unusual odor, color, or texture. Eat foods that are likely to spoil first, such as meats and dairy, to minimize waste; however it is better to dispose of foods if there is any question about its safety or contamination status.''If the power is out for longer than 4 hours, follow the guidelines below:' Use dry ice, if available: 25 pounds of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide or CO2) will keep a ten-cubic-foot freezer below freezing for 3 to 4 days. Use care when handling dry ice, do not allow it to touch skin because it can cause frostbite and do not it in confine areas where CO2 gas can accumulate. For the freezer section: A freezer that is half full will hold food safely for up to 24 hours. A full freezer will hold food safely for 48 hours. Do not open the freezer door unless it is absolutely necessary. Before the storm, you can fill water bottles or empty soda bottles with water and freeze them to help keep the freezer full and cold. For the refrigerated section: Pack dairy products, meat, fish, eggs, gravy, and spoilable leftovers into a cooler surrounded by ice. Discard this food if it seems spoiled. Use a digital quick-response thermometer to check the temperature of the food right before you cook or eat it."
How can I make sure our water is safe?,"'Hurricanes, especially if accompanied by a tidal surge or flooding, can contaminate the public water supply, which can cause illness. Do not assume water in a hurricane-affected area is safe to drink.''Listen for public announcements about the safety of the municipal water supply. Use bottled water for eating or drinking. If you do not have bottled water, and are not sure that your tap water is safe, follow these directions to purify tap water published by the government for public information:''The bleach method may not kill all parasites and the filter methods must be followed carefully; people need to read the directions carefully to produce the safest possible drinking water.''If there is flooding along with a hurricane, local waterways may become polluted with waste. There is risk of disease from eating or drinking anything contaminated with floodwater.'""Do not allow children to play in floodwater areas. Wash children's hands frequently and disinfect any toys that have come into contact with flood waters, using a solution of one cup of bleach in five gallons of water."" Filter the water using a piece of cloth or coffee filter to remove solid 
particles. Disinfect using one of the following methods: Boiling: Boil water vigorously for 1 minute. To improve taste, pour from one 
clean container to another several times to aerate. Allow water to cool for 30 minutes before 
using. Purification tablets: Purification tablets are available at most drugstores or camping supply 
stores. Follow directions supplied on the packaging. Filters: Use a ""backpacking"" type filter and follow the directions on the 
filter. Bleach purification: Liquid household bleach can be used for water 
disinfection. The only active ingredient in the bleach should be sodium hypochlorite of the 
concentration of 5.25% to 6%. There should not be any added soap or fragrances. (A major 
bleach manufacturer has also added sodium hydroxide as an active ingredient, which 
they state does not pose a health risk for water treatment.) Add bleach to the water 
according to the amounts listed in the table below. Stir to mix and let stand 30 minutes prior 
to using."
How do I perform first aid for injuries?,"'First aid is extremely important when someone is exposed to waters potentially contaminated with human, animal, or toxic wastes. ' If you live in a hurricane-prone area, take a community-based first aid 
course, such as those offered by the American Red Cross. If you are injured, contact a physician if possible to determine the 
necessary type of treatment (for example, need for
	tetanus shot).  Immediately clean out all open wounds and cuts with soap and clean water. 
	 Apply an antibiotic ointment to wounds and cuts if available to discourage infection. 
	Take care to assure the affected individual is not allergic to the compound. If a wound develops redness, swelling, or drainage, seek immediate medical 
attention.  If you are not sure what to do for yourself or someone else, seek help 
	immediately."
What can I do to cope with mental stress after a hurricane?,"""The days and weeks after a hurricane may be emotionally difficult. In addition to an individual's physical health, the mental health of those affected by the hurricane need to be considered. If you or someone you know has been affected by a hurricane feel any of these symptoms acutely (suddenly), seek counseling. Otherwise, some ""'sleeplessness'', ''anxiety'', anger, ''hyperactivity'', mild ''depression'', or lethargy are normal, and may resolve with time.''State and local health departments will help you find local resources, including hospitals or health care practitioners that you or someone you know may need.''Individual responses to a threatening or potentially traumatic event vary from person to person. Emotional reactions may include feelings of fear, ''grief'', and ''depression''. Physical and behavioral responses might include ''nausea'', ''dizziness'', changes in appetite and ''sleep'' patterns, as well as withdrawal from daily activities. Responses to ''trauma'' can last for weeks to months before people start to feel normal again.''Seek medical care if you or someone you know becomes injured, feels sick, or experiences ''stress'' and ''anxiety''.''There are many things that can be done to cope with traumatic events including:' Keep as many elements of a normal routine incorporated into the disaster 
plans as possible, including activities to allay children's fears.  Be aware that there may be a lack of resources to resolve daily 
	emotional conflicts. Try to resolve any major emotional conflicts ahead of 
	time if possible.  Turn to family, friends, and important social or religious contacts to 
set-up support networks to help deal with the potential stressors.  Let children know that it is okay to feel upset when something bad or 
scary happens.  Encourage children to express their feelings and thoughts, without making 
judgments. "
How can I prevent injuries after a hurricane?,"'When the wind and waters recede, people in the areas affected by a hurricane will continue to face a number of hazards associated with cleanup activities. Follow these guidelines to prevent injury.''Long hours of work, combined with exhaustion, can create a highly stressful situation during cleanup. People working on hurricane and flood cleanup can reduce their risks of injury and illness in several ways:''For most work in flooded areas, wear hard hats, goggles, heavy work gloves, and watertight boots with steel toe and insole (not just steel shank). ''Wear earplugs or protective headphones to reduce noise induced ''hearing'' risk from equipment noise. Equipment such as chain saws, backhoes, and professional dryers may cause ''ringing in the ears'' (''tinnitus'') and subsequent hearing damage.''Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is poisonous to breathe. During flood cleanup, operate all gasoline-powered devices such as pumps, generators, and pressure washers outdoors and never bring them inside a building or home. This will help to ensure the safety from carbon monoxide poisoning for everyone.''Never assume that water-damaged structures or the ground are stable. Buildings that have been submerged or have withstood rushing flood waters may have suffered structural damage and could be dangerous. ''Flood waters can dislodge tanks, drums, pipes, and equipment which may contain hazardous materials such as pesticides or propane.''Fire can pose a major threat to an already badly damaged flood area. Fire protection systems may be inoperative, the fire department response may be hampered and water supplies may be inoperable. ''Make sure you have at least one working fire extinguisher in your home. Natural gas lines may be disrupted; leave any area that has an unusual smell, notify the gas and fire departments, and do not use power equipment in the area as any sparks could cause fire or explosions if a gas line is broken and leaking. '""Use care operating a home powered generator, and always follow the manufacturer's instructions including operating the generator outdoors. ""'When entering moving water, you are at risk for ''drowning'' regardless of your ability to swim. Individuals in vehicles are at the greatest risk of drowning, so it is important to comply with all hazard warnings on roadways and to avoid driving vehicles or heavy equipment into water of an unknown depth. NIOSH recommends you avoid working alone and wear a Coast Guard-approved life jacket when working in or near flood waters.''Never walk into standing water after a storm, as you do not know how deep the water may be, or if there are active electrical lines hidden underneath. ''While cleaning up after the hurricane, you are at risk for developing ''heat-related illness'' from working in hot environments where hurricanes form.''To reduce heat-related illness risks:' Set priorities for cleanup tasks and pace the work. Avoid physical 
exhaustion.  Resume a normal sleep schedule as quickly as possible. 
	 Be alert to emotional exhaustion or strain. Consult family members, friends, 
or professionals for emotional support.  If water has been present anywhere near electrical circuits and electrical 
equipment, turn off the power at the main breaker or fuse on the service panel. 
Do not turn the power back on until electrical equipment has been inspected by a 
qualified electrician.  Never enter any area with standing water or touch electrical equipment if 
the ground is wet, unless you are certain that the power is off. NEVER handle a 
downed power line.  When using gasoline and diesel generators to supply power to a building, 
switch the main breaker or fuse on the service panel to the ""off"" position prior 
to starting the generator.  If clearing debris or other work must be performed near a downed power line, 
contact the utility company before entering the area to do work. Extreme caution 
is necessary when moving ladders and other equipment near overhead power lines 
to avoid inadvertent contact.  Don't work in or around any flood-damaged building until it has been 
examined and certified as safe for work by a registered professional engineer or 
architect.  Assume all stairs, floors, and roofs are unsafe until they are inspected. 
	 Leave immediately if shifting or unusual noises are heard if you are in 
	an area as they may 
signal a possible collapse.  Do not attempt to move unidentified dislodged containers without first 
contacting the local fire department or hazardous materials team.  If working in potentially contaminated areas, avoid skin contact or 
inhalation of vapors by wearing appropriate protective clothing and respirators. 
	 Frequently and thoroughly wash areas of skin that may have been exposed to 
pesticides and other hazardous chemicals.  Contact the 
	National Institute for 
	Occupational Safety and Health.  drink a glass of fluid every 15 to 20 minutes wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing take frequent rest breaks work during the cooler hours of the day"
How do I deal with wild and domestic animals in a disaster?,"'Be cautious of wild or stray animals. They may be disoriented and dangerous following a hurricane or flood. Try to confine the animal without putting yourself at risk of being bitten. Call the Animal Control agency in your county if you find or come across a wild or domestic animal. Rising water in hurricanes displace snakes which may seek the same higher drier ground that people, pets and other animals may occupy. Be aware of this hazard and avoid any reptiles.''Wild and domestic animals may escape or be killed in disasters. Escaped animals may wander onto land where they may:''Decaying carcasses create biologic waste, may contaminate groundwater, cause foul odors, and attract flies and rodents, which can spread disease. Animal carcasses should be disposed of as soon as possible to avoid creating a health hazard to animals or humans. Contact your local animal control department or local health department for specific disposal guidance.

What is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)?,"'Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disease of two body systems, the blood stream and the kidney. ''Hemolysis'' describes the destruction of red blood cells. In hemolytic uremic syndrome, blood within capillaries, the smallest blood vessels in the body, begins to clot abnormally. When red blood cells pass through the clogged capillaries, they are sheared apart and broken. (hemo = blood + lysis = destruction). The second failed system, kidney failure (uremia), occurs when urea and other waste products build up in the bloodstream because the kidneys cannot filter and dispose of them. (urea = a waste chemical + emia = in the blood).''HUS is also related to another disease caused by a similar normal clotting process within the capillaries called thrombotic thrombocytic purpura (TTP). Within the medical literature, these two conditions are often considered together. HUS is more widely known, however, because it has been discussed in the press because of its relationship to a special type of ''E. Coli'' (''Escherichia coli'') infection associated with ''food poisoning''.''HUS can be classified as typical or atypical. The typical type is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms including ''vomiting'' and ''diarrhea''. Atypical HUS is not associated with GI symptoms.' "
What causes hemolytic uremic syndrome?,"'While the cause of HUS has not been established with certainty, researchers believe that an abnormal inflammatory reaction is stimulated in the blood stream causing platelets (the parts of the blood that form clots) to sludge in small blood vessels and form ''blood clots'' where they are not supposed to. This uses up the platelets and causes a shortage of them in the rest of the body. This abnormal reaction may be caused by a yet unidentified chemical that is produced in blood plasma (the fluid or non-cellular part of the bloodstream).''The triggering events for HUS are varied and include:''Only the diarrheal form of HUS is considered to be typical HUS and is usually a disease of infants and children younger than 3 years of age.''The others are classified as atypical HUS and also include the familial form of the disease in which a gene mutation affects the blood clotting mechanism.'  
	Enterohemorrhagic E. Coli is a type of bacteria that causes 
	bloody diarrhea. 
	E. coli is a very common type of bacteria in the body, and it is only 
the OH157:H7 type that causes the problem. It can be found in undercooked meat 
and other foods; and is one of the causes of food recalls and restaurant-related 
food poisoning outbreaks. This accounts for almost 90% of HUS in children. The 
	2011 outbreak of HUS in Germany was due to a different type of Shigela 
	toxin-producing E. coli called 0104:H4.  Pregnancy and the early postpartum (after delivery) time period and the use 
of birth control pills are the more common associations with HUS. Pneumonia caused by the 
	Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria is another 
possible precipitating factor. HUS is rare complication of this common 
infection. Most often, this pneumonia is treated with antibiotics as an 
outpatient. However, it is the cause of 40% of atypical HUS. Medications may be also associated with HUS, including some chemotherapy 
and immunosuppression drugs, birth control pills,
	ticlopidine (Ticlid, 
	an anti-platelet drug) and
	quinine (Quinerva, 
	Quinite) an anti-platelet drug. AIDS may be associated with HUS."
What are the signs and symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome?,"'In typical HUS, ''gastroenteritis'' occurs with abdominal cramping, vomiting and profuse bloody, watery ''diarrhea'', as a symptom up to a week before the onset of HUS. This may cause significant ''dehydration'', weakness and lethargy, as well as ''electrolyte'' imbalances because of the loss of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the vomit and diarrhea. These symptoms may resolve before the onset of anemia and the ''kidney failure symptoms'' of HUS.''The anemia and uremia usually present with weakness, lethargy, and sleepiness. ''Seizures'' may occur. Purpura or small areas of bleeding in the skin may be seen because of low platelet counts (''thrombocytopenia'').'  "
How is hemolytic uremic syndrome diagnosed?,"'The health care professional will have a suspicion of the disease based on the history and physical examination, especially in a small child who has had the typical bloody diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory tests help confirm the diagnosis. These abnormal findings may include:''In atypical HUS, history is very important to search for other potential causes of the disease. Unfortunately, the case may not be found in up to half of cases of atypical HUS.''One of the distinguishing findings between HUS and TTP is a normal neurologic examination. The brain function is normal in HUS.' Hemolytic anemia: the red blood cell count is low and a peripheral blood 
smear, in which blood is examined under a microscope, will show that the red 
cells have been damaged and destroyed. This differentiates hemolysis (hemo=blood 
+ lysis=destruction) from anemia caused by decreased production of blood cells 
in the bone marrow. Thrombocytopenia: a low platelet count Uremia: Kidney function can be measured by testing the level of 
	waste products in the blood normally filtered by the kidney. BUN (blood urea 
	nitrogen) and creatinine are measures of this kidney function. When levels 
	rise, it is an indication of kidney failure or uremia in which the kidneys 
	cannot clear the waste products of metabolism from the body. Abnormal urine findings: Blood and protein may be found in the urine when 
normally they are not present. Stool cultures: Since E. coli O157:O7 is the most common 
	cause of HUS in children; attempts are made to culture the bacteria from 
	stool samples. 
	The body usually clears the bacteria from the stool within a week, so a 
	negative test does not exclude the disease. A positive test helps confirm 
	HUS and will be reported to public health authorities to try to determine 
	the source of the infection. In 2011, outbreaks in Europe were traced by 
	public health authorities to tainted sprouts."
What is the treatment for hemolytic uremic syndrome?,"  Typical HUS in children tends to be self-limiting, and supportive care is often all that is needed. This may include intravenous fluids for rehydration and rebalancing of electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which can be lost with the diarrhea. Blood transfusions are only used for the most severe cases of anemia in which the hemoglobin falls below 6 or 7 g/dL (depending on age, the normal value is 11-16). Kidney failure may be managed expectantly (by observation and supportive care), and dialysis is not often required. Adults with atypical HUS tend to become more ill and need more aggressive therapy than children with the condition. In addition to the supportive care discussed above, plasmapheresis or plasma exchange may be required. Since it is thought there is an abnormal chemical in the plasma stimulating the abnormal clot formation, removing the plasma and replacing it with donor plasma is helpful in treating adult HUS. Dialysis may be needed while awaiting recovery of the kidneys from the illness. Eculizumab (Soliris) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of atypical HUS. It is a monoclonal antibody that decreases the blood clotting in the capillary blood vessels, decreasing the potential destruction of cells. This type of therapy decreases the body's immune capabilities, and the risk of infection increases."
What is the prognosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome?," Typical HUS in children tends to be self-limiting, and full recovery is most likely. Adults do less well. Without aggressive therapy like plasmapheresis and dialysis, up to 25% of those affected with atypical HUS may die in the acute phase of the disease, and 50% may have developed long-term kidney impairment. Patients with HUS not related to a diarrheal illness have a worse prognosis than those whose illness is due to gastrointestinal infection. In those patients with genetically caused HUS, relapsing illness is common as are kidney failure requiring dialysis and death."
How can hemolytic uremic syndrome be prevented?,"'Most cases of typical HUS associated with diarrhea can be prevented by thorough washing and cooking of food products. The vast majority of cases of typical HUS are caused by poor food handling from the farmer to the wholesaler and grocer. Proper washing and cooking techniques in the kitchen is the key to ''prevention''. ''Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent atypical HUS.' "
Facts you should know about a hydrocele," While hydroceles may occur in either gender, they are much more common in males. A hydrocele is a collection of clear fluid in a thin walled sack present in the scrotum. Hydroceles may be either one sided or occupy both sides. Hydroceles are painless, soft swellings and may be either present at birth (congenital) or develop later. A very large majority of hydroceles present at birth resolve spontaneously by one year of age. Hydroceles that are not congenital or those still present after one year of age may need surgical correction. There are other conditions that must be considered when evaluating a boy with chronic, non-tender scrotal swelling. These include hernia, varicocele and tumor. Physical examination is very helpful in sorting through these options. Rarely are diagnostic or invasive studies necessary."
What is a hydrocele?,"'A hydrocele is a scrotal collection of clear fluid (""hydro"" = water) in a thin walled sack (""cele"" = swelling) that also contains the testicle. Less frequently, due to the common embryological background of male and female gonadal structures, female children or women may also experience a hydrocele. In this case, the sack and connection exist in the labia majora (the outermost and larger of the two labial structures). Because of less potential concern for complications in females with hydroceles, this article will focus predominantly on the male gender. A hydrocele may involve either one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral) of the scrotum.' "
What causes hydroceles?,"'Between the 28th and 36th week of gestation, the testes, associated blood vessels and nerves migrate from the upper posterior abdominal wall adjacent to the kidneys to the lower abdominal ''cavity'' and through a tunnel (inguinal canal) into the scrotum. As each gonad exits the pelvic region through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, it is preceded by a thinly lined ""sack"" called the process vaginalis. Once the testes and associated structures have entered the scrotum, the trailing end of the process vaginalis generally closes off, completely isolating the contents of the abdominal ''cavity'' and obstructing their passage into the inguinal canal or scrotum. Should this closure be incomplete and the communication narrow, free fluid in the abdominal cavity (peritoneal fluid) may seep into and through the process vaginalis and collect in the scrotum forming a hydrocele. If the connection is larger and a portion of the small intestine migrates out of the abdominal cavity into the inguinal canal and/or scrotum, a ''hernia'' has developed.' "
"What are the signs, symptoms, and types of hydroceles?","'A hydrocele is characterized as a non-painful, soft ''swelling of the scrotum'' (one or both sides). The overlying skin is not tender or inflamed. There are two types of hydroceles:'   communicating, and non-communicating."
Communicating hydroceles,"'Communicating hydroceles are present at birth and occur as a consequence of the failure of the ""tail"" end of the process vaginalis to completely close off. Peritoneal fluid (free fluid in the abdominal cavity) is thus free to pass into the scrotum in which the process vaginalis surrounds the testicle.''A characteristic feature of communicating hydroceles is their tendency to be relatively small in the morning (having been horizontal during ''sleep'') and increase in size during the day (peritoneal fluid drainage assisted by gravity). Actions which increase intra-abdominal pressure (for example, crying, straining, severe ''coughing'', etc.) will also tend to increase the size of the hydrocele.' "
Non-communicating hydroceles,"'Non-communicating hydroceles may also be present at birth or develop as a boy matures. In a non-communicating hydrocele the tail end of the process vaginalis has closed appropriately. The fluid surrounding the testicle is created by the lining cells of the process vaginalis and is unable to either drain or be reabsorbed efficiently and thus accumulates. Since this fluid is walled off, the size of the hydrocele is generally stable and does not reflect intra abdominal pressure.' "
How do doctors diagnose a hydrocele?,"'The diagnosis of a hydrocele is generally made clinically. An apt description of a hydrocele surrounding a palpable (something that can be felt) testis would be that of a small water balloon containing a peanut. The differences between communicating and non-communicating hydroceles described above help to support the suspected diagnosis.''A bedside test, transillumination, provides confirmation of the condition. Transillumination involves placing a small light source (commonly an otoscope - the medical device used to examine the ear) against the swollen scrotum. The fluid filled nature of the hydrocele side is distinctly different from the non-involved side of the scrotum. In some cases, a scrotal\xa0''ultrasound'' may be indicated. In unusual cases where a hydrocele may be a secondary phenomenon to pathologic cause (caused by disease), surgical exploration may be necessary to establish the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for hydroceles?,"'In 95% of congenital (present at birth) hydroceles, the natural history is one of gradual and complete resolution by one year of age. For those lasting longer than one year or for those non-communicating hydroceles that manifest after the first year, surgical repair is indicated since these rarely resolve spontaneously. '  "
What are other non-tender scrotal swelling conditions?,"'The differential diagnosis (list of possibilities) of chronic non tender scrotal swellings (besides hydroceles) includes:''Hernia:'' A hernia involves the introduction of a segment of the small intestine into the inguinal canal. A sign of a hernia in the small intestinal region is swelling in the groin alone, or may also include the scrotum on the same side. Many complain of an ""ache"" or ""sense of fullness"" during this time. If the small intestine spontaneously slides back into the abdominal cavity or if a physician reduces it, the patient is generally referred to a surgeon for closure of the inguinal canal as a preventative move to preclude a repeat experience.''If the small intestine is trapped and cannot be reduced, this is a surgical emergency. The patient will need urgent surgery in order to avoid intestinal swelling which may result in decreased blood flow to the intestine, and consequent death of the trapped bowel tissue.''Varicocele:'' A varicocele represents engorgement of the testicular veins and clinically has been likened to a ""bag of worms"". While it is a relatively rare finding in the preadolescent, approximately 20% of late ''teens'' and adult men have been found to have a varicocele. More common on the left side of the scrotum, the varicocele characteristically ""deflates"" when the male reclines, and becomes engorged due to gravity when standing.''In the older teen and adult, varicoceles generally require no specific management other than observation. In a younger male, if the varicocele becomes painful, or there is an associated size decrease in the same sided testicle, evaluation with a doctor specializing in urology conditions (''urologist'') should be sought. The sudden onset of a varicocele, especially if it occurs on the right side, may indicate the presence of ''kidney cancer'' and should always be evaluated by a physician.''Tumor'':'' childhood tumors of the structures contained within the scrotum are more often benign when compared to those of ''teens'' and adults. The most common tumor in this latter age range is ''testicular cancer'"". As a response to the notoriety of Lance Armstrong's battle with testicular ""'cancer'', the recommendation for monthly self-testicular exams (especially for teens and young adults who have a predisposition for this ''cancer'') has found a more receptive audience than in the past.'  "
What is hydrocephalus?,"'The term hydrocephalus is derived from the Greek words ""hydro"" meaning water and ""cephalus"" meaning head. As the name implies, it is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain. Although hydrocephalus was once known as ""water on the brain,"" the ""water"" is actually cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)--a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The excessive accumulation of CSF results in an abnormal widening of   spaces in the brain called ventricles. This widening creates potentially harmful pressure on the tissues of the brain.''The ventricular system is made up of four ventricles connected by narrow passages.. Normally, CSF flows through the ventricles, exits into cisterns (closed spaces that serve as reservoirs) at the base of the brain, bathes the surfaces of the brain and spinal cord, and then reabsorbs into the bloodstream.''CSF has three important life-sustaining functions: 1) to keep the brain tissue buoyant, acting as a cushion or ""''shock'' absorber""; 2) to act as the vehicle for delivering nutrients to the brain and removing waste; and 3) to flow between the cranium and spine and compensate for changes in intracranial blood volume (the amount of blood within the brain).''The balance between production and absorption of CSF is critically important. Because CSF is made continuously,  medical conditions that block its normal flow or absorption will result in an over-accumulation of CSF.  The resulting pressure of the fluid against brain tissue is what causes hydrocephalus.'  "
What are the different types of hydrocephalus?,"'Hydrocephalus may be congenital or acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be caused by either events or influences that occur during ''fetal development'', or genetic abnormalities. Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward. This type of hydrocephalus can affect individuals of all ages and may be caused by injury or disease.''Hydrocephalus may also be communicating or non-communicating. Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked after it exits the ventricles. This form is called communicating because the CSF can still flow between the ventricles, which remain open. Non-communicating hydrocephalus - also called ""obstructive"" hydrocephalus - occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked along one or more of the narrow passages connecting the ventricles. One of the most common causes of hydrocephalus is ""aqueductal stenosis."" In this case, hydrocephalus results from a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius, a small passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the middle of the brain.''There are two other forms of hydrocephalus which do not fit exactly into the categories mentioned above and primarily affect adults: hydrocephalus ex-vacuo and normal pressure hydrocephalus.''Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when ''stroke'' or traumatic injury cause damage to the brain. In these cases, brain tissue may actually shrink. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can happen to people at any age, but it is most common among the elderly. It may result from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, head ''trauma'', infection, ''tumor'', or complications of surgery. However, many people develop normal pressure hydrocephalus even when none of these factors are present for reasons that are unknown.' "
Who gets this hydrocephalus?,"'The number of people who develop hydrocephalus or who are currently living with it is difficult to establish since there is no national registry or database of people with the condition.  However, experts estimate that hydrocephalus affects approximately 1 in every 500 children.' "
What causes hydrocephalus?,"'The causes of hydrocephalus are still not   well understood. Hydrocephalus may result from   ''inherited'' genetic abnormalities (such as the genetic defect that causes aqueductal stenosis) or developmental disorders (such as those associated with ''neural tube defects'' including ''spina bifida'' and encephalocele). Other possible causes include complications of premature birth such as intraventricular hemorrhage, diseases such as meningitis, tumors, traumatic ''head injury'', or subarachnoid hemorrhage, which block the exit of CSF from the ventricles to the cisterns or eliminate the passageway for CSF into the cisterns.'  "
What are the symptoms of hydrocephalus?,"""Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age, disease progression, and individual differences in tolerance to the condition. For example, an infant's ability to compensate for increased CSF pressure and enlargement of the ventricles differs from an adult's. The infant skull can expand to accommodate the buildup of CSF because the ""'sutures'' (the fibrous joints that connect the bones of the skull) have not yet closed.''In infancy, the most obvious indication of hydrocephalus is often a rapid increase in head circumference or an unusually large head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, downward deviation of the eyes (also called ""sunsetting""), and ''seizures''.''Older children and adults may experience different symptoms because their skulls cannot expand to accommodate the buildup of CSF. Symptoms may include ''headache'' followed by vomiting, ''nausea'', papilledema (swelling of the optic disk which is part of the optic nerve), blurred or ''double vision'', sunsetting of the eyes, problems with balance, poor coordination, gait disturbance, urinary ''incontinence'', slowing or loss of developmental progress, lethargy, drowsiness, irritability, or other changes in personality or cognition including ''memory loss''.''Symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus include, problems with ''walking'', impaired bladder control leading to urinary frequency and/or incontinence, and progressive mental impairment and ''dementia''. An individual with this type of hydrocephalus may have a general slowing of movements or may complain that his or her ''feet'' feel ""stuck."" Because some of these symptoms may also be experienced in other disorders such as '""Alzheimer's""' disease, '""Parkinson's""' disease, and ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'', normal pressure hydrocephalus is often incorrectly diagnosed and never properly treated. Doctors may use a variety of tests, including brain scans (CT and/or ''MRI''), a ''spinal tap'' or lumbar catheter, intracranial pressure monitoring, and neuropsychological tests, to help them accurately diagnose normal pressure hydrocephalus and rule out any other conditions.''The symptoms described in this section account for the most typical ways in which progressive hydrocephalus manifests itself, but it is important to remember that symptoms vary significantly from one person to the next.'  "
How is hydrocephalus diagnosed?,"'Hydrocephalus is diagnosed through clinical neurological evaluation and by using cranial imaging techniques such as ''ultrasonography'', computed tomography (CT), ''magnetic resonance imaging'"" (MRI), or pressure-monitoring techniques. A physician selects the appropriate diagnostic tool based on an individual's age, clinical presentation, and the presence of known or suspected abnormalities of the brain or spinal cord."" "
What is the current treatment for hydrocephalus?,"'Hydrocephalus is most often treated by surgically inserting a shunt system. This system diverts the flow of CSF from the CNS to another area of the body where it can be absorbed as part of the normal circulatory process.''A shunt is a flexible but sturdy ''plastic'' tube. A shunt system consists of the shunt, a catheter, and a valve. One end of the catheter is placed within a ventricle inside the brain or in the CSF outside the spinal cord. The other end of the catheter is commonly placed within the abdominal ''cavity'', but may also be placed at other sites in the body such as a chamber of the ''heart'' or areas around the lung where the CSF can drain and be absorbed. A valve located along the catheter maintains one-way flow and regulates the rate of CSF flow.''A limited number of individuals can be treated with an alternative procedure called third ventriculostomy. In this procedure, a neuroendoscope — a small camera that uses ''fiber'' optic technology to visualize small and difficult to reach surgical areas — allows a doctor to view the ventricular surface. Once the scope is guided into position, a small tool makes a tiny hole in the floor of the third ventricle, which allows the CSF to bypass the obstruction and flow toward the site of resorption around the surface of the brain.' "
What are the possible complications of a shunt system?,"'Shunt systems are not perfect devices. Complications may include mechanical failure, infections, obstructions, and the need to lengthen or replace the catheter. Generally, shunt systems require monitoring and regular medical follow up. When complications occur,   the shunt system usually   requires some type of revision.''Some complications can lead to other problems such as overdraining or underdraining. Overdraining occurs when the shunt allows CSF to drain from the ventricles more quickly than it is produced. Overdraining can cause the ventricles to collapse, tearing blood vessels and causing ''headache'', hemorrhage (subdural ''hematoma''), or slit-like ventricles (slit ventricle syndrome). Underdraining occurs when CSF is not removed quickly enough and the symptoms of hydrocephalus recur. In addition to the common symptoms of hydrocephalus, infections from a shunt may also produce symptoms such as a low-grade ''fever'', soreness of the neck or shoulder muscles, and redness or tenderness along the shunt tract. When there is reason to suspect that a shunt system is not functioning properly (for example, if the symptoms of hydrocephalus return), medical attention should be sought immediately.' "
What is the prognosis for hydrocephalus?,"'The prognosis for individuals diagnosed with hydrocephalus is difficult to predict, although there is some correlation between the specific cause of the hydrocephalus and the outcome. Prognosis is further complicated by the presence of associated disorders, the timeliness of diagnosis, and the success of treatment. The degree to which relief of CSF pressure following shunt surgery can minimize or reverse damage to the brain is not well understood.''Affected individuals and their families should be aware that hydrocephalus poses risks to both cognitive and physical development. However, many children diagnosed with the disorder benefit from rehabilitation therapies and educational interventions and go on to lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment by an interdisciplinary team of medical professionals, rehabilitation specialists, and educational experts is critical to a positive outcome. Left untreated, progressive hydrocephalus may be fatal.''The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus usually get worse over time if the condition is not treated, although some people may experience temporary improvements. While the success of treatment with shunts varies from person to person, some people recover almost completely after treatment and have a good quality of life. Early diagnosis and treatment improves the chance of a good recovery.' "
What research is being done for hydrocephalus?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research related to hydrocephalus in laboratories and clinics at the NIH and support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.  Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders such as hydrocephalus. The NINDS also conducts and supports a wide range of fundamental studies that explore the complex mechanisms of normal and abnormal brain development.' "

What is the hydrogen breath test?,"'The hydrogen breath test is a test that uses the measurement of hydrogen in the breath to diagnose several conditions that cause gastrointestinal symptoms. In humans, only bacteria - specifically, anaerobic bacteria in the colon - are capable of producing hydrogen. The bacteria produce hydrogen when they are exposed to unabsorbed food, particularly sugars and carbohydrates, but not proteins or ''fats''. Although limited hydrogen is produced from the small amounts of unabsorbed food that normally reach the colon, large amounts of hydrogen may be produced when there is a problem with the ''digestion'' or absorption of food in the small intestine, that allows more unabsorbed food to reach the colon.''Large amounts of hydrogen also may be produced when the colon bacteria move back into the small intestine, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel. In this latter instance, the bacteria are exposed to unabsorbed food that has not yet had a chance to completely traverse the small intestine to be fully digested and absorbed. Some of the hydrogen produced by the bacteria, whether in the small intestine or the colon, is absorbed into the blood flowing through the wall of the small intestine and colon. The hydrogen-containing blood travels to the ''lungs'' where the hydrogen is released and exhaled in the breath where it can be measured.' "
When is hydrogen breath testing used?,"'Hydrogen breath testing is used in the diagnosis of three conditions. '   The first is a condition in which dietary sugars are not digested normally. The most common sugar that is poorly digested is lactose, the sugar in milk. Individuals who are unable to properly digest lactose are referred to as lactose intolerant. Testing also may be used to diagnose problems with the digestion of other sugars such as sucrose, fructose and sorbitol.  The second condition for which hydrogen breath testing is used is for diagnosing bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel, a condition in which larger-than-normal numbers of colonic bacteria are present in the small intestine.  The third condition for which hydrogen breath testing is used is for diagnosing rapid passage of food through the small intestine. All three of these conditions may cause abdominal pain, abdominal bloating and distention, flatulence (passing gas in large amounts), and diarrhea."
How does hydrogen breath testing work?,"'The bacteria in the colon, including the anaerobic bacteria, are able to digest and use sugars and carbohydrates as food. When the anaerobic bacteria digest sugars and carbohydrates, they convert some of the sugars and carbohydrates into gases, most commonly hydrogen. They also may produce and release into the colon other substances, for example, chemicals that cause the colon to secrete water and cause ''diarrhea''.''As previously discussed, some of the hydrogen gas is absorbed by the colon into the blood and is eliminated in the breath where it can be measured. As long as little sugar or carbohydrate reaches the colon, the small amounts of gas and other substances that are produced do not cause a problem. When larger amounts of sugar or carbohydrate reach the colon because they are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine, larger amounts of gas and substances are formed in the colon.''For example, if an individual digests and absorbs the sugar in milk (lactose) normally, then none of the lactose that is given for the lactose hydrogen breath test reaches the colon, and no increase in the concentration of hydrogen in the breath is seen during the breath test. On the other hand, if the individual does not digest and absorb the lactose completely, that is, he or she is lactose intolerant, the lactose travels through the small intestine and enters the colon where the bacteria digest it and produce hydrogen. An increase in hydrogen in the breath then is seen. Other sugars for which poor digestion can be diagnosed by breath testing include sucrose and fructose (found in ''corn'' syrup), and sorbitol (a sugar that is used as a low-calorie sweetener).''There are ways other than abnormal digestion of dietary sugars by which the bacteria can cause problems. Unlike in the colon, the number of hydrogen-producing, anaerobic bacteria in the small intestine is small. If, however, large numbers of hydrogen-producing bacteria move into the small intestine from the colon, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel, the bacteria may digest the sugars and carbohydrates before the small bowel has had a chance to digest and absorb them and produce large amounts of hydrogen.''Finally, if individuals have abnormally rapid passage of food through the small intestine, there may not be enough time for the small intestine to digest and absorb sugars and carbohydrates. This results in the entry of larger amounts of sugar and carbohydrate into the colon where the bacteria can digest and convert them to gas.''To diagnose bacterial overgrowth and rapid transit through the small intestine, a sugar that is not digested and absorbed by man, such as ''lactulose'', usually is used for the test. In the case of rapid passage through the small intestine, the sugar passes quickly through the small intestine and into the colon so that hydrogen is found in the breath very soon after ingestion of the sugar. In the case of bacterial overgrowth, production of hydrogen occurs twice during the test. Once as the sugar passes the bacteria in the small intestine and again when the sugar enters the colon.' "
How is hydrogen breath testing performed?,"'Prior to hydrogen breath testing, the patient fasts for at least 12 hours. At the start of the test, the patient blows into and fills a balloon with a breath of air. The concentration of hydrogen is measured in a sample of breath removed from the balloon. The patient then ingests a small amount of the test sugar (lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, fructose, lactulose, etc. depending on the purpose of the test). Additional samples of breath are collected and analyzed for hydrogen every 15 minutes for up to five hours.' "
How are the results of hydrogen breath testing interpreted?,"'The interpretation of the results of hydrogen breath testing depends on the sugar that is used for testing, and the pattern of hydrogen production after the sugar is ingested.''After ingestion of test doses of the dietary sugars lactose, sucrose, fructose or sorbitol, any production of hydrogen means that there has been a problem with digestion or absorption of the test sugar and that some of the sugar has reached the colon. ''When rapid intestinal transit is present, the test dose of non-digestible lactulose reaches the colon more quickly than normally, and, therefore, hydrogen is produced by the colonic bacteria soon after the sugar is ingested. ''When bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel is present, ingestion of lactulose results in two separate periods during the test in which hydrogen is produced, an earlier period caused by the bacteria in the small intestine and a later one caused by the bacteria in the colon.'  "
What are the limitations of hydrogen breath testing?,"'There are several limitations to hydrogen breath testing. For unclear reasons, testing for bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel with lactulose can diagnose only 60% of cases. (This insensitivity of the test may be due in part to the strict criteria that are used for interpreting a test as abnormal. Less strict criteria may diagnose overgrowth more often.) In addition, with bacterial overgrowth there may be an overlap of the early and later periods of hydrogen production that can be misinterpreted as a single period characteristic of rapid intestinal transit. Finally, some normal individuals may have slow transit through the small intestine making prolonged testing - up to 5 hours - necessary, and many individuals are unwilling to undergo such prolonged testing.''Some individuals do not have bacteria that produce hydrogen, and in these individuals hydrogen breath testing is not possible. Most of these individuals have bacteria that produce a different gas, methane. (There also are individuals who produce both hydrogen and methane.) Methane can be measured in the breath just like hydrogen, and the production of methane can be used for diagnosis in the same way as hydrogen. There is much less experience with methane, however, and the production of methane is more complex than the production of hydrogen. Therefore, it is not clear if the pattern of methane production after ingestion of sugars can be interpreted in the same way as hydrogen production, particularly for the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth.'""A pattern of hydrogen production that is typical for bacterial overgrowth does not necessarily mean that an individual's symptoms are caused by the overgrowth. For example, there may be anatomic abnormalities of the small intestine such as narrowing or functional abnormalities in the way the muscle of the small intestine works. These abnormalities can cause symptoms of bloating, distention, ""'pain'', and ''diarrhea'' themselves, but they also can lead to bacterial overgrowth with its similar symptoms. Therefore, it may be an underlying abnormality that is responsible for the symptoms and not the bacterial overgrowth. The only way to differentiate between the two causes of symptoms-an underlying problem or bacterial overgrowth - is to treat and eradicate the bacteria. If the symptoms disappear, then it is more likely that it is the overgrowth rather than the underlying abnormality that is responsible for the symptoms.''Any condition that results in the delivery of undigested or unabsorbed food to the colon may result in abnormal breath tests when dietary sugars are used for testing. Both pancreatic insufficiency and the condition called ''celiac sprue'' can cause abnormal breath tests, in the former instance because pancreatic enzymes that are necessary for the digestion of carbohydrates are missing, and in the latter instance because the lining of the small intestine is destroyed, and digested food cannot be absorbed. It may be necessary to exclude these causes of abnormal breath tests by additional tests-pancreatic function tests and small intestinal biopsy.' "
Are there other ways in which hydrogen breath testing can be used?,"'Antibiotics are used for treating bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel; however, any one antibiotic may be effective at eliminating the overgrowing bacteria only 50%-60% of the time. Therefore, if symptoms do not disappear in an individual following treatment with antibiotics, it may be useful to repeat the breath test to determine if the antibiotics have eliminated the bacteria. If not, a different antibiotic or non-antibiotic treatment can be tried.' "
What are the side effects of hydrogen breath testing?,"'The side effects of hydrogen breath testing are exactly what one would expect to see in individuals who poorly digest and absorb sugars and carbohydrates, for example, bloating, distention, ''pain'', and diarrhea. When lactulose is used these symptoms are unlikely to occur or are mild because the dose of lactulose used for testing is small.'  "
What are the alternatives to hydrogen breath testing?,"'For diagnosing ''lactose intolerance'', an alternative procedure to breath testing requires blood samples to be taken after the ingestion of lactose. If the digestion and absorption of lactose is normal, the levels of glucose in the blood should rise. The elevation of blood glucose occurs because the lactose is broken down into its two component sugars, galactose and glucose, as it is absorbed into the blood. A second alternative is to give a dose of lactose (or other dietary sugar) and observe an individual for symptoms. If the individual is intolerant, bloating, distention, pain, ''flatulence'', and diarrhea are likely to occur. A third alternative is a trial of a ''diet'' in which the potentially-offending sugar is strictly eliminated. All of these alternatives, however, have limitations and problems.''Bacterial overgrowth can be diagnosed by culturing (growing) the bacteria from a sample of fluid from the small intestine and counting the numbers of colonic bacteria that are present. This procedure requires a tube to be passed through the nose, throat, ''esophagus'' and stomach under X-ray guidance so that fluid can be obtained from the small intestine. It is an uncomfortable and expensive procedure, and most laboratories are not able to accurately culture the samples. Hence, this test is not performed routinely.' "
What is hydronephrosis?,"'Hydronephrosis describes the situation where the urine collecting system of the kidney is dilated. This may be a normal variant or it may be due to an underlying illness or medical condition.''Normally, the kidney filters waste products from blood and disposes of it in the urine. The urine drains into individual calyces (single=calyx) that form the renal pelvis. This empties into the ureter, a tube that connects the kidney to the bladder. The urethra is the tube that empties the bladder.''While obstruction or blockage is the most frequent cause of hydronephrosis, it may be due to problems that occur congenitally in a fetus (''prenatal'') or may be a physiologic response to ''pregnancy''. A large percentage of ''pregnant'' women develop hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Experts think this is, in part, because of the effects of ''progesterone'' on the ureters, which decreases their tone.''Technically, hydronephrosis specifically describes dilation and swelling of the kidney, while the term hydroureter is used to describe swelling of the ureter. Hydronephrosis may be unilateral involving just one kidney or bilateral involving both.''A complication of hydronephrosis that is not physiologic is decreased kidney function. The increased pressure of extra fluid within the kidney decreases the blood filtration rate and may cause structural damage to kidney cells. This decrease in function is often reversible if the underlying condition is corrected but if the duration is prolonged, the damage is often permanent.' "
What causes hydronephrosis?,"'There are numerous causes of hydronephrosis that are categorized based upon the location of the swelling and whether the cause is intrinsic (located within the urinary collecting system), extrinsic (outside of the collecting system) or if it is due to an alteration in function of the parts of the urinary system.'   Kidney stone. Likely the most common reason to have unilateral hydronephrosis is a kidney stone that causes obstruction of the ureter. The stone gradually moves from the kidney into the bladder but if it should act like a dam while in the ureter, urine will back up and cause the kidney to swell. This would be classified as an intrinsic obstruction. Blood clot Stricture or scarring Bladder cancer Bladder stones Cystocele Bladder neck contracture The inability to empty the bladder (urinary retention) for any reason may cause bilateral hydronephrosis. Urethral stricture Urethral valves Urethral cancer Tumors or cancers that compress the ureter and prevent urine flow. Examples include lymphoma and sarcoma, especially if they are located in the retroperitoneum, where the kidneys and ureters are located behind the sac that contains the bowel. Retroperitoneal fibrosis Ovarian vein syndrome Cancer of the cervix Cancer of the prostate Pregnancy Uterine prolapse Scarring due to radiation therapy Prostate hypertrophy or swelling is a common cause of urinary retention and subsequent hydronephrosis in males. Prostate cancer Neurogenic bladder or the inability of the bladder to function properly occurs because of damage to the nerves that supply it. This may occur in brain tumors, spinal cord injuries or tumors, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes among other causes. Vesicoureteral reflux where urine flows backwards from the bladder into the ureter. Prenatal hydronephrosis is an example, though it may occur at any time in life."
What are the symptoms of hydronephrosis?,"'There may or may not be direct symptoms of hydronephrosis depending upon the underlying cause.''Individuals with acute hydronephrosis, for example symptoms from renal ''colic'' due to a kidney stone begin with an acute onset of intense flank or ''back pain'' radiating to the groin, associated with ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''sweating''. Colicky ''pain'' comes and goes and its intensity may cause the person to writhe or roll around or pace in pain. There may be blood seen in the urine.''Chronic hydronephrosis develops over time and there may be no specific symptoms. Tumors in the pelvis or bladder obstruction may develop silently and the person may have ''symptoms of kidney failure''. These are often nonspecific and may include ''weakness'', malaise,  ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', ''leg swelling'', nausea and vomiting. If ''electrolyte'' abnormalities occur because the kidneys are unable to regulate sodium, potassium, and calcium, there may be ''heart'' rhythm disturbances and ''muscle spasms''.'  "
When should I seek medical care for hydronephrosis?,"'A person with acute hydronephrosis usually develops significant pain and needs emergent help with pain control. ''Blood in the urine'' is never normal and should not be ignored. Most often in women, it is due to a ''bladder infection'', but other causes include ''kidney stones'', tumors, and occasionally is associated with ''appendicitis''. ''Individuals who have the diagnosis of hydronephrosis who develop a ''fever'' need to be seen immediately. If a ''urinary tract infection'' occurs and there is decreased urine flow, there is the risk of becoming very ill by developing ''bacteremia'' (blood stream bacterial infection).''Hydronephrosis is a true emergency in patients with only one kidney and should the person believe that the lone kidney is at risk, urgent medical care should be accessed.' "
How is hydronephrosis diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis begins with taking a history of the symptoms that the patient experiences. The health care practitioner will ask questions that will direct whether further tests need to be ordered. Reviewing the patient's past medical history and family history may be helpful.""'Depending upon the situation and whether there is acute onset of symptoms, physical examination may reveal tenderness in the flank or where the kidneys are located. The bladder may be found to be distended when the abdomen is examined. Usually, in males, a rectal examination is done to assess the size of the prostate. In women a pelvic examination may be performed to evaluate the uterus and ovaries.''The following laboratory tests may be ordered depending upon what potential diagnosis is being considered.''CT scan'"" of the abdomen can be performed to evaluate the kidney anatomy and make the diagnosis of hydronephrosis. It also may allow the health care practitioner to look for the underlying cause including kidney stones or structures that are compressing the urinary collecting system. Depending upon the situation and the health care practitioner's concerns, the CT may be done with or without contrast dye injected into a vein, and with or without oral contrast (that the patient ""'drinks'') to outline the intestine. Most commonly, for kidney stones, neither oral nor intravenous contrast is needed.''Ultrasound'' is another imaging study that can be done to look for hydronephrosis. The quality of the test depends upon the skill of the ultrasonographer to evaluate the structures in the abdomen and retroperitoneum. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, quick procedure for screening purposes, and is also useful in women who are pregnant where ''radiation'' concerns exist.''Intravenous pyelography (IVP) has mostly been replaced by CT scanning but does have a role in diagnosing some patients and its use is now limited.''KUB ''X-rays'' (an X-ray that shows the kidney, ureter, and bladder) are used by some urologists to classify a kidney stone as radiodense or radiolucent and may use KUB X-rays to determine if the stone is able to migrate down the ureter into the bladder.' Urinalysis to look for blood, infection or abnormal cells Complete blood count (CBC) may reveal anemia or potential infection Electrolyte analysis may be helpful in chronic hydronephrosis since the kidneys are responsible for maintaining and balancing their concentrations in the blood stream. BUN (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are blood tests that help assess kidney function."
What is the treatment for hydronephrosis?,"'The goal of treatment for hydronephrosis is to restart the free flow of urine from the kidney and decrease the swelling and pressure that builds up and decreases kidney function.''The initial care for the patient is aimed at minimizing pain and preventing ''urinary tract infections''. Otherwise, surgical intervention may be required.''The timing of the procedure depends upon the underlying cause of hydronephrosis and hydroureter and the associated medical conditions that may be present. For example, patients with a kidney stone may be allowed 1-2 weeks to pass the stone with only supportive pain control if urine flow is not completely blocked by the stone. If, however, the patient develops an infection or if they only have one kidney, surgical intervention may be done emergently to remove the stone.''Shock'' wave ''lithotripsy'' (SWL or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy) is the most common treatment for kidney stones in the U.S. Shock waves from outside the body are targeted at a kidney stone fragmenting the stone into tiny pieces that are able to be passed out of the urinary tract in the urine.''For patients with urinary retention and an enlarged bladder as a cause of hydronephrosis, bladder catheterization may be all that is needed for initial treatment. For patients with ureteral strictures or stones that are difficult to remove, a ''urologist'' may place a ''stent'' into the ureter that bypasses the obstruction and allows urine to flow from the kidney. Using a ''fiber''-optic scope inserted through the urethra into the bladder, the urologist can visualize where the ureter enters and can thread the stent through the ureter into the kidney pelvis bypassing any obstruction.''When a stent cannot be placed, an alternative is inserting a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. A urologist or interventional radiologist uses fluoroscopy to insert a tube through the flank directly into the kidney to allow urine to drain.''Some conditions, for example, retroperitoneal fibrosis or tumors, may require steroid therapy, a formal operation, or ''laparoscopy'' to relieve the hydronephrosis or hydroureter while oral alkalinization therapy may be used to dissolve uric acid kidney stones.'  "
What are the complications of hydronephrosis?,"'If hydronephrosis remains untreated, the increased pressure within the kidney may decrease the ability of the kidney to filter blood, remove waste products, and make urine as well as regulate the ''electrolytes'' in the body. Hydronephrosis can lead to kidney infections, and in some cases, complete kidney function loss or death. Kidney function will begin decreasing almost immediately with the onset of hydronephrosis but is reversible if the swelling resolves. Usually kidneys recover well even if there is an obstruction lasting up to 6 weeks.''The term acute hydronephrosis may be used when, after resolution of the kidney swelling, kidney function returns to normal. Chronic hydronephrosis refers to the gradual development of the obstruction and the slow loss of kidney function.'  "
Can hydronephrosis be prevented?,"'Since hydronephrosis is a situation that occurs because of an underlying cause, ''prevention'' depends upon avoiding the underlying cause. For example, individuals with kidney stones that cause ureteral obstruction and hydronephrosis may try to decrease the chance of a recurrent stone by keeping well hydrated.' "
What is hydroxyapatite?,"'Hydroxyapatite is the major component, and an essential ingredient, of normal bone and ''teeth''.  It is hydroxyapatite that makes up bone mineral and the matrix of ''teeth''.'  "
What are hydroxyapatite crystals?,"'Hydroxyapatite molecules can group together (crystallize) to form microscopic clumps, called hydroxyapatite crystals.  ''Tiny crystals of hydroxyapatite sometimes form in or around joints and can cause inflammation of joints and tissues around the joints, such as tendons and ligaments.  They have been described particularly as a cause of ''rotator cuff'' inflammation of the shoulder.''The inflammation caused by hydroxyapatite crystals has been referred to as hydroxyapatite crystal disease.' "
Is hydroxyapatite crystal disease the same as gout or pseudogout?,"""No. These conditions are similar in that they are all caused by the inflammation that results from the body's reaction to crystals. However, hydroxyapatite crystals are distinctly different from the crystals of pseudogout or ""'gout''.  While hydroxyapatite crystals can sometimes also be found in the company of the calcium pyrophosphate crystals characteristic of pseudogout, these are quite different types of crystals.' "
How are hydroxyapatite crystals identified?,"'Sometimes, hydroxyapatite crystals can be seen clumped in the fluid of a joint that has developed ''arthritis''. The crystals are usually so small as to be invisible under a regular microscope and thus require a special (electron) microscope for identification.' "
How is hydroxyapatite crystal disease treated?,"'The treatment of the inflammation caused by hydroxyapatite crystals includes rest, ''cold'' application, and medications to reduce inflammation. Cortisone-related medications injected into inflamed tissues can also sometimes help decrease inflammation and thereby relieve pain.'  "
What is the  definition of low testosterone (low-T)?,"'The low limit of testosterone levels in men is about 300 nanograms per deciliter and the upper normal limit is approximately 1000-1200 ng/dl. A low level needs to be investigated further to distinguish it from normal ''aging''.'

Testosterone is responsible for building muscle and bone mass, sperm production, and sex drive. Testosterone influences male pattern fat distribution, bone density, and red blood cell production.

What is the  definition of low testosterone (low-T)?,"'The low limit of testosterone levels in men is about 300 nanograms per deciliter and the upper normal limit is approximately 1000-1200 ng/dl. A low level needs to be investigated further to distinguish it from normal ''aging''.'   Testosterone is a hormone required for male development and sexual function and is produced primarily in the testicles. Testosterone is responsible for building muscle and bone mass, sperm production, and sex drive. Testosterone influences male pattern fat distribution, bone density, and red blood cell production. In the normal developing male, testosterone peaks during early adulthood. Once you reach age 30, testosterone levels slowly decline by approximately 1% a year. This is a normal part of aging."
What is low testosterone (low-T)?," Low testosterone (low-T) is underproduction or lack of production of testosterone in men and women.

What are the signs and symptoms of jaundice in adults?,"'As already mentioned, jaundice is not a disease, but rather a visible sign of an underlying disease process. Individuals with jaundice will have a yellow discoloration of the skin to varying degrees, and may also exhibit yellowing of the mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes. However, depending on the underlying cause of jaundice, individuals may experience different symptoms. Some individuals may have very few, if any, symptoms at all, while others may experience more severe and pronounced symptoms. Individuals with jaundice may experience any of the following signs and symptoms.'   Pale-colored stools Dark-colored urine Skin itching Nausea and vomiting Rectal bleeding Diarrhea Fever and chills Weakness Weight loss Loss of appetite Confusion Abdominal pain Headache Swelling of the legs Swelling and distension of the abdomen due to the accumulation of fluid (ascites)"
How common is jaundice in adutls? Who gets it?,"'The risk factors for developing jaundice vary based upon the underlying cause.' Certain people with hereditary conditions (for example, thalassemia or hereditary spherocytosis) are at an increased risk of developing jaundice from hemolysis. People who consume alcohol heavily are at an increased risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis leading to jaundice. People who are at an increased risk of exposure to the different types of viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) are at risk of developing jaundice at the time of infection or subsequently, if liver disease occurs or if liver cancer develops later. Other risk factors include:Eating raw shellfishDrug injections of other substancesTattooingBirth between 1945 and 1965Being an unvaccinated (for hepatitis)Healthcare professionalsParticipating in high-risk sexual activity Eating raw shellfish Drug injections of other substances Tattooing Birth between 1945 and 1965 Being an unvaccinated (for hepatitis) Healthcare professionals Participating in high-risk sexual activity"
What causes jaundice in adults?,"'Jaundice in adults is caused by various medical conditions that affect the normal metabolism or excretion of bilirubin. Bilirubin is mostly formed from the daily breakdown and destruction of ''red blood cells'' in the bloodstream, which release ''hemoglobin'' as they rupture. The heme portion of this hemoglobin molecule is then converted into bilirubin, which is transported in the bloodstream to the ''liver'' for further metabolism and excretion. In the liver, the bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid (made more water-soluble), and is excreted into the gallbladder (where it is stored) and then eventually passed into the ''intestines''. In the intestines, a portion of the bilirubin is excreted in the feces, while some are metabolized by the intestinal bacteria to urobilinogen and excreted in the urine.''Jaundice occurs if there is a dysfunction of the normal metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This disruption in the metabolism or excretion of bilirubin can occur at various stages, and it is, therefore, useful to classify the different causes of jaundice based on where the dysfunction occurs. The causes of jaundice are generally classified as pre-hepatic (the problem arises before secretion to the liver), hepatic (the problem arises within the liver), and post-hepatic (the problem arises after bilirubin is excreted from the liver).'""Jaundice caused during the pre-hepatic phase is due to the excessive destruction (hemolysis) of red blood cells from various conditions. This rapid increase in bilirubin levels in the bloodstream overwhelms the liver's capability to properly metabolize the bilirubin, and consequently the levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase. Conditions which can lead to an increase in the hemolysis of red blood cells include:""   Malaria, Sickle cell disease, Hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), Drugs or other toxins, and Autoimmune disorders."
What causes jaundice during the hepatic phase in adults?,"'Jaundice caused during the hepatic phase can arise from abnormalities in the metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This can lead to an increase in both unconjugated and/or conjugated bilirubin levels. Conditions with a hepatic cause of jaundice include:' Acute or chronic hepatitis (commonly viral [Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E] or alcohol related) Cirrhosis (caused by various conditions incuding alcohol toxicity) Drugs or other toxins Crigler-Najjar syndrome Autoimmune disorders Gilbert's syndrome Liver cancer"
What are post-hepatic causes of jaundice in adults?,"'Jaundice from a post-hepatic cause arises from a disruption (an obstruction) in the normal drainage and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the form of bile from the liver into the intestine. This leads to increased levels of conjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream. Conditions that can cause post-hepatic jaundice include' Gallstones, Cancer (pancreatic cancer, gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer), Strictures of the bile ducts, Cholangitis, Pancreatitis, and Parasites (for example, liver flukes)."
What tests and procedures diagnose jaundice in adults?,"'The presence of jaundice requires a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the cause. Initially, your health-care professional will take a detailed history of your illness and perform a physical exam, which can sometimes determine the cause of the jaundice. Initial blood testing will also be undertaken, with special attention being given to your:''Blood testing for exposure to hepatitis may also be ordered. Additional blood testing may be ordered based on the initial results. A ''urinalysis'' will likely also be ordered.''Depending on the results of initial blood tests, further studies may be needed to help diagnose the underlying disease process. In certain cases, imaging studies will need to be obtained in order to evaluate for any abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. These imaging studies may include:''Occasionally, people will need further invasive testing to determine the cause of the jaundice. Procedures that may be ordered include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP'') or a ''liver biopsy''.' Liver blood tests Complete blood count (CBC) Electrolyte pane Lipase levels  Abdominal ultrasound Computerized tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)"
What is the treatment for jaundice in adults?,"'The treatment for jaundice depends entirely on the underlying cause. Once a diagnosis has been established, the appropriate course of treatment can then be initiated. Certain patients will require hospitalization, whereas others may be managed as outpatients at home.'   In certain individuals with jaundice, the treatment will consist of supportive care and can be managed at home. For example, most cases of mild viral hepatitis can be managed at home with watchful waiting and close monitoring by your doctor (expectant management). Novel medications for hepatitis C now can offer a cure for this condition. Alcohol cessation is necessary in patients with cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, or acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use. Jaundice caused by drugs/medications/toxins requires discontinuation of the offending agent. In cases of intentional or unintentional acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, the antidote N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) may be required. Various medications may be used to treat the conditions leading to jaundice, such as steroids in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders. Certain patients with cirrhosis, for example, may require treatment with diuretics and lactulose. Antibiotics may be required for infectious causes of jaundice, or for the complications associated with certain conditions leading to jaundice (for example, cholangitis). Blood transfusions may be required in individuals with anemia from hemolysis or as a result of bleeding. Individuals with cancer leading to jaundice will require consultation with an oncologist, and the treatment will vary depending on the type and extent (staging) of the cancer. Surgery and various invasive procedures may be required for certain patients with jaundice. For example, certain patients with gallstones may require surgery. Other individuals with liver failure/cirrhosis may require a liver transplant."
What are the complications of jaundice in adults?,"'The type of complication and the severity of complications vary with the underlying cause leading to jaundice. Certain individuals will not suffer any long-term after effects and will have a full recovery, while for others the appearance of jaundice will be the first indication of a life-threatening condition. A few of the potential complications include:'   Electrolyte abnormalities Anemia Bleeding Infection/sepsis Chronic hepatitis Cancer Liver failure Kidney failure Hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) Death"
What is the prognosis for an adult with jaundice? Can it be cured? Is it fatal?,"""The prognosis for individuals with jaundice depends on the underlying cause of the condition. There are certain conditions that carry an excellent prognosis with individuals making a full recovery. However, more serious causes of jaundice can sometimes be fatal despite medical or surgical intervention. The development and severity of complications will also determine an individual's prognosis, as will a patient's underlying health and comorbidities (presence of other diseases). Therefore, a case-by-case assessment by your health care professional is necessary in order to determine a more accurate prognosis."" "
Can jaundice in adults be prevented?,"'Certain conditions leading to jaundice can be prevented, whereas others may be less preventable. However, there are certain measures that can be taken in order to decrease the risk of developing jaundice.' Take medications as instructed in order to prevent potential liver damage or unintentional overdose. Individuals with certain medical conditions (for example, G6PD deficiency or cirrhosis) should avoid certain medications altogether. Discuss medications with your health care professional. Avoid high-risk behaviors such as unprotected intercourse or intravenous drug use, and implement universal precautions when working with blood products and needles. This can decrease your risk of developing hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Consider being vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. There is currently no available vaccine against hepatitis C. Avoid potentially contaminated food products or unsanitary water, as this may decrease your risk of developing hepatitis A. When travelling to areas where malaria is endemic, take the recommended precautions and prophylactic medications in order to prevent the development of malaria. Consume alcohol responsibly and only in moderation. This can prevent alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis and pancreatitis, among other conditions. Certain individuals will need to avoid alcohol altogether. Avoid smoking, as it is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer, as well as many other malignancies."
Facts you should know about hypercalcemia," Calcium is important for bone strength, as well as muscle and nerve function Calcium levels in the bloodstream are regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin Hypercalcemia can vary in severity and in chronicity The main cause of hypercalcemia is hyperparathyroidism Malignancies may be associated with hypercalcemia, and the presence of hypercalcemia usually heralds a worse prognosis The signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia can be remembered by the phrase ""moans, stones, groans, and bones."" Treatment depends on the underlying cause of hypercalcemia as well as the degree of severity Both surgical and medical treatments are available as treatment options Prognosis depends on the underlying cause of hypercalcemia"
What is hypercalcemia?,"'Calcium is a mineral that is important in the regulation and processes of many body functions including bone formation, hormone release, muscle contraction, and nerve and brain function. Hypercalcemia is the term that refers to elevated levels of calcium in the bloodstream.''Calcium levels are tightly regulated in the body. Calcium regulation is primarily controlled by parathyroid hormone (PTH), ''vitamin D'', and calcitonin.''Together, these three hormones act on the bones, the kidneys, and the GI tract to regulate calcium levels in the bloodstream.'   Parathyroid hormone is a hormone produced by the parathyroid glands, which are four small glands that surround the thyroid and are found in the anterior part of the lower neck. Vitamin D is obtained through a process that begins with sun exposure to the skin, the process then continues in the liver and kidneys. Vitamin D can also be found in foods such as eggs and dairy products. Calcitonin is produced in specialized cells in the thyroid gland."
What are the causes of hypercalcemia?,"'One of the most common causes of high calcium levels (hypercalcemia), is an overproduction of parathyroid hormone, or hyperparathyroidism. ''Hypercalcemia can occur due to other medical conditions. These conditions can vary in severity and chronicity, and may be life-threatening. ''Malignancy'' is a common cause of elevated blood calcium. Up to 20% of individuals with ''cancer'' will develop hypercalcemia at some point in their disease. ''Other conditions associated with hypercalcemia include:' Hyperparathyroidism tends to be more common in women over 50.  It can be the result of all four parathyroid glands producing too much PTH (parathyroid 
hyperplasia), or one gland specifically producing an excessive amount of hormone (usually the result of a parathyroid adenoma, or benign tumor). Cancers, especially lung cancer and breast cancer Immobilization over a long period of time Kidney failure Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or excessive thyroid hormone intake Use of certain medications such as the thiazide diuretics Inherited kidney or metabolic conditions Excessive vitamin D levels from vitamins, excessive dietary calcium, or from diseases that may result in excess vitamin D production"
What are the signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia?,"'In the majority of patients with hypercalcemia, the signs and symptoms are minimal. In general, the symptoms increase with higher levels of calcium in the blood. In severe cases, the ''elevated calcium'' levels can cause ''abnormal heart rhythms'' with specific findings on ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'').''Because of the clinical findings that are seen in hypercalcemia, the symptoms are often described as ""moans, stones, groans, and bones"". ''Some of the symptoms include the following:'   Constipation Nausea Decreased appetite Abdominal pain  Peptic ulcer disease Kidney stones Flank pain Frequent urination Confusion Dementia Memory loss Depression Bone aches and pains Fractures Curving of the spine and loss of height"
How do doctors diagnose hypercalcemia?,"'Hypercalcemia is easily diagnosed with a blood test. Diagnosing the causes of hypercalcemia, however, is a more involved process; in addition to a detailed history and physical examination, it may require further blood tests (such as a PTH level and vitamin D level), urine evaluation, ''X-rays'', and other imaging procedures.' "
What are treatments for hypercalcemia?,"'The treatment of elevated levels of calcium in the blood involves the evaluation of the following:''If the hypercalcemia is causing severe symptoms, or if the values are critically high, lowering the blood levels may require hospitalization and the use of hydration, steroids, or even ''dialysis''. There are intravenous medications that can be used to lower calcium as well.''If the hypercalcemia is modest, treatment with medications can be administered on an outpatient basis.''If the underlying cause is hyperparathyroidism (particularly from an adenoma), there are certain criteria that are reviewed to discuss if surgery should be considered. These criteria include the absolute calcium level, a history of kidney stones or other calcium-related complications, and the amount of calcium seen in a 24-hour urine collection. Based on these findings, surgical removal of the adenoma may be considered.'   Is the level of calcium elevated enough to be dangerous, or is it causing symptoms? What is the underlying cause of the hypercalcemia, and does it need treatment?"
What is the prognosis for hypercalcemia?,"'The results of treatment for hypercalcemia depend on the underlying cause of the condition. If hypercalcemia is seen in the presence of ''cancer'', the average 30-day survival rate is about 50%. The prognosis is excellent for many of the other causes of hypercalcemia provided the underlying cause is addressed and treated.' "
Is it possible to prevent hypercalcemia?,"'Hypercalcemia cannot be prevented, but early detection can both allow for normalization of calcium levels and lead to an early work-up to define the cause. If there is a known family history of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism, it is worth mentioning this to the health care practitioner; together the patient and health care practitioner can determine if screening is warranted.' "
What is Cushing's syndrome?,"'Cushing\'s syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body\'s tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol. Sometimes called ""hypercortisolism,"" it is relatively rare and most commonly affects adults aged 20 to 50.'  "
What are the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome?,"'Symptoms vary, but most people have upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, and thinning arms and legs. Children tend to be obese with slowed growth rates.''Other symptoms appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin. It ''bruises'' easily and heals poorly. Purplish pink ''stretch marks'' may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms and breasts. The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting or rising from a chair may lead to backaches, rib and spinal column ''fractures''.''Most people have severe ''fatigue'', weak muscles, ''high blood pressure'' and ''high blood sugar''. Irritability, ''anxiety'' and ''depression'' are common.''Women usually have excess hair growth on their faces, necks, chests, abdomens, and thighs. Their menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. Men have decreased ''fertility'' with diminished or absent desire for sex.'  "
What causes Cushing's syndrome?,"""Cushing's syndrome occurs when the body's tissues are exposed to excessive levels of cortisol for long periods of time. Many people suffer the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome because they take glucocorticoid hormones such as prednisone for ""'asthma'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'' and other inflammatory diseases, or for immunosuppression after transplantation.'""Others develop Cushing's syndrome because of overproduction of cortisol by the body. Normally, the production of cortisol follows a precise chain of events. First, the hypothalamus, a part of the brain which is about the size of a small ""'sugar'' cube, sends corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) to the pituitary gland. CRH causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals, which are located just above the kidneys, receive the ACTH, they respond by releasing cortisol into the bloodstream.''Cortisol performs vital tasks in the body. It helps maintain ''blood pressure'"" and cardiovascular function, reduces the immune system's inflammatory response, balances the effects of ""'insulin'' in breaking down ''sugar'' for energy, and regulates the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and ''fats'"". One of cortisol's most important jobs is to help the body respond to ""'stress''. For this reason, women in their last 3 months of ''pregnancy'' and highly trained athletes normally have high levels of the hormone. People suffering from ''depression'', ''alcoholism'', malnutrition and ''panic disorders'' also have increased cortisol levels.'""When the amount of cortisol in the blood is adequate, the hypothalamus and pituitary release less CRH and ACTH. This ensures that the amount of cortisol released by the adrenal glands is precisely balanced to meet the body's daily needs. However, if something goes wrong with the adrenals or their regulating switches in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, cortisol production can go awry.""'Pituitary adenomas cause most cases of Cushing\'s syndrome. They are benign, or non-cancerous, tumors of the pituitary gland which secrete increased amounts of ACTH. Most patients have a single adenoma. This form of the syndrome, known as ""Cushing\'s disease,"" affects women five times more frequently than men.''Some benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous) tumors that arise outside the pituitary can produce ACTH. This condition is known as ectopic ACTH syndrome. Lung tumors cause over 50 percent of these cases. Men are affected 3 times more frequently than women. The most common forms of ACTH-producing tumors are oat cell, or ''small cell lung cancer'', which accounts for about 25 percent of all ''lung cancer'' cases, and carcinoid tumors. Other less common types of tumors that can produce ACTH are thymomas, pancreatic ''islet cell tumors'', and medullary carcinomas of the thyroid.''Sometimes, an abnormality of the adrenal glands, most often an adrenal ''tumor'"", causes Cushing's syndrome. The average age of onset is about 40 years. Most of these cases involve non-cancerous tumors of adrenal tissue, called adrenal adenomas, which release excess cortisol into the blood.""'Adrenocortical carcinomas, or adrenal ''cancers'"", are the least common cause of Cushing's syndrome. ""'Cancer'' cells secrete excess levels of several adrenal cortical hormones, including cortisol and adrenal androgens. Adrenocortical carcinomas usually cause very high hormone levels and rapid development of symptoms.'""Most cases of Cushing's syndrome are not ""'inherited'"". Rarely, however, some individuals have special causes of Cushing's syndrome due to an inherited tendency to develop tumors of one or more endocrine glands. In Primary Pigmented Micronodular Adrenal Disease, children or young adults develop small cortisol-producing tumors of the adrenal glands. In Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type I (MEN I), hormone secreting tumors of the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary occur. Cushing's syndrome in MEN I may be due to pituitary, ectopic or adrenal tumors."" "
How is Cushing's syndrome diagnosed?,"""Diagnosis is based on a review of the patient's medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Often x-ray exams of the adrenal or pituitary glands are useful for locating tumors. These tests help to determine if excess levels of cortisol are present and why.""""This is the most specific diagnostic test. The patient's urine is collected over a 24-hour period and tested for the amount of cortisol. Levels higher than 50-100 micrograms a day for an adult suggest Cushing's syndrome. The normal upper limit varies in different laboratories, depending on which measurement technique is used.""""Once Cushing's syndrome has been diagnosed, other tests are used to find the exact location of the abnormality that leads to excess cortisol production. The choice of test depends, in part, on the preference of the endocrinologist or the center where the test is performed.""""This test helps to distinguish patients with excess production of ACTH due to pituitary adenomas from those with ectopic ACTH-producing tumors. Patients are given dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, by mouth every 6 hours for 4 days. For the first 2 days, low doses of dexamethasone are given, and for the last 2 days, higher doses are given. Twenty-four hour urine collections are made before dexamethasone is administered and on each day of the test. Since cortisol and other glucocorticoids signal the pituitary to lower secretion of ACTH, the normal response after taking dexamethasone is a drop in blood and urine cortisol levels. Different responses of cortisol to dexamethasone are obtained depending on whether the cause of Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma or an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor.""'The dexamethasone suppression test can produce false-positive results in patients with ''depression'', ''alcohol abuse'', high estrogen levels, acute illness, and ''stress''. Conversely, drugs such as ''phenytoin'' and phenobarbital may cause false-negative results in response to dexamethasone suppression. For this reason, patients are usually advised by their physicians to stop taking these drugs at least one week before the test.''This test helps to distinguish between patients with pituitary adenomas and those with ectopic ACTH syndrome or cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors. Patients are given an injection of CRH, the corticotropin-releasing hormone which causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH. Patients with pituitary adenomas usually experience a rise in blood levels of ACTH and cortisol. This response is rarely seen in patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome and practically never in patients with cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors.''Imaging tests reveal the size and shape of the pituitary and adrenal glands and help determine if a tumor is present. The most common are the CT (''computerized tomography'') scan and MRI (''magnetic resonance imaging''). A CT scan produces a series of x-ray pictures giving a cross-sectional image of a body part. MRI also produces images of the internal organs of the body but without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation.''Imaging procedures are used to find a tumor after a diagnosis has been established. Imaging is not used to make the diagnosis of Cushing\'s syndrome because benign tumors, sometimes called ""incidentalomas,"" are commonly found in the pituitary and adrenal glands. These tumors do not produce hormones detrimental to health and are not removed unless blood tests show they are a cause of symptoms or they are unusually large. Conversely, pituitary tumors are not detected by imaging in almost 50 percent of patients who ultimately require pituitary surgery for Cushing\'s syndrome.'""This test is not always required, but in many cases, it is the best way to separate pituitary from ectopic causes of Cushing's syndrome. Samples of blood are drawn from the petrosal sinuses, veins which drain the pituitary, by introducing catheters through a vein in the upper thigh/groin region, with local anesthesia and mild sedation. ""'X-rays'' are used to confirm the correct position of the catheters. Often CRH, the hormone which causes the pituitary to secrete ACTH, is given during this test to improve diagnostic accuracy. Levels of ACTH in the petrosal sinuses are measured and compared with ACTH levels in a forearm vein. ACTH levels higher in the petrosal sinuses than in the forearm vein indicate the presence of a pituitary adenoma; similar levels suggest ectopic ACTH syndrome.'""Some individuals have high cortisol levels, but do not develop the progressive effects of Cushing's syndrome, such as muscle weakness, fractures and thinning of the skin. These individuals may have Pseudo Cushing's syndrome, which was originally described in people who were ""'depressed'' or drank excess ''alcohol'"", but is now known to be more common. Pseudo Cushing's does not have the same long-term effects on health as Cushing's syndrome and does not require treatment directed at the endocrine glands. Although observation over months to years will distinguish Pseudo Cushing's from Cushing's, the dexamethasone-CRH test was developed to distinguish between the conditions rapidly, so that Cushing's patients can receive prompt treatment. This test combines the dexamethasone suppression and the CRH stimulation tests. Elevations of cortisol during this test suggest Cushing's syndrome.""""Some patients may have sustained high cortisol levels without the effects of Cushing's syndrome. These high cortisol levels may be compensating for the body's resistance to cortisol's effects. This rare syndrome of cortisol resistance is a genetic condition that causes ""'hypertension'' and chronic ''androgen'' excess.'""Sometimes other conditions may be associated with many of the symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. These include ""'polycystic ovarian syndrome'', which may cause menstrual disturbances, ''weight gain'' from adolescence, excess hair growth and sometimes impaired insulin action and ''diabetes''. Commonly, weight gain, ''high blood pressure'' and abnormal levels of ''cholesterol'' and ''triglycerides'' in the blood are associated with resistance to insulin action and ''diabetes''; this has been described as the ""''Metabolic Syndrome''-X."" Patients with these disorders do not have abnormally elevated cortisol levels.'  "
How is Cushing's syndrome treated?,"'Treatment depends on the specific reason for cortisol excess and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or the use of cortisol-inhibiting drugs. If the cause is long-term use of glucocorticoid hormones to treat another disorder, the doctor will gradually reduce the dosage to the lowest dose adequate for control of that disorder. Once control is established, the daily dose of glucocorticoid hormones may be doubled and given on alternate days to lessen side effects.'""Several therapies are available to treat the ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas of Cushing's disease. The most widely used treatment is surgical removal of the tumor, known as transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Using a special microscope and very fine instruments, the surgeon approaches the pituitary gland through a nostril or an opening made below the upper lip. Because this is an extremely delicate procedure, patients are often referred to centers specializing in this type of surgery. The success, or cure, rate of this procedure is over 80 percent when performed by a surgeon with extensive experience. If surgery fails, or only produces a temporary cure, surgery can be repeated, often with good results. After curative pituitary surgery, the production of ACTH drops two levels below normal. This is a natural, but temporary, drop in ACTH production, and patients are given a synthetic form of cortisol (such as hydrocortisone or prednisone). Most patients can stop this replacement therapy in less than a year.""'For patients in whom transsphenoidal surgery has failed or who are not suitable candidates for surgery, radiotherapy is another possible treatment. Radiation to the pituitary gland is given over a 6-week period, with improvement occurring in 40 to 50 percent of adults and up to 80 percent of children. It may take several months or years before patients feel better from radiation treatment alone. However, the combination of radiation and the drug ''mitotane'' (''Lysodren''®) can help speed recovery. Mitotane suppresses cortisol production and lowers plasma and urine hormone levels. Treatment with mitotane alone can be successful in 30 to 40 percent of patients. Other drugs used alone or in combination to control the production of excess cortisol are aminoglutethimide, ''metyrapone'', trilostane and ''ketoconazole''. Each has its own side effects that doctors consider when prescribing therapy for individual patients.''To cure the overproduction of cortisol caused by ectopic ACTH syndrome, it is necessary to eliminate all of the cancerous tissue that is secreting ACTH. The choice of ''cancer'' treatment - surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination of these treatments - depends on the type of ''cancer'' and how far it has spread. Since ACTH-secreting tumors (for example, small cell ''lung cancer'') may be very small or widespread at the time of diagnosis, cortisol-inhibiting drugs, like mitotane, are an important part of treatment. In some cases, if pituitary surgery is not successful, surgical removal of the adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy) may take the place of drug therapy.'""Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for benign as well as cancerous tumors of the adrenal glands. In Primary Pigmented Micronodular Adrenal Disease and the familial Carney's complex, surgical removal of the adrenal glands is required."" "
What research is being done on Cushing's syndrome?,"""The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the biomedical research component of the Federal Government. It is one of the health agencies of the Public Health Service, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Several components of the NIH conduct and support research on Cushing's syndrome and other disorders of the endocrine system, including the National Institute of ""'Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI).'""NIH-supported scientists are conducting intensive research into the normal and abnormal function of the major endocrine glands and the many hormones of the endocrine system. Identification of the corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), which instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH, enabled researchers to develop the CRH stimulation test, which is increasingly being used to identify the cause of Cushing's syndrome.""""Improved techniques for measuring ACTH permit distinction of ACTH-dependent forms of Cushing's syndrome from adrenal tumors. NIH studies have shown that petrosal sinus sampling is a very accurate test to diagnose the cause of Cushing's syndrome in those who have excess ACTH production. The recently described dexamethasone suppression-CRH test is able to differentiate most cases of Cushing's from Pseudo Cushing's.""""As a result of this research, doctors are much better able to diagnose Cushing's syndrome and distinguish among the causes of this disorder. Since accurate diagnosis is still a problem for some patients, new tests are under study to further refine the diagnostic process.""""Many studies are underway to understand the causes of formation of benign endocrine tumors, such as those which cause most cases of Cushing's syndrome. In a few pituitary adenomas, specific gene defects have been identified and may provide important clues to understanding tumor formation. Endocrine factors may also play a role. There is increasing evidence that tumor formation is a multi-step process. Understanding the basis of Cushing's syndrome will yield new approaches to therapy.""""NIH supports research related to Cushing's syndrome at medical centers throughout the United States. Scientists are also treating patients with Cushing's syndrome at the NIH Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Physicians who are interested in referring a patient may contact Dr. George P. Chrousos, Developmental Endocrinology Branch, NICHD, Building 10, Room 10N262, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, telephone 301-496-4686."" "

What is hyperdontia?,"'Hyperdontia is an oral condition characterized by having an excess number of ''teeth''. The standard number of primary teeth is 20 and the standard number of permanent teeth is 32. ''Primary teeth'"" are the first set of teeth that erupt in a person's mouth, generally by the age of 36 months of age, and are shed by the time the person is about 12 years old. The permanent teeth then take the place of the primary teeth and usually erupt completely by the time the person reaches 21 years of age. A person who develops more than 20 primary teeth or more than 32 permanent teeth has hyperdontia. The additional teeth are referred to as supernumerary teeth.""'Supernumerary teeth can occur in any part of the dental arch, but the most common supernumerary teeth are permanent, anterior incisors, in the maxillary (upper) arch. After maxillary incisors, maxillary and mandibular (lower arch) fourth molars are the next most common supernumerary teeth. These generally appear as extra impacted ''wisdom teeth''. An extra maxillary incisor is called a mesiodens, and an extra fourth molar is referred to as a distodens or distomolar. Extra primary teeth present at or shortly after birth are called natal teeth.'  "
How common is hyperdontia?,"'The prevalence of hyperdontia is between 1% and 4% of the population with a male to female ratio of 2:1; the majority of cases are limited to a single tooth. There have been reported cases of over 30 supernumerary teeth in one person, but such large numbers are rare.' "
What are risk factors for hyperdontia?,"'When a person does develop multiple supernumerary teeth, it often is associated with a variety of conditions or syndromes such as ''cleidocranial dysplasia'', ''Ehler-Danlos syndrome'', ''Gardner syndrome'', and ''cleft lip'' and palate''.' "
What is the cause of hyperdontia?,"'The cause of hyperdontia is not entirely clear. It is believed that there may be a genetic factor in hyperdontia consisting of an autosomal dominant trait with low penetrance (only sometimes producing supernumerary teeth in a carrier of the mutated gene). Other possible causes are environmental factors and overactivity of the dental lamina during tooth development. The dental lamina is a zone of cells that initiates the formation of the tooth germ, which forms the tooth.' "
What is the treatment for hyperdontia?,"'It is important to detect, evaluate, and treat supernumerary teeth as soon as possible since the additional teeth will present both cosmetic and functional problems for the affected individual. As a majority of supernumerary teeth cause clinical problems, treatment generally consists of removal of the teeth when possible.' "
What are complications of hyperdontia? What is the prognosis of hyperdontia?,"'Supernumerary teeth may cause delayed eruption of adjacent teeth or significant crowding that will often require orthodontic treatment to correct. If retained, the teeth can lead to the development of ''cysts'' or ''tumors''. It is generally not necessary to remove natal teeth unless the supernumerary teeth are loose and present a risk for aspiration due to passage into the lung.' "
What is high blood sugar?,"'Hyperglycemia is the medical term describing an abnormally high blood glucose (blood sugar) level. Blood sugar is measured in a sample of blood taken from a vein or from a small ''finger stick'"" sample of blood. It can be measured in a laboratory either alone or with other blood tests, or it can be measured using a handheld glucometer, a small device that allows frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels without the need for a doctor's office or laboratory.""'Hyperglycemia or high blood sugar is a hallmark sign of diabetes (both ''type 1 diabetes'' and ''type 2 diabetes'') and prediabetes. ''Normal ranges for blood glucose'' measurements can vary slightly among different laboratories, but in general a fasting (early a.m. before breakfast) glucose level is considered normal if it is between 70-100 mg/dL. Glucose levels may rise slightly above this range following a meal. Random blood glucose measurements are usually lower than 125 mg/dL.'  "
10 Symptoms and signs of high blood sugar,"'The main symptoms of hyperglycemia are increased ''thirst'' and a frequent need to urinate. Other symptoms that can occur with high blood sugar are:''Other symptoms and signs of high blood sugar include:''Nose spray. Some nasal sprays have chemicals that trigger the ''liver'' to make more blood sugar.''Severely elevated blood sugar levels can result in a medical emergency (""''diabetic coma''""). This can occur in both people with type 1 and those with type 2 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes may develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and those with type 2 diabetes can develop hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS, also referred to as hyperglycemisa hyperosmolar state). These so-called hyperglycemia crises are serious conditions that can be life threatening if not treated immediately. Hyperglycemic crises cause about 2,400 deaths each year in the U.S.''Over time, hyperglycemia can lead to damage to organs and tissues. Long-term hyperglycemia can impair the immune response, leading to poor healing of ''cuts'' and wounds. It can also cause nerve damage, vision problems, and damage to the blood vessels and kidneys (see below).'   Headaches. Tiredness. Blurred vision. Hunger. Trouble with thinking or concentrating. Frequent urination Sunburns. Pain from a sunburn causes pain, which increases blood sugars. Coffee. Some people with diabetes have an extra sensitivity to caffeine. Gum disease. Gum disease is a complication of diabetes, and can make blood sugars rise. Loosing sleep. Going a night or two without sleeping can cause the body to use insulin less efficiently."
What causes high blood sugar?,"'A number of medical conditions can cause hyperglycemia, but the most common by far is ''diabetes mellitus''. Diabetes affects over 8% of the total U.S. population. In diabetes, blood glucose levels rise either because there is an insufficient amount of insulin in the body or the body cannot use insulin well. Normally, the pancreas releases insulin after a meal so that the cells of the body can utilize glucose for fuel. This keeps blood glucose levels in the normal range.'""Type 1 diabetes is responsible for about 5% of all cases of diabetes and results from damage to the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is far more common and is related to the body's inability to effectively use insulin. In addition to type 1 and type 2, ""'gestational diabetes'' is a form of diabetes that develops in ''pregnant'' women. Studies show that between 2% to 10% of all pregnant women get ''gestational diabetes''.''Sometimes, high blood sugar is not the result of diabetes. Other medical conditions that can cause the condition include:'   Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Pancreatic cancer Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) Cushing's syndrome (elevated blood cortisol level) Unusual tumors that secrete hormones, including glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma, or growth hormone-secreting tumors Severe stresses on the body, such as heart attack, stroke, trauma, or severe illnesses, can temporarily lead to hyperglycemia Taking certain medications, including prednisone, estrogens, beta-blockers, glucagon, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, and others, can elevate blood glucose levels"
How is high blood sugar diagnosed?,"'There are different kinds of blood tests that can diagnose hyperglycemia. These include:''Random blood glucose:'' this test reflects the blood sugar level at a given point in time. Normal values are generally between 70 and 125 mg/dL, as discussed earlier.''Fasting blood glucose'':'' this is a measurement of blood sugar level taken in the early morning prior to eating or drinking anything since the night before. Normal fasting blood glucose levels are less than 100 mg/dL. Levels above 100 mg/dL up to 125 mg/dL suggest prediabetes, while levels of 126 mg/dL or above are diagnostic of diabetes.''Oral glucose tolerance test'': this is a test that measures blood glucose levels at given time points after a dose of sugar is consumed. This test is most commonly used to diagnose gestational diabetes.''Glycohemoglobin A1c'': is a measurement of glucose that is bound to ''red blood cells'' and provides an indication about blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months.' "
What is the treatment for high blood sugar?,"'Mild or transient hyperglycemia may not need medical treatment, depending upon the cause. People with mildly elevated glucose or prediabetes can often lower their glucose levels by incorporating ''diet'' and lifestyle changes. Discuss any dietary or lifestyle changes with your healthcare team to assure or use reliable resources such as the American Diabetes Association.''Insulin is the treatment of choice for people with type 1 diabetes and for life-threatening increases in glucose levels. People with type 2 diabetes may be managed with a combination of different oral and injectable medications. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin.''High blood sugar due to medical conditions other than diabetes is generally treated by addressing the underlying condition responsible for the elevated glucose. In some cases, insulin may be needed to stabilize glucose levels during this treatment.' "
What are the dangers and complications of high blood sugar?,"'Long-term complications of prolonged hyperglycemia or high blood sugar can be severe. These occur in people with diabetes and are worse when the condition is poorly controlled. The long-term complications of diabetes tend to develop slowly over time. Some of the complications of hyperglycemia in poorly controlled diabetes are:' Heart and blood vessel disease, that can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease Poor kidney function eventually leading to kidney failure Nerve damage, that can lead to burning, tingling, pain, and changes in sensation Eye diseases, including damage to the retina, glaucoma, and cataracts Gum disease"
What is excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)?,"'The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis, excessive sweat or excessive sweating, produces a lot of embarrassment and unhappiness. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no apparent cause. Secondary hyperhidrosis is much less common and can be due to certain ''drugs'', a variety of serious systemic diseases, neurological disorders, facial surgery, and ''anxiety''. Of the approximately 3% of Americans who suffer from excessive sweating, 50% involve the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis). Underarm problems tend to start around ''puberty'', while palm and sole sweating may begin earlier, often during childhood. Untreated, these problems may continue throughout life.''Sweating is embarrassing, stains clothes, and may complicate business and social interactions. Excessive sweat can have serious practical consequences, like making it difficult to hold tools, grip a steering wheel, or shake hands.'  "
What is the cause of excessive sweating?,"'Otherwise healthy people with excessive sweating have primary hyperhidrosis. Heat and emotions may trigger hyperhidrosis in some, but many who suffer from hyperhidrosis perspire nearly all the time, regardless of their mood or the weather.''Secondary hyperhidrosis can be caused by medications such as ''dopamine'' agonists, ''antidepressants'', antipsychotics, ''alcohol'', and ''insulin''.

What is hyperkalemia?,"'Hyperkalemia is a common diagnosis. Fortunately, most patients who are diagnosed have mild hyperkalemia (which is usually well tolerated). However, any condition causing even mild hyperkalemia should be treated to prevent progression into more severe hyperkalemia. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood (severe hyperkalemia) can lead to ''cardiac arrest'' and death. When not recognized and treated properly, severe hyperkalemia results in a high mortality rate.''Technically, hyperkalemia means an abnormally elevated level of potassium in the blood. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Potassium levels between 5.1 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L reflect mild hyperkalemia. Potassium levels of 6.1 mEq/L to 7.0 mEq/L are moderate hyperkalemia, and levels above 7 mEq/L are severe hyperkalemia.'  "
How does hyperkalemia affect the body?,"'Potassium is critical for the normal functioning of the muscles, ''heart'', and nerves. It plays an important role in controlling activity of smooth muscle (such as the muscle found in the digestive tract) and skeletal muscle (muscles of the extremities and torso), as well as the muscles of the heart. It is also important for normal transmission of electrical signals throughout the nervous system within the body.''Normal blood levels of potassium are critical for maintaining normal heart electrical rhythm. Both low blood potassium levels (''hypokalemia'') and high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can lead to ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''The most important clinical effect of hyperkalemia is related to electrical rhythm of the heart. While mild hyperkalemia probably has a limited effect on the heart, moderate hyperkalemia can produce ''EKG'' changes (EKG is a reading of the electrical activity of the heart muscles), and severe hyperkalemia can cause suppression of electrical activity of the heart and can cause the heart to stop beating.''Another important effect of hyperkalemia is interference with functioning of the skeletal muscles. Hyperkalemic periodic ''paralysis'' is a rare ''inherited'' disorder in which patients can develop sudden onset of hyperkalemia, which in turn causes muscle paralysis. The reason for the muscle paralysis is not clearly understood, but it is probably due to hyperkalemia suppressing the electrical activity of the muscle.' "
What are the symptoms of hyperkalemia?,"'Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic, meaning that it causes no symptoms. Sometimes, patients with hyperkalemia report vague symptoms including:''More serious symptoms of hyperkalemia include slow heartbeat and weak pulse. Severe hyperkalemia can result in fatal cardiac standstill (heart stoppage). Generally, a slowly rising potassium level (such as with chronic ''kidney failure'') is better tolerated than an abrupt rise in potassium levels. Unless the rise in potassium has been very rapid, symptoms of hyperkalemia are usually not apparent until potassium levels are very high (typically 7.0 mEq/l or higher).''Symptoms may also be present that reflect the underlying medical conditions that are causing the hyperkalemia.'   nausea, fatigue, muscle weakness, or tingling sensations."
What causes hyperkalemia?,"'The major causes of hyperkalemia are kidney dysfunction, diseases of the adrenal gland, potassium shifting out of cells into the blood circulation, and medications.' "
Hyperkalemia and kidney dysfunction,"'The kidneys normally excrete potassium so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. These include:''Furthermore, patients with kidney dysfunctions are especially sensitive to medications that can increase blood potassium levels. For example, patients with kidney dysfunctions can develop worsening hyperkalemia when given salt substitutes that contain potassium, potassium ''supplements'' (either orally or intravenously), or medications that can increase blood potassium levels. Examples of medications that can increase blood potassium levels include:' acute and chronic renal failure, glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, transplant rejection, and obstructive diseases of the urinary tract, such as urolithiasis (stones in the urinary tract). ACE inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), and potassium-sparing diuretics."
Hyperkalemia and diseases of the adrenal gland,"""Adrenal glands are small glands located adjacent to the kidneys, and are important in secreting hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain sodium and fluid while excreting potassium in the urine. Therefore diseases of the adrenal gland, such as Addison's disease, that lead to decreased aldosterone secretion can decrease kidney excretion of potassium, resulting in body retention of potassium, and hence hyperkalemia."" "
Hyperkalemia and potassium shifts,"'Potassium can move out of and into cells. Our total body potassium stores are approximately 50 mEq/kg of body weight. At any given time, about 98% of the total potassium in the body is located inside of cells (intracellular), with only 2% located outside of cells (in the blood circulation and in the extracellular tissue). The blood tests for measurement of potassium levels measure only the potassium that is outside of the cells. Therefore, conditions that can cause potassium to move out of the cells into the blood circulation can increase the blood potassium levels even though the total amount of potassium in the body has not changed.''One example of potassium shift causing hyperkalemia is diabetic ''ketoacidosis''. ''Insulin'' is vital to patients with ''type 1 diabetes''. Without insulin, patients with ''type 1 diabetes'' can develop severely elevated blood glucose levels. Lack of insulin also causes the breakdown of fat cells, with the release of ketones into the blood, turning the blood acidic (hence the term ketoacidosis). The acidosis and high glucose levels in the blood work together to cause fluid and potassium to move out of the cells into the blood circulation. Patients with ''diabetes'' often also have diminished kidney capacity to excrete potassium into urine. The combination of potassium shift out of cells and diminished urine potassium excretion causes hyperkalemia.''Another cause of hyperkalemia is tissue destruction, dying cells release potassium into the blood circulation. Examples of tissue destruction causing hyperkalemia include:' trauma, burns, surgery, hemolysis (disintegration of red blood cells), massive lysis of tumor cells, and rhabdomyolysis (a condition involving destruction of muscle cells that is sometimes associated with muscle injury, alcoholism, or drug abuse)."
Hyperkalemia and medications,"'Potassium ''supplements'', salt substitutes that contain potassium and other medications can cause hyperkalemia.''In normal individuals, healthy kidneys can adapt to excessive oral intake of potassium by increasing urine excretion of potassium, thus preventing the development of hyperkalemia. However, taking in too much potassium (through foods, supplements, or salt substitutes that contain potassium) can cause hyperkalemia if there is kidney dysfunction or if the patient is taking medications that decrease urine potassium excretion such as ACE inhibitors and potassium-sparing diuretics.''Examples of medications that decrease urine potassium excretion include:''Even though mild hyperkalemia is common with these medications, severe hyperkalemia usually does not occur unless these medications are given to patients with kidney dysfunction.'   ACE inhibitors, ARBs, NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics such as:spironolactone (Aldactone),triamterene (Dyrenium), andtrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim). spironolactone (Aldactone), triamterene (Dyrenium), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)."
How is hyperkalemia diagnosed?,"'Blood is withdrawn from a vein (like other blood tests). The potassium concentration of the blood is determined in the laboratory. If hyperkalemia is suspected, an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'' or EKG) is often performed, since the ECG may show changes typical for hyperkalemia in moderate to severe cases. The ECG will also be able to identify cardiac arrhythmias that result from hyperkalemia.'  "
How is hyperkalemia treated?,"'Treatment of hyperkalemia must be individualized based upon the underlying cause of the hyperkalemia, the severity of symptoms or appearance of ECG changes, and the overall health status of the patient. Mild hyperkalemia is usually treated without hospitalization especially if the patient is otherwise healthy, the ECG is normal, and there are no other associated conditions such as acidosis and worsening kidney function. Emergency treatment is necessary if hyperkalemia is severe and has caused changes in the ECG. Severe hyperkalemia is best treated in the hospital, oftentimes in the intensive care unit, under continuous heart rhythm monitoring.''Treatment of hyperkalemia may include any of the following measures, either singly or in combination:''Treatment of hyperkalemia also includes treatment of any underlying causes (for example, ''kidney disease'', adrenal disease, tissue destruction) of hyperkalemia.'   A diet low in potassium (for mild cases). Discontinue medications that increase blood potassium levels. Intravenous administration of glucose and insulin, which promotes movement of potassium from the extracellular space back into the cells. Intravenous calcium to temporarily protect the heart and muscles from the effects of hyperkalemia. Sodium bicarbonate administration to counteract acidosis and to promote movement of potassium from the extracellular space back into the cells. Diuretic administration to decrease the total potassium stores through increasing potassium excretion in the urine. It is important to note that most diuretics increase kidney excretion of potassium. Only the potassium-sparing diuretics mentioned above decrease kidney excretion of potassium. Medications that stimulate beta-2 adrenergic receptors, such as albuterol and epinephrine, have also been used to drive potassium back into cells. Medications known as cation-exchange resins, which bind potassium and lead to its excretion via the gastrointestinal tract. Dialysis, particularly if other measures have failed or if renal failure is present."
What is hyperkalemia?,"'Hyperkalemia is a common diagnosis. Fortunately, most patients who are diagnosed have mild hyperkalemia (which is usually well tolerated). However, any condition causing even mild hyperkalemia should be treated to prevent progression into more severe hyperkalemia. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood (severe hyperkalemia) can lead to ''cardiac arrest'' and death. When not recognized and treated properly, severe hyperkalemia results in a high mortality rate.''Technically, hyperkalemia means an abnormally elevated level of potassium in the blood. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Potassium levels between 5.1 mEq/L to 6.0 mEq/L reflect mild hyperkalemia. Potassium levels of 6.1 mEq/L to 7.0 mEq/L are moderate hyperkalemia, and levels above 7 mEq/L are severe hyperkalemia.'  "
How does hyperkalemia affect the body?,"'Potassium is critical for the normal functioning of the muscles, ''heart'', and nerves. It plays an important role in controlling activity of smooth muscle (such as the muscle found in the digestive tract) and skeletal muscle (muscles of the extremities and torso), as well as the muscles of the heart. It is also important for normal transmission of electrical signals throughout the nervous system within the body.''Normal blood levels of potassium are critical for maintaining normal heart electrical rhythm. Both low blood potassium levels (''hypokalemia'') and high blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) can lead to ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''The most important clinical effect of hyperkalemia is related to electrical rhythm of the heart. While mild hyperkalemia probably has a limited effect on the heart, moderate hyperkalemia can produce ''EKG'' changes (EKG is a reading of the electrical activity of the heart muscles), and severe hyperkalemia can cause suppression of electrical activity of the heart and can cause the heart to stop beating.''Another important effect of hyperkalemia is interference with functioning of the skeletal muscles. Hyperkalemic periodic ''paralysis'' is a rare ''inherited'' disorder in which patients can develop sudden onset of hyperkalemia, which in turn causes muscle paralysis. The reason for the muscle paralysis is not clearly understood, but it is probably due to hyperkalemia suppressing the electrical activity of the muscle.' "
What are the symptoms of hyperkalemia?,"'Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic, meaning that it causes no symptoms. Sometimes, patients with hyperkalemia report vague symptoms including:''More serious symptoms of hyperkalemia include slow heartbeat and weak pulse. Severe hyperkalemia can result in fatal cardiac standstill (heart stoppage). Generally, a slowly rising potassium level (such as with chronic ''kidney failure'') is better tolerated than an abrupt rise in potassium levels.

What is joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'The joint hypermobility syndrome is a condition that features joints that easily move beyond the normal range expected for a particular joint. The joint hypermobility syndrome is considered a benign condition. It is estimated that 10%-15% of normal children have hypermobile joints or joints that can move beyond the normal range of motion. Hypermobile joints are sometimes referred to as ""loose joints,"" and those affected are referred to as being ""double jointed.""' "
What diseases are risk factors for joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Joint hypermobility is also a feature of a rare, inherited, more significant medical condition called ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome'' (EDS), which is characterized by ''weakness'' of the connective tissues of the body. Joint hypermobility is commonly seen in people with ''Down syndrome'' and in people with ''Marfan syndrome''.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of joint hypermobility?,"'Because the joints are capable of excessive motion in people with the joint hypermobility syndrome, they are susceptible to injury. Symptoms of the joint hypermobility syndrome include ''pain'' in the knees, fingers, hips, and elbows. There is a higher incidence of joint dislocation and ''sprains'' of involved joints. ''Scoliosis'' (curvature of the spine) occurs more frequently in people with hypermobile joints and can lead to ''back pain''. Joint hypermobility tends to decrease with ''aging'' as we become naturally less flexible.''Signs of the syndrome are the ability to place the palms of the hands on the floor with the knees fully extended, hyperextension of the knee or elbow beyond 10 degrees, and the ability to touch the thumb to the forearm.'  "
What causes joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Hypermobile joints tend to be inherited in specific genes passed on by parents to their children. It is felt that these certain genes predispose to the development of hypermobile joints. As a result, there is a tendency of the condition to run in families (familial). Genes that are responsible for the production of collagen, an important protein that helps to glue tissues together, are suspected of playing a role.'  "
What tests diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Joint hypermobility syndrome is diagnosed by examining affected joints and noting that they easily move beyond the normal range expected. For example, the middle of the fingers may bend backward more than usual. There is no blood test for hypermobility syndrome.' "
What is the treatment for hypermobility syndrome?,"'Often joint hypermobility causes no symptoms and requires no treatment. Many individuals with joint hypermobility syndrome improve in adulthood. Treatments are customized for each individual based on their particular manifestations. ''Joint pains'' can be relieved by medications for pain or inflammation. Proper physical ''fitness'' ''exercise'' should be designed to avoid injury to joints. Home remedies include home exercises and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), as needed. Sometimes physical therapy can help with rehabilitation of injured areas and can be especially helpful to prevent reinjury.'  "
What is the prognosis for joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Frequently, there are no long-term consequences of joint hypermobility syndrome. However, hypermobile joints can lead to ''joint pain''. Over time, joint hypermobility can lead to degenerative cartilage and ''arthritis''. Certain hypermobile joints can be at risk for injury, such sprained ligaments.' "
Which types of doctors treat hypermobility syndrome?,"'Doctors who treat hypermobility syndrome include general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'', orthopedists, and physical-medicine physicians.' "
Can you prevent joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Because joint hypermobility syndrome is inherited, it is not preventable. Nevertheless, when joint hypermobility syndrome causes symptoms, ''prevention'' of injury and pain is possible by avoiding ''trauma'' and with appropriate treatments.' "
What is hyperparathyroidism?,"'Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, also called parathyroids. ""Primary"" means this disorder originates in the parathyroids: One or more enlarged, overactive parathyroid glands secretes too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). In secondary hyperparathyroidism, a problem such as ''kidney failure'' causes the parathyroids to be overactive. This publication focuses on primary hyperparathyroidism.' "
What are the parathyroid glands?,"'The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized glands located on the thyroid gland in the neck. Occasionally, a person is born with one or more of the parathyroid glands embedded in the thyroid, in the thymus, or located elsewhere around this area. In most such cases, however, the glands function normally.''Though their names are similar, the thyroid and parathyroid glands are entirely different glands, each producing distinct hormones with specific functions. The parathyroid glands secrete PTH, a substance that helps maintain the correct balance of calcium and phosphorus in the body. PTH regulates the level of calcium in the blood, release of calcium from bone, absorption of calcium in the intestine, and excretion of calcium in the urine.''When the level of calcium in the blood falls too low, the parathyroid glands secrete just enough PTH to restore the blood calcium level.' "
What is primary hyperparathyroidism?,"'If the parathyroid glands secrete too much hormone, as happens in primary hyperparathyroidism, the balance is disrupted: Blood calcium rises. This condition of excessive calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia, is what usually signals the doctor that something may be wrong with the parathyroid glands. In 85 percent of people with primary hyperparathyroidism, a benign tumor called an adenoma has formed on one of the parathyroid glands, causing it to become overactive. Benign tumors are noncancerous. In most other cases, the excess hormone comes from two or more enlarged parathyroid glands, a condition called hyperplasia. Very rarely, hyperparathyroidism is caused by ''cancer'' of a parathyroid gland.''This excess PTH triggers the release of too much calcium into the bloodstream. The bones may lose calcium, and too much calcium may be absorbed from food. The levels of calcium may increase in the urine, causing kidney stones. PTH also lowers blood phosphorus levels by increasing excretion of phosphorus in the urine.' "
How common is hyperparathyroidism?,"'In the United States, about 100,000 people develop the disorder each year. Women outnumber men two to one, and risk increases with age. In women 60 years and older, two out of 1,000 will develop hyperparathyroidism each year.' "
Why are calcium and phosphorous so important?,"'Calcium is essential for good health. It plays an important role in bone and tooth development and in maintaining bone strength. Calcium is also important in nerve transmission and muscle contraction.''Phosphorus is found in all bodily tissue. It is a main part of every cell with many roles in each. Combined with calcium, phosphorus gives strength and rigidity to your bones and ''teeth''.' "
What causes hyperparathyroidism?,"""In most cases doctors don't know the cause. The vast majority of cases occur in people with no family history of the disorder. Only about 5 percent of cases can be linked to an ""'inherited'' problem. Familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is a rare, inherited syndrome that affects the parathyroids as well as the pancreas and the ''pituitary gland''. Another rare ''genetic disorder'', familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, is sometimes confused with typical hyperparathyroidism. Each accounts for about 2 percent of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.' "
What are the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism?,"'A person with hyperparathyroidism may have severe symptoms, subtle ones, or none at all. Increasingly, routine blood tests that screen for a wide range of conditions, including ''high calcium levels'', are alerting doctors to people who have mild forms of the disorder even though they are symptom-free.''When symptoms do appear, they are often mild and nonspecific, such as a feeling of weakness and ''fatigue'', ''depression'', or aches and pains. With more severe disease, a person may have''Patients may have thinning of the bones without symptoms, but with risk of ''fractures''.''Increased calcium and phosphorus excretion in the urine may cause kidney stones.'   a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination."
Is there a blood test to diagnose hyperparathyroidism?,"'Hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed when tests show that blood levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone are too high. Other diseases can cause high blood calcium levels, but only in hyperparathyroidism is the elevated calcium the result of too much parathyroid hormone. A blood test that accurately measures the amount of parathyroid hormone has simplified the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.''Once the diagnosis is established, other tests may be done to assess complications. Because high PTH levels can cause bones to weaken from calcium loss, a measurement of ''bone density'' can help assess bone loss and the risk of fractures. Abdominal images may reveal the presence of kidney stones and a 24-hour urine collection may provide information on kidney damage, the risk of stone formation, and the risk of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.' "
Will surgery (parathyroidectomy) cure hyperthyroidism?,"'Surgery to remove the enlarged gland(s) (''parathyroidectomy'') is the main treatment for the disorder and cures it in 95 percent of operations, with low complication rates when performed by surgeons experienced with hyperparathyroidism.''The NIH panels recommended against the use of expensive imaging tests to locate benign tumors before initial surgery. Such tests are not likely to improve the success rate of surgery, which is about 95 percent when performed by experienced surgeons. Simple imaging tests before surgery are preferred by some surgeons. Localization tests are useful in patients having a second operation for recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism.'   About 1% of patients undergoing surgery experience damage to the nerves controlling the vocal cords, which can affect speech. One to 5% of patients lose all their parathyroid tissue and thus develop chronic low calcium levels, which may require treatment with calcium or vitamin D. The complication rate is slightly higher for hyperplasia than it is for adenoma since more extensive surgery is needed."
"What are other treatment 
options for hyperparathyroidism?","'Calcimimetics are a new class of drug that turns off secretion of PTH. They have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism secondary to ''kidney failure'' with ''dialysis'', and primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid ''cancer''. They have not been approved for primary hyperparathyroidism, but some physicians have begun prescribing calcimimetics for some patients with this condition. Patients can discuss this class of drug in more detail with their physicians.''Some patients who have mild disease may not need immediate treatment, according to panels convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2002. Patients who are symptom-free, whose blood calcium is only slightly elevated, and whose kidneys and bones are normal may wish to talk with their physicians about long-term monitoring. In the 2002 recommendation, periodic monitoring would consist of clinical evaluation, measurement of serum calcium levels, and bone mass measurement. If the patient and physician choose long-term follow-up, the patient should try to drink lots of water, get plenty of ''exercise'', and avoid certain diuretics, such as the ''thiazides''. Immobilization (inability to move) and gastrointestinal illness with ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'' can cause calcium levels to rise. Patients with hyperparathyroidism should seek medical attention if they find themselves immobilized, vomiting, or having ''diarrhea''.' "
Which doctors specialize in treating hyperparathyroidism?,"'Endocrinologists are doctors who specialize in hormonal problems. Nephrologists are doctors who specialize in kidney and mineral disorders. Along with surgeons who are experienced in endocrine surgery, endocrinologists and nephrologists are best qualified to treat people with hyperparathyroidism. Organizations that help people with hyperparathyroidism may have additional information to assist in finding a qualified health professional nearby.' "
What is tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is a rare disorder that increases the levels of several substances, including phenylalanine, in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the ''diet''. It is found in all proteins and in some ''artificial sweeteners''. If tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.' "
What are the symptoms of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'High levels of phenylalanine are present from early infancy in people with untreated tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. Infants with this condition appear normal at birth, but medical problems ranging from mild to severe become apparent over time.''The signs and symptoms of this condition can include:'  intellectual disability,  progressive problems 
with development, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, and an inability to control body temperature. "
How common is tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'This condition is very rare, affecting about 1 per million newborns. In most parts of the world, tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency accounts for only 1 percent to 2 percent of all cases of elevated phenylalanine levels. The remaining cases are caused by a similar condition called  ''phenylketonuria'' (PKU). In certain countries, including Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, China, and Turkey, it is more common for elevated levels of phenylalanine to be caused by tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.' "
What genes are related to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can be caused by mutations in one of several genes, including GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. These genes provide instructions for making enzymes that help produce and recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin (also known as BH4) is a molecule that helps process several amino acids, including phenylalanine. It is also involved in the production of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain.''If one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation, little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is available to help process phenylalanine. As a result, phenylalanine can build up in the blood and other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause ''brain damage''. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can also alter the levels of certain neurotransmitters, which disrupts normal brain function. ' "
How do people inherit tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'This condition is ''inherited'' in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "

What is malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to particular drugs that are often used during surgery and other invasive procedures. Specifically, this reaction occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of ''pain'', and with a muscle relaxant that is used to temporarily paralyze a person during a surgical procedure. If given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high ''fever'', increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. Without prompt treatment, the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening. ''People at increased risk for this disorder are said to have malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Affected individuals may never know they have the condition unless they undergo testing or have a severe reaction to anesthesia during a surgical procedure. While this condition often occurs in people without other serious medical problems, certain inherited muscle diseases (including  central core disease and multiminicore disease) are associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. ' "
How common is malignant hyperthermia?,"'Malignant hyperthermia occurs in 1 in 5,000 to 50,000 instances in which people are given anesthetic gases. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is probably more frequent, because many people with an increased risk of this condition are never exposed to drugs that trigger a reaction. ' "
What genes are related to malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Variations of the ''CACNA1S'' and ''RYR1'' genes increase the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia. ''Researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. Mutations in the ''RYR1'' gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as MHS1. These mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Another form of the condition, ''MHS5'', results from mutations in the ''CACNA1S'' gene. These mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. ''The ''RYR1'' and ''CACNA1S'' genes provide instructions for making proteins that play essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. The proteins produced from the ''RYR1'' and ''CACNA1S'' genes are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. In response to certain signals, the ''CACNA1S'' protein helps activate the RYR1 channel, which releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. The resulting increase in calcium ion ''concentration'' inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to contract. ''Mutations in the ''RYR1'' or ''CACNA1S'' gene cause the ''RYR1'' channel to open more easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. As a result, large amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. An overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant hyperthermia. An increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis). ''The genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (MHS2, MHS4, and MHS6) are still under study. A form of the condition known as MHS3 has been linked to the ''CACNA2D1'' gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in activating the RYR1 channel to release calcium ions into muscle cells. Although this gene is thought to be related to malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been identified. ' "
How do people inherit malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery. In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who is also at risk for the condition. ' "

Introduction to Hypersomnia,"'Hypersomnia'', or excessive sleepiness, is a condition in which a person has trouble staying awake during the day. People who have hypersomnia can fall asleep at any time; for instance, at work or while they are driving. They may also have other ''sleep''-related problems, including a ''lack of energy'' and trouble thinking clearly.''According to the National ''Sleep'' Foundation, up to 40% of people have some symptoms of hypersomnia from time to time.'  "
What Causes Hypersomnia?,"'There are several potential causes of hypersomnia, including:'   The sleep  disorders narcolepsy (daytime sleepiness) and sleep apnea 
  (interruptions of breathing during sleep) 
  Not getting enough sleep at night (sleep deprivation) 
 Being overweight
 Drug or
	alcohol abuse
 A head injury or a neurological disease, such as multiple sclerosis Prescription drugs, such as tranquilizers 
  Genetics (having a relative with hypersomnia)"
How Is Hypersomnia Diagnosed?,"'If you consistently feel drowsy during the day, talk to your doctor. In making a diagnosis of hypersomnia, your doctor will ask you about your sleeping habits, how much sleep you get at night, if you wake up at night, and whether you fall asleep during the day. Your doctor will also want to know if you are having any emotional problems or are taking any medications that may be interfering with your sleep.''Your doctor may also order some tests, including blood tests, computed tomography (CT) scans, and a sleep test called polysomnography. In some cases, an additional ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), which measures the electrical activity of the brain, is needed.' "
How Is Hypersomnia Treated?,"'If you are diagnosed with hypersomnia, your doctor can prescribe various drugs to treat it, including ''stimulants'', ''antidepressants'', as well as several newer medications (for example, ''Provigil'' and Xyrem).''If you are diagnosed with ''sleep apnea'', your doctor may prescribe a treatment known as continuous positive ''airway'' pressure, or ''CPAP''. With CPAP, you wear a mask over your nose while you are sleeping. A machine that delivers a continuous flow of air into the nostrils is hooked up to the mask. The pressure from air flowing into the nostrils helps keep the airways open.''If you are taking a medication that causes drowsiness, ask your doctor about changing the medication to one that is less likely to make you sleepy. You may also want to go to bed earlier to try to get more sleep at night, and eliminate ''alcohol'' and ''caffeine''.'  "
What is pseudotumor cerebri?,"'Pseudotumor cerebri'' literally means ""false ''brain tumor''."" It is likely due to high pressure within the skull caused by the buildup or poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The disorder is most common in women between the ages of 20 and 50.  ' "
What are the symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri?,"'Symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri include symptoms that closely mimic large ''brain tumors'':'   headache,  nausea,  vomiting, and  pulsating sounds within the head. "
How is pseudotumor cerebri treated?,"   Obesity, other treatable diseases, and some medications can cause raised intracranial pressure and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri.  A thorough medical history and physical examination is needed to evaluate these factors.  If a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri is confirmed, close, repeated ophthalmologic exams are required to monitor any changes in vision.  Drugs may be used to reduce fluid buildup and to relieve pressure.  Weight loss and cessation of certain drugs (including oral contraceptives, tetracycline, and a variety of steroids) may lead to improvement.  Surgery may be needed to remove pressure on the optic nerve. Therapeutic shunting, which involves surgically inserting a tube to drain CSF from the lower spine into the abdominal cavity, may be needed to remove excess CSF and relieve CSF pressure. "
What is the prognosis for patient's with pseudotumor cerebri?,"'The disorder may cause progressive, permanent visual loss in some patients. In some cases, pseudotumor cerebri recurs.' "

What is portal hypertension?,"'The ''liver'' serves many purposes within the body from making carbohydrates, proteins and ''fats'"" to synthesizing bile to help digest food. Because of this, the liver requires a significant blood supply. As opposed to other organs in the body, the majority of this blood supply (75%) comes from the venous system through the portal system. Blood vessels from the stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and spleen converge and form the portal vein delivering nutrients and chemical building blocks to the liver. Once in the liver, the portal vein and hepatic artery (which accounts for 25% of the liver's blood supply) come together to form sinusoids, spaces where the blood is filtered. From there, blood makes its way to the vena cava, the largest vein in the body to return to the ""'heart''.''Portal ''hypertension'' describes elevated pressure within the portal system, including the portal vein and the tributary veins that drain into it. The pressure within the portal system is not normally measured and is not an issue except if an illness or disease occurs that makes it difficult for blood to flow through the liver tissue. This damming effect increases pressure within the portal venous system and causes potential problems with ''liver function''. It is the onset of symptoms associated with ''liver disease'' that might cause the health care professional to look for the presence of portal ''hypertension''.' "
What causes portal hypertension?,"'Portal ''hypertension'' occurs when there is an obstruction of blood flow through the liver, and pressure rises within the portal vein. This obstruction can be intrahepatic (intra=within +hepatic=liver), pre-hepatic (pre=before) or post- hepatic (post=after).''Intrahepatic causes of portal hypertension include ''cirrhosis'' and hepatic fibrosis or scarring. A wide variety of illnesses are implicated as the cause of portal hypertension. Examples include the following:''Post-hepatic causes are due to obstruction of blood flow from the liver to the heart and can include:'   Alcohol abuse, Hepatitis B and C infections, Fatty liver (NASH, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), Wilson's disease, an abnormality of copper metabolism, Hemochromatosis (iron overload), excess iron buildup Cystic fibrosis Primary sclerosing cholangitis, a hardening of the bile ducts Biliary atresia, poorly formed bile ducts Parasite infections such as schistosomiasis Portal vein thrombosis or blood clots within the portal vein Congenital portal vein atresia or failure of the portal vein to develop Hepatic vein thrombosis Inferior vena cava thrombosis Restrictive pericarditis, where the lining of the heart stiffens and does not allow the heart to relax and expand when blood returns to it. Causes may include tuberculosis, fungal infections, tumors, connective tissue disorders (for example, scleroderma), and complications from radiation therapy."
What are the symptoms of portal hypertension?,"'When blood cannot easily flow through the liver architecture (from portal vein to sinusoids to hepatic vein to vena cava), it tries to bypass the portal system, using the systemic venous system to return to the heart. Symptoms of portal hypertension are due to the complications of decreased blood flow through the liver, and from increased pressure within the veins where blood is shunted.'  Varices describe enlarged veins. Blood, meant for the portal system, is diverted to and gathers in other veins as it makes its way to the heart. These varices can occur in the esophagus, stomach, around the umbilicus and in the anus and rectum. Esophageal and gastric varices are at risk for life-threatening bleeding and can have signs and symptoms with vomiting blood and blood in the stool. Melena describes black, tarry stool that is the result of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Ascites describes abnormal fluid collection within the peritoneum (the sac that contains the intestines within the abdominal cavity) and is due to a combination of factors, including increased pressure in the portal system and decrease protein in the body. The liver produces the body's protein; portal hypertension and the underlying liver disease decrease its ability to function. Hepatic encephalopathy is another complication of liver disease, causing confusion and lethargy due to the buildup of waste products and the inability of the liver to adequately filter them. Splenomegaly or enlargement of the spleen. Because of portal hypertension, blood backs up, and this also can trap the components of blood (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) within the spleen causing anemia and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count in the bloodstream). Decreased white blood cell counts increase the risk of general infection. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection within the peritoneal sac within the abdomen, and is seen as a consequence of long-standing portal hypertension."
How is the diagnosis of portal hypertension made?,"'Portal hypertension usually is diagnosed well after the process has begun in the body, and only after a complication occurs. When a patient develops\xa0ascites or has gastrointestinal bleeding, the health care professional will look for potential causes, including portal hypertension.''Once the diagnosis is a possibility, it can be confirmed by blood tests, ''X-rays'', CT or ''MRI'', and ''endoscopy''. Pressures within the portal vein are not routinely measured except in specific situations (see TIPS procedure).' "
What is the treatment for portal hypertension?,"'Treatment for portal hypertension is often directed at preventing complications. This includes treating the underlying cause and avoidance of ''alcohol''. Because of the risk of further liver damage, ''over-the-counter'' medications that contain ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'', Panadol, for example) should also be avoided.'""Dietary restrictions include limiting salt to prevent further ascites fluid accumulation. Protein may also be restricted, since increased protein load can overwhelm the liver's ability to synthesize it and may lead to ""'hepatic encephalopathy''.''Medications such as ''beta-blockers'' and ''nitroglycerin'' may be appropriate to decrease pressure within the portal system. ''Lactulose'' may be prescribed as a treatment for hepatic ''encephalopathy''.''Endoscopy may be required to band or tie off varices in the esophagus to prevent catastrophic and life-threatening bleeding.''A TIPS procedure (''transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt'') may be an option to decrease the pressure within the portal system. An interventional radiologist attempts to place a tube that connects the portal vein with the hepatic vein. This may decrease the pressure within the liver and may also reduce pressure within the veins of the stomach and esophagus, hopefully decreasing the risk of bleeding.''If portal hypertension and liver dysfunction become bad enough, liver transplantation may be necessary.'  "
What are the complications of portal hypertension?,"'The complications of portal hypertension are the complications of liver failure. These include gastrointestinal bleeding from varices, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Splenomegaly can also cause ''anemia'', low white blood cell counts, and low platelet counts.' "
Can portal hypertension be prevented?,"'Some liver diseases due to inborn errors of metabolism like copper and iron cannot be prevented. The same can be said with congenital anatomy problems. However, when liver disease is due to alcohol and ''drug abuse'', ''prevention'' is a real possibility. Chronic ''alcoholism'' can lead to ''cirrhosis'' and portal hypertension. IV ''drug abuse'' can be the cause of ''hepatitis B'' and C, resulting in cirrhosis.' "
What is the prognosis for portal hypertension?,"'Portal hypertension is a complication of an underlying liver disease. It is a disease that can be controlled but requires patients to be compliant with dietary restrictions and to abstain from alcohol and ''drugs''. Survival rates can be quite high as long as some liver function is maintained. The worse the liver function, the worse the prognosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease?,"'The only way to diagnose hypertension is to have it measured repeatedly over several times of the day and several days. This is because hypertension does not give rise to any symptoms. Rarely, it can cause ''headaches''.''You can have your blood pressure measured at a doctor’s office, or you can keep a digital blood pressure monitor to check by yourself at home.\xa0''Early chronic kidney disease (CKD) also may not have symptoms. As the disease progresses, the following signs and symptoms develop:' Edema (swelling) over the ankle, feet, or legs Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Drowsiness Fatigue Disturbed sleep Headaches Trouble concentrating Frequent urination or decreased urination Nocturia (frequent trips to the washroom at night) Hematuria (blood in the urine) Itching all over the body Dry skin or darkened skin Weight loss Muscle cramps Shortness of breath"
How is hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease diagnosed?,"'Anyone who has ''high blood pressure'' is more likely to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the absence of treatment.''Your doctor will take your complete medical history and perform a physical examination. If you have uncontrolled hypertension (and some symptoms that point toward a kidney problem), they may order the following tests to diagnose if you have hypertension-induced CKD:''Your doctor would also like to know if you have ''diabetes'' or ''heart'' problems. Hence, they may ask for tests such as:' Kidney function tests: This test will look at your creatinine levels to check if you have trouble with your kidneys. Blood tests: Low hemoglobin levels are found in CKD. Urine test: This will be done particularly to check for the presence of protein. Proteinuria (persistent protein) in the urine is a sign of kidney damage. Other things that the doctor will look for include red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR): It is a measure to estimate the level of kidney function. It is calculated by a lab specialist based on a combination of several factors that include your creatinine levels, age, weight, height, etc. GFR test is usually done after the above tests show abnormalities. Doctors usually confirm kidney damage on encountering low levels of GFR. Ultrasonography (USG) of the pelvis: The doctor may order this imaging test to know if there are any structural problems in the kidneys. Blood sugar test Urine sugar test Electrocardiography (ECG)"
What is the treatment for hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease?,"'There is no cure for hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment can just help to control the signs and symptoms. Your doctor may refer you to a kidney-specialist (nephrologist) to treat your hypertension-induced CKD. The prescribed medications will aim at''Advanced stages of CKD usually require lifetime ''dialysis'' or a ''kidney transplant'' to increase survival by a few years.''Along with the right medications, certain lifestyle changes are a must. The dietary modification depends on the stage of CKD you are at. For example, higher stages of CKD demand low intakes of protein, phosphorus, and potassium. A certified nutritionist can chalk out a ''diet'' plan that will work best for you.''Some commonly recommended lifestyle steps include:' Lowering your blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg. Halting the worsening of the kidney disease. Reducing your risks of heart disease. Exercising for at least 30 minutes a day or 150 minutes in a week Having a salt-restricted (low in sodium) diet Eating lots of fruits and vegetables (after medical advice only) Managing stress through activities such as yoga and deep breathing"
What are the complications of hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease?,'Hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) carries several risks that include:' Excessive fluid retention in many parts of the body Anemia (low blood hemoglobin levels) Hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels that can damage the heart) Cardiovascular disease (heart and blood vessel disease) Insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep) Lower sex drive Erectile dysfunction Osteomalacia (weakening of the bones) Damage to the central nervous system Weak immune system
What is a heat-related illness?,"'A heat-related illness is a medical condition that may occur as a result of heat exposure. Even short periods of high temperatures can cause serious health problems. Heat-related illness encompasses a spectrum of conditions that range from minor illnesses to life-threatening medical emergencies. There are several heat-related illnesses, including heat ''stroke'', heat exhaustion, heat ''cramps'', heat syncope (fainting), and ''heat rash''.''Summer can bring heat waves with unusually high temperatures that can last for days and sometimes weeks.' 

Read Doctor's View
   According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 7,415 death due to heat-related illness in the United States from 1999 to 2010, or an average of approximately 618 death per year. Heat waves lead to more deaths annually in the United States than tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes combined. In the summer of 1980, a severe heat wave hit the United States, and approximately 1,700 people lost their lives from heat-related illness; and in the summer of 2003, tens of thousands of people died in Europe from an extreme heat wave. The summer of 2012 heat wave in the United States led to many heat-related deaths, and numerous all-time high temperature records were broken throughout the United States. Most recently, a summer heat wave in Pakistan in 2015 led to more than 1,000 fatalities. High temperatures put people at risk."
What causes a heat-related illness?,"""People suffer heat-related illness when the body's normal temperature control system is unable to effectively regulate its internal temperature. Normally, at high temperatures the body primarily cools itself through the evaporation of sweat. However, under certain conditions (air temperatures above 95 F/35 C high humidity), this cooling mechanism becomes less effective. When the humidity is high, sweat will not evaporate as quickly, preventing the body from releasing heat quickly. Furthermore, without adequate fluid intake, excessive fluid losses and ""'electrolyte'' imbalances may also occur leading to ''dehydration'"". In such cases, a person's body temperature rises rapidly. Very high body temperatures can damage the brain and other vital organs.""'Other conditions that can limit the ability to regulate body temperature include old age, ''obesity'', ''fever'', ''dehydration'', ''heart disease'', poor circulation, ''sunburn'', and drug or ''alcohol'' use.'  "
Who is at risk of heat-related illness?,"'Those at greatest risk of heat-related illness include:''Infants and children up to four years of age are very sensitive to the effects of high temperatures and rely on others to regulate their environment and to provide adequate fluid intake. Moreover, they have a higher metabolic rate and inefficient ''sweating'' compared to adults.''People 65 years of age or older may not compensate for heat ''stress'' efficiently, and are less likely to sense and respond to changes in temperature. The elderly population also is at a higher risk because they usually have other pre-existing medical conditions, and they often take medications that can make them more vulnerable to dehydration (for example, diuretics).''Overweight individuals may be prone to heat-related illness because of their tendency to retain more body heat.'""Any health condition that causes dehydration makes the body more susceptible to heat-related illness. If you or someone you know is at higher risk, it is important to drink plenty of fluids, avoid overexertion, and get your doctor or pharmacist's advice about medications being taken for:"" infants and children up to four years of age, people 65 years of age or older, people who are overweight, people who overexert during outdoor work or exercise, people with mental illness, and people who are chronically ill or on certain medications. High blood pressure Mental illness Poor circulation"
What are the symptoms of heat-related illness?,"'Signs and symptoms of heat-related illness vary based on the severity of the illness.'  Heat rash symptoms: red bumps on the skin, a feeling of prickly or itchy skin. Heat syncope (fainting) symptoms: dizziness or lightheadedness and fainting, generally due to prolonged exposure to heat, dehydration, or orthostatic hypotension. Heat cramps symptoms: significant sweating, involuntary spasms of the muscles in the body, most often affecting the legs. Heat exhaustion symptoms: nausea and vomiting, headache, muscle cramps, weakness, and profuse sweating. Heat stroke symptoms: dizziness, muscle cramps and aches, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, headache, weakness, confusion and coma. Heat stroke is a medical emergency."
Heat stroke,"'Heat ''stroke'"" is a medical emergency requiring immediate medical attention. It is the most severe form of heat-related illness, and it can sometimes lead to death or permanent disability. Heat stroke occurs when the body's ability to regulate its internal temperature has failed. The body's temperature rises rapidly in excess of 104 F (40. C), leading to damage to the brain and other vital organs. Generally, the extent of injury depends on the duration of exposure to excessive heat and the peak temperature attained. Heat stroke is sometimes referred to as sunstroke.""'Heat stroke can be categorized as either ''exertional heat stroke (EHS)'' or ''nonexertional heat stroke (NEHS)''. Exertional heat stroke generally occurs in young, healthy individuals who engage in strenuous activity in hot weather. Nonexertional heat stroke (also referred to as classic heat stroke) typically occurs in the elderly, the very young, or the chronically ill.''Warning signs of heat stroke vary but may include:''If you see any of these signs, you may be dealing with a life-threatening emergency. ''Have someone call for immediate medical assistance while you begin cooling the affected individual: '""If the affected individual's muscles begin to twitch uncontrollably (""'seizure'') as a result of heat stroke; keep the individual from injuring themselves, and do not place any object in the mouth and do not give fluids. If there is vomiting, make sure the ''airway'' remains clear by turning the person on their side to prevent choking.' high body temperature (above 104 F or 40 C), skin that is red, hot, and either moist or dry (sweating may have stopped), rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, headache, dizziness, loss of coordination, nausea and vomiting, confusion and restlessness, seizures, and unconsciousness/coma. Get the person to a cool indoor or outdoor area and remove restrictive clothing. Cool the person rapidly using whatever methods you can. For example, if possible, immerse the person in a tub of cool water or place them in a cool shower. You may also spray them with lukewarm water and blow cool air from a fan towards them. If the humidity is low, loosely wrap the person's body in a cool, wet sheet and fan him or her vigorously. Alternatively, place ice or cold packs to the armpits, neck, and groin areas. Monitor body temperature, and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to about 102 F or lower (38.8 C), in order to prevent overcooling the affected individual. If emergency medical personnel are delayed, call the hospital emergency room for further instructions. If the affected individual is awake and alert, give them cool fluids to drink. Do not give them alcohol to drink."
Heat cramps,"""Heat cramps usually affect people who sweat significantly during strenuous activity. This sweating depletes the body's salt and moisture. The low salt level in the muscles causes painful muscle cramps, often following ""'exercise''. Heat cramps may also be a symptom of heat exhaustion.''What are the signs and symptoms of heat cramps? ''Heat cramps are muscle pains or ''muscle spasms'' (usually in the abdomen, arms, or legs) that may occur in association with strenuous activity. If the affected person has heart problems or are on a low sodium ''diet'', seek medical attention for heat cramps.' Stop all activity, and sit and rest in a cool place. Drink water or a sports beverage, and eat a salty snack. Passively stretch the affected muscles. Do not return to strenuous activity for a few hours after the cramps have subsided as further exertion can lead to heat exhaustion or rarely, heat stroke. Seek medical attention for heat cramps if they do not subside in 1 hour."
Heat exhaustion,"""Heat exhaustion is the body's response to an excessive ""'loss of water'' and salt contained in sweat as a result of engaging in physical activity (work or exercising) in a hot environment. The body temperature may be normal or mildly elevated, but not above 104 F (40 C). It often occurs in individuals who are not accustomed to working or exercising in the heat. The symptoms may range from minor complaints to more pronounced symptoms, however the affected individual will not experience the central nervous system manifestations noted with heat stroke. Many cases of heat exhaustion can be treated outside of the hospital setting however it is important to understand that heat exhaustion can progress to heat stroke if not properly addressed in a timely fashion.''Warning signs of heat exhaustion include:'""The skin may be cool and moist. The affected individual's pulse rate may be fast, and breathing may be fast and shallow. If heat exhaustion is untreated and heat exposure continues, it may sometimes progress to heat stroke.""'Cooling measures that may be effective include:''Seek medical attention immediately if: ''Otherwise, help the person cool off, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or last longer than one hour.'  a normal or mildly elevated body temperature, heavy sweating, pallor (paleness), muscle cramps and muscle pain, fatigue, weakness, dizziness and lightheadedness, headache, and nausea. drink cool, non-alcoholic beverages, such as water and sports drinks, eat salty snacks, rest in the shade or in an air-conditioned environment, take a cool shower or bath, and loosen or remove restrictive clothing. the symptoms are severe or worsening, or the affected individual has serious underlying health problems (for example, heart disease or diabetes)."
Heat syncope (fainting),"'Heat syncope is a fainting episode that occurs in the heat, either during prolonged standing or exercise, or when rapidly standing from a lying or sitting position. It typically occurs in individuals who are not acclimatized to the heat. Dehydration can also contribute to this condition.' dizziness or lightheadedness, and fainting. Sit and rest in a cool place. The affected individual may also lie down and elevate the legs above the level of the heart. Drink water or a sports beverage. Seek immediate medical attention for repeated episodes of fainting, or if the individual experiences chest pain, seizures, or confusion."
Heat rash,"'Heat ''rash'' is a skin irritation that occurs in hot, humid weather. It is caused by profuse sweating, which can lead to the blockage of sweat ducts. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children.''Heat rash appears as a cluster of small red ''pimples'' or ''blisters''. This skin irritation can be ''itchy''. It typically occurs on the neck and upper chest, in the groin, under the breasts, and in the elbow creases.''The best treatment for heat rash is to avoid a hot, humid environment and to try to remain in cooler, less humid conditions. Try to keep the affected area dry, and wear light, loose clothing. Dusting powder may be used to increase comfort, but avoid using ointments or creams because they keep the skin warm and moist and may make the condition worse.''Treating heat rash is simple and usually does not require medical assistance.' "
Heat-related illness prevention,"'To protect your health when temperatures are extremely high, remember to keep cool and use common sense. The following tips are important.''Increase your fluid intake regardless of your activity level. Do not wait until you feel thirsty. During heavy exercise in a hot environment, drink 2-4 glasses (16-32 ounces) of cool fluids each hour.''Caution:'' If your doctor has prescribed a fluid-restricted ''diet'' or diuretics for you, ask your doctor how much you should drink.''Heavy sweating removes salt and ''minerals'' from the body. These are necessary for your body and must be replaced. The easiest and safest way to replace salt and minerals is through your diet.''These self-help measures are not a substitute for medical care but may help you recognize and respond promptly to warning signs of trouble. Your best defense against heat-related illness is prevention. Staying cool and making simple changes in your fluid intake, activities, and clothing during hot weather can help you remain safe and healthy.' During hot weather, you will need to drink more liquid than your thirst indicates. This is especially true for people 65 years of age and older who often have a decreased ability to respond to external temperature changes. Drinking plenty of liquids during exercise is especially important. However, avoid very cold beverages because they can cause stomach cramps. In addition, avoid drinks containing alcohol or caffeine, because they will actually cause you to lose more fluid. Drink a sports beverage during exercise or work in the heat. Do not take salt tablets unless directed by your doctor. If you are on a low-salt diet, ask your doctor before changing what you eat or drink, especially before drinking sports beverages. Wear as little clothing as possible when you are at home. Choose lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing. In the hot sun, a wide-brimmed hat will provide shade and keep the head cool. Sunburn affects the body's ability to cool itself and causes a loss of body fluids. It also causes pain and damages the skin. A variety of sunscreens are available to reduce the risk of sunburn. The protection that they offer against sunburn varies. Check the sun protection factor (SPF) number on the label of the sunscreen container. Select SPF 15 or higher to protect yourself adequately. Apply sunscreen 30 minutes before going outdoors and reapply according to package directions. If you are unaccustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment, start slowly and pick up the pace gradually. If exertion in the heat makes your heart pound and leaves you gasping for breath, STOP all activity. You should get into a cool area or in the shade, and rest, especially if you become lightheaded, weak, or faint. The most efficient way to beat the heat is to stay in a cool or air-conditioned area. If you do not have an air conditioner or evaporative cooling unit, consider a visit to a shopping mall, see a movie in a movie theater, or visit a public library for a few hours. Contact your local health department to see if there are any heat-relief shelters in your area. Electric fans may be useful to increase comfort and to draw cool air into your home at night, but do not rely on a fan as your primary cooling device during a heat wave. When the temperature is in the 90s or higher, a fan will not prevent heat-related illness. A cool shower or bath is a more effective way to cool off. Also, use your stove and oven less to maintain a cooler temperature in your home. If you must be out in the heat, try to plan your activities so that you are outdoors either before noon or in the evening. While outdoors, rest frequently in a shady area. Resting periodically will give your body's thermostat a chance to recover. When working in the heat, monitor the condition of your coworkers and have someone do the same for you. Heat-related illness can cause a person to become confused or lose consciousness. During a heat wave, have a friend or relative call to check in on you twice a day if you are 65 years of age or older. If you know anyone in this age group, check on them at least twice a day. Be aware that any sudden change in temperature, such as an early summer heat wave, will be stressful to your body. You will have a greater tolerance for the heat if you limit your physical activity until you become accustomed to the heat. If traveling to a hotter climate, allow several days to become acclimated before attempting any vigorous exercise, and work up to it gradually. Avoid hot foods and heavy meals as they may add heat to your body. Do not ever leave infants, children, or pets in a parked car. Dress infants and young children in cool, loose clothing and shade their heads and faces with hats or an umbrella. Make sure they use sunscreen when outdoors. Limit sun exposure during the mid-day hours and in places of potential heavy sun exposure, such as beaches. Ensure that infants and children drink adequate amounts of liquids. Make sure to keep your pet cool by giving them plenty of fresh water, and leave the water in a shady area."
What is malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to particular drugs that are often used during surgery and other invasive procedures. Specifically, this reaction occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of ''pain'', and with a muscle relaxant that is used to temporarily paralyze a person during a surgical procedure. If given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high ''fever'', increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. Without prompt treatment, the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening. ''People at increased risk for this disorder are said to have malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Affected individuals may never know they have the condition unless they undergo testing or have a severe reaction to anesthesia during a surgical procedure. While this condition often occurs in people without other serious medical problems, certain inherited muscle diseases (including  central core disease and multiminicore disease) are associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. ' "
How common is malignant hyperthermia?,"'Malignant hyperthermia occurs in 1 in 5,000 to 50,000 instances in which people are given anesthetic gases. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is probably more frequent, because many people with an increased risk of this condition are never exposed to drugs that trigger a reaction. ' "
What genes are related to malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Variations of the ''CACNA1S'' and ''RYR1'' genes increase the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia. ''Researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. Mutations in the ''RYR1'' gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as MHS1. These mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Another form of the condition, ''MHS5'', results from mutations in the ''CACNA1S'' gene. These mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. ''The ''RYR1'' and ''CACNA1S'' genes provide instructions for making proteins that play essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. The proteins produced from the ''RYR1'' and ''CACNA1S'' genes are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. In response to certain signals, the ''CACNA1S'' protein helps activate the RYR1 channel, which releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. The resulting increase in calcium ion ''concentration'' inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to contract. ''Mutations in the ''RYR1'' or ''CACNA1S'' gene cause the ''RYR1'' channel to open more easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. As a result, large amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. An overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant hyperthermia. An increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis). ''The genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (MHS2, MHS4, and MHS6) are still under study. A form of the condition known as MHS3 has been linked to the ''CACNA2D1'' gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in activating the RYR1 channel to release calcium ions into muscle cells. Although this gene is thought to be related to malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been identified. ' "
How do people inherit malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery. In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who is also at risk for the condition. ' "

What is hyperthyroidism?,"'Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which an overactive thyroid gland is producing an excessive amount of thyroid hormones that circulate in the blood. (""Hyper"" means ""over"" in Greek). Thyroid hormones include thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). T3 is actually the most active thyroid hormone. Much of the T4 is converted to T3 in the bloodstream.''The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck. The thyroid gland itself is regulated by the pituitary gland in the brain, and the pituitary gland is regulated by the hypothalamus, another gland in the brain.''Thyrotoxicosis is a toxic condition that is caused by an excess of thyroid hormones from any cause. Thyrotoxicosis can be caused by an excessive intake of thyroid hormone or by overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.' "
What are hyperthyroidism symptoms and signs?,"'Hyperthyroidism is suggested by several signs and symptoms; however, people with mild disease usually experience no symptoms. People 70 years of age and older may not have any symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism. In general, the symptoms become more obvious as the degree of hyperthyroidism increases. The symptoms usually are related to an increase in the metabolic rate of the body.''Common symptoms include:''In older people, irregular heart rhythms and ''heart failure'' can occur. In its most severe form, untreated hyperthyroidism may result in ""''thyroid storm'',"" a condition involving ''high blood pressure'', ''fever'', and heart failure. Mental changes, such as ''confusion'' and ''delirium'', also may result.'   Excessive sweating Heat intolerance Increased bowel movements Tremor (usually fine shaking) Nervousness, agitation, anxiety Rapid heart rate, palpitations, irregular heart rate Weight loss Fatigue, weakness Decreased concentration Irregular and scant periods (menstruation) Fine or brittle hair Rapid heartbeat Thinning and/or smooth velvety skin Sleep disturbances"
What is the difference between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidsm?,"'Hyperthyroidism refers to an increased production of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland, while ''hypothyroidism'' refers to a condition in which a person has too little thyroid hormone or underproduction of thyroid hormones.' "
What causes hyperthyroidism?,'Some common causes of hyperthyroidism include:'   Graves' Disease Functioning adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG) Excessive intake of thyroid hormones Abnormal secretion of TSH Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid gland) Excessive iodine intake
Graves' disease,"""Graves' disease"""", which is caused by a generalized overactivity of the thyroid gland, and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid gland usually has lost the ability to respond to the normal control by the pituitary gland via TSH (renegade). Graves' disease is hereditary and is up to five times more common among women than men.""""Graves' disease is thought to be an autoimmune disease, and antibodies that are characteristic of the illness may be found in the blood. These antibodies include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI antibodies), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO), and ""'TSH receptor'' antibodies.'""Signs and symptoms of Graves’ disease include those of hyperthyroidism; however, Graves’ disease may be associated with eye disease (Graves' opthalmopathy) and skin lesions (dermopathy). Opthalmopathy can occur before, after, or at the same time as the hyperthyroidism. Early on, it may cause ""'sensitivity to light'' and a feeling of ""sand in the eyes."" The eyes may be reddened and produce excess tears. Swelling behind the eyeballs causes the eyes to protrude, and ''double vision'' can occur. The degree of opthalmopathy is worsened in those who smoke.''In addition to the symptoms of hyperthyroidism mentioned above, Graves\' disease may be associated with eye disease (Graves\' opthalmopathy) and skin lesions (dermopathy). Opthalmopathy can occur before, after, or at the same time as the hyperthyroidism. Early on, it may cause sensitivity to light and a feeling of ""sand in the eyes."" The eyes may be reddened and produce excess tears. Swelling behind the eyeballs causes the eyes to protrude, and ''double vision'' can occur. The degree of opthalmopathy is worsened in those who smoke.''The course of the eye disease is often independent of the ''thyroid disease'', and steroid medications may be necessary to control the inflammation that causes the opthalmopathy. In addition, surgical intervention may be required. The skin condition (dermopathy) is rare and causes a painless, red, lumpy skin ''rash'' on the front of the legs.'""The triggers for Graves' disease include:""""Graves' disease can be diagnosed by a standard, nuclear medicine ""'thyroid scan'', which shows diffusely increased uptake of a radioactively labeled iodine. In addition, a blood test may reveal elevated TSI levels.' stress, smoking, radiation to the neck, medications, and infectious organisms such as viruses."
Thyroiditis (thyroid gland inflammation),"'Inflammation of the thyroid gland may occur after a viral illness (subacute thyroiditis). This condition is associated with signs and symptoms of ''fever'' and ''sore throat'' , often with painful swallowing. The thyroid gland is also tender to touch. There may be generalized neck aches and pains. Inflammation of the gland with an accumulation of white blood cells known as lymphocytes (lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also occur. In both of these conditions, the inflammation leaves the thyroid gland ""leaky,"" so that the amount of thyroid hormone entering the blood is increased. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is most common after a ''pregnancy'' and can actually occur in up to 8% of women after delivery. In these cases, the hyperthyroid phase can last from 4 to 12 weeks and is often followed by a hypothyroid (low thyroid output) phase that can last for up to 6 months. The majority of affected women return to a state of normal thyroid function. Thyroiditis can be diagnosed by a thyroid scan.' "
Other causes of hyperthyroidism,"'As we age, lumps or nodules may form in the thyroid gland. Usually, these lumps do not produce thyroid hormones and require no treatment. Occasionally, a nodule may become ""autonomous,"" which means that it does not respond to pituitary regulation and produces thyroid hormones independently. This becomes more likely if the nodule is larger than 3 cm. When there is a single nodule that is independently producing thyroid hormones, it is called a functioning nodule. If there is more than one functioning nodule, the term toxic, multinodular goiter is used. Functioning nodules may be readily detected with a thyroid scan.''Taking too much thyroid hormone medication is actually quite common. Excessive doses of thyroid hormones frequently go undetected due to the lack of follow-up of patients taking their thyroid medicine. Other persons may be abusing the drug in an attempt to achieve other goals such as ''weight loss''.''A ''tumor'' in the pituitary gland may produce an abnormally high secretion of TSH (the thyroid stimulating hormone produced by the pituitary gland). This leads to excessive signaling to the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. This condition is very rare and can be associated with other abnormalities of the pituitary gland. To identify this disorder, an endocrinologist performs elaborate tests to assess the release of TSH.''The thyroid gland uses iodine to make thyroid hormones. An excess of iodine may cause hyperthyroidism. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is usually seen in patients who already have an underlying abnormal thyroid gland. Certain medications, such as ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), which is used in the treatment of heart problems, contain a large amount of iodine and may be associated with thyroid function abnormalities.' "
What tests are used for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism?,"'A blood test can confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Usually, in hyperthyroidism or overactive thyroid, blood levels of thyroid hormones are elevated. However, there is one exception. If the excessive amount of thyroid hormone is due to a TSH-secreting ''pituitary tumor'', then the levels of TSH will be abnormally high. This uncommon disease is known as ""secondary hyperthyroidism.""'""Although the blood tests mentioned previously can confirm the presence of excessive thyroid hormone, they do not point to a specific cause. A combination of antibody screening (for Graves' disease) and a thyroid scan using radioactively labeled iodine (which concentrates in the thyroid gland) can help diagnose the underlying thyroid disease. Graves' disease is almost certain if there are obvious signs and symptoms that affect the eyes. Tests for hyperthyroidism are based on an individual basis."" "
Medications for hyperthyroidism treatment,"'The options for treating hyperthyroidism include, treating the symptoms of the condition with medications, antithyroid ''drugs'', radioactive iodine, and surgery.''Medications that immediately treat ''hyperthyroidism symptoms'' caused by excessive thyroid hormones, such as a rapid heart rate, include ''beta-blockers'', for example, ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), and ''metoprolol'' (''Lopressor''). These medications counteract the effect of thyroid hormone to increase metabolism, but they do not alter the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. A doctor determines which patients to treat based on a number of variables including the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism, the age of the patient, the size of the thyroid gland, and the presence of coexisting medical illnesses.'  "
Antithyroid drugs,"'There are two main antithyroid drugs available for use in the United States to treat hyperthyroidism, ''methimazole'' (''Tapazole'') and ''propylthiouracil'' (PTU). The major risk of these medications is occasional suppression of production of white blood cells by the bone marrow (agranulocytosis). (White cells are needed to fight infection.) It is impossible to tell if or when this side effect is going to occur, so regular determination of white blood cells in the blood are not useful.''Rarely, methimazole or propylthiouracil may cause fever, ''sore throat'', or other signs of infection. If you develop these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately.'""Usually, long-term antithyroid therapy is only used for people with Graves' disease, since this disease may actually go into remission under treatment without requiring treatment with thyroid radiation or surgery. If treated from 1 to 2 years, data shows remission rates of 40%-70%. When the disease is in remission, the gland is no longer overactive, and antithyroid medication is not needed.""""Studies also have shown that adding a pill of thyroid hormone to the antithyroid medication results in higher remission rates. This type of therapy remains controversial, however. When long-term therapy is withdrawn, patients should continue to be seen by the doctor every three months for the first year, since a relapse of Graves' disease is most likely in this time. If a patient does relapse, antithyroid drug therapy can be restarted, or radioactive iodine or surgery may be considered."" "
Radioactive iodine,"'Radioactive iodine is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-time basis to ablate a hyperactive gland. The iodine given for ablative treatment is different from the iodine used in a scan. Radioactive iodine is given after a routine iodine scan, and uptake of the iodine is determined to confirm hyperthyroidism. There are no widespread side effects with this therapy.''Usually, more than 80% of patients are cured with a single dose of radioactive iodine. It takes between 8 to 12 weeks for the thyroid to become normal after therapy. Permanent hypothyroidism is the major complication of this form of treatment. While a temporary hypothyroid state may be seen up to 6 months after treatment with radioactive iodine, if it persists longer than 6 months, thyroid replacement therapy usually is begun.' "
Thyroidectomy (hyperthyroidism surgery),"'With the introduction of radioactive iodine therapy and antithyroid drugs, surgery for hyperthyroidism (''thyroidectomy'') is less common. When this therapy is necessary, it is used in:''Partial thyroidectomy (removal of a portion of the thyroid gland) was once a common treatment for hyperthyroidism. The goal is to remove the thyroid tissue that was producing the excessive thyroid hormone. However, if too much tissue is removed, an inadequate production of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) may result. In this situation, thyroid replacement therapy is started.''The major complication of thyroid surgery is disruption of the surrounding tissue, including the nerves supplying the vocal cords and the four tiny glands in the neck that regulate calcium levels in the body (the parathyroid glands). Accidental removal of these glands may result in low calcium levels (''hypercalcemia'') and require calcium replacement therapy.' Pregnant women and children who have major adverse reactions to antithyroid medications. People with very large thyroid glands and in those who have symptoms stemming from compression of tissues adjacent to the thyroid, such as difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and shortness of breath."
What should I do if I think I have hyperthyroidism?,"'If you are concerned that you may have an excess amount of thyroid hormone, you should mention your symptoms to your doctor. A simple blood test is the first step in the diagnosis. From there, both you and your doctor can decide what the next step should be. If treatment is needed, it is important for you to let your doctor know of any concerns or questions you have about the options available. Remember that thyroid disease is very common, and the diseases that cause an excess of thyroid hormones can be easily diagnosed and treated.' "
Which types of doctors treat hyperthyroidism?,"""Endocrinologists are specialists in diagnosing and treating hormonal disorders such as hyperthyroidism. Primary care physicians, including family practitioners and internists, may also be involved in treating patients with hyperthyroidism. Ophthalmologists and ophthalmic surgeons may be involved in the care of patients with Graves' disease."" "
What is an overactive bladder?,"'Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition that is characterized by sudden, involuntary contraction of the muscle in the wall of the urinary bladder. This results in a sudden, compelling need to urinate that is difficult to suppress (''urinary urgency''), even though the bladder may only contain a small amount of urine. The key symptom is sudden urge to void (urgency) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, often associated with urinary frequency (voiding 8 or more times per day) and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to void). Irritating fluids, such as ''caffeinated'' ''beverages'' (coffee, tea), spicy foods, and ''alcohol'' can worsen the symptoms. It is common for those affected to compensate for OAB by toilet mapping, fluid restriction, and timed voiding. There is no ''pain'', burning, or ''blood in the urine'' with OAB.''Overactive bladder coupled with urinary leakage (inability to suppress the urge to void) is also referred to as urgency urinary incontinence. Another common type of urinary incontinence is called ''stress'' incontinence, which is caused by ''weakness'' in the pelvic floor muscles that surround and support the bladder and urethra. The symptom of ''stress'' incontinence is leakage when ''coughing'', straining, jumping, or with other physical activity that increase the pressure in the abdomen (Valsalva). Treatment for stress incontinence is very different than urge incontinence. In some individuals, there can be a combination of urge and stress incontinence (mixed incontinence). Often, the most bothersome condition is treated first in individuals with mixed urinary incontinence. In general, urinary incontinence is more common in women compared to men.''The overall prevalence of overactive bladder is 13.9%, affecting men and women with equal frequency. Although it can happen at any age, overactive bladder is especially common in older adults. Overactive bladder should not be considered a normal part of ''aging''. The prevalence under the age of 50 is < 10%. After age 60, the prevalence increases to 20%-30%. It is estimated that 60% of patients have dry OAB (no leakage) while 40% have wet OAB.' "
What are the causes of overactive bladder?,"""Overactive bladder is typically caused by early, uncontrolled contraction (spasms) of the bladder muscle (detrusor muscle), resulting in an urge to urinate. Overactive bladder is primarily a problem of the nerves and muscles of the bladder that allow for early contraction during the normal relaxation phase of bladder filling. The bladder's contraction in response to filling with urine is one the steps in the normal process of urination. The contraction and relaxation of the detrusor muscle is regulated by the nervous system. Approximately 300 cc of urine in the bladder can signal the nervous to trigger muscles of the bladder to coordinate urination. Voluntary control of the sphincter muscles at the opening of the bladder can hold the urine in the bladder for longer. Up to 600 cc of urine can be contained in a normal adult bladder. For those with OAB, the bladder capacity is typically low (< 200cc).""'Overactive bladder typically results from inappropriate contraction of the detrusor muscle regardless of the amount of urine. The most common form of OAB is idiopathic, where the exact cause is not known. However, OAB can result from problems of the nervous system.''The common abnormalities of the nervous system that cause overactive bladder are''Other causes of ''OAB symptoms'' include ''urinary tract infection'', bladder stones, urethral strictures, benign prostatic enlargement (''BPH''), or bladder tumors.''Frequently, no apparent cause of overactive bladder can be determined (idiopathic overactive bladder).'   spinal cord injury, back problems (disc hernia, degenerative disc disease), strokes, Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and diabetic neuropathy."
Are there any risk factors for overactive bladder?,"'Some of the common risk factors for overactive bladder include the following:' Advanced age Injury to the nervous systemStrokeSpinal cord injuryDementiaParkinson's diseaseMultiple sclerosis Stroke Spinal cord injury Dementia Parkinson's disease Multiple sclerosis Diabetes mellitus Prostate enlargement Prostate surgery Multiple pregnancies Previous pelvic surgery Previous radiotherapy of the pelvis Postmenopausal women have an increased risk of OAB. Race may affect risk of developing OAB: African-American and Hispanic men and women have a higher risk of developing OAB. Obesity also appears to increase the risk of OAB. OAB is also associated with depression, anxiety, and other symptoms."
What are overactive bladder symptoms?,"'The symptoms of an overactive bladder include ''frequent urination'' (urinating eight or more times per day), urgency of urination (sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer) with or without urgency urinary incontinence, and nocturia (awakening one or more times at night to urinate). Overactive bladder may cause significant social, psychological, occupational, domestic, physical, sexual, and financial problems. Again, these symptoms should not be considered a normal part of aging.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose overactive bladder?,"'The diagnosis of overactive bladder is based on the presence of symptoms, while excluding other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. This is based on history, physical examination, and a urine test. Waking up to urinate one or more times at night, urinary frequency (urinating at least eight times daily), urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence are all important clues in evaluating someone suspected of having overactive bladder.''In addition to a general physical examination, a ''pelvic exam'' in women (to assess for dryness, atrophy, inflammation, infection, stress incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse [seeing a bulge in the vagina particularly with increasing abdominal pressure by straining]) and a prostate examination in men (to assess for size, tenderness, texture, and/or masses) are helpful in excluding other contributing conditions.''Urine analysis (UA) to assess for infection, blood cells in the urine, and high levels of glucose (''sugar'') in the urine is recommended. Occasionally, urine cytology (to look for ''cancer'' cells in the bladder) is sometimes advised in individuals undergoing evaluation of urinary incontinence and overactive bladder, particularly individuals with blood cells in the urine (''hematuria''). Bladder ''ultrasound'' measurement of the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination (called post-void residual) may also provide additional information about the cause of urinary incontinence (obstruction to urine flow or weak bladder muscle) but is not needed in all individuals with OAB symptoms.' "
What are the treatments for an overactive bladder?,"'The treatment for overactive bladder can vary with each individual. Guidelines suggest starting with less invasive therapies first. The recommended first line of therapy is behavioral, dietary, and lifestyle therapies. In some individuals, the addition of biofeedback is helpful. Biofeedback may be done in the office or by a physical therapist. In those individuals who do not respond adequately to behavioral, dietary, or lifestyle therapies, the addition of medications (pharmacologic therapy) is recommended as a second-line treatment. Third-line therapies consist of less-invasive surgical options (injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder wall) and electrical stimulation therapies, including sacral neuromodulation (Interstim) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PTNS). More extensive surgical therapies are available but are rarely needed for treatment of OAB that is not the result of a nervous system condition.''Here are commonly recommended treatments.''Dietary and Lifestyle''Behavioral'   Weight loss in obese individuals may decrease incontinence episodes. Reducing fluid intake to a recommended daily amount may be helpful in decreasing OAB symptoms. Decreasing/eliminating caffeine intake may be helpful in some individuals. Kegel exercises: Regular, daily exercising of pelvic muscles can improve, and even prevent, urinary incontinence. This is particularly helpful for younger women. These exercises should be performed 30-80 times daily for at least eight weeks. These exercises are thought to strengthen the muscles of the pelvis and urethra, which can support the opening to the bladder to prevent incontinence. Their success depends on practicing the proper technique and the recommended frequency. These exercises may be helpful for women with both stress and urgency urinary incontinence. Biofeedback: Used in conjunction with Kegel exercises, biofeedback helps people gain awareness and control of their pelvic muscles. Biofeedback is often performed by a physical therapist but may also be performed in the office of a urologist or urogynecologist. Biofeedback can help identify the pelvic floor muscles to ensure proper contractions of these muscles. Vaginal weight training: Small weights are held within the vagina by tightening the vaginal muscles. These exercises should be performed for 15 minutes, twice daily, for four to six weeks. Pelvic-floor electrical stimulation: Mild electrical pulses stimulate muscle contractions. This should be done in conjunction with Kegel exercises. Bladder training teaches people to resist the urge to void by conscious suppression of the need to urinate as well as using pelvic floor muscle contractions to suppress the urge to void and gradually expand the intervals between voiding. Toileting assistance uses routine or scheduled toileting, habit-training schedules, and prompted voiding to empty the bladder regularly to prevent leaking."
What is the role of medications in treating overactive bladder?,"'There are several medications recommended for the treatment of overactive bladder. Using these medications in conjunction with behavioral therapies has shown to increase the success rate for the treatment of overactive bladder.''The main goals of OAB treatment are to''Typically, the medications for overactive bladder start to work within one to two weeks, and optimal relief of OAB symptoms is usually achieved by six weeks. The most common medications (anticholinergics), bladder relaxants, target to decrease the overactivity of the detrusor muscle. Anticholinergics should be used under the direction of the physician prescribing them. They may have some common side effects, including ''dry mouth'', ''constipation'', facial flushing, blurry vision, and ''confusion'' (in the elderly). There are multiple anticholinergic therapies approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. They all are similar in their ability to treat the ''symptoms of overactive bladder'' but differ in the frequency and type of side effects as well as method of use. Some are once daily, some are topical treatments applied to the skin, and some come in different doses, allowing one to increase the dose if needed. Lastly, several of these medications are now available in generic forms.''Contraindications: The use of anticholinergics in individuals with narrow-angle ''glaucoma'' is not recommended without approval from an eye specialist. The side effects of anticholinergic medications for OAB may be increased with the use of other medications, thus it is important to always review current medications with the prescribing physician prior to starting an anticholinergic.''Injection of botulinum toxin into the bladder is considered a third-line therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder and is used in individuals who have tried and failed and/or cannot tolerate the side effects of medical therapy and/or has contraindications to the use of medications to treat overactive bladder.''Another third-line therapy is neuromodulation.''Neuromodulation is a newer method of treating overactive bladder with electrical stimulation that results in reorganization of the spinal reflexes involved in bladder control. There are two types of neuromodulation available: percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and sacral neuromodulation (Interstim). PTNS is performed in the office and is usually performed once a week for 12 weeks with periodic therapies thereafter to maintain a response. It involves placing a small needle into the area near the ankle and administering electrical stimulation. Sacral neuromodulation is usually performed in two stages. The first stage involves the placement of wires (leads) into areas in the ''sacrum'' and then using a small generator to test the response to stimulation. If there is a 50% or more improvement in symptoms the wires (leads) are internalized and an internal generator is placed, typically under the skin near the buttocks.''Surgery is rarely necessary in treating overactive bladder unless symptoms are debilitating and unresponsive to other treatments. Reconstructive bladder surgery (cystoplasty) is the most common surgical procedure. This surgery involves enlarging the size of the bladder by using part of the intestine.' reduce urinary urgency and frequency, increase voided volume (bladder capacity), and decrease urge incontinence (reduce leakage episodes). Oxybutynin (Ditropan) prevents urge incontinence by relaxing the detrusor muscle. This is typically taken two to three times a day (Ditropan XL is extended release, taken once a day). This medication was the first-generation therapy available, and its main side effects include dry mouth (60%) and constipation. Ditropan patch (Oxytrol) is also available with fewer side effects, but it releases a smaller dose than the oral form. The patch is placed on the skin once to twice weekly, and it may cause some local skin irritation. Tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA) is indicated for the treatment of an overactive bladder with symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, or urge incontinence. This medication affects the salivary glands less than oxybutynin, thus, it is better tolerated with fewer side effects (dry mouth). Detrol is usually prescribed twice a day, whereas the long-acting type (Detrol LA) is taken only once a day. Trospium chloride (Sanctura) is available in both a once a day and twice a day therapy. Trospium is less likely to get into the brain and is broken down differently than other medications, which may be beneficial in some individuals. Solifenacin (Vesicare) is a relatively newer medication in this group. It is generally similar to tolterodine, but it has a longer half-life and needs to be taken once a day. Darifenacin (Enablex) is also a newer anticholinergic medicine for treating overactive bladder with fewer side effects, such as confusion. Therefore, it may be more helpful in the elderly with underlying dementia. This medication is also typically taken once a day. Fesoterodine fumarate (Toviaz) is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. The medication is taken once daily. Common side effects include constipation and dry mouth. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq) is a new type of medication, a beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, to treat overactive bladder that is not an anticholinergic and can be used alone or more recently is being tested in combination with anticholinergic medications. Unlike anticholinergic medications that work to prevent the bladder muscle from contracting, the beta-3 adrenoceptor agonists work on the bladder to help it to relax. As these medications have a very different mechanism of action, they have different side effects. The side effects include increased blood pressure, incomplete bladder emptying, sinus irritation, constipation, and dry mouth (< 2%-3%). Currently, mirabegron is the only drug of this type that is FDA approved, however, other similar agents are being studied.It is recommended that blood pressure checks be performed when starting mirabegron. It is recommended that blood pressure checks be performed when starting mirabegron. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) is a toxin that is injected directly into the bladder muscle with a cystoscope and may be repeated every four to six months. The effects of the toxin are to prevent the release of chemicals from the nerves that supply the bladder, preventing stimulation of the bladder muscle. As the chemical cannot spread very far when injected, to treat the bladder adequately, multiple injections of a small amount of the toxin are necessary for the treatment to be effective. In most individuals, this can be done in the office. The treatment does not cause permanent changes and thus will require periodic retreatments for the effect to be continued. Serious side effects are unusual but may include difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty talking, muscle weakness, and more commonly, urinary tract infection and urinary retention. Individuals undergoing injection of Botox into the bladder muscle must be willing to perform clean, intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder. The effect of Botox is not permanent, thus repeat injections are needed to maintain the improvement, typically once every six to 16 months. Estrogen, either oral or vaginal, may be helpful in conjunction with other treatments for postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence."
Are there alternative therapies for OAB?,"'There is limited information on the effects of ''acupuncture'' on OAB symptoms. However, small studies have demonstrated improvements in OAB symptoms.''Select herbal therapies have also demonstrated improvement in OAB symptoms in small studies.' "
What are treatments for the chronically incontinent?,"'Although many people will improve their continence through medications, pelvic-muscle exercises, and bladder training, some will never achieve complete dryness. Sometimes treatment failures are due to concurrent use of other necessary medications, such as diuretics (water pills that increase urination), that actually can cause incontinence. Others may have dementia or other physical impairments that keep them from being able to perform pelvic-muscle exercises or retrain their bladders. Many will be cared for in long-term care facilities or at home. The following recommendations can help keep the chronically ''incontinent'' drier and reduce their cost of care:'   Scheduled toileting (timed voiding): Take people to the toilet every two to four hours or according to their toilet habits. Prompted voiding: Check for dryness and encourage use of the toilet. Improved access to toilets: Use equipment such as canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and devices that raise the seating level of toilets to make toileting easier. Managing fluids and diet: Behavioral modifications can directly impact symptoms of OAB. These include eliminating dietary caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods (for those with urge incontinence) and encourage adequate fiber in the diet. Disposable absorbent garments: Use these to keep people dry. Avoid indwelling catheters as much as possible, as these are associated with a risk of urinary tract infection, stones, and urethral and bladder irritation."
What measures can be taken at home to prevent overactive bladder symptoms?,"'The exact cause of overactive bladder syndrome is not known, thus preventative strategies are not established. However, the following options can avoid exacerbating symptoms in some individuals.''Caffeine may exacerbate urinary urgency, and it is potentially an irritant to the bladder. Eliminating caffeine intake can diminish some of the symptoms of overactive bladder.''Some experts suggest that avoidance of certain foods, such as ''chocolate'', spicy foods, alcohol, carbonated beverages, and nuts, can be beneficial in preventing symptoms of overactive bladder. Others encourage increasing the amount of dietary fiber for people with overactive bladder. Limiting fluid intake can also help to reduce urinary frequency.''Excess weight can put more pressure on the bladder, causing urinary incontinence. Therefore, ''weight loss'' can also help with urinary incontinence in general.' "
What are some of the complications of overactive bladder?,"'Common complications that can result from overactive bladder include' urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin irritation, skin infection, bladder stones, falls/fractures in elderly, sleep disturbances, negative impact on quality of life, and depression."
What is the prognosis for overactive bladder?,"'The overall prognosis for overactive bladder is generally good. Through a combined approach of behavioral modifications and medications, the patient can help significantly improve bladder urgency, and the quality of life of those affected by overactive bladder can substantially improve.' "
Childbirth class options introduction,"'Many women and couples desire to take part in formal classes as part of their birthing plan. While a number of class formats and emphasis is available, what they have in common is that they all prepare a mother for giving birth. Classes may cover techniques for non-drug ''pain management'' as well as information about ''labor and delivery''. ''Childbirth'' classes can also teach expectant women what to expect in the postpartum period. In addition, information regarding ''breastfeeding'' is commonly presented. ''While classes focused on birthing techniques commonly start around the seventh month of ''pregnancy'', other types of classes may start in early ''pregnancy''. Your health care professional can help you decide when and if a ''childbirth'"" class is a good option for you. Classes can be held at hospitals, community centers, health care practitioners' offices or other settings. Video or book versions of classes are also available.""'The following is a brief overview of some of the most well-known childbirth class options in the United States.' "
What is the Lamaze technique?,"'The Lamaze technique is one of the best known methods, and one of the most commonly used childbirth class method in the United States. Lamaze classes are designed to inform women about their options for support during the birth process. The Lamaze program does not encourage or discourage the use of medications and medical interventions during the birth process. Women are presented with information and options to make the decision that is best for her.''Some of the topics covered in Lamaze technique classes include:''Lamaze classes are generally taught in small groups of up to 12 couples. Typically, there is at least 12 hours of instruction time.' The progress of normal labor The delivery and postpartum period Pain relief techniques such as massage 
and relaxation methods Other kinds of support during labor Communication Breastfeeding Medical procedures that may be 
recommended Living a healthy lifestyle"
What is The Bradley Method?,"'The Bradley method is also known as husband-coached childbirth. It is a process that prepares a woman to give birth without the use of ''pain'"" control medications. It also prepares the woman's partner to be an effective birth coach. The method does include preparation for problems or unexpected situations like unplanned Cesarean section delivery. The course is taught over 12 sessions. Topics covered in the classes include:"" Healthy lifestyle choices  Relaxation techniques for use during 
labor ""Rehearsals"" for labor Postpartum care Breastfeeding Training for the partner in coaching 
techniques Ways to avoid a Cesarean section 
(C-section)"
What is The Alexander Technique?,"'The Alexander Technique is a strategy for improving movement, balance, coordination, and flexibility. This technique is used by many individuals--not just ''pregnant'"" women. In expectant women it may be used to increase the mother's comfort during pregnancy, increase the effectiveness of pushing, lessen any discomfort associated with ""'nursing'', and assist the overall recovery from childbirth. Some ''pregnant'' women choose to take weekly lessons in the technique throughout their pregnancy.' "
What is HypnoBirthing?,'HypnoBirthing is a method that is based on self-hypnosis techniques to achieve a healthy and natural birth process. It is sometimes referred to as the Morgan method. Pre-birth ''parenting'' and the consciousness of the unborn baby are among the topics covered in the training sessions. It is commonly given in a series of 4 or 5 class sessions of 2 ½ to 3 hours each.' 
10 questions to ask when choosing a childbirth class,"'Asking the following questions may help women decide on a childbirth class. There are no right or wrong answers. Thinking about these issues may help you clarify your own interests and goals.' When and where does the class meet? How many 
sessions are offered? Is the class designed for expectant mothers 
or for couples? Is there training for the expectant woman's 
partner? Is this important to you? What is the cost of the class? Will 
insurance cover the cost? How are the teachers trained? Does the teacher have experience with this 
type of class? What is the class size? What kinds of medical interventions are 
covered in the class? Does the class promote natural birth without 
medications or does the class allow women to choose medical intervention? Does the class run throughout pregnancy or only in the later 
stages?"
What is Addison's disease?,"""Addison's disease is an endocrine or hormonal disorder that occurs in all age groups and afflicts men and women equally. The disease is characterized by ""'weight loss'', muscle weakness, ''fatigue'', ''low blood pressure'', and sometimes darkening of the skin in both exposed and nonexposed parts of the body.' "
How does Addison's disease occur?,"""Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, in some cases, the hormone aldosterone. The disease is also called adrenal insufficiency, or hypocortisolism.""  "
What is cortisol?,"""Cortisol is normally produced by the adrenal glands, located just above the kidneys. It belongs to a class of hormones called glucocorticoids, which affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. Scientists think that cortisol has possibly hundreds of effects in the body. Cortisol's most important job is to help the body respond to ""'stress''. Among its other vital tasks, cortisol:' helps maintain blood pressure and heart function helps slow the immune system's inflammation response helps balance the effects of insulin in breaking down sugar for energy helps regulate the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats helps maintain proper arousal and sense of well-being"
How is cortisol regulated?,"""Because cortisol is so vital to health, the amount of cortisol produced by the adrenals is precisely balanced. Like many other hormones, cortisol is regulated by the brain's hypothalamus and the ""'pituitary gland'', a bean-sized organ at the base of the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends ""releasing hormones"" to the pituitary gland. The pituitary responds by secreting hormones that regulate growth and thyroid and adrenal function, and sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. One of the pituitary\'s main functions is to secrete ACTH (adrenocorticotropin), a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands. When the adrenals receive the pituitary\'s signal in the form of ACTH, they respond by producing cortisol. Completing the cycle, cortisol then signals the pituitary to lower secretion of ACTH.' "
What is aldosterone?,"'Aldosterone belongs to a class of hormones called mineralocorticoids, also produced by the adrenal glands. It helps maintain blood pressure and water and salt balance in the body by helping the kidney retain sodium and excrete potassium. When aldosterone production falls too low, the kidneys are not able to regulate salt and water balance, causing blood volume and blood pressure to drop.' "
What causes Addison's disease?,'Failure to produce adequate levels of cortisol can occur for different reasons. The problem may be due to a disorder of the adrenal glands themselves (primary adrenal insufficiency) or to inadequate secretion of ACTH by the pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency).'  
Primary adrenal insufficiency,"""Addison's disease affects about 1 in 100,000 people. Most cases are caused by the gradual destruction of the adrenal cortex, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, by the body's own immune system. Up to 80 percent of reported cases of Addison's disease are caused by autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system makes antibodies that attack the body's own tissues or organs and slowly destroy them. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when at least 90 percent of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. As a result, often both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) hormones are lacking. Sometimes only the adrenal gland is affected, as in idiopathic adrenal insufficiency; sometimes other glands also are affected, as in the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome."" "
Polyendocrine deficiency syndrome,"'The polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is classified into two separate forms, referred to as type I and type II.''Type I occurs in children, and adrenal insufficiency may be accompanied by:'""Type II, often called Schmidt's syndrome, usually afflicts young adults. Features of type II may include:""'Scientists think that the polyendocrine deficiency syndrome is ''inherited'' because frequently more than one family member tends to have one or more endocrine deficiencies. ' underactive parathyroid glands  slow sexual development  pernicious anemia  chronic candida infections  chronic active hepatitis  hair loss (in very rare cases)  an underactive thyroid gland  slow sexual development  diabetes  vitiligo  loss of pigment on areas of the skin "
Tuberculosis,"'Tuberculosis'' (''TB''), an infection which can destroy the adrenal glands, accounts for about 20 percent of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency in developed countries. When adrenal insufficiency was first identified by Dr. Thomas Addison in 1849, TB was found at ''autopsy'' in 70 to 90 percent of cases. As the treatment for TB improved, however, the incidence of adrenal insufficiency due to TB of the adrenal glands has greatly decreased.' "
Other causes,"'Less common causes of primary adrenal insufficiency are: ' chronic infection, mainly fungal infections  cancer cells spreading from other parts of the body to the adrenal glands  amyloidosis  surgical removal of the adrenal glands "
Secondary adrenal insufficiency,"""This form of adrenal insufficiency is much more common than primary adrenal insufficiency and can be traced to a lack of ACTH. Without ACTH to stimulate the adrenals, the adrenal glands' production of cortisol drops, but not aldosterone. A temporary form of secondary adrenal insufficiency may occur when a person who has been receiving a glucocorticoid hormone such as ""'prednisone'' for a long time abruptly stops or interrupts taking the medication. Glucocorticoid hormones, which are often used to treat inflammatory illnesses like ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''asthma'', or ''ulcerative colitis'', block the release of both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Normally, CRH instructs the pituitary gland to release ACTH. If CRH levels drop, the pituitary is not stimulated to release ACTH, and the adrenals then fail to secrete sufficient levels of cortisol. '""Another cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency is the surgical removal of benign, or noncancerous, ACTH-producing tumors of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease). In this case, the source of ACTH is suddenly removed, and replacement hormone must be taken until normal ACTH and cortisol production resumes. ""'Less commonly, adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland either decreases in size or stops producing ACTH. These events can result from: ' tumors or infections of the area  loss of blood flow to the pituitary  radiation for the treatment of pituitary tumors  surgical removal of parts of the hypothalamus  surgical removal of the pituitary gland "
What are the signs and symptoms of Addison's disease?,"'The symptoms of adrenal insufficiency usually begin gradually. Characteristics of the disease are:''About 50 percent of the time, one will notice:''Other symptoms include:'""Addison's disease can cause irritability and ""'depression''. Because of salt loss, a craving for salty foods also is common. ''Hypoglycemia'', or ''low blood glucose'', is more severe in children than in adults. In women, menstrual periods may become irregular or stop. ''Because the symptoms progress slowly, they are usually ignored until a stressful event like an illness or an accident causes them to become worse. This is called an addisonian crisis, or acute adrenal insufficiency. In most cases, symptoms are severe enough that patients seek medical treatment before a crisis occurs. However, in about 25 percent of patients, symptoms first appear during an addisonian crisis. ''Symptoms of an addisonian crisis include: ''Left untreated, an addisonian crisis can be fatal. '   chronic, worsening fatigue  muscle weakness  loss of appetite  weight loss  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea  low blood pressure that falls further when standing, causing dizziness or fainting  skin changes in Addison's disease, with areas of hyperpigmentation, or dark tanning, covering exposed and nonexposed parts of the body; this darkening of the skin is most visible on scars; skin folds; pressure points such as the elbows, knees, knuckles, and toes; lips; and mucous membranes sudden penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs  severe vomiting and diarrhea  dehydration  low blood pressure  loss of consciousness "
How is Addison's disease diagnosed?,"""In its early stages, adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose. A review of a patient's medical history based on the symptoms, especially the dark tanning of the skin, will lead a doctor to suspect Addison's disease.""""A diagnosis of Addison's disease is made by laboratory tests. The aim of these tests is first to determine whether levels of cortisol are insufficient and then to establish the cause. X-ray exams of the adrenal and pituitary glands also are useful in helping to establish the cause.""""This is the most specific test for diagnosing Addison's disease. In this test, blood cortisol, urine cortisol, or both are measured before and after a synthetic form of ACTH is given by injection. In the so-called short, or rapid, ACTH test, measurement of cortisol in blood is repeated 30 to 60 minutes after an intravenous ACTH injection. The normal response after an injection of ACTH is a rise in blood and urine cortisol levels. Patients with either form of adrenal insufficiency respond poorly or do not respond at all.""'When the response to the short ACTH test is abnormal, a ""long"" CRH stimulation test is required to determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. In this test, synthetic CRH is injected intravenously and blood cortisol is measured before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency have high ACTHs but do not produce cortisol. Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency have deficient cortisol responses but absent or delayed ACTH responses. Absent ACTH response points to the pituitary as the cause; a delayed ACTH response points to the hypothalamus as the cause.''In patients suspected of having an addisonian crisis, the doctor must begin treatment with injections of salt, fluids, and glucocorticoid hormones immediately. Although a reliable diagnosis is not possible while the patient is being treated for the crisis, measurement of blood ACTH and cortisol during the crisis and before glucocorticoids are given is enough to make the diagnosis. Once the crisis is controlled and medication has been stopped, the doctor will delay further testing for up to 1 month to obtain an accurate diagnosis.''Once a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency has been made, x-ray exams of the abdomen may be taken to see if the adrenals have any signs of calcium deposits. Calcium deposits may indicate TB. A tuberculin skin test also may be used.''If secondary adrenal insufficiency is the cause, doctors may use different imaging tools to reveal the size and shape of the pituitary gland. The most common is the CT scan, which produces a series of x-ray pictures giving a cross-sectional image of a body part. The function of the pituitary and its ability to produce other hormones also are tested.' "
How is Addison's disease treated?,"""Treatment of Addison's disease involves replacing, or substituting, the hormones that the adrenal glands are not making. Cortisol is replaced orally with hydrocortisone tablets, a synthetic glucocorticoid, taken once or twice a day. If aldosterone is also deficient, it is replaced with oral doses of a mineralocorticoid called fludrocortisone acetate (Florinef), which is taken once a day. Patients receiving aldosterone replacement therapy are usually advised by a doctor to increase their salt intake. Because patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency normally maintain aldosterone production, they do not require aldosterone replacement therapy. The doses of each of these medications are adjusted to meet the needs of individual patients.""'During an addisonian crisis, low blood pressure, low blood glucose, and high levels of potassium can be life threatening. Standard therapy involves intravenous injections of hydrocortisone, saline (salt water), and dextrose (''sugar''). This treatment usually brings rapid improvement. When the patient can take fluids and medications by mouth, the amount of hydrocortisone is decreased until a maintenance dose is achieved. If aldosterone is deficient, maintenance therapy also includes oral doses of fludrocortisone acetate.'  "
Surgery,'Patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency who need surgery with general anesthesia are treated with injections of hydrocortisone and saline. Injections begin on the evening before surgery and continue until the patient is fully awake and able to take medication by mouth. The dosage is adjusted until the maintenance dosage given before surgery is reached.' 
Pregnancy,"'Women with primary adrenal insufficiency who become ''pregnant'' are treated with standard replacement therapy. If ''nausea'' and vomiting in early ''pregnancy'' interfere with oral medication, injections of the hormone may be necessary. During delivery, treatment is similar to that of patients needing surgery; following delivery, the dose is gradually tapered and the usual maintenance doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone acetate by mouth are reached by about 10 days after ''childbirth''.' "
Patient education,"""A person who has adrenal insufficiency should always carry identification stating his or her condition in case of an emergency. The card should alert emergency personnel about the need to inject 100 mg of cortisol if its bearer is found severely injured or unable to answer questions. The card should also include the doctor's name and telephone number and the name and telephone number of the nearest relative to be notified. When traveling, a needle, syringe, and an injectable form of cortisol should be carried for emergencies. A person with Addison's disease also should know how to increase medication during periods of ""'stress'' or mild upper respiratory infections. Immediate medical attention is needed when severe infections, vomiting, or diarrhea occur. These conditions can precipitate an addisonian crisis. A patient who is vomiting may require injections of hydrocortisone.''People with medical problems may wish to wear a descriptive warning bracelet or neck chain to alert emergency personnel. A number of companies manufacture medical identification products.' "

What is low blood sugar?,"'Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar is syndrome that results from low blood sugar. The severity and ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' can vary from person to person. Blood tests can diagnose low blood sugar, and symptoms resolve when the levels of sugar in the blood return to the normal range. The medical term for blood sugar is blood glucose.' "
What are the symptoms and signs that your blood sugar is too low?,"""The normal range of glucose in the bloodstream is from 70 to 100 mg/dL when the individual is fasting (that is not immediately after a meal). The body's biochemical response to hypoglycemia usually starts when sugars are in the high/mid 70's. At this point, the liver releases its stores and the hormones mentioned above start to activate. In many people, this process occurs without any clinical symptoms. The amount of ""'insulin'' produced also declines in an attempt to prevent a further drop in glucose.'""While there is some degree of variability among people, most will usually develop symptoms suggestive of low blood sugar when blood glucose levels are lower than 50 mg/dL. The first set of symptoms are called adrenergic (or sympathetic) because they relate to the nervous system's response to hypoglycemia. People with hypoglycemia may experience any of these symptoms and signs:""'In most people, these symptoms are easily recognizable. The vast majority of individuals with ''diabetes'' only experience this degree of hypoglycemia if they are on medications or insulin. People (with ''diabetes'' or who have ''insulin resistance'') with high circulating levels of insulin who fast or change their ''diet'' to lower their carbohydrate intake drastically should also be cautioned. These individuals may also experience modest hypoglycemia.''People being treated for diabetes who experience the condition may not experience symptoms as easily as people without diabetes. This phenomenon has been referred to as ''hypoglycemic'' unawareness. This can be dangerous as blood sugars may approach extremely low levels before any symptoms are perceived.'""Anyone who has experienced an episode of hypoglycemia describes a sense of urgency to eat and resolve the symptoms. And, that's exactly the point of these symptoms. They act as warning signs to tell the body to consume more fuel. At this level, the brain still can access circulating blood glucose for fuel. The symptoms provide a person the opportunity to raise blood glucose levels before the brain is affected.""'If a person does not or cannot respond by eating something to raise blood glucose, the levels of glucose continue to drop. With further drops in blood glucose, patients progress to neuro-glyco-penic ranges (meaning that the brain is not getting enough glucose). At this point, symptoms progress to ''confusion'', drowsiness, changes in behavior, ''coma'', and ''seizure''.'   Nervousness. Sweating. Intense hunger. Dizzy or lightheaded. Trembling. Weakness. Palpitations. Often have trouble speaking. Pale. Trouble concentrating. irritable and nervous. Changes in behavior or  personality. Seizures. Unconsciousness."
Why is low blood sugar dangerous?,"'When the circulating level of blood glucose falls, the brain actually senses the drop. The brain then sends out messages that trigger a series of events, including changes in hormone and nervous system responses that are aimed at increasing blood glucose levels. Insulin secretion decreases and hormones that promote higher blood glucose levels, such as glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, and epinephrine all increase. As mentioned previously, there is a store in the liver of glycogen that can be converted to glucose rapidly.''In addition to the biochemical processes that occur, the body starts to consciously alert the affected person that it needs food by causing the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.''The body needs fuel to work. One of its major fuel sources is sugars, which the body gets from what is consumed as either simple sugar or complex carbohydrates in the ''diet''. For emergency situations (like prolonged fasting), the body stores a stash of sugar in the liver as glycogen. If this store is needed, the body goes through a biochemical process to make new sugar (gluco-neo-genesis) and converts these stores of glycogen to sugar. This backup process emphasizes that the fuel source of sugar is important (important enough for human beings to have developed an evolutionary system of storage to avoid a sugar deficit).''Risk factors are having type 1 or 2 diabetes or in some cases, ''prediabetes''.'""Of all the organs in the body, the brain depends on sugar (glucose) almost exclusively. Rarely, if absolutely necessary, the brain will use ketones as a fuel source, but this is not preferred. The brain cannot make its own glucose and is 100% dependent on the rest of the body for its supply.

People with pre-diabetes or insulin resistance also can have low blood sugars on occasion if their high circulating insulin levels are further challenged by a prolonged period of fasting. There are other rare causes for the condition, such as insulin-producing tumors (insulinomas) and certain medications.''These uncommon causes of hypoglycemia will not be discussed in this article, which will primarily focus on the condition occurring with type 1 or 2 diabetes and its treatment.' "
What drinks and foods raise blood sugar fast?,"'The acute management of low blood sugar involves the rapid delivery of a source of easily absorbed sugar. Regular soft drinks, juice, lifesaver candies, table sugar, and the like are good options. In general, 15 grams of glucose is the dose that is given, followed by an assessment of symptoms and a blood glucose check if possible. If after 10 minutes there is no improvement, another 10-15 grams should be given. This can be repeated up to three times. ''At that point, the patient should be considered as not responding to the therapy and an ambulance should be called. ''The equivalency of 10-15 grams of glucose (approximate servings) are:''Many people like the idea of treating low blood sugar with dietary treats such as cake, cookies, and brownies. However, sugar in the form of complex carbohydrates or sugar combined with fat and protein are much too slowly absorbed to be useful in acute treatment.''Once the acute episode has been treated, a healthy, long-acting carbohydrate to maintain blood sugars in the appropriate range should be consumed. Half a sandwich is a reasonable option.''If the hypoglycemic episode has progressed to the point at which the patient cannot or will not take anything by mouth, more drastic measures will be needed. In many cases, a family member or roommate can be trained in the use of glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that causes a rapid release of glucose stores from the liver. It is an injection given intramuscularly to an individual who cannot take glucose by mouth. A response is usually seen in minutes and lasts for about 90 minutes. Again, a long-acting source of glucose should thereafter be consumed to maintain blood sugar levels in the safe range. If glucagon is not available and the patient is not able to take anything by mouth, emergency services (for example 911) should be called immediately. An intravenous route of glucose administration should be established as soon as possible.''With a history of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, the first step in treatment is to assess whether it is related to medications or insulin treatment. Patients with a consistent pattern of the condition may benefit from a medication dose adjustment. It is important that people with diabetes who experience low blood sugar to check blood glucose values multiple times a day to help define whether there is a pattern related to meals or medications. Some people who experience recurrent episodes will benefit from changes in when and what they eat, for example, eating multiple small meals and frequent small snacks throughout the day rather than three larger meals.'   Four lifesavers 4 teaspoons of sugar 1/2 can of regular soda or juice"
What else can you do to control blood sugar levels?,"'Yes. People with diabetes should wear identification stating they have diabetes and whether they have recurrent low blood sugar. Those at risk for the health condition should be counseled on checking blood sugars before they drive a car, operate heavy machinery, or do anything physically taxing. In addition, it is important to carry a quick-acting glucose source (such as those mentioned above) at all times, and keep a source in their car, office, and by their bedside. Efforts should be made to minimize the hypoglycemic effects of drug regimens and to avoid variable surges in ''exercise'', activity, and drinking ''alcohol''.' "
What is low blood sugar?,"'Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar is syndrome that results from low blood sugar. The severity and ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' can vary from person to person. Blood tests can diagnose low blood sugar, and symptoms resolve when the levels of sugar in the blood return to the normal range. The medical term for blood sugar is blood glucose.' "
What are the symptoms and signs that your blood sugar is too low?,"""The normal range of glucose in the bloodstream is from 70 to 100 mg/dL when the individual is fasting (that is not immediately after a meal). The body's biochemical response to hypoglycemia usually starts when sugars are in the high/mid 70's. At this point, the liver releases its stores and the hormones mentioned above start to activate. In many people, this process occurs without any clinical symptoms. The amount of ""'insulin'' produced also declines in an attempt to prevent a further drop in glucose.'""While there is some degree of variability among people, most will usually develop symptoms suggestive of low blood sugar when blood glucose levels are lower than 50 mg/dL. The first set of symptoms are called adrenergic (or sympathetic) because they relate to the nervous system's response to hypoglycemia. People with hypoglycemia may experience any of these symptoms and signs:""'In most people, these symptoms are easily recognizable. The vast majority of individuals with ''diabetes'' only experience this degree of hypoglycemia if they are on medications or insulin. People (with ''diabetes'' or who have ''insulin resistance'') with high circulating levels of insulin who fast or change their ''diet'' to lower their carbohydrate intake drastically should also be cautioned. These individuals may also experience modest hypoglycemia.''People being treated for diabetes who experience the condition may not experience symptoms as easily as people without diabetes. This phenomenon has been referred to as ''hypoglycemic'' unawareness. This can be dangerous as blood sugars may approach extremely low levels before any symptoms are perceived.'""Anyone who has experienced an episode of hypoglycemia describes a sense of urgency to eat and resolve the symptoms. And, that's exactly the point of these symptoms. They act as warning signs to tell the body to consume more fuel. At this level, the brain still can access circulating blood glucose for fuel. The symptoms provide a person the opportunity to raise blood glucose levels before the brain is affected.""'If a person does not or cannot respond by eating something to raise blood glucose, the levels of glucose continue to drop. With further drops in blood glucose, patients progress to neuro-glyco-penic ranges (meaning that the brain is not getting enough glucose). At this point, symptoms progress to ''confusion'', drowsiness, changes in behavior, ''coma'', and ''seizure''.'   Nervousness. Sweating. Intense hunger. Dizzy or lightheaded. Trembling. Weakness. Palpitations. Often have trouble speaking. Pale. Trouble concentrating. irritable and nervous. Changes in behavior or  personality. Seizures. Unconsciousness."
Why is low blood sugar dangerous?,"'When the circulating level of blood glucose falls, the brain actually senses the drop. The brain then sends out messages that trigger a series of events, including changes in hormone and nervous system responses that are aimed at increasing blood glucose levels. Insulin secretion decreases and hormones that promote higher blood glucose levels, such as glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone, and epinephrine all increase. As mentioned previously, there is a store in the liver of glycogen that can be converted to glucose rapidly.''In addition to the biochemical processes that occur, the body starts to consciously alert the affected person that it needs food by causing the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.''The body needs fuel to work. One of its major fuel sources is sugars, which the body gets from what is consumed as either simple sugar or complex carbohydrates in the ''diet''. For emergency situations (like prolonged fasting), the body stores a stash of sugar in the liver as glycogen. If this store is needed, the body goes through a biochemical process to make new sugar (gluco-neo-genesis) and converts these stores of glycogen to sugar. This backup process emphasizes that the fuel source of sugar is important (important enough for human beings to have developed an evolutionary system of storage to avoid a sugar deficit).''Risk factors are having type 1 or 2 diabetes or in some cases, ''prediabetes''.'""Of all the organs in the body, the brain depends on sugar (glucose) almost exclusively. Rarely, if absolutely necessary, the brain will use ketones as a fuel source, but this is not preferred. The brain cannot make its own glucose and is 100% dependent on the rest of the body for its supply. If for some reason, the glucose level in the blood falls (or if the brain's requirements increase and demands are not met) there can be effects on the function of the brain.""'Despite advances in the treatment of diabetes, low blood sugar episodes often are the limiting factor in achieving optimal blood sugar control, because many medications that are effective in treating diabetes carry the risk of lowering the blood sugar level too much, causing symptoms of the condition.

What can cause hypoglycemia in people without diabetes?,"'Hypoglycemia'' (''low blood sugar'' level) is a condition mostly seen in patients with ''diabetes'', who are on ''insulin'' or medications. Hypoglycemia is uncommon to happen in people without ''diabetes''.''Clinical hypoglycemia is a blood ''sugar'' level below 70 mg/dl.''Depending on when it happens, hypoglycemia without ''diabetes'' (nondiabetic hypoglycemia) can be categorized into two types:''Fasting hypoglycemia:'' It occurs when you do not eat for extended periods.''Reactive hypoglycemia:'' It occurs within a few hours of eating a meal.''Fasting hypoglycemia can be caused by any of the following factors:''The cause of reactive hypoglycemia can be:' Medications (most common cause): Nonselective beta-blockers (such as Propranolol) ACE inhibitors (such as Captopril) Certain antibiotics (such as Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin) Alcohol Exercise Diseases: Liver disease (such as viral hepatitis) Hypothyroidism Pancreatic tumor Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa) Malnutrition Stomach surgery Hemodialysis (using an external filter placed outside the body that acts as an artificial kidney) Sepsis (widespread body infection that leads to organ damage) Insulinomas: These are a type of insulin-secreting tumors that can cause sudden episodes of hypoglycemia. They are sometimes a part of multiple cancer syndromes and genetic testing may be needed for diagnosis. Hyperinsulinism (excessive production of insulin) Refined carbohydrates (such as white bread) Prediabetes stage (a condition in which blood sugar is high but not enough to termed as diabetes) Surgeries of the digestive system"
What are the signs and symptoms of nondiabetic hypoglycemia?,"'The signs and ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' do not depend on whether you have diabetes or not. If hypoglycemia happens, it usually gives rise to one or more of the signs and symptoms that include:''Untreated hypoglycemia can lead to ''seizures'', ''coma'', and can even be life-threatening.' Sudden sweating (without exertion) Cold, clammy skin Tachycardia (fast pulse) Palpitations (pounding heart rate) Tremors in hands Weakness Dizziness Headache Shivering Nausea Hunger Blurred vision Anxiety Irritability Confusion"
How is nondiabetic hypoglycemia treated?,"'A person can use the 15-15 rule. In this rule, the person needs to have 15 grams of\xa0carbohydrate\xa0to raise the blood sugar level. After having this, they have to wait for 15 minutes and check the blood sugar level. If your blood sugar level is still below 70 mg/dL, have another 15 grams of carbohydrate.''The treatment of hypoglycemia aims to increase blood glucose levels as fast as possible:' If you are conscious and able to eat, you will be asked to consume 15 to 20 grams of glucose powder every 15 minutes until the symptoms disappear and blood sugar level has returned to normal. You can also eat bread, rice, cereals, sugar candies, or fruits to increase the blood sugar level, however, sugar is the best substance to immediately raise the blood sugar levels. If you are unconscious or unable to eat, then the doctor will give you glucose through an IV. An IV is a small needle placed in your vein. They might also give you the hormone glucagon that raises your blood sugar levels. If the doctor suspects that certain medications to be the cause of your hypoglycemia, they will ask you to discontinue the medications and switch you to other medicines. The diseases that are responsible for your hypoglycemic spells will also be treated accordingly."
What should be the diet for a person with nondiabetic hypoglycemia?,"'If you suffer from episodes of hypoglycemia without even having diabetes, you will need to carry a pack of sugar candies or biscuits wherever you go. Ask your doctor or dietician about what your ''diet'' should be, which can help you prevent ''hypoglycemic'' episodes. The following may help you avoid episodes of hypoglycemia:' Eat frequent, small meals each day instead of three large meals Do not skip meals Cut back on refined carbohydrates (white bread, pastries, soft drinks, syrups, and candy) Have a well-balanced diet that is rich in proteins, contains carbohydrates, fat (good fat), fruits, and vegetables Limit alcohol or drink it along with meals or after meals (not on an empty stomach)"
What is potassium? What is low potassium? Why do we need it?,"'Potassium enters the body through ''diet'' and is one of the primary ''electrolytes'"" (crucial chemicals for cell function), and is concentrated within the cells of the body. Only 2% of the body's total potassium is available in the serum or bloodstream. Small changes in the serum levels of potassium can affect body function. One of the more important functions of potassium is to maintain the electrical activity of the cells in the body. Cells with high electrical activity (for example, nerves and muscles, including the ""'heart'') are particularly affected when potassium levels fall.'""Normal serum potassium levels range from 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in the blood. Normal daily intake of potassium is 70-100 mEq (270 to 390 mg/dl) and requires the kidneys to remove that same amount each day. If more is removed, the body's total potassium store will be decreased, and the result is hypokalemia (hypo=low + kal=potassium +emia= in the blood) occurs."" "
Which foods are rich in potassium?,"'Potassium enters the body through dietary intake. Examples of potassium rich foods include:' Fresh fruits: bananas, cantaloupe, oranges, strawberries, kiwi, avocados, apricots Fresh vegetables: greens, mushrooms, peas, beets, tomatoes Meats: beef, fish, turkey, Juices: Orange, prune, apricot, grapefruit"
What are the symptoms and signs of low potassium?,"'Potassium affects the way neuromuscular cells discharge energy (depolarize) and then regenerate (repolarize) that energy to be able to fire again. When potassium levels are low, the cells cannot repolarize and are unable to fire repeatedly, and muscles and nerves may not function normally. The effects of low potassium include may cause the following symptoms:'   muscle weakness, muscle aches, muscle cramps, and heart palpitations (irregular heartbeats)."
What are the causes (reasons) of low potassium?,"'Hypokalemia is not commonly caused by poor dietary intake.''The most common reason that potassium levels fall is due to the loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the kidney.''Potassium loss from the GI tract may be caused by:''Causes of potassium loss from the kidney:''Low potassium levels may result from side effects of some medications:' Vomiting Diarrhea Ileostomy: In some patients who have had bowel surgery and have an ileostomy, the stool output can contain significant amounts of potassium. Villous adenoma (a type of colon polyp that can cause the colon to leak potassium) Laxative use Diuretic medications (water pills) like hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or furosemide (Lasix) Elevated corticosteroid levels, either from medication like prednisone or from an illness like Cushing's Syndrome Elevated levels of aldosterone, a hormone that can increase with renal artery stenosis or adrenal tumors Renal tubular acidosis Low body magnesium levels Aminoglycosides like gentamicin (Garamycin) or tobramycin (Nebcin) Amphotericin B Prednisone"
What tests diagnose low potassium?,"'Potassium levels in the blood may be easily measured by routine blood tests.''Low potassium is often a potential complication of medication. For example, patients with ''high blood pressure'' who are being treated with diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide (''Hydrodiuril'') or furosemide (Lasix) often have their potassium levels monitored.''Patients who become ill with ''vomiting'' and ''diarrhea'', might develop ''dehydration'' and weakness. Part of the patient evaluation may include having their ''electrolyte'' levels tested in order to determine whether body potassium losses may need to be replaced.''There can be ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'') changes associated with low potassium, and sometimes the diagnosis of low potassium is made incidentally by finding the characteristic ""U"" waves on the EKG tracing. In severe cases, hypokalemia can lead to dangerous disturbances in heart rhythm (dysrhythmia).'  "
What is the treatment for low potassium? Is it dangerous?,"""Serum potassium levels above 3.0 mEq/liter are not considered dangerous or of great concern; they can be treated with potassium replacement by mouth. Depending on the patient's medical condition, other medical problems, and the patient's symptoms, serum levels lower than 3.0 mEq/liter may require intravenous replacement. Decisions are patient-specific and depend upon the diagnosis, the circumstances of the illness, and the patient's ability to tolerate fluid and medication by mouth.""'Over the short-term, with self-limited illnesses like ''gastroenteritis'' with vomiting and ''diarrhea'', the body is able to regulate and restore potassium levels on its own. However, if the hypokalemia is severe, or the losses of potassium are predicted to be ongoing, potassium replacement or supplementation may be required.''In those patients taking diuretics, often a small amount of oral potassium may be prescribed since the loss will continue as long as the medication is prescribed. Oral ''supplements'' may be in pill or liquid form, and the dosages are measured in mEq (milliequivalents). Common doses are 10-20mEq per day. Alternatively, consumption of foods high in potassium may be the first option in replacing potassium. Bananas, apricots, oranges, and tomatoes are high in potassium content. Since potassium is excreted in the kidney, blood tests that monitor kidney function may be ordered to predict and prevent potassium levels from rising too high.''When potassium needs to be given intravenously, it must be given slowly. Potassium is irritating to the vein and is usually administered at a maximal rate of 10 mEq per hour. Moreover, infusing potassium too quickly can cause heart irritation and promote potentially dangerous rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia.''Rarely, a special situation will occur when all the potassium in the body shifts from the serum into the cells of the body. This drops the serum potassium levels to 1.0 mEq/liter or lower. This causes immediate muscle weakness to the point that the patient cannot move and becomes paralyzed. Arms and legs are most affected. Rarely, ''breathing'' and swallowing muscles can be involved.''Periodic ''paralysis'' may be hereditary (genetic) and may be precipitated by excessive ''exercise'', a high carbohydrate or high salt meal, or may occur without apparent cause.''Treatment by potassium replacement intravenously is effective, and recovery occurs within 24 hours.'  "
Can low potassium be prevented?,"'Usually, the body is able to maintain potassium levels within the normal range as long as there is adequate potassium in the ''diet''. When the body loses potassium due to a short-term illness, it is able to compensate for the loss. If your potassium loss is continues, it is important for the you and your doctor to anticipate the loss, and consider routine potassium replacement.'  "
What is mania and what is hypomania?," Mania is a severe episode of elevated/euphoric or irritable mood and increased energy that usually lasts at least a week and severely interferes with the sufferer's ability to function. Hypomania is a less severe version of mania, in that it is characterized by somewhat elevated or irritable mood that may more mildly interfere with a person's functioning to a less debilitating degree than mania."
What are causes and risk factors for mania and hypomania?,"'As with most other mental health issues, mania or hypomania are not directly passed from one generation to another genetically. Rather, each is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental vulnerabilities. People with these symptoms or with ''schizophrenia'' and ''schizoaffective disorder'' often have risk factors in common, including a family history of any of these disorders, loss of a parent or other ''trauma'', as well as being born prematurely.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of mania and hypomania?,"""Manic symptoms must last at least a week's time, unless it is part of a mixed (more rapidly alternating) mood episode, and include""'Hypomanic'' symptoms must last at least four days in a row and include''While mania and hypomania have many symptoms in common, mania results in more severe problems compared to hypomania.'  euphoric, elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased energy; racing thoughts; pressured speech (rapid, excessive, frenzied speaking); decreased need for sleep; grandiose ideas (for example, false/delusional beliefs of paranoia, superiority, or failure); tangential speech (repeatedly changing conversational topics to ones that are hardly related); restlessness/increased goal-directed activity; and impulsivity, poor judgment, or engaging in risky activity (like spending sprees, promiscuity, or excess desire for sex). euphoric, elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased energy; excessive self-esteem or grandiosity; less need to sleep; more talkative than usual or feeling pressured to continue talking; expresses ideas rapidly -- quickly changes topics or feels that thoughts are racing; trouble focusing; restlessness or increased participation in goal-oriented activities; and excessively engaging in activities that have a high likelihood of having negative consequences (for example, promiscuity, excessive spending, poor business decisions)."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose mania and hypomania?,"""There is no one test that definitively assesses that someone has mania or hypomania. Therefore, health care clinicians diagnose either of these mood episodes by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information to exclude the presence of other mental conditions. The health care professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the person's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has past or present other mental health symptoms like ""'depression'', ''anxiety'', or psychotic features (for example, ''delusions'' or ''hallucinations'') that are associated with a medical condition or exposure to a drug of abuse or other substance.'""To determine if an individual has mania, mental health professionals will explore if the sufferer has at least three of the aforementioned symptoms that last most of every day for at least a week and result in either hospitalization or other severe problems with the person's functioning at home, work, school, or in the community. To diagnose a person with hypomania, a practitioner will determine if the sufferer has the symptoms described for at least four days in a row and results in a clear change in the person's functioning. However, symptoms of hypomania cannot rise to the level of severity of causing severe impairment in the person's functioning, or else it is better explained as a manic episode."" "
What are medications and other treatments for mania and hypomania?,"'People with manic or hypomanic feelings can expect their mental health professionals to consider several medical interventions in the form of medications, psychotherapies, and lifestyle advice to address symptoms -- relieving already existing symptoms and preventing symptoms from returning. Mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications are thought to be particularly effective in treating mania or hypomania, in that these groups of medications can be useful in treating active (acute) symptoms of manic or mixed episodes, as well as preventing the return of such symptoms. Despite its stigmatized history, ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can be a viable treatment for people whose mania is severe and has inadequately responded to psychotherapies and a number of drug trials.'  "
What is the prognosis of mania and hypomania?,"'The prognosis for mania or hypomania is such that individuals tend to have episodes of some sort of mood problem up to 60% of the time. However, the episodes can often be well managed by the combination of psychotherapy and medication treatment. There are a number of potential complications of these mood problems, particularly if left untreated.''Complications of mania or hypomania can include substance use disorders, thinking (cognitive) problems, and generally more medical problems. The risk of committing ''suicide'' is 60 times higher for people who have had mania or hypomania compared to the general population.' "
Is it possible to prevent mania and hypomania?,"'While far more seems to be known about the prevention of symptoms of mania or hypomania once symptoms have occurred at least once, there is emerging research that when family focused therapy is provided to children who have more subtle symptoms prior to having a manic episode and who have relatives who have suffered from a similar mood episode, they may be less likely to develop full-blown ''bipolar disorder'' as adults.' "
What is hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'Hyponatremia refers to a lower-than-normal level of sodium in the blood. Sodium is essential for many body functions including the maintenance of fluid balance, regulation of ''blood pressure'', and normal function of the nervous system. Hyponatremia has sometimes been referred to as ""water intoxication,"" especially when it is due to the consumption of excess water, for example during strenuous ''exercise'', without adequate replacement of sodium.''Sodium is the major positively charged ion (cation) in the fluid outside of cells of the body. The chemical notation for sodium is Na. When combined with chloride (Cl), the resulting substance is table salt (NaCl).''The normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L). Results may vary slightly among different laboratories.'  "
What are the symptoms of hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'When sodium levels in the body are low, water tends to enter cells, causing them to swell. When this occurs in the brain, it is referred to as cerebral ''edema''. Cerebral edema is particularly dangerous because the brain is confined in the skull without room for expansion, and the swelling can lead to ''brain damage'' as the pressure increases within the skull. Cerebral edema occurs only in severe cases of hyponatremia.''In chronic hyponatremia, in which the blood sodium levels drop gradually over time, symptoms are typically less severe than with acute hyponatremia (a sudden drop in blood sodium level). Symptoms can be very nonspecific and can include:''Other possible symptoms include:''Nausea'' and ''vomiting'' may accompany any of the symptoms.'   headache, confusion or altered mental state, seizures, and decreased consciousness, which can proceed to coma and death. restlessness, muscle spasms or cramps, weakness, and tiredness."
What causes hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'A low sodium level in the blood may result from excess water or fluid in the body, diluting the normal amount of sodium so that the concentration appears low. This type of hyponatremia can be the result of chronic conditions such as ''kidney failure'' (when excess fluid cannot be efficiently excreted) and congestive ''heart failure'', in which excess fluid accumulates in the body. ''SIADH'' (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone) is a disease whereby the body produces too much anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in retention of water in the body. Consuming excess water, for example during strenuous ''exercise'', without adequate replacement of sodium, can also result in hyponatremia.''Hyponatremia can also result when sodium is lost from the body or when both sodium and fluid are lost from the body, for example, during prolonged ''sweating'' and severe vomiting or ''diarrhea''.''Medical conditions that can sometimes be associated with hyponatremia are ''adrenal insufficiency'', ''hypothyroidism'', and ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver''.''Finally, a number of medications can lower blood sodium levels. Examples of these include diuretics, vasopressin, and the sulfonylurea ''drugs''.' "
What tests diagnose hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'The symptoms of hyponatremia are nonspecific, so a blood test measuring the sodium level is required to confirm the diagnosis of hyponatremia. Sometimes the medical history (such as prolonged vomiting or ''excessive sweating'') will suggest the diagnosis. In other cases, further blood tests, urine tests, and imaging studies may be needed in order to determine the exact cause of the hyponatremia.'  "
What diets and treatment guidelines are used for hyponatremia (low blood sodium)?,"'Mild chronic hyponatremia may not require treatment other than adjustments in ''diet'', lifestyle, or medications. For severe or acute hyponatremia, treatment typically involves the intravenous administration of fluids and ''electrolytes''. In these situations, medications are often needed that treat the underlying cause of the hyponatremia as well as medications to manage the accompanying symptoms.'  "
What is hypoparathyroidism?,"""Hypoparathyroidism is a condition in which the body doesn't make enough parathyroid hormone (PTH). """"This hormone regulates the amount of calcium and phosphorus in your body's bones and blood. Decreased levels of PTH lead to low levels of calcium and high levels of phosphorus in the blood. This imbalance can lead to problems with bones, muscles, skin, and nerve endings. "" "
What causes hypoparathyroidism?,"'The most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is injury to the parathyroid glands, such as during head and neck surgery. Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands that are located in the neck behind the thyroid gland. ''It other cases, hypoparathyroidism is present at birth or may be associated with an autoimmune disease that affects the parathyroids along with other glands in the body, such as the thyroid, ovaries, or adrenal glands. ''Hypoparathyroidism is very rare. It is different from hyperparathyroidism, a much more common condition in which the body makes too much PTH. ' "
What are the symptoms of hypoparathyroidism?,"'Symptoms of hypoparathyroidism may include: '   Tingling in the lips, fingers, and toes Dry hair, brittle nails, and dry, coarse skin Muscle cramps and pain in the face, hands, legs, and feet Cataracts on the eyes  Malformations of the teeth, including weakened tooth enamel and misshapen roots of the teeth Loss of memory Headaches Severe muscle spasms (also called tetany) and convulsions "
How is hypoparathyroidism treated?,"""The goal of treatment for hypoparathyroidism is to restore the body's calcium and phosphorus to normal levels. Calcium carbonate and ""'vitamin D'' ''supplements'' are the only currently approved treatment. However, NIH studies have shown the investigational drug PTH to work well as an alternative therapy. ''If hypoparathyroidism is diagnosed and treated early, outcomes are usual good and the body grows normally. ''If hypoparathyroidism is left untreated, complications can include a blocked ''airway'' due to severe muscle spasms, stunted growth, malformed teeth, development of cataracts, and calcium deposits in the brain.'  "
What do blood pressure numbers mean (chart with ranges)?,"'Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It constitutes one of the critically important signs of life or vital signs, which include ''heart'' rate, ''breathing'', and temperature. Blood pressure is generated by the heart pumping blood into the arteries modified by the response of the arteries to the flow of blood.'""An individual's blood pressure is expressed as ""'systolic/diastolic'' blood pressure, for example, 120/80.''Blood pressure always is higher when the heart is pumping (squeezing) than when it is relaxing.''The range of systolic blood pressure for most healthy adults falls between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Normal diastolic blood pressure ranges between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Current guidelines define normal blood pressure range as lower than 120/80. Blood pressures over 130/80 are considered high. ''High blood pressure'' increases the risk of damaging the arteries, which leads to the development of:''Low blood pressure (''hypotension'') is pressure so low it causes symptoms or signs due to the low flow of blood through the arteries and veins. When the flow of blood is too low to deliver enough oxygen and nutrients to vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidney, the organs do not function normally and may be temporarily or permanently damaged.''Unlike ''high blood pressure'', low blood pressure is defined primarily by signs and symptoms of low blood flow and not by a specific blood pressure number. Some individuals routinely may have blood pressure numbers of 90/50 with no symptoms and therefore do not have low blood pressure. However, others who normally have higher blood pressures may develop symptoms of low blood pressure if their blood pressure drops to 100/60.''During ''pregnancy'', blood pressure tends to decrease. Normal blood pressure during pregnancy may be lower than 100/60. Your OB/GYN or ''Midwife'' should monitor your bood pressure if you are ''pregnant''.'   The systolic blood pressure (the top number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart contracts and pumps blood into them. The diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) represents the pressure in the arteries as the muscle of the heart relaxes following its contraction. Heart disease Kidney disease Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) Eye damage Stroke"
How does blood pressure work? ,"'During relaxation of the heart (diastole), the ''left ventricle'' of the heart fills with blood returning from the ''lungs''. The left ventricle then contracts and pumps blood into the arteries (systole). The blood pressure in the arteries during contraction of the ventricle (systolic pressure) is higher because blood is being actively ejected into the arteries. It is lower during relaxation of the ventricle (diastolic pressure) when no blood is being ejected into the arteries. The pulse we feel when we place our fingers over an artery is caused by the contraction of the left ventricle and the ejection of blood.''Blood pressure is determined by two factors: 1) The amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle of the heart into the arteries, and 2) the resistance to the flow of blood caused by the walls of the arterioles (smaller arteries).''Generally, blood pressure tends to be higher if more blood is pumped into the arteries or if the arterioles are narrow and/or stiff. Narrow and/or stiff arterioles, by resisting the flow of blood, increase blood pressure. Arterioles may become narrower when the muscles surrounding them contract. Arterioles may become stiff and narrow when older patients develop atherosclerosis.''Blood pressure tends to be lower if less blood is being pumped into the arteries or if the arterioles are larger and more flexible and, therefore, have less resistance to the flow of blood.''The body has mechanisms to alter or maintain blood pressure and blood flow. There are sensors that detect blood pressure in the walls of the arteries and send signals to the heart, the arterioles, the veins, and the kidneys that cause them to make changes that lower or increase blood pressure.''Several ways in which blood pressure can be adjusted ''by adjusting the amount of blood pumped by the heart into the arteries (cardiac output), the amount of blood contained in the veins, the arteriolar resistance, and the volume of blood.''For example, low blood volume due to bleeding (such as a bleeding ulcer in the stomach or from a severe laceration from an injury) can cause low blood pressure. The body quickly responds to the low blood volume and pressure by the following adjustments, which all increase blood pressure:'""The heart rate increases and the forcefulness of the heart's contractions increase, pumping more blood through the heart."" The heart can speed up and contract more frequently and it can eject more blood with each contraction (more forcefully). Both of these responses increase the flow of blood into the arteries and increase blood pressure. The veins can expand and narrow. When veins expand, more blood can be stored in the veins and less blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries. As a result, the heart pumps less blood, and blood pressure is lower. On the other hand, when veins narrow, less blood is stored in the veins, more blood returns to the heart for pumping into the arteries, and blood pressure is higher. The arterioles can expand and narrow. Expanded arterioles create less resistance to the flow of blood and decrease blood pressure, while narrowed arterioles create more resistance and raise blood pressure. The kidney can respond to changes in blood pressure by increasing or decreasing the amount of urine that is produced. Urine is primarily water that is removed from the blood. When the kidney makes more urine, the amount (volume) of blood that fills the arteries and veins decreases, and this lowers blood pressure. If the kidneys make less urine, the amount of blood that fills the arteries and veins increases and this increases blood pressure. Compared with the other mechanisms for adjusting blood pressure, changes in the production of urine affect blood pressure slowly over hours and days. (The other mechanisms are effective in seconds.) Veins narrow to return more blood to the heart for pumping. Blood flow to the kidneys decreases to reduce the formation of urine and thereby increases the volume of blood in the arteries and veins. Arterioles narrow to increase resistance to blood flow. These adaptive responses will keep the blood pressure in the normal range unless blood loss becomes so severe that the responses are overwhelmed."
What are the benefits of low blood pressure?,"'People who have lower blood pressures have a''Athletes, people who ''exercise'' regularly, people who maintain ideal body weight, and nonsmokers tend to have lower blood pressures.''Low blood pressure is desirable as long as it is not low enough to cause symptoms and damage to the organs in the body.' lower risk of stroke, kidney disease, and heart disease."
What are the signs and symptoms of low blood pressure?,"'When blood pressure is not sufficient to deliver enough blood to the organs of the body, the organs do not work properly and can be temporarily or permanently damaged. Symptoms of low blood pressure caused by conditions or diseases depend upon the specific cause of the low blood pressure. For example, if insufficient blood flows to the brain, brain cells do not receive enough oxygen and nutrients, and a person can feel lightheaded, dizzy, or even faint.''The most common symptoms of low blood pressure include:''Symptoms of low blood pressure due to conditions or diseases include:'   Lightheadedness Dizziness Fainting (syncope) Orthostatic hypotension symptoms: Going from a sitting or lying position to a standing position often brings out symptoms of low blood pressure. This occurs because standing causes blood to ""settle"" in the veins of the lower body, and this can lower the blood pressure. If the blood pressure is already low, standing can make the low pressure worse, to the point of causing symptoms. The development of lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing caused by low blood pressure is called orthostatic hypotension. Normal individuals are able to compensate rapidly for the low pressure created by standing with the responses discussed previously and do not develop orthostatic hypotension. Heart disease: Chest pain (a symptom of angina) or even a heart attack may occur when there is insufficient blood pressure to deliver blood to the coronary arteries (the arteries that supply blood to the heart's muscle). Kidney disease: When insufficient blood is delivered to the kidneys, the kidneys fail to eliminate wastes from the body, for example, urea (BUN and creatinine), and increases in their levels in the blood occur. Shock is a life-threatening condition where persistently low blood pressure causes organs such as kidney, liver, heart, lung, and brain to fail rapidly."
What causes low blood pressure?,'Conditions that reduce the volume of blood or that reduce cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart) and medications are frequent reasons for low blood pressure.' 
"Dehydration, bleeding, and inflammation","   Dehydration is common among patients with prolonged nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive exercise, which shunts blood away from the organs to the muscles. Large amounts of water are lost when vomiting and with diarrhea, especially if the person does not drink adequate amounts of fluid to replace the depleted water.Other causes of dehydration include exercise, sweating, fever, and heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Individuals with mild dehydration may experience only thirst and dry mouth. Moderate to severe dehydration may cause orthostatic hypotension (manifested by lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting upon standing). Prolonged and severe dehydration can lead to shock, kidney failure, confusion, acidosis (too much acid in the blood), coma, and even death. Moderate or severe bleeding can quickly deplete an individual's body of blood, leading to low blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension. Bleeding can result from trauma, surgical complications, or from gastrointestinal abnormalities such as ulcers, tumors, or diverticulosis. Occasionally, the bleeding may be so severe and rapid (for example, bleeding from a ruptured aortic aneurysm) that it causes shock and death rapidly. Severe inflammation of organs inside the body such as acute pancreatitis can cause low blood pressure. In acute pancreatitis, fluid leaves the blood vessels to enter the inflamed tissues around the pancreas as well as the abdominal cavity, concentrating blood and reducing its volume."
Heart disease,"'Several common reasons for bradycardia include: 1) sick sinus syndrome, 2) ''heart block'', and 3) drug toxicity. Many of these conditions occur in the elderly.''An abnormally fast heart rate (tachycardia)'' also can cause low blood pressure. The most common example of tachycardia causing low blood pressure is ''atrial fibrillation'' (''Afib''). ''Atrial fibrillation'' is a disorder of the heart characterized by rapid and irregular electrical discharges from the muscle of the heart causing the ventricles to contract irregularly and (usually) rapidly. The rapidly contracting ventricles do not have enough time to fill maximally with blood before each contraction, and the amount of blood that is pumped decreases in spite of the faster heart rate. Other abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia also can produce low blood pressure, and sometimes life-threatening shock.' Weakened heart muscle can cause the heart to fail and reduce the amount of blood it pumps. One common cause of weakened heart muscle is the death of a large portion of the heart's muscle due to a single, large heart attack or repeated smaller heart attacks. Other examples of conditions that can weaken the ability of the heart to pump blood include medications toxic to the heart, infections of the muscle of the heart by viruses (myocarditis), and diseases of the heart's valves such as aortic stenosis that reduce the flow of blood from the heart and into the arteries. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). Pericarditis can cause fluid to accumulate within the pericardium and compress the heart, restricting the ability of the heart to expand, fill, and pump blood. Pulmonary embolism is a condition in which a blood clot in a vein (deep vein thrombosis or DVT) breaks off and travels to the heart and eventually the lung. A large blood clot can block the flow of blood into the left ventricle from the lungs and severely diminish the blood returning to the heart for pumping. Pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening emergency. A slow heart rate (bradycardia) can decrease the amount of blood pumped by the heart. The resting heart rate for a healthy adult is between 60 and 100 beats/minute. Bradycardia (resting heart rates slower than 60 beats/minute) does not always cause low blood pressure. In fact, some highly trained athletes can have resting heart rates in the 40s and 50s (beats per minute) without any symptoms. The slow heart rates are offset by more forceful contractions of the heart that pump more blood than in non-athletes. However, in many patients bradycardia can lead to low blood pressure, lightheadedness, dizziness, and even fainting. Sick sinus syndrome: Sick sinus syndrome occurs when the diseased electrical system of the heart cannot generate electrical signals fast enough to maintain a normal heart rate. Heart block: Heart block occurs when the specialized tissues that transmit electrical current in the heart are damaged by heart attacks, degeneration from atherosclerosis, and medications. Heart block prevents some or all of the electrical signals from reaching parts of the heart, and this prevents the heart from contracting as well as it otherwise would. Drug toxicity: Drugs such as digoxin (Lanoxin) or beta blockers for high blood pressure can slow the transmission of electricity in the heart chemically and can cause bradycardia and hypotension (see section ""Medications that cause low blood pressure"")."
Medications,"'Medications that cause low blood pressure' Medications such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, and digoxin (Lanoxin) can slow the rate at which the heart contracts. Some elderly people are extremely sensitive to these medications since they are more likely to have diseased hearts and electrical conduction tissues. In some individuals, the heart rate can become dangerously slow even with small doses of these medications. Medications used in treating high blood pressure (such as angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers) can excessively lower blood pressure and result in symptomatic low blood pressure especially among the elderly. Water pills (diuretics) such as hydrochlorothiazide (HydroDIURIL) and furosemide (Lasix) can decrease blood volume by causing excessive urination. Medications used for treating depression, such as amitriptyline (Elavil); Parkinson's disease, such as levodopa-carbidopa (Sinemet); and erectile dysfunction (impotence), such as sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) when used in combination with nitroglycerin, can cause low blood pressure. Alcohol and narcotics also can cause low blood pressure."
Other causes of low blood pressure," Vasovagal reaction is a common condition in which a healthy person temporarily develops low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and sometimes fainting. A vasovagal reaction typically is brought on by emotions of fear or pain such as having blood drawn, starting an intravenous infusion, or by gastrointestinal upset. Vasovagal reactions are caused by activity of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system, especially the vagus nerve, which releases hormones that slow the heart and widen the blood vessels. The vagus nerve also controls digestive tract function and senses activity in the digestive system. Thus, some people can have a vasovagal reaction from straining at a bowel movement or vomiting. Postural (orthostatic) hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when an individual stands up from a sitting, squatting, or supine (lying) position. When a person stands up, gravity causes blood to settle in the veins in the legs so that less blood returns to the heart for pumping, and, as a result, the blood pressure drops. The body normally responds automatically to the drop in blood pressure by increasing the rate and narrowing the veins to return more blood to the heart. In patients with postural hypotension, this compensating reflex fails to occur, resulting low blood pressure and its symptoms. Postural hypotension can occur in persons of all ages but is much more common among the elderly, especially in those on medications for high blood pressure and/or diuretics. Other causes of postural hypotension include dehydration, adrenal insufficiency, prolonged bed rest, diabetes, and certain rare neurological syndromes (for example, Shy-Drager syndrome) that damage the autonomic nerves. Another form of postural hypotension occurs typically in young healthy individuals. After prolonged standing, the individual's heart rate and blood pressure drop, causing dizziness, nausea, and often fainting. In these individuals, the autonomic nervous system wrongly responds to prolonged standing by directing the heart to slow down and the veins to dilate thereby removing blood from circulating in the arteries. Micturition syncope is a temporary drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness brought about by urinating. This condition typically occurs in elderly patients and may be due to the release of hormones that lower blood pressure. Adrenal insufficiency, for example, due to Addison's disease, can cause low blood pressure. Addison's disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands (small glands next to the kidneys) are destroyed. The destroyed adrenal glands can no longer produce sufficient adrenal hormones (specifically cortisol) necessary to maintain normal bodily functions. Cortisol has many functions, one of which is to maintain blood pressure and the function of the heart. Addison's disease is characterized by weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, low blood pressure, and, sometimes, darkening of the skin. Septicemia is a severe infection in which bacteria (or other infectious organisms such as fungi) enter the blood. The infection typically originates in the lungs (as pneumonia), bladder, or in the abdomen due to diverticulitis or gallstones. The bacteria then enter the blood where they release toxins and cause life-threatening and profound low blood pressure (septic shock), often with damage to several organs. Anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock) is a potentially fatal allergic reaction to medications such as penicillin, intravenous iodine used in some X-ray studies, foods such as peanuts, or bee stings (insect stings). In addition to a severe drop in blood pressure, individuals may also experience hives and wheezing due to constriction of the airways, and a swollen throat, which causes difficulty breathing. The shock is caused by enlargement of blood-containing blood vessels and escape of water from the blood into the tissues."
What procedures and tests diagnose low blood pressure?,"'In some people, particularly relatively healthy ones, symptoms of weakness, dizziness, and fainting raise the suspicion of low blood pressure. In others, an event often associated with low blood pressure, for example a heart attack, has occurred to cause the symptoms.''Measuring blood pressure in both the lying (supine) and standing positions usually is the first step in diagnosing low blood pressure. In patients with symptomatic low blood pressure, there often is a marked drop in blood pressure upon standing, and patients may even develop orthostatic symptoms. The heart rate often increases. The goal is to identify the cause of the low blood pressure. Sometimes the causes are readily apparent (such as loss of blood due to trauma, or sudden shock after receiving X-ray dyes containing iodine). At other times, the cause may be identified by testing:' CBC (complete blood count) may reveal anemia from blood loss or elevated white blood cells due to infection. Blood electrolyte measurements may show dehydration and mineral depletion, renal failure (kidney failure), or acidosis (excess acid in the blood). Cortisol levels can be measured to diagnose adrenal insufficiency and Addison's disease. Blood and urine cultures can be performed to diagnose septicemia and bladder infections, respectively. Radiology studies, such as chest X-rays, abdominal ultrasounds, and computerized tomography (CT or CAT) scans may detect pneumonia, heart failure, gallstones, pancreatitis, and diverticulitis. Electrocardiograms (EKG) can detect abnormally slow or rapid heartbeats, pericarditis, and heart muscle damage from either previous heart attacks or a reduced supply of blood to the heart muscle that has not yet caused a heart attack. Holter monitor recordings are used to diagnose intermittent episodes of abnormal heart rhythms. If abnormal rhythms occur intermittently, a standard EKG performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not show the abnormal rhythm. A Holter monitor is a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours that often is used diagnose intermittent episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia (aslow or fast heart rate). Patient-activated event recorder: If the episodes of bradycardia or tachycardia are infrequent, a 24-hour Holter recording may not capture these sporadic episodes. In this situation, a patient can wear a patient-activated event recorder for up to 4 weeks. The patient presses a button to start the recording when he or she senses the onset of an abnormal heart rhythm or symptoms possibly caused by low blood pressure. The doctor then analyzes the recordings later to identify the abnormal episodes. Echocardiograms are examinations of the structures and motion of the heart using ultrasound. Echocardiograms can detect pericardial fluid due to pericarditis, the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks, diseases of the heart valves, and rare tumors of the heart. Ultrasound examinations of the leg veins and CT scans of the chest can detect deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Tilt-table tests are used to evaluate patients suspected of having postural hypotension or syncope due to abnormal function of the autonomic nerves. During a tilt-table test, the patient lies on an examination table with an intravenous infusion administered while the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored. The table then is tilted upright for 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Heart rate and blood pressure are monitored every few minutes. The purpose of the test is to try to reproduce postural hypotension. Sometimes a doctor may administer epinephrine (Adrenalin, Isuprel) intravenously to induce postural hypotension."
What is the treatment for low blood pressure?,"'Low blood pressure readings in healthy people without symptoms or organ damage need no treatment. A doctor should evalute all patients with symptoms that are possibly due to low blood pressure. Patients who have had a major drop in blood pressure from their usual levels even without the development of symptoms also should be evaluated. The doctor needs to identify the cause of the low blood pressure; remedies will depend on the cause. For example, if a medication is causing the low blood pressure, the dose of medication may have to be reduced or the medication stopped. ''Do not adjust medication dose on your own, and do not stop taking any medication without first consulting your doctor.''Do not take any herbs without first consulting your doctor.''*Note: Increasing salt intake can lead to heart failure in patients with existing heart disease and should not be undertaken without consulting a doctor.'   Dehydration is treated with fluids and minerals (electrolytes). Mild dehydration without nausea and vomiting can be treated with oral fluids and electrolytes. Moderate to severe dehydration usually is treated in a hospital or emergency room with intravenous fluids and electrolytes. Blood loss can be treated by treating the cause of the bleeding, and with intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. Continuous and severe bleeding needs to be treated immediately. Septic shock is a medical emergency and is treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Blood pressure medications or diuretics are adjusted, changed, or stopped by the doctor if they are causing low blood pressure symptoms. Bradycardia may be due to a medication. The doctor may reduce, change, or stop the medication. Bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome or heart block is treated with an implantable pacemaker. Tachycardia is treated depending on the nature of the tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation can be treated with oral medications, electrical cardioversion, or a catheterization procedure called pulmonary vein isolation. Ventricular tachycardia can be controlled with medications or with an implantable defibrillator. Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is treated with blood thinners, initially with types of heparin. Later, oral warfarin (Coumadin) or other oral medications are substituted for heparin. Pericardial fluid from pericarditis can be removed by a procedure called pericardiocentesis. Postural hypotension can be treated with changes in diet such asincreasing water and salt intake,* increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels),using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins, andin some patients, the use of a medication called midodrine (ProAmatine). increasing water and salt intake, * increasing intake of caffeinated beverages (because caffeine constricts blood vessels), using compression stockings to compress the leg veins and reduce the pooling of blood in the leg veins, and in some patients, the use of a medication called midodrine (ProAmatine). The problem with midodrine is that while it increases blood pressure in the upright position, the supine blood pressure may become too high, thus increasing the risk of strokes. Mayo Clinic researchers found that a medication used to treat muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis called pyridostigmine (Mestinon) increases upright blood pressure but not supine blood pressure. Pyridostigmine, an anticholinesterase medication, works on the autonomic nervous system, especially when a person is standing up. Side effects include minor abdominal cramping or increased frequency of bowel movements. Postprandial hypotension refers to low blood pressure occurring after meals. Ibuprofen (Motrin) or indomethacin (Indocin) may be beneficial. Vasovagal syncope can be treated with several types of drugs such as beta blockers, for example:Propanolol (Inderal, Inderal LA)SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such asfluoxetine (Prozac),escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro),paroxetine (Paxil),sertraline (Zoloft),citalopram (Celexa), andfluvoxamine (Luvox). Propanolol (Inderal, Inderal LA) SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such asfluoxetine (Prozac),escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro),paroxetine (Paxil),sertraline (Zoloft),citalopram (Celexa), andfluvoxamine (Luvox). fluoxetine (Prozac), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and fluvoxamine (Luvox). fludrocortisone (Florinef) (a drug that prevents dehydration by causing the kidney(s) to retain water) also may be used. A pacemaker can also be helpful when a patient fails drug therapy. Natural remedies have not been proven. Some herbs reported to raise blood pressure includeginger,rosemary,aniseed,cinnamon, andpepper. ginger, rosemary, aniseed, cinnamon, and pepper."
What is orthostatic hypotension?,"'When a person stands up from sitting or lying down, the body must work to adjust to that change in position. It is especially important for the body to push blood upward and supply the brain with oxygen. If the body fails to do this adequately, blood pressure falls, and a person may feel lightheaded or even pass out. Orthostatic hypotension is the term used to describe the fall in blood pressure when a person stands (orthostatic= upright posture of the body; hypo= less + tension=pressure).'""Adequate blood supply to the body's organs depends upon three factors: ""'When the body changes position, a variety of actions occur involving all parts of the ''cardiovascular system'' as well as the autonomic nervous system that helps regulate their function. ''The ''autonomic nervous system'' can be considered to ""run in the background"" of the body, regulating body processes that we take for granted. There is a balance between the ''sympathetic system'' (adrenergic nerves), that speed things up, and the ''parasympathetic system'' (cholinergic nerves) that slow things down. These names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. ''These two systems are in balance, and yet need to respond to routine changes in the body that happens throughout the day.''Orthostatic hypotension is not a disease or a complaint from an individual; it is an abnormal change in blood pressure and heart rate associated with an illness.' a heart strong enough to pump,  arteries and veins that are able to constrict or squeeze, and  enough blood and fluid within the vessels.  Adrenaline (from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to stress. Imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster, your palms get sweaty, your eyes dilate, and your hair stands on end.  Acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. 
 When the body moves to a standing position, pressure monitors (baroreceptor cells) located in the carotid arteries and 
the aorta sense a subtle drop in blood pressure because of gravity, which causes blood to flow towards the legs.  Almost immediately, the sympathetic system is stimulated, causing the heart rate to increase, the heart muscle to contract or squeeze more forcefully, and blood vessels to constrict or narrow.  All of these actions serve to increase the blood pressure so that an adequate amount of blood can still be pumped to the brain and other organs.  Without these changes, gravity would cause the blood to remain in the lowest part of the body and away from the brain, causing symptoms 
of lightheadedness or even passing out."
What are the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension?,"'When the brain does not get enough blood supply, it begins to shut down.''Symptoms include:''There may also be weakness, blurred vision, and shaking or tremulousness.''These symptoms may resolve quickly as the body slowly adjusts to the standing position, but in some cases the patient has to sit or lie down quickly to prevent passing out or falling.'   lightheadedness,  confusion,  nausea, and  fainting or passing out. "
What are the risk factors for orthostatic hypotension?,"'Orthostatic hypotension most often occurs in the elderly. ""''Hardening of the arteries''"" or ''atherosclerosis'' that develops as we age makes it more difficult for blood vessels to adapt quickly when necessary. As well, many of the diseases that are associated with orthostatic hypotension are progressive, with symptoms worsening with age.''Pregnancy'' is associated with orthostatic hypotension. As the pregnancy progresses, the volume of the circulatory system expands and blood pressure tends to fall. This may lead to lightheadedness when standing quickly. Blood pressure levels return to normal after delivery.''Excessive sweating'' due to physical exertion and exposure to heat are risk factors and potential causes of dehydration and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Patients who have other risk factors to develop orthostatic hypotension have an increased risk if they become even mildly dehydrated.''Chronic ''alcohol'' use and ''drug abuse'' are also risk factors for developing symptoms of orthostatic hypotension.' "
What causes orthostatic hypotension?,"'Orthostatic hypotension has many potential causes, some affecting only one part of the system that supplies blood to the brain, and others affecting two or three.''Loss of fluid within the blood vessels is the most common reason to develop the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. The fluid may be water or blood depending upon the cause.''A ''vasovagal episode'' is a condition that may occur when a stimulus causes excess activation of the parasympathetic system, slowing the heart rate and dilating blood vessels. Symptoms of lightheadedness or fainting then occur due to the lowering of blood pressure and decrease in blood flow to the brain. The stimulus may be pain from an injury such as a ''broken bone'', or there may be a psychologic trigger, such as a medical student watching a first operation. The vagus nerve that causes this response may also in some cases be triggered by urinating (micturition syncope) or by pushing hard to have a bowel movement.''Patients with ''diabetes'' may develop ''peripheral neuropathy'' that can affect nerves of the autonomic nervous system, and as a result, may develop orthostatic hypotension. As well, patients with poorly-controlled ''diabetes'' have the potential of becoming dehydrated.''Some patients may develop post-prandial lightheadedness, meaning that symptoms occur after a heavy meal. In this case, the body dilates blood vessels to the stomach and intestine to help with ''digestion'', leaving less blood available to flow to the brain.'""Addison's Disease""', or ''adrenal insufficiency'', may also be associated with the inability of the body to compensate for position change.''There are a variety of reasons that ''heart disease'' may cause orthostatic hypotension. Abnormalities of the electrical conduction system including heart rates that are too slow or too fast may cause changes in blood pressure. Patients with heart valve disorders, ''heart failure'', and ''heart attack'' may all experience orthostatic hypotension.''Disorders of the nervous system may also cause orthostatic hypotension. Examples include ''Parkinsonism'', ''amyloidosis'', and Shy-Drager Syndrome (or multiple system atrophy).''Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome'' describes the feeling of lightheadedness, ''nausea'', ''fatigue'', and weakness associated with an elevated heart rate (greater than 120 beats per minute) that begins within 10 minutes of a heads-up tilt table test. It is often seen in younger females between the ages of 12 and 50, and there may be a relationship with ''chronic fatigue syndrome''.'   Dehydration occurs when fluid intake cannot match the amount of fluid lost by the body. Vomiting, 
 diarrhea, fever, and heat-related illnesses (for example, heat exhaustion or 
 heat stroke) are common reasons a person loses a significant amount of fluid. Diuretics or water pills used to control high blood pressure are also another cause of a decreased amount of fluid in the body. Blood loss and other causes of anemia decrease the number of red blood cells that carry oxygen in the bloodstream, and this may lead to the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. The bleeding may arise from one large event or may occur slowly over a period of time. With slow bleeding, the body may be able to compensate, replacing the lost volume of red blood cells with water in the bloodstream. However, after a while the loss of oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood will cause symptoms to develop. In addition to lightheadedness, there may be weakness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Medications that affect the autonomic nervous system may also cause orthostatic hypotension.  Beta blocker medications such as metoprolol (Inderal) block the beta-adrenergic receptors in the body, preventing the heart from speeding up, preventing the heart from contracting as forcefully, and dilating blood vessels. All three of these effects affect the ability of the body to react to position changes. Aside from high blood pressure and heart disease, these medications are also used for headache control and anxiety prevention. sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis) dilate blood vessels, and this class of medication may cause orthostatic hypotension. The effect can be magnified if taken with nitrates, medications used to treat angina [for example, nitroglycerin (Nitrostat, Nitroquick, Nitrolingual, Nitro-Dur, Minitran, Nitro-Bid and others), isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur, Ismo, Monoket)], alcohol, or narcotic pain medications. Other medications used for high blood pressure control may be a potential cause of orthostatic hypotension, even if taken as prescribed. Orthostatic hypotension is a side effect of many psychiatric medications, including tricyclic antidepressants [amitriptyline (Endep, Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl), phenothiazines (Thorazine, Mellaril, Compazine), and MAO inhibitors (Nardil, Parnate)"
When should I call the doctor for orthostatic hypotension?,"'Feeling faint or lightheaded is not normal. While a rare episode that can be explained by circumstances, such as working or exercising in the heat, may be ignored, more frequent occurrences should be investigated. ''If a person passes out and is unconscious, even for a short period of time, is never normal and medical care should be accessed.' "
How is orthostatic hypotension diagnosed?,"'The key to the diagnosis is a good history and physical examination. The health care practitioner will want to know the circumstances that are associated with the symptoms of lightheadedness or passing out, since the patient is unlikely to have taken their blood pressure and checked their pulse rate in the midst of the episode.''The symptoms tend to be transient and resolve quickly. Should there be concern that the vital signs will change with position, the health care practitioner will take the blood pressure in both lying and standing positions and look for changes. It is advisable to pump up the cuff first, then have the patient stand, and then begin to release the pressure.''According to the American Academy of Neurology, the formal diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension requires a 20mm drop in systolic blood pressure or a 10mm drop in diastolic blood pressure within three minutes of standing. Often there is an associated increase in the heart rate, especially if dehydration or bleeding is the cause (if the patient is taking a beta blocker, the heart rate may not be able to respond with an increase).''Blood tests may be ordered to look for the underlying cause. These may include a red blood cell count (''CBC'') to access for anemia or bleeding. ''Electrolytes'' may be checked, especially if there has been a history of fluid loss through ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'', since sodium and potassium abnormalities may be an issue. Kidney function may be assessed.''If the physical examination reveals concern about the heart, an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') may be done to evaluate electrical conduction and heart rhythm. An ''echocardiogram'' or ''ultrasound of the heart'' may be ordered to evaluate the heart valves and assess the function of the heart muscle. A ''stress'' test may be considered if there is concern about ''coronary artery disease''.''A heads-up tilt table test may be ordered if the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension continue to recur but it has been difficult to document abnormalities in blood pressure readings. During the test, the patient is strapped flat on a table, and as the table gradually is tilted to a 70 or 80 degree angle, continuous blood pressure and heart rate readings are taken. The patient may be left on the table for more than 10 minutes to look for the delayed changes seen in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.''For many patients, the diagnosis may be made based upon the history and physical examination, and no further testing may be needed.'  "
What is the treatment for orthostatic hypotension?,"'The treatment for orthostatic hypotension depends upon the underlying diagnosis. If the cause is dehydration, then fluid replacement will resolve the symptoms. If it is due to medication, then an adjustment of the dose or change in the type of medicine taken may be required.''Compression stockings may be considered to help prevent fluid from pooling in the legs when a person is sitting or lying down. This allows for more blood flow to be available to the brain when changes in position occur.''Medications may be of use, again depending upon the underlying cause of the orthostatic hypotension. For those who are otherwise healthy and have no specific illness that must be treated, increased salt and fluid intake may be recommended. ''Caffeine'' and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications for example, ''ibuprofen'' may also be suggested.''Some patients may be a candidate for ''fludrocortisone'' (''Florinef'') to increase the volume of fluid in the blood vessels. Fludrocortisone is an adrenergic (adrenaline-mimicking) drug, which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. This medication does have significant side effects, including lowering magnesium and potassium levels in the blood, ''headache'', swelling, and ''weight gain''.' "
What are the complications of orthostatic hypotension?,"'Falling is the most important complication of orthostatic hypotension. Most often, the symptoms are transient and self- limiting, giving the patient a chance to sit down, but when the drop in blood pressure causes syncope (fainting) or near syncope, it is the ''trauma'' that is sustained in the fall that causes the most damage.' "
How can orthostatic hypotension be prevented?,"'Since dehydration is the most common cause of orthostatic hypotension, it is important to minimize the risk by keeping adequately hydrated. This is especially important if an individual works or exercises in a hot environment. Fluid lost from vomiting, ''diarrhea'', and other illnesses that are associated with a ''fever'' should be replaced as best as possible.''Patients taking new medications that may affect the autonomic nervous system should be aware of the potential for orthostatic hypotension and report any symptoms to their health care practitioner.' "
What is hypothermia?,"""Hypothermia is defined as a body temperature (core, or internal body temperature) of less than about 95 F (35 C). Usually, hypothermia occurs when the body's temperature regulation is overwhelmed by a ""'cold'' environment. However, in the medical and lay literature there are essentially two major classifications, ''accidental hypothermia'' and ''intentional hypothermia''.''Accidental hypothermia usually occurs from an exposure to cold that results in lowering the body temperature.''Intentional hypothermia is body temperature lowering induced usually for a medical procedure.''This article will focus on accidental hypothermia. Hypothermia is a medical emergency that, when quickly and appropriately treated, people can recover with little or no consequences.''Body temperature, when discussing hypothermia, is usually termed ""core"" temperature. This temperature is the temperature measured inside the body. It\'s a measurement that is most accurately done by a rectal thermometer, a rectal probe thermometer that has a constant temperature readout or by a bladder or esophageal temperature device. Temperatures taken by other methods may not adequately measure core temperature.'  "
What are the risk factors for hypothermia?,"'The highest risk factor for hypothermia is losing body heat due to exposure to cold weather or partial or complete immersion in cold water. Examples of include:''Other risk factors for hypothermia include:'""Some medical diseases or conditions may decrease the body's ability to regulate its internal temperature, for example:"" Not dressing appropriately for cold weather Walking on a partially frozen body of water (rivers, lakes, ponds, etc.) The young and elderly because their bodies do not have the ability to regulate body temperature efficiently People with mental illness People with alcohol or drug problems Some medications Diabetes Spinal cord injuries Burns Hypothyroidism Parkinson's disease Malnutrition"
What body parts are more susceptible to hypothermia?,"'The body parts most susceptible to injury in patients with hypothermia are those that may suffer from poor circulation or often have the least protection from the cold environment (''feet'"", hands, nose and ears). These extremities usually cool faster than the body's core. The internal organ most susceptible to hypothermia is the ""'heart'' (dysrhythmias).' "
What causes hypothermia?,"""The cause of hypothermia is the inability of the body's temperature regulation system to keep the body's core temperature between 35.6 C and 37.5 C (96.08 F and 99.5 F), so any body temperature below about 35.6 C (96.08 F) is considered hypothermic by many doctors.""'The body regulates the core temperature by either:'   generating heat cooling, or heat conservation. Heat conservation can be accomplished by peripheral vasoconstriction and by behavior; heat production is done by shivering and by increasing levels of thyroxine and epinephrine."
What are the signs and symptoms of hypothermia?,"'The signs and ''symptoms of hypothermia'' vary depending upon how severe the hypothermia becomes. In general, there is a sequence of symptoms that can be roughly graded as mild, moderate or severe (not all doctors agree with grading or fixed temperatures). However, the following is a list of symptoms that may occur as hypothermia progresses from mild to severe (temperatures are approximate and some symptoms may overlap).''Mild ''hypothermia symptoms'' (core temperature 32 C to 35 C (90 F to 95 F) are:''Moderate hypothermia'' (core temperature 28 C to 32 C (82 F to 90 F) are:''Severe hypothermia'' (core temperature below 28 C (82 F) are:'   Shivering Fatigue Increased respiratory rate Hunger Nausea Mild confusion Some difficulty with speech and coordination Increasing difficulty with all the symptoms (for example, inability to do simple tasks, slurred speech) Shivering stops Extreme confusion (for example, removing clothing or extreme risk-taking behavior) A decline in consciousness A weak and/or irregular pulse Slow and shallow breathing Coma that can result in death"
What are the symptoms of hypothermia in infants and children?,"'Newborns, infants, and young children are more likely to develop hypothermia because they have a larger surface area compared to body weight so they can lose body heat faster than older children and adults. WHO suggests slightly different temperature values for hypothermia levels in infants:''There may be some variation in these temperature values by some researchers, but these temperature levels can serve as guidelines in assessing hypothermia levels in infants and young children.''Since infants and young children either cannot or will not communicate with adults about hypothermia, parents, caregivers, and medical personnel rely on other clues or symptoms of hypothermia, which include:''Some infants and children may experience chronic hypothermia and show symptoms of:''Children and ''teens'' that can communicate have symptoms like those described for adults, but may occasionally have a combination of symptoms of those of a child or adult.' Cold stress or mild hypothermia: 36.0 C to 36.4 C (96.8 F - 97.5 F) Moderate hypothermia: 32.0 C to 35.9 C (89.6 F to 96.6 F) Severe hypothermia: <32 C (89.6 F) An accurate axillary (armpit) or rectal temperature below 36.4 C (97.5 F) A weak cry Low energy level Lethargic Reddish and cold skin Cool feeling of extremities and abdomen Poor feeding Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) Hypoxia (low levels of blood oxygen) or apneic (absence of breathing) episodes Heart arrhythmias weight loss, no weight gains, or failure to thrive."
Can a person experience hypothermia indoors?,"'Yes, a person can become hypothermic indoors; however, the symptoms may develop slowly or not seem as obvious to family, friends, or even health care individuals unless a core body temperature is measured.''Individuals at risk for hypothermia indoors are the elderly or young living in unheated homes in cold temperatures, or living in an over-air-conditioned home.' "
When should I call my doctor for hypothermia?,"'Any person that is at risk for hypothermia (see previous section on risk factors) and has had exposure to cold weather or cold water immersion, and exhibits any symptoms of hypothermia should be seen in the emergency department. Individuals exhibiting intense shivering, numbness, clumsiness, confusion and/or ''amnesia'' after exposure to cold should be seen immediately.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose hypothermia?,"""For many people, hypothermia is diagnosed by the patient's history and physical exam; especially pertinent is the patient's core temperature. As previously stated, any core temperature below 95 F or 35 C for an adult is considered to be hypothermic (for an infant, consider 36.4 C or 97.5 F).""'Most individuals with hypothermia are considered to have a medical emergency so that diagnosis and treatment begins simultaneously. Some patients can develop bradycardia and show ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'') abnormalities.' "
What is the treatment for hypothermia?,"'For severe cases of hypothermia, treatment begins immediately in the field by careful handling of the patient to avoid developing ventricular ''fibrillation'' or any other cardiac dysrhythmia that hypothermic patients are prone to develop. Place the patient in an environment that is warm; remove all wet clothing and replace it with dry towels and blankets or sleeping ''bags''. Simultaneously, be aware that the patient may have suffered other problems, like ''trauma'' and these problems may also need immediate attention (respiratory and/or cardiac failure).'""External rewarming can begin prior to hospital arrival with warm packs (warm water bottles, warm chemical packs) placed on the person's armpits, groin, and abdomen. Be sure the warm packs (about 105.8 F or 41 C) are not hot to avoid skin ""'burns''. Do not attempt to warm extremities by rubbing them.''Core temperatures should be measured by a rectal, bladder, or esophageal thermometer. Do not use tympanic or skin thermometers. Hypothermic induced dysrhythmias have been treated with bretylium, but this drug may not be available as it is no longer being manufactured.'""After warming has begun with dry coverings, most guidelines recommend using warm humidified oxygen and heated intravenous saline (heated to about 113 F or 45 C) as additional treatments. In severe cases of hypothermia others also suggest instilling warm fluid into the patient's bladder. Thoracic lavage (flushing the thoracic [chest] region with warm water) with isotonic saline (pre-warmed to about 105.8 F or 41 C) has also been done.""'Patients with mild to moderate hypothermia (95 F to 89.9 F or 35 C to 32.16 C) and no other injuries or problems require less drastic methods to rewarm. Patients whose body temperature normalizes by gradually rewarming in a warm, dry room with towels and blankets, usually do not need admission to the hospital. However, those with more severe hypothermia may need to be observed in the hospital.''Ideally, treatment will allow the body to return to its normal temperature. At normal temperature, the symptoms of hypothermia should gradually disappear. Consequently, the saying in most emergency departments that treat hypothermic patients is that ""the hypothermic patient is not dead until they are warm and dead.""'  "
Home remedies for hypothermia,"'The best home remedy for hypothermia is simply to avoid those conditions that result in hypothermia such as not dressing appropriately for cold weather.''However, if you find someone that is possibly suffering from hypothermia the first priority is to check for breathing, a pulse and if necessary, begin cardiac resuscitation. If possible, help should be called (911). The next step is to rewarm the person as described above. If the person develops symptoms of moderate to severe hypothermia, they should be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible.' "
What items should I have to be prepared to prevent hypothermia?,"'Preventing hypothermia is possible.'  Before participating in any cold-weather activities make sure that you are in good physical condition and have the right clothing and nutrition before engaging in such activities. If you go camping or hiking in cold weather, travel with a partner for safety and let people know where you are going. Multiple layers of clothing that are loose fitting and tend to remain dry are the best for cold-weather activities. Note that rain and wind can markedly increase the rate of heat loss from the body, so if these conditions develop, you need to be prepared to stay warm and dry. For individuals that have a higher risk for hypothermia (elderly and young children, for example), during wintry weather, keep homes heated to about 21.1 C (70 F), especially in the bedrooms at night."
What is the prognosis for hypothermia?,"'If the person with mild hypothermia is treated quickly, does not require hospitalization, and has little or no residual problems, the prognosis is usually very good. However, some patients may suffer from extremity damage due to ''frostbite'' while others may be more prone to develop hypothermia in the future. People that have concurrent problems (''alcoholism'', psychiatric problems, advanced age or are homeless) have a worse prognosis, and their mortality rate is higher.' "
What is hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism (overactive thyroid) is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces an abnormally low amount of thyroid hormone. Many disorders result in hypothyroidism, which may directly or indirectly involve the thyroid gland. Because thyroid hormone affects growth, development, and many cellular processes, inadequate thyroid hormone has widespread consequences for the body.'  "
What should I do if I have signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'If you have signs or symptoms the same or similar to hypothyroidism, discuss them (for example, weight gain, ''constipation'', or ''fatigue'') with your doctor or other healthcare professional. A simple blood test is the first step in the diagnosis. If you need treatment for hypothyroidism, let your doctor know of any concerns or questions you have about the available treatment, including home or natural remedies.' "
What is subclinical hypothyroidism?,"'Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to a state in which people do not have symptoms of hypothyroidism and have a normal amount of thyroid hormone in their blood. The only abnormality is an increased TSH on the person’s blood work. This implies that the pituitary gland is working extra hard to maintain a normal circulating thyroid hormone level and that the thyroid gland requires extra stimulation by the pituitary to produce adequate hormones. Most people with subclinical hypothyroidism can expect the disease to progress to obvious hypothyroidism, in which symptoms and signs occur.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'The symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. They are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to ''aging''. People with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. The symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. Common symptoms and signs include:'

What  are the symptoms of severe hypothyroidism? What is myxedema coma?,"'As hypothyroidism becomes more severe, signs and symptoms may include puffiness around the eyes, the ''heart'' rate slows, body temperature drops, and ''heart failure''.' Severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). In a person with severe hypothyroidism, a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness, surgery, stress, or traumatic injury. Myxedema coma requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection."
Where is the thyroid located? What are thyroid hormones?,"""Thyroid hormones are produced by the thyroid gland. This gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below Adam's apple. The gland wraps around the windpipe (trachea) and has a shape that is similar to a butterfly - formed by two wings (lobes) and attached by a middle part (isthmus).""'The thyroid gland uses iodine (mostly from foods in the ''diet'' like seafood, bread, and salt) to produce thyroid hormones. The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine or T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which account for 99% and 1% of thyroid hormones present in the blood respectively. However, the hormone with the most biological activity is T3. Once released from the thyroid gland into the blood, a large amount of T4 is converted as needed into T3 - the active hormone that affects the metabolism of cells.' "
What causes hypothyroidism?,"""Hypothyroidism is a very common condition. Approximately 3% to 4% of the U.S. population has some form of hypothyroidism. This type of thyroid disorder is more common in women than in men, and its incidence increases with age. Examples of common causes of hypothyroidism in adults include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune form of overactive thyroid, lymphocytic thyroiditis, which may occur after ""'hyperthyroidism'' (underactive thyroid), thyroid destruction from radioactive iodine or surgery, pituitary or hypothalamic disease, medications, and severe iodine deficiency.''The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an ''inherited'"" condition called Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This condition is named after Dr. Hakaru Hashimoto who first described it in 1912. In this condition, the thyroid gland is usually enlarged (goiter) and has a decreased ability to make thyroid hormones. Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system inappropriately attacks the thyroid tissue. In part, this condition is believed to have a genetic basis. This means that the tendency toward developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis can run in families. Hashimoto's is 5 to 10 times more common in women than in men.""'In areas of the world where there is an iodine deficiency in the diet, severe hypothyroidism occurs in about 5% to 15% of the population. Examples of these areas include Zaire, Ecuador, India, and Chile. Severe iodine deficiency occurs in remote mountain areas such as the Andes and the Himalayas. Since the addition of iodine to table salt and to bread, iodine deficiency is rare in the United States.''Thyroiditis refers to inflammation of the thyroid gland. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is a condition in which the inflammation is caused by a particular type of white blood cell known as a lymphocyte. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is particularly common after ''pregnancy'', and can affect up to 8% of women after they deliver their baby. In this type of thyroid disorder there usually is a hyperthyroid phase (in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormone leak out of the inflamed gland), which is followed by a hypothyroid phase that can last for up to six months. In the majority women with lymphocytic thyroiditis, the thyroid eventually returns to its normal function, but there is a possibility that the thyroid will remain underactive.''People who have been treated for hyperthyroidism (underactive thyroid) like '""Graves' disease""', and received radioactive iodine may be left with little or no functioning thyroid tissue after treatment. The likelihood of this depends on a number of factors including the dose of iodine given, along with the size and the activity of the thyroid gland. If there is no significant activity of the thyroid gland six months after the radioactive iodine treatment it usually means that the thyroid gland no longer functioning adequately. The result is hypothyroidism. Similarly, removal of the thyroid gland during surgery cause hypothyroidism.''If for some reason the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus are unable to signal the thyroid and instruct it to produce thyroid hormones, it may cause decreased T4 and T3 blood levels, even if the thyroid gland itself is normal. If pituitary disease causes this defect, the condition is called ""secondary hypothyroidism."" If the defect is due to hypothalamic disease, it is called ""tertiary hypothyroidism.""''A pituitary injury may result after brain surgery or the blood supply to the brain has decreased. When the pituitary gland is injured, hypothyroidism results in low TSH blood levels because the thyroid gland is no longer stimulated by the pituitary TSH. Usually, hypothyroidism from pituitary gland injury occurs in together with other hormone deficiencies, since the pituitary regulates other processes such as growth, reproduction, and adrenal function.''Medications that are used to treat an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) may cause hypothyroidism. These ''drugs'' include ''methimazole'' (''Tapazole'') and ''propylthiouracil'' (PTU). The psychiatric medication, ''lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid''), is also known to alter thyroid function and cause hypothyroidism. Interestingly, drugs containing a large amount of iodine such as ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), ''potassium iodide'"" (SSKI, Pima), and Lugol's solution can cause changes in thyroid function, which may result in low blood levels of thyroid hormone.""  "
Are there special foods or diets for hypothyroidism?,"'There is no special diet required for people with hypothyroidism. In the US, routine supplementation of salt, flour, and other foods with iodine has decreased the rates of hypothyroidism caused by an iodine deficiency.' "
What tests diagnose hypothyroidism?,"   People with symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry, flaky skin may have hypothyroidism. A blood test can confirm the diagnosis. ""Secondary"" or ""tertiary"" hypothyroidism occurs when the decrease in thyroid hormone is due to a defect of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. A special test, known as the TRH test, can help distinguish if the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. This test requires an injection of the TRH hormone and is performed by a doctor that treats thyroid conditions (endocrinologist or hormone specialist). Blood work confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, but does not identify the cause. A combination of the patient's clinical history, antibody screening, and a thyroid scan can help diagnose the underlying thyroid problem more clearly. An MRI of the brain and other tests may be ordered if the cause is thought to be from pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems."
What is the treatment for hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism can be easily treated with thyroid hormone replacement. The preferred treatment for most people with an underactive thyroid is ''levothyroxine sodium'' (''Levoxyl'', ''Synthroid''). This is a more stable form of thyroid hormone and requires once a day dosing.''Liothyronine sodium'' (''Cytomel'') also may be prescribed to treat hypothyroidism under certain conditions.''With the exception of certain conditions, the treatment of hypothyroidism requires life-long therapy. However, over treating hypothyroidism with excessive thyroid medication is potentially harmful and can cause problems with heart ''palpitations'' and ''blood pressure'' control, and contribute to ''osteoporosis''.'  "
What happens if hypothyroidism goes untreated? What are the complications?,"'Untreated hypothyroidism can cause complications, for example, ''enlarged heart'' (''cardiomyopathy''), worsening ''congestive heart failure'', an accumulation of fluid around the ''lungs'' (''pleural effusion'').' "
What is hypothyroidism?," Thyroid disease is particularly common in women of child-bearing age. As a result, it is no surprise that thyroid disease may complicate the course of pregnancy. Frequency varies among different populations and different countries. While pregnancy itself is a natural state and not a ""disease,"" thyroid disorders during pregnancy affect both the mother and baby. This article focuses specifically on hypothyroidism and pregnancy. After a general description of normal and abnormal thyroid function, recent data on long term consequences in children of mothers who had hypothyroidism during pregnancy will be reviewed."
What is the thyroid gland? Where is it located and what does it do?,"""The thyroid is a gland weighing about 15 grams (about half an ounce) that is located in the front of the neck just below the Adam's apple (cricoid cartilage). The thyroid gland is responsible for the production of the body's thyroid hormone. The thyroid responds to hormonal signals from the brain to maintain a constant level of thyroid hormone. The hormone signals are sent by specialized areas of the brain (hypothalamus and ""'pituitary gland''), eventually sending thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) that stimulates thyroid hormone production by the thyroid gland.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of thyroid disease? What causes it?,"'Disease of the thyroid gland is extremely common. In some conditions, the thyroid may produce too much hormone. In other conditions, the thyroid may be damaged or destroyed and little, if any, thyroid hormone is produced. The main thyroid hormone is called thyroxine, or T4.''Symptoms of thyroid problems vary depending on whether there is too much or too little T4 present in the blood. With an excess of T4 (''hyperthyroidism''), people may complain of feeling:''Some people may have symptoms like:''If T4 levels are low (hypothyroidism) as a result of decreased production by the thyroid gland, patients often experience ''fatigue'', lethargy, and ''weight gain''. ''Constipation'' is common and many patients report feeling excessively ''cold''.'   Restless Emotionally hyper Hot and sweaty Tremors Trouble concentrating Weight loss Frequent bowel movements Diarrhea"
How is hypothyroidism treated during pregnancy?,"'In many respects, the treatment of hypothyroidism in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant women.. A synthetic form of T4 is given to replace the missing hormone. The medication dose is regularly adjusted to maintain a steady blood level of thyroid hormone within the normal range, and the requirements for this hormone may increase during pregnancy. Therefore, it is routine practice to monitor the blood level of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) during pregnancy. For more information, please read the article on hypothyroidism.' "
Does hypothyroidism during pregnancy hurt the fetus?,"'Doctors have known for years of a link between mothers with untreated severe hypothyroidism during pregnancy and developmental delay in their children after birth. This was particularly seen in mothers who came from ''iodine'"" deficient areas of the country (iodine is necessary to produce thyroid hormone and is now a common component of the salt in our foods), and was observed in mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease, such as Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis''. Some studies have suggested that mild untreated hypothyroidism may also affect the baby’s brain development, but this relationship is less clear.' "
How early does the mother's thyroid hormone affect the unborn baby?,"""Before birth a baby is entirely dependent on the mother for thyroid hormone until the baby's own thyroid gland can start to function. This usually does not occur until about 12 weeks of gestation (the end of the ""'first trimester'' of pregnancy). Thus, hypothyroidism of the mother may play a role early on, before many women realize they are pregnant! In fact, the babies of mothers who were hypothyroid in the first part of pregnancy, then adequately treated, exhibited slower motor development than the babies of normal mothers. However, during the latter part of pregnancy, severe, untreated hypothyroidism in the mother can also have adverse effects on the baby, as pointed out by the research described above. These children are more likely to have intellectual impairment.' "
How can you avoid the complications of hypothyroidism in pregnancy?,"'A number of medical associations and organizations have made recommendations on screening for thyroid disease. Some of the recommendations are:'""The management of each woman's situation is considered individually after consultation with her physician. The benefits of treatment extend not only to pregnant women with hypothyroidism, but also to their children."" All women who are planning a pregnancy should be considered for screening of thyroid disease. All pregnant women with a goiter (enlarged thyroid), high blood levels of thyroid antibodies, a family history of thyroid disease, or symptoms of hypothyroidism should be tested for hypothyroidism. In women who are borderline, or sub-clinical, hypothyroid (for example, not in the laboratory range for true hypothyroidism, but within the low normal range) and who also have positive antibodies (which may indicate an ongoing autoimmune thyroid destruction), therapy with low dose thyroid hormone at the onset of pregnancy may be beneficial. There is some evidence that the antibodies that may contribute to hypothyroidism can play a role in pregnancy. Some data suggest that selenium supplementation may be of benefit in women with high antibody levels at the time of preconception. This should be reviewed with your doctor. Women who are on thyroid hormone replacement before pregnancy should also be tested to make certain that their levels are appropriate. During pregnancy, the medication dose required may increase by up to 50%. Increases may be required as early as in the first trimester. Dosing is dynamic during pregnancy and should be closely monitored by regular blood testing. As the pregnancy progresses, many women require higher doses of hormone replacement. The dosage of thyroid hormone replacement during and after pregnancy should be carefully monitored using the blood thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value. The laboratory ranges for normal TSH are quite wide In women with hypothyroidism before conception, most go back to their pre-pregnancy dose of thyroid hormone within a few weeks to months after delivery."
What is hypoxia and hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)?,"   Hypoxia is a condition or state in which the supply of oxygen is insufficient for normal life functions. Hypoxemia is a condition or state in which there is a low arterial oxygen supply. Hypoxia is sometimes used to describe both states (hypoxia and hypoxemia). Within the body, hypoxemia can lead to hypoxia (tissue hypoxia) in various tissues and organs with the most severe being cerebral hypoxia that can rapidly result in brain damage or death. Conversely, if a person experiences environmental hypoxia (low or absent oxygen in the environment from high altitudes or drowning, for example), the person can develop hypoxemia."
What causes hypoxia and hypoxemia?,"'The causes of both environmental and tissue hypoxia often result in the intermediate state of hypoxemia; thus the causes of any type of hypoxia are also potential causes of hypoxemia. Some of the many causes of hypoxia are the following:' Chemical or gas poisoning (for example cyanide, carbon monoxide) Low or absent concentration of oxygen (for example, high altitudes reached without supplemental oxygen as seen in mountain climbing, and aviation, drowning, or fires) Lung problems, for example:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)EmphysemaBronchitisPulmonary edemaLung cancerPneumoniaSleep apnea (nocturnal hypoxemia)PneumothoraxAsthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Emphysema Bronchitis Pulmonary edema Lung cancer Pneumonia Sleep apnea (nocturnal hypoxemia) Pneumothorax Asthma Any medications that reduce or stop the effort for breathing (for example, fentanyl and other narcotics) Heart problems (for example, severe bradycardia, and ventricular fibrillation) Anemia and/or conditions that destroy red blood cells Reducing or stopping arterial blood flow to any tissue for organ (for example, arterial blockage by a clot or by injury like a gunshot)"
What are the symptoms of hypoxia and hypoxemia?,"'The symptoms of hypoxia and/or hypoxemia may be acute or chronic.''Acute symptoms'' can come on rapidly and usually consist of:''Other ''associated symptoms'' that can occur in both acute and chronic hypoxia and hypoxemia include:''The affected individual may be mildly confused initially and appear weak or may experience rapid changes in the color of his or her skin ranging from blue to cherry red (depending on the causes).''Severe symptoms seen with cerebral hypoxia include:''The symptoms in pediatric patients can be similar to the above and may include the following:'   shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and a fast heart rate. Wheezing Sweating Coughing confusion, inability to communicate, coma, and may result in death. Lethargy Irritableness Anxiousness Inattentiveness Sitting up and leaning forward to improve diaphragmatic breathing Children with epiglottitis and airway restriction may drool and mainly breathe by mouth."
How is hypoxia and/or hypoxemia diagnosed?,"'In general, an individual patient’s hypoxemia is usually diagnosed by oxygen monitors placed on fingers or ears (pulse oximeter) and/or by determining the oxygen level in a blood gas sample (a sample of blood taken from an artery). Normal readings are about 94% to 99% oxygen saturation levels; generally, oxygen is supplied if the level is about 92% or below.''Other tests may be ordered to determine if other potential problems such as carbon monoxide poisoning are responsible for the hypoxia.''Pulmonary function tests may also be ordered along with other studies to help determine the cause of unexplained low oxygen saturation.' "
What is the treatment for hypoxia and/or hypoxemia?,"'The treatment for hypoxia and/or hypoxemia is to give additional oxygen to the patient and into the body (blood) as quickly as possible, especially if cerebral hypoxia is suspected, or to treat the underlying cause of the hypoxia.''Many patients will respond to additional oxygen supplied by a nasal cannula. The quicker the oxygen level reaches normal, the better the prognosis is for the patient. However, the timing is very important, because cerebral hypoxia can occur within a few minutes and, in many patients, may not be reversible.''Some patients may be treated in a hyperbaric chamber that increases oxygen concentrations in the blood (used in carbon monoxide poisoning), while others may require mechanical ventilation (''intubation'') with oxygen supplied at higher than normal atmospheric concentrations.''Others, such as mountain climbers or airline passengers, may need only additional oxygen provided by oxygen masks until they reach lower levels where oxygen concentrations are closer to the normal levels (about 21%) in the atmosphere.''However, care must be used when giving oxygen, as it can be toxic to tissues if it is used excessively (hyperoxia). Hyperoxia may cause:''Hyperoxia may occur in patients undergoing hyperbaric therapy or in long-term ICU patients.'  vertigo, behavior changes, and other central nervous system changes such as seizures and/or tissue damage that may result in pneumonia, eye changes like cataracts, and other organ pathology."
Can hypoxia and/or hypoxemia be prevented?,"'Hypoxia and/or hypoxemia may be prevented in some individuals by avoiding circumstances that reduce the oxygen concentration in the environment or by providing oxygen via nasal cannula or oxygen masks before hypoxia and/or hypoxemia develop. This can be done by recognizing those individuals who have a tendency to develop hypoxia and/or hypoxemia and provide them with oxygen if they develop any of the early symptoms. Moreover, there are medications that can provide ''prevention'' and/or relief from hypoxia/hypoxemia symptoms that are due to certain medical conditions like ''asthma''.' "
What is hypoxia and hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)?,"   Hypoxia is a condition or state in which the supply of oxygen is insufficient for normal life functions. Hypoxemia is a condition or state in which there is a low arterial oxygen supply. Hypoxia is sometimes used to describe both states (hypoxia and hypoxemia). Within the body, hypoxemia can lead to hypoxia (tissue hypoxia) in various tissues and organs with the most severe being cerebral hypoxia that can rapidly result in brain damage or death. Conversely, if a person experiences environmental hypoxia (low or absent oxygen in the environment from high altitudes or drowning, for example), the person can develop hypoxemia."
What causes hypoxia and hypoxemia?,"'The causes of both environmental and tissue hypoxia often result in the intermediate state of hypoxemia; thus the causes of any type of hypoxia are also potential causes of hypoxemia. Some of the many causes of hypoxia are the following:' Chemical or gas poisoning (for example cyanide, carbon monoxide) Low or absent concentration of oxygen (for example, high altitudes reached without supplemental oxygen as seen in mountain climbing, and aviation, drowning, or fires) Lung problems, for example:Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)EmphysemaBronchitisPulmonary edemaLung cancerPneumoniaSleep apnea (nocturnal hypoxemia)PneumothoraxAsthma Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Emphysema Bronchitis Pulmonary edema Lung cancer Pneumonia Sleep apnea (nocturnal hypoxemia) Pneumothorax Asthma Any medications that reduce or stop the effort for breathing (for example, fentanyl and other narcotics) Heart problems (for example, severe bradycardia, and ventricular fibrillation) Anemia and/or conditions that destroy red blood cells Reducing or stopping arterial blood flow to any tissue for organ (for example, arterial blockage by a clot or by injury like a gunshot)"
What are the symptoms of hypoxia and hypoxemia?,"'The symptoms of hypoxia and/or hypoxemia may be acute or chronic.''Acute symptoms'' can come on rapidly and usually consist of:''Other ''associated symptoms'' that can occur in both acute and chronic hypoxia and hypoxemia include:''The affected individual may be mildly confused initially and appear weak or may experience rapid changes in the color of his or her skin ranging from blue to cherry red (depending on the causes).''Severe symptoms seen with cerebral hypoxia include:''The symptoms in pediatric patients can be similar to the above and may include the following:'   shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and a fast heart rate. Wheezing Sweating Coughing confusion, inability to communicate, coma, and may result in death. Lethargy Irritableness Anxiousness Inattentiveness Sitting up and leaning forward to improve diaphragmatic breathing Children with epiglottitis and airway restriction may drool and mainly breathe by mouth."
How is hypoxia and/or hypoxemia diagnosed?,"'In general, an individual patient’s hypoxemia is usually diagnosed by oxygen monitors placed on fingers or ears (pulse oximeter) and/or by determining the oxygen level in a blood gas sample (a sample of blood taken from an artery). Normal readings are about 94% to 99% oxygen saturation levels; generally, oxygen is supplied if the level is about 92% or below.''Other tests may be ordered to determine if other potential problems such as carbon monoxide poisoning are responsible for the hypoxia.''Pulmonary function tests may also be ordered along with other studies to help determine the cause of unexplained low oxygen saturation.'

What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A ''hysterectomy'' is the removal of the uterus (womb). For certain conditions, the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are also removed. ''The most common medical reasons for doing a hysterectomy include benign ''fibroid'' tumors of the uterus, abnormal uterine bleeding, ''endometriosis'', genital prolapse, and chronic ''pelvic pain''. Some women choose to have a hysterectomy for other reasons, including other types of tumors. ''Uterine cancer'' is an uncommon, but important reason for doing a hysterectomy.' "
What is a laparoscope?,"'A laparoscope is a viewing tube through which structures within the abdomen and pelvis can be seen. A small surgical incision (cut) is made in the abdominal wall to permit the laparoscope to enter the abdomen or pelvis. Additional tubes can also be pushed through the same or other small incisions allowing the introduction of probes and other instruments. In this way, surgical procedures can be performed without the need for a large surgical incision.' "
What is laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH)?,"'Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a surgical procedure using a laparoscope to guide the removal of the uterus and/or Fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina (birth canal). (A different procedure, called a laparoscopic hysterectomy, is entirely performed using a laparoscope and other instruments inserted through tiny abdominal incisions, and the uterus, Fallopian tubes etc. are removed in tiny portions.) ''Not all hysterectomies can or should be done by LAVH. In certain situations, a laparoscopic hysterectomy (see above) may be sufficient. In other cases, an abdominal hysterectomy or a vaginal hysterectomy (without ''laparoscopy'') is indicated. The surgeon determines the appropriate procedure for each individual case based upon the reason for the hysterectomy and the medical history and condition of the patient.' "
How do doctors perform an LAVH?,"'During LAVH, several small incisions (''cuts'') are made in the abdominal wall through which slender metal tubes known as ""trocars"" are inserted to provide passage for a laparoscope and other microsurgical tools. The laparoscope acts as a tiny telescope. A camera attached to it provides a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen for viewing.''In the course of LAVH, the uterus is detached from the ligaments that attach it to other structures in the pelvis using the laparoscopic tools. If the Fallopian tubes and ovaries are to be removed, they are also detached from their ligaments and blood supply. The organs and tissue are then removed through an incision made in the vagina.' "
What are the disadvantages of LAVH?,"'LAVH can be a longer operation and more expensive than a vaginal hysterectomy and, under certain circumstances, it can be more dangerous.' "
What are the advantages of LAVH?,"'The incisions in an LAVH are relatively small. The ''scars'', ''pain'', and recovery time from LAVH are usually significantly less than with an abdominal hysterectomy, which requires both a vaginal incision and a 4-6 inch (10-15 cm) long incision in the abdomen). LAVH is similarly less physically traumatic than a routine vaginal hysterectomy. When LAVH is feasible, it has distinct advantages. It can allow for a vaginal hysterectomy in patients who have not had children.' "
Introduction to birth control,"'\tThe terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' include: ''contraception'', ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from an abundance of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of ''birth control'' available\xa0today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.''\tIn simple terms, all methods of ''birth control'"" are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'\tUnfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Permanent methods of contraception (surgical sterilization),"'\tSterilization is considered a permanent method of contraception. In certain cases, sterilization can be reversed, but the success of this procedure is not guaranteed. For this reason, sterilization is meant for men and women who do not intend to have children in the future.' "
Vasectomy,"'\tA ''vasectomy'' is a form of sterilization of a man. A vasectomy ensures that no sperm will exit from his penis when he ejaculates during sexual intercourse.''\tA vasectomy is usually performed by either a ''urologist'' or a general surgeon. Under local anesthesia, the vas deferens (tubes that carry sperm from the testicles into the urethra, also known as ductus deferens) from each testicle is severed. The open ends are then closed off. A vasectomy can be performed in the clinic and involves making two small openings in the scrotum. After a vasectomy, the man may feel tenderness or ''bruising'' around the incision site.''\tA vasectomy does not interfere with the ability of a man to have an erection or the quantity of his ejaculation fluid. After a man has a vasectomy, another second form of birth control should be used until his ejaculate fluid is found to be free from sperm. This usually takes 10 to 20 ejaculations.''\tVasectomy reversals are possible, but they tend to be expensive and are not guaranteed to be effective. A vasectomy should be considered a permanent form of birth control.''\tA vasectomy does not protect a man or his partner from sexually transmitted infections.' "
Tubal ligation (tubes tied),"'Tubal ligation is also known as ""having one\'s tubes tied,"" or having a ""tubal."" Tubal ligation is for women, and like a vasectomy, should be considered a permanent form of birth control.'""A tubal ligation is performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia and can be performed as an outpatient procedure. The surgeon or OB/GYN\xa0uses one of several procedures in order to access a woman's Fallopian tubes (which run from the top part of her uterus to each ovary). A ""'laparoscopy'' is a procedure in which a small incision is made\xa0just below the navel. A viewing tube (scope) can then be inserted through this incision to view and reach the Fallopian tubes. A minilaparotomy is a small incision in the lower abdomen is sometimes used for tubal ligation as an alternative to a laparoscopic procedure.'""Once the doctor has access to a woman's Fallopian tubes, they are closed off by using a clip, tying and cutting, or cauterizing (burning) the tubes. The procedure takes anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes.""'Side effects of a tubal ligation may include infection, bleeding (hemorrhage), and any effects or complications associated with being under general anesthesia.'""A tubal ligation blocks a woman's Fallopian tubes. As a result of the procedure, about 1 inch of each tube is blocked off. An egg can no longer travel down the tube to the uterus, and sperm cannot make contact with the egg. Tubal ligation should have no effect on a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' or hormone production.'""A woman's tubal ligation can be surgically reversed, usually with more success than in men who have had a vasectomy. About 14% of women in the US seek information about a reversal of tubal ligation.""'A tubal ligation does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or ''STDs''). It is also not an absolute method of birth control because a small percentage of women become ''pregnant'' after a tubal ligation. Pregnancy after tubal ligation is uncommon (occurring in less than 2% of women), and the risk of pregnancy appears to be related to age (younger women have more post-tubal ligation ''pregnancies'') as well as the type of procedure used for the sterilization.' "
Hysteroscopic sterilization,"""\tHysteroscopic sterilization is a nonsurgical form of permanent birth control in which a physician inserts a 4-centimeter (1.6 inch) long metal coil into each one of a woman's two Fallopian tubes via a scope passed through the cervix into the uterus (hysteroscope), and from there into the openings of the Fallopian tubes. Over the next few months, tissue grows over the coil to form a plug that prevents fertilized eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus.""""\tThe procedure takes about 30 minutes, can be done in a doctor's office, and usually requires only a local anesthetic. During a 3-month period after the coils are inserted, women must use other forms of birth control until their physician verifies by an imaging test known as a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) that the Fallopian tubes are completely blocked.""'\tLike tubal ligation, this form of sterilization is permanent (not reversible) and is designed as an alternative to surgical sterilization which requires general anesthesia and an incision. About 6% of women who have the procedure develop side effects, mainly due to improper placement of the coils.''\tThis form of sterilization, like other methods of surgical sterilization, does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Hysterectomy,"'A ''hysterectomy'"" is the surgical removal of a woman's uterus and, depending on her overall health status and the reason for the operation, perhaps her ovaries as well. For practical purposes, no woman who has had a hysterectomy can become pregnant; it is an irreversible method of birth control and absolute sterilization. A laparoscopic hysterectomy (removal of the uterus through tiny incisions in the abdomen through which instruments are placed) is possible when there are no complications and no suspicion of ""'cancer''. A supra-cervical hysterectomy, which spares the cervix and removes the upper part of the uterus, is also a common surgical technique.''If a woman has other chronic medical problems that may be helped by a hysterectomy (such as abnormally excessive menstrual bleeding, ''uterine fibroids'', ''uterine growths''), than this may be an appropriate procedure for her to consider. Otherwise, contraception should be considered a secondary benefit and not a sole reason to have the procedure.' "
What is hysteroscopy? ,"'Hysteroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure for viewing the inside of the uterus. Hysteroscopy is performed by inserting a visualizing scope through the vagina and into the cervical opening. Hysteroscopy allows visualization of the inside of the uterus, including the openings to the Fallopian tubes, as well as direct examination of the cervix, cervical canal, and vagina.'  "
Why is a hysteroscopy done?,"'Hysteroscopy can be performed for both diagnosis or also for treatment (therapeutic). Hysteroscopy is one of several procedures that your doctor may recommend to evaluate or treat abnormalities of the uterus or cervix. Since hysteroscopy examines the lining and interior of the uterus, it is not suitable for evaluating problems within the muscular wall or on the outer surface of the uterus.''Hysteroscopy may be recommended as one step in the evaluation of a number of gynecological problems, including:''Hysteroscopy can be used to help pinpoint the location of abnormalities in the uterine lining for sampling and biopsy, and it can be used to perform surgical sterilization.' Abnormal vaginal bleeding Retained placenta or products of conception after birth or miscarriage Congenital (inborn) anatomical abnormalities of the female genital tract Scarring, or adhesions, from previous uterine surgery or instrumentation such as dilation and curettage (D&C) Polyps or fibroid tumors inside the cervical canal or inside the uterine cavity"
How is the hysteroscopy performed? What are the types?,"'There are a number of different sizes and types of hysteroscopes available, depending upon the type of procedure that is required. Some hysteroscopes are combined with instruments that allow surgical manipulation and removal of tissues if necessary.'""Hysteroscopy may be performed in an outpatient surgery center or a hospital operating room, or a physician's office. A number of different methods for anesthesia and ""'pain'' control may be used, depending upon the individual situation. Sometimes, hysteroscopy using narrow-diameter hysteroscopes that do not require dilation of the cervical opening can be performed without anesthesia. In other cases, a local anesthetic can be applied topically or given by injection. In certain cases, a regional or general anesthetic may be recommended.''A vaginal speculum is often inserted prior to the procedure to facilitate insertion of the hysteroscope through the uterine cavity. Depending upon the exact type of hysteroscope that is used, dilation of the cervical opening with surgical instruments may be necessary. After insertion of the hysteroscope, fluid or ''gas'' is injected to distend the uterine cavity and allow for better visualization.''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications are generally recommended after the procedure to control any ''pain'' or cramping that may occur.''Hysteroscopy should not be performed if a woman is ''pregnant'' or has an active pelvic infection. It is also not recommended if a woman has known uterine or ''cervical cancer''. Certain conditions (abnormal position of the uterus, obstruction of the cervical canal or uterine cavity, scarring or narrowing of the cervical opening) may make hysteroscopy more difficult or impossible to perform in certain cases.' "
"What are the side effects, risks, and complications of hysteroscopy?","'Women should expect to experience light ''vaginal bleeding'' and some cramping after the hysteroscopy procedure. Some cramping may be felt during the procedure, depending upon the type of anesthesia.''Complications of hysteroscopy are rare and include perforation of the uterus, bleeding, infection, damage to the urinary or digestive tract, and medical complications resulting from reactions to ''drugs'' or anesthetic agents. Accidental perforation of the uterus is the most common complication and occurs in 0.1% of diagnostic hysteroscopy procedures and 1% of therapeutic (surgical) hysteroscopies. Other rare complications are fluid overload or ''gas'' embolism (when gas bubbles enter the bloodstream) from the distending medium used in the procedure.' "
What is the outlook after hysteroscopy?,"'The outlook depends upon the individual case and the reason for hysteroscopy. Many minor surgical procedures can be successfully performed using hysteroscopy. Complications are rare, and most women recover with only minor post-procedure cramping and bleeding.' "
