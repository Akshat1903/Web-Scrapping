Questions,Answer
"What are e-cigarettes? What is ""vaping""?","'E-cigarettes (e cigarettes, or vaping) are smokable, refillable or replaceable cartridges or containers that hold liquid that contains ''nicotine'', solvents, and chemical flavors. When a person inhales (""vaping""), they are putting a negative pressure on the device that triggers a battery to heat the liquid solution, which is then atomized into inhalable vapor.'  "
Do e-cigarettes contain nicotine?,"'Depending upon the cartridge, it may contain no ''nicotine'' or up to about 16 mg nicotine. One container or cartridge has enough fluid for about 250 ""puffs."" However, nicotine concentrations and fluid volumes plus the compounds in the fluids can vary, depending upon who makes the e- ''cigarette''.' "
Can you vape marijuana?,"'Vape cartridge fluid is also similar in ''marijuana'' e-cigarettes, except the fluid contains THC (the main active ingredient in cannabis) and sometimes other cannabis components. The market for marijuana e-cigarettes has grown rapidly as more U.S. states legalize the substance for medicinal and recreational use.' "
How do e-cigarettes work?,"'An e-''cigarette'' has three main parts 1) a rechargeable battery, 2) a vaporization chamber/atomizer, and 3) a liquid cartridge usually containing nicotine or THC, chemical flavoring, and other compounds. When you inhale on the tip of the e-cigarette, a valve opens to allow some fluid into the vaporization chamber/atomizer. The battery then heats the liquid, which vaporizes it, and then it is inhaled into the ''lungs''.' "
What are the side effects of  e-cigarettes? Are they safe?,"'It is not known how safe or how unsafe these products are. September of 2019 saw a ''rash'' of nearly 500 cases of respiratory illness linked to vaping throughout the US, according to the CDC, which reports symptoms to include ''cough'', ''chest pain'', ''nausea'', ''shortness of breath'', ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea''. As of September, six had died of ""vaping lung disease."" The exact component of vape fluid had not been identified as of that time, but illness seems to affect users of both nicotine and cannabis e-cigarettes.''“While this investigation is ongoing, consider not using e-cigarette products,” the CDC advised as of Sept. 6. They further state, regardless of the ongoing investigation, youth, young adults and women who are\xa0 ''pregnant'' should not use e-cigarette products.''Nicotine is considered to be very addictive, and that seems to be a cause for concern. Low doses may cause ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', and eye irritation. High doses of nicotine may cause tachycardia, ''high blood pressure'', ''seizures'', ''coma'', and death. Moreover, the FDA reported detecting ethylene glycol in some of the e-cigarettes and ''cancer''-causing substances called nitrosamines in others. In addition, some e-cigarettes have caught fire and/or exploded because of faulty batteries or malfunctioning battery chargers.''It took several decades to determine problems associated with tobacco use. It is likely that it will also take some time and study to determine how safe (or unsafe) e-cigarettes are. Experts claim that in order to stop ''cigarette smoking'', it is probably better to use studied material such as nicotine gum, nicotine patches and/or counseling than to use e-cigarettes. They also suggest people do not start ''smoking'' e-cigarettes for fun or for quitting any tobacco products.''The CDC published a report about the number of calls to poison centers involving e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine. The proportion of calls to poison centers increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 41.7% as of February 2014. The bulk of these calls are related to small children that open the liquid nicotine containers. The liquid nicotine containers are not childproof; they appeal to young children because of the candy and fruit flavors. They can cause ''vomiting'', and eye irritation.' "
Do e-cigarettes expel secondhand smoke?,"'Not much is known about the ''secondhand'' ""vapor"" that is expelled from users, including levels of nicotine, nitrosamines, and other components that are yet to be identified. Nevertheless, many people would prefer not to be in a restaurant or other place of business and be exposed to vapors that contain addictive nicotine, and possibly other products that have a potential for harm.'  "
"Do e-cigarettes cause ""popcorn lung?""","'“''Popcorn lung''” (''bronchiolitis obliterans'') is a lung disease that results in scarring and narrowing of the airways in the ''lungs''. The disease was linked to a chemical, diacetyl that provides flavor to microwave popcorn. This compound and others that are similar, when inhaled, causes high risk for this disease.''Researchers found that 92% of e-cigarettes studied had at least one of three different compounds known to cause popcorn lung. Although long-term studies are absent, the American Lung Association considers e-cigarettes to be a dangerous risk factor for popcorn lung.' "
Are e-cigarettes addictive?,"'There is some concern that e-cigarettes are being marketed to attract younger non-''smokers'' with ""flavored"" liquids such as bubblegum, piña colada, vanilla, and others. Because most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, it is possible that people can become addicted to them. Some doctors are concerned that if they become addicted to the nicotine in the e-cigarettes, it may be an easy step up to ''smoking'' tobacco, which is associated with so very many health consequences.' "
Do e-cigarettes help with quitting smoking?,"'Although e-cigarettes have been touted as a way for tobacco ''smokers'' to kick their cigarette habit, e-cigarettes in one study were only about as effective as nicotine patches.\xa0The FDA does not recognize e-cigarettes to be a method to augment quitting ''smoking''. However, there are 7 FDA-approved safe ''smoking'' quit aids available (patches, gum, mints, etc.), and has warned electronic cigarette maker Juul to stop saying vaping is safer than ''smoking''.'  "
How many people use e-cigarettes?,"'Since this product was first developed in 2004 in China as a tobacco cessation device, it has grown rapidly so that in 2013 the estimated market is about 1.5 billion as compared to 100 billion for tobacco sales. However, the sale of this product is growing rapidly worldwide. The CDC suggests that as more people utilize e-cigarettes, the dramatic increase in nicotine poisoning in children will continue if nothing is done to prevent young children gaining access to nicotine-containing liquids. According to the FDA, over two million middle and high school students were e-cigarette users in 2016.' "
Are e-cigarettes regulated by the FDA?,"'As of 2016, the FDA now regulates the manufacture, import, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of ENDS (electronic delivery systems, such as e-cigarettes), including components and parts of ENDS (not including accessories. The American Lung Association is urging the FDA to require that diacetyl and other harmful chemicals be removed from e-cigarettes (removal from the fluid accessories).' "
What are E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria?,"'Escherichia coli'' ''(''E. coli'') is a bacterium (Enterobacteriaceae family) that can survive in an environment with or without air (facultative anaerobe) and, depending on the environment, may or may not produce thin hair-like structures (flagella or pili) that allow the bacteria to move and to attach to human cells. These bacteria commonly live in the ''intestines'' of people and in warm blood animals worldwide and do not cause problems. Some ''strains'' (serotypes) cause diseases that range from ''urinary tract infections'' to life-threatening, bloody ''diarrhea''. It is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium.''E coli'' O157:H7 is the predominant serotype of ''E. coli'' that form one group of ''EEC''. This EEC group is termed enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'' or EHEC. Unfortunately, other terms in the medical literature describe this group (VTEC or Vero toxin-producing ''E. coli'' and ''STEC'' or Shiga toxin-producing ''E. coli''). Research suggests that only a small number of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 are needed to cause infection (ingestion of about 10–100 organisms) instead of the thousands to millions needed for infections by other ''E. coli'' serotypes. Infection is aided by adhesive receptors (pili or fimbriae) that attach the bacteria to human intestinal cells. Most of the problems caused by the bacteria are due to two Shiga toxins, termed Stx 1 and Stx 2 termed Vero toxins. (Toxins are chemicals that are produced by the bacterium and damage human cells.) These toxins, for example, (for example, </i>E. coli Shiga</i> toxin), are almost identical to toxins produced by another related bacterium, ''Shigella'' ''spp.'' that causes dysentery (''Shigellosis''), and can damage and kill intestinal cells. Shigellosis occasionally causes anemia, damage to platelets, and death of cells in other organs, especially the kidneys.''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is a major health problem. It is estimated to cause infection in more than 70,000 individuals a year in the United States, and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is responsible for the majority of ''E. coli'' outbreaks in the U.S. It has been reported to cause both large as well as small outbreaks.''E. coli'' 0157:H7 diarrheal illness was first recognized when CDC personnel isolated ''E. coli'' O157:H7 from patients in two separate outbreaks in Oregon and Michigan. The illnesses were associated with eating hamburgers at the ''restaurants'' of a national chain; some patients experienced hemorrhagic ''colitis'' (inflammation and bleeding of the colon). Thus, hemorrhagic colitis due to ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is commonly referred to as ''hamburger disease''. Since that time, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 also has been associated with contaminated water, foods, and unpasteurized or incorrectly pasteurized (heat-treated) dairy products.''In 2015 an outbreak of ''E. coli 0157:H7'' infection occurred in Montana from Costco contaminated rotisserie chicken salad, and resulted in recalls of products from Taylor farms containing celery. In 2017, an outbreak of this strain was linked to Healthy Brand ''Soy'' nut Butter. The CDC found 32 people from 12 states infected with the bacteria, 12 of which required hospitalization, and nine developed ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'' (HUS). Twenty-six of the 32 patients infected were younger than 18. The product was recalled, and fortunately, there were no deaths.''A widespread outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 began in April 2018. The source was traced by the CDC to Romaine lettuce and other lettuce produce and distributed from Yuma, Arizona. The bacterial strain is aggressive. Of the 121 identified patients, 1 death and 52 hospitalizations along with 14 people who developed HUS have occurred. The 121 patients have been found in 25 states with the most diagnosed in California and Pennsylvania. The CDC strongly recommends that if you cannot identify where your Romaine lettuce originated, you should not eat it. Restaurants and retailers are advised not to serve or sell romaine lettuce from the Yuma Arizona growing region.' "
8 early signs and symptoms  of E. coli 0157:H7 infection,'The early or initial symptoms of ''E. coli'' O157:H7 infections usually appear about three to five (though occasionally in as few as one day or as many as 10 days) after a person ingests the bacteria; the symptoms include:''These symptoms can be seen in infected children and adults.'   Nausea Vomiting Stomach cramps (abdominal pain) Diarrhea that often is bloody Fever of about 100 F to 101 F (37.7 C to 38.3 C) Malaise Loss of appetite Mild dehydration
17 later symptoms of signs and symptoms of E. coli infections,"'The majority of people (especially normal adults) that are infected resolve the infection without antibiotics (self-limiting) in about five to seven days. However, some people (about 10% of people infected and especially children under the age of 5 and the elderly) develop more severe signs and symptoms, and these people usually require hospitalization and aggressive treatment. These patients develop the usual early symptoms listed above, but do not resolve the infection. They develop symptoms that last longer (at least a week) and, if not treated promptly, the infection may lead to disability or death.''Later or late symptoms of ''E. coli'' infections may include:''These symptoms or complications fall into three main categories:''For most people (about 90%), the infection clears and a good outcome or and prognosis is good. However, if any of the previously mentioned complications occur, the prognosis may range from good to poor. The variable prognosis depends on the severity of the complication, the rapidity of diagnosis and treatment, the response of the individual to adequate treatment and the overall health of the individual. Children and the elderly are at higher risk for adverse outcomes.''Strains of ''E. coli 0157:H7'' mainly are known to produce gastrointestinal symptoms, Only a few reports of such strains causing ''E. coli'' ''urinary tract infections''.' Hemorrhagic diarrhea (large amounts of blood in the stools) Anemia Pale skin color Severe dehydration Little or no urine output Severe abdominal pains Easy bruising Nosebleeds Fatigue Shortness of breath Generalized swelling Kidney failure Jaundice Excessive bleeding Seizures Mental changes Death Hemorrhagic (bloody) diarrhea: Hemorrhagic (bloody) diarrhea is defined as an increased amount of blood in the diarrheal stool, which does not seem to decrease over time, and usually is accompanied by severe abdominal pain. Although this may resolve within a week, some individuals can develop anemia and dehydration that can cause death. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS): Hemolytic-uremic syndrome symptoms of pallor (due to anemia), fever, bruising or nosebleeds (due to destruction of blood platelets that are needed for blood to clot), fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling of the body, especially hands and feet, jaundice, and reduced flow of urine may be seen. HUS symptoms usually develop about 7 to 10 days after the initial diarrhea begins. HUS is the most common cause of kidney failure in children; children under 10 years old are the most likely to develop HUS. Iproduces toxins that damage the kidneys and destroys platelets that can lead to kidney failure, excessive bleeding, seizures, or death. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by the loss of platelets; however, the symptoms that occur are somewhat different and occur mainly in the elderly. The symptoms are fever, weakness, easy, rapid or ""spontaneous"" bruising, kidney failure, and mental impairment that can rapidly progress to organ failures and death. Until the 1980's, TTP was considered a fatal disease, but since the 1980's, plasma exchange and infusion techniques have reduced the death rate in TTP patients to about 10%."
How do you  get an E. coli 0157:H7 infection (how is it spread)?,"'Most commonly, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 comes from eating raw or undercooked ground beef (for example, hamburger) or from drinking raw milk. The bacteria are found in animal feces, particularly cattle feces, and contact with the feces can lead to contamination of many types of food and fluids. In 2010, the FDA recalled several productions of beef, including beef placed in pet food. Less commonly, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 can be transmitted from one person to another, usually by direct physical contact. However, a major outbreak in 2018 came from contaminated Romaine lettuce grown in Yuma, Arizona.' "
How long can E. coli bacteria live outside of the body?,"'Studies suggest that ''E. coli'' survival outside of the body of humans and animals depends on environmental variables such as moisture, nutrients like iron and temperature. Some studies suggest ''E. coli'' survival times may vary from about 12 hours to 2 months or more.' "
Is E. coli 0157:H7 contagious?,"'E. coli'' 0857:H7 is an infection, and is contagious. It can be spread from person to person by contamination with feces of food or water then is eaten.'  "
What causes E. coli infection?,"'There are over 700 strains (serotypes) of ''E. coli''. Most of the strains of ''E. coli'' are normal inhabitants of the small intestine and colon and do not cause disease in the intestines. (They are non-pathogenic.) Nevertheless, non-pathogenic ''E. coli'' can cause disease if they spread outside of the intestines, for example, into the urinary tract (where they cause bladder or kidney infections), or into the blood stream (''sepsis'' or ''E. coli'' in the blood). Other ''E. coli'' strains (enterovirulent ''E. coli'' strains or EEC) cause ""poisoning"" or diarrhea even though they usually remain within the intestine by producing toxins or intestinal inflammation. Four to six groups ''E. coli'' serotypes comprise EEC.. (Some researchers combine groups.) Their names are derived from descriptions of the characteristics that separate them from the other groups.''E. coli'' were first isolated by T. Escherich in 1885 and were named after him. The over 700 serotypes are identified by small antigenic changes in their surface ""O"" antigens (lipopolysaccharides or molecules on the bacterial surface of gram-negative bacteria), for example ''E. coli'' 0157 or ''E. coli'' 055. These serotypes are identified by immunological tests using antibodies to the antigens. ""H"" protein antigens (different types of flagella that make the bacteria motile) further distinguish ''E. coli'' strains. Consequently, a particular ''E. coli'' strain can be identified as H, followed by a number, and this identifier is added to the ""0"" name; for example, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7. Although this name designation seems complicated, researchers and clinicians use these antigenic identifiers to track specific ''E. coli'' strains that cause outbreaks of disease.''As discussed previously, ''E. coli'' strain, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is notorious for its potential to cause complicated disease in humans; the remainder of this article will focus on this ''E. coli'' strain. However, it is important to remember other types of ''E. coli'' produce similar if not identical problems and they too, will be addressed in this article; the newest serotype causing problems is ''E. coli'' 0145.' EHEC (enterohemorrhagic E. coli) ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli) EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli) EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli) EAEC (enteroadherent E. coli) EAggEC (enteroaggregative E. coli)"
Is there a test for E. coli?,"'The diagnosis of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 infection begins with an accurate history, physical exam, and an analysis of a sample of stool from the patient. A presumptive diagnosis is frequently made if the patient has symptoms of bloody diarrhea and a history of being exposed to persons, foods, or liquids known to be a source of an ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 outbreak.''Because other disease-causing bacteria (for example, '' Shigella'' and '' ''Salmonella'') can give patients similar initial symptoms and test negative on bacterial screeing tests like the oxidase test; a definite diagnosis is based on culture of ''E. coli'"" 0157:H7 from the patient's sample of stool on special culturing plates that then are tested with antiserum (antibodies) that react only with ""'E. coli'' O157H7. Not all clinics or hospitals have the diagnostic antiserum, so the testing may take a few days.''In addition to taking a stool sample test, in 2009 the CDC recommended that all patients being screened for community-acquired diarrheal infections have their stool samples analyzed with antisera for Shiga toxins, toxins produced by ''E. coli 0157:H7'', and a few other bacteria, for example, ''E. coli 0104:H4''.''This approach may result in faster diagnosis of I infections. Urine samples can be tested, but ''E. coli 0157:H7'' infrequently causes urinar tract infections (''UTIs'') Its renal involvement is mainly due to toxins produced by the bacteria. This approach may result in faster diagnosis of ''E. coli 0157:H7 ''infections. Urine samples can be tested, but ''E. coli 0157:H7'' infrequently causes UTIs.''Blood tests such as a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), and blood levels of ''electrolytes'', platelets, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and ''creatinine'' (blood tests that measure function of the kidney) are performed periodically to look for the development of HUS or TTP.' "
What is the treatment for E. coli 0157:H7?,"'Treatment for ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 depends on the severity of the disease.''Patients, especially healthy adults, often require no treatment for ''E. coli'' O157:H7 since many infections are self-limited. Moreover, for the acute diarrheal illness, antibiotics have not proven useful. In fact, some studies have shown that antibiotics may increase the chances of developing HUS (up to 17-fold). This effect is thought to occur because the antibiotic damages the bacteria, causing them to release even more toxin. Most investigators suggest antibiotic use only if a patient is septic, that is, there is evidence that the bacterium has spread to parts of the body other than the intestine. In addition, use of ''atropine'' and diphenoxylate (''Lomotil''), ''drugs'' that are commonly used to control diarrhea, also may increase symptoms and trigger complications.''In summary, mild infections are treated with the following:''Treatment for severe symptoms of infection and its complications may include:'   Rest Fluid intake Rarely, antibiotics Treatment in an Intensive care unit (ICU) Intravenous fluids and electrolytes Red blood cell transfusion(s) Platelet transfusion Plasma exchange Kidney dialysis Medications for high blood pressure Medications for seizures Kidney transplantation"
What are the complications of infection with E. coli 0157:H7?,"'Although these conditions have been presented in the symptoms section, they are presented here again because they are actual complications that can occur after the initial disease begins. Patients without these complications usually have excellent outcomes (a good prognosis). Individuals who develop the following complications have outcomes that range from good to poor, depending on their overall health and how quickly they are diagnosed, treated, and respond to treatment. Meningitis and/or ''pneumonia'' are potential complications that may occur when individuals with a weakened immune system (when ''pregnant'', in infants or elderly) become infected.''The incubation period between exposure to EHEC bacteria, including ''E. coli'' O157:H7, and the onset of symptoms is usually three to four days but may be longer in some individuals. Symptoms of EHEC infection include severe ''abdominal pain'' and abdominal tenderness, which often is associated with bloody diarrhea. Curiously, there often is little or no fever. The diarrhea typically lasts for six to eight days. Dehydration and blood loss can lead to death in some patients if not corrected early.''Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most worrisome complication of EHEC infection, especially in children, because it is a serious and potentially fatal complication. ""Hemolytic"" refers to the breakup of ''red blood cells'', which leads to anemia. There also is destruction of platelets, which leads to low blood levels of platelets (''thrombocytopenia''), which in turn promotes abnormal bleeding. ""Uremic"" refers to failure of the kidneys. In addition, problems in the brain with seizures and ''coma'' may occur.''Hemolytic-uremic syndrome most commonly affects children under the ages of 10 years and is the most common cause of acute kidney failure in infants and young children. It occurs in about 6% to 10% of hemorrhagic colitis caused by E coli 0157:H7 and usually occurs approximately 7 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea. Early intervention usually results in better outcomes.''Persons infected with ''E. coli'' 0157:H7, particularly the elderly, can develop a syndrome similar to HUS called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or TTP with clotting of blood within small blood vessels; anemia due to fragmentation of red blood cells; and a shortage of platelets (thrombocytopenia) that results in ''easy bruising'', neurologic abnormalities, impaired kidney function, and fever. TTP is a serious consequence of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 infection that requires early and aggressive treatment since it results in death in about 10% of all patients who develop it.' "
How can E. coli be prevented ?,"'The CDC recommends the following to prevent infections from ''E. coli'' 0157:H7.''Moreover, many researchers suggest that hamburgers ordered in a restaurant should be cooked through and completely so that no pink hamburger meat is visible inside. This cooking reduces the chance that ''E. coli'' serotypes will remain alive in the meat.''All other foods involved in a recall should be put in the trash. No one should attempt to cook the recalled material and eat it, including hamburger meat.''Because ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is routinely found in the intestines of cattle, companies have developed a vaccine to reduce the number of these bacteria in cattle. The first vaccine for cattle was FDA approved in 2009. There is no vaccine available for ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 in humans.' Wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Wash hands after contact with animals or their environments (at farms, petting zoos, fairs, even your own pets in your own yard or house). Cook meats thoroughly. Ground beef and meat that has been needle-tenderized should be cooked to a temperature of at least 160 F (70 C). It's best to use a thermometer, as color is not a very reliable indicator of ""doneness."" Avoid raw milk, unpasteurized dairy products, and unpasteurized juices (like fresh apple cider). Avoid swallowing water when swimming or playing in lakes, ponds, streams, swimming pools, and backyard ""kiddie"" pools due to E. coli in the water. Prevent cross contamination in food preparation areas by thoroughly washing hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils after they touch raw meat."
What kind of doctor(s) treat E. coli 0157:H7 infections?,"'People who develop only acute symptoms that are mild usually do not require a physician because the illness resolves spontaneously. However, for some children, a pediatrician may be notified and/or may want to see the child. If a person develops severe symptoms, a team of doctors that may include a nephrologist (kidney specialist), a critical care specialist (pediatric or adult), a hematologist, a ''pulmonologist'', cardiologist, and an infectious disease specialist or even a ''kidney transplant'' surgeon may be needed. Hospitalization also may be necessary.' "
"Other enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains (for example, 0145, 026:H11, 0104:H4 and 0121)","'Most enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'' (EHEC or STEC) infections were thought to be variants of strain 0157:H7, but this has been shown not to be the situation. Apparently, many other serotypes such as 0145 can acquire the plasmid that is responsible for the synthesis of Shiga (Vero) toxin, and thus can produce disease almost identical to disease symptoms produced by 0157:H7 in infected humans. Just like the 0157:H7 strains, these other ''E. coli'' serotypes can cause outbreaks of bloody diarrhea with hemorrhagic colitis that can become complicated by hemolytic ''uremia''.''In 2011, an outbreak in Germany began due to ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 due to contamination of sprouts. The outbreak was extensive as over 4000 people in 16 countries became infected. There is some consideration that this strain (and others) may be grouped together as a new EEC group in the future.''Although EHEC strains can be transmitted person to person and on or in contaminated food, the source for the 0145 strain outbreak that has occurred in several states (California, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee) was never identified by the CDC.''Another strain, ''E. coli'' 0121, caused an outbreak in 19 states in the U.S.; it was traced to contaminated Farm Rich brand of frozen foods.''These serotypes produce essentially the same type of disease as 0157:H7 and are diagnosed and treated in the same manner. Consequently, the previous sections use 0157:H7 as the prototypic EHEC so for all practical purposes, it represents all the EHEC serotypes.' "

The variable prognosis depends on the severity of the complication, the rapidity of diagnosis and treatment, the response of the individual to adequate treatment and the overall health of the individual. Children and the elderly are at higher risk for adverse outcomes.''Strains of ''E. coli 0157:H7'' mainly are known to produce gastrointestinal symptoms, Only a few reports of such strains causing ''E. coli'' ''urinary tract infections''.' Hemorrhagic diarrhea (large amounts of blood in the stools) Anemia Pale skin color Severe dehydration Little or no urine output Severe abdominal pains Easy bruising Nosebleeds Fatigue Shortness of breath Generalized swelling Kidney failure Jaundice Excessive bleeding Seizures Mental changes Death Hemorrhagic (bloody) diarrhea: Hemorrhagic (bloody) diarrhea is defined as an increased amount of blood in the diarrheal stool, which does not seem to decrease over time, and usually is accompanied by severe abdominal pain. Although this may resolve within a week, some individuals can develop anemia and dehydration that can cause death. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS): Hemolytic-uremic syndrome symptoms of pallor (due to anemia), fever, bruising or nosebleeds (due to destruction of blood platelets that are needed for blood to clot), fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling of the body, especially hands and feet, jaundice, and reduced flow of urine may be seen. HUS symptoms usually develop about 7 to 10 days after the initial diarrhea begins. HUS is the most common cause of kidney failure in children; children under 10 years old are the most likely to develop HUS. Iproduces toxins that damage the kidneys and destroys platelets that can lead to kidney failure, excessive bleeding, seizures, or death. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is caused by the loss of platelets; however, the symptoms that occur are somewhat different and occur mainly in the elderly. The symptoms are fever, weakness, easy, rapid or ""spontaneous"" bruising, kidney failure, and mental impairment that can rapidly progress to organ failures and death. Until the 1980's, TTP was considered a fatal disease, but since the 1980's, plasma exchange and infusion techniques have reduced the death rate in TTP patients to about 10%."
How do you  get an E. coli 0157:H7 infection (how is it spread)?,"'Most commonly, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 comes from eating raw or undercooked ground beef (for example, hamburger) or from drinking raw milk. The bacteria are found in animal feces, particularly cattle feces, and contact with the feces can lead to contamination of many types of food and fluids. In 2010, the FDA recalled several productions of beef, including beef placed in pet food. Less commonly, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 can be transmitted from one person to another, usually by direct physical contact. However, a major outbreak in 2018 came from contaminated Romaine lettuce grown in Yuma, Arizona.' "
How long can E. coli bacteria live outside of the body?,"'Studies suggest that ''E. coli'' survival outside of the body of humans and animals depends on environmental variables such as moisture, nutrients like iron and temperature. Some studies suggest ''E. coli'' survival times may vary from about 12 hours to 2 months or more.' "
Is E. coli 0157:H7 contagious?,"'E. coli'' 0857:H7 is an infection, and is contagious. It can be spread from person to person by contamination with feces of food or water then is eaten.'  "
What causes E. coli infection?,"'There are over 700 strains (serotypes) of ''E. coli''. Most of the strains of ''E. coli'' are normal inhabitants of the small intestine and colon and do not cause disease in the intestines. (They are non-pathogenic.) Nevertheless, non-pathogenic ''E. coli'' can cause disease if they spread outside of the intestines, for example, into the urinary tract (where they cause bladder or kidney infections), or into the blood stream (''sepsis'' or ''E. coli'' in the blood). Other ''E. coli'' strains (enterovirulent ''E. coli'' strains or EEC) cause ""poisoning"" or diarrhea even though they usually remain within the intestine by producing toxins or intestinal inflammation. Four to six groups ''E. coli'' serotypes comprise EEC.. (Some researchers combine groups.) Their names are derived from descriptions of the characteristics that separate them from the other groups.''E. coli'' were first isolated by T. Escherich in 1885 and were named after him. The over 700 serotypes are identified by small antigenic changes in their surface ""O"" antigens (lipopolysaccharides or molecules on the bacterial surface of gram-negative bacteria), for example ''E. coli'' 0157 or ''E. coli'' 055. These serotypes are identified by immunological tests using antibodies to the antigens. ""H"" protein antigens (different types of flagella that make the bacteria motile) further distinguish ''E. coli'' strains. Consequently, a particular ''E. coli'' strain can be identified as H, followed by a number, and this identifier is added to the ""0"" name; for example, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7. Although this name designation seems complicated, researchers and clinicians use these antigenic identifiers to track specific ''E. coli'' strains that cause outbreaks of disease.''As discussed previously, ''E. coli'' strain, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is notorious for its potential to cause complicated disease in humans; the remainder of this article will focus on this ''E. coli'' strain. However, it is important to remember other types of ''E. coli'' produce similar if not identical problems and they too, will be addressed in this article; the newest serotype causing problems is ''E. coli'' 0145.' EHEC (enterohemorrhagic E. coli) ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli) EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli) EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli) EAEC (enteroadherent E. coli) EAggEC (enteroaggregative E. coli)"
Is there a test for E. coli?,"'The diagnosis of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 infection begins with an accurate history, physical exam, and an analysis of a sample of stool from the patient. A presumptive diagnosis is frequently made if the patient has symptoms of bloody diarrhea and a history of being exposed to persons, foods, or liquids known to be a source of an ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 outbreak.''Because other disease-causing bacteria (for example, '' Shigella'' and '' ''Salmonella'') can give patients similar initial symptoms and test negative on bacterial screeing tests like the oxidase test; a definite diagnosis is based on culture of ''E. coli'"" 0157:H7 from the patient's sample of stool on special culturing plates that then are tested with antiserum (antibodies) that react only with ""'E. coli'' O157H7. Not all clinics or hospitals have the diagnostic antiserum, so the testing may take a few days.''In addition to taking a stool sample test, in 2009 the CDC recommended that all patients being screened for community-acquired diarrheal infections have their stool samples analyzed with antisera for Shiga toxins, toxins produced by ''E. coli 0157:H7'', and a few other bacteria, for example, ''E. coli 0104:H4''.''This approach may result in faster diagnosis of I infections. Urine samples can be tested, but ''E. coli 0157:H7'' infrequently causes urinar tract infections (''UTIs'') Its renal involvement is mainly due to toxins produced by the bacteria. This approach may result in faster diagnosis of ''E. coli 0157:H7 ''infections. Urine samples can be tested, but ''E. coli 0157:H7'' infrequently causes UTIs.''Blood tests such as a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC''), and blood levels of ''electrolytes'', platelets, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and ''creatinine'' (blood tests that measure function of the kidney) are performed periodically to look for the development of HUS or TTP.' "
What is the treatment for E. coli 0157:H7?,"'Treatment for ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 depends on the severity of the disease.''Patients, especially healthy adults, often require no treatment for ''E. coli'' O157:H7 since many infections are self-limited. Moreover, for the acute diarrheal illness, antibiotics have not proven useful. In fact, some studies have shown that antibiotics may increase the chances of developing HUS (up to 17-fold). This effect is thought to occur because the antibiotic damages the bacteria, causing them to release even more toxin. Most investigators suggest antibiotic use only if a patient is septic, that is, there is evidence that the bacterium has spread to parts of the body other than the intestine. In addition, use of ''atropine'' and diphenoxylate (''Lomotil''), ''drugs'' that are commonly used to control diarrhea, also may increase symptoms and trigger complications.''In summary, mild infections are treated with the following:''Treatment for severe symptoms of infection and its complications may include:'   Rest Fluid intake Rarely, antibiotics Treatment in an Intensive care unit (ICU) Intravenous fluids and electrolytes Red blood cell transfusion(s) Platelet transfusion Plasma exchange Kidney dialysis Medications for high blood pressure Medications for seizures Kidney transplantation"
What are the complications of infection with E. coli 0157:H7?,"'Although these conditions have been presented in the symptoms section, they are presented here again because they are actual complications that can occur after the initial disease begins. Patients without these complications usually have excellent outcomes (a good prognosis). Individuals who develop the following complications have outcomes that range from good to poor, depending on their overall health and how quickly they are diagnosed, treated, and respond to treatment. Meningitis and/or ''pneumonia'' are potential complications that may occur when individuals with a weakened immune system (when ''pregnant'', in infants or elderly) become infected.''The incubation period between exposure to EHEC bacteria, including ''E. coli'' O157:H7, and the onset of symptoms is usually three to four days but may be longer in some individuals. Symptoms of EHEC infection include severe ''abdominal pain'' and abdominal tenderness, which often is associated with bloody diarrhea. Curiously, there often is little or no fever. The diarrhea typically lasts for six to eight days. Dehydration and blood loss can lead to death in some patients if not corrected early.''Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most worrisome complication of EHEC infection, especially in children, because it is a serious and potentially fatal complication. ""Hemolytic"" refers to the breakup of ''red blood cells'', which leads to anemia. There also is destruction of platelets, which leads to low blood levels of platelets (''thrombocytopenia''), which in turn promotes abnormal bleeding. ""Uremic"" refers to failure of the kidneys. In addition, problems in the brain with seizures and ''coma'' may occur.''Hemolytic-uremic syndrome most commonly affects children under the ages of 10 years and is the most common cause of acute kidney failure in infants and young children. It occurs in about 6% to 10% of hemorrhagic colitis caused by E coli 0157:H7 and usually occurs approximately 7 to 10 days after the onset of diarrhea. Early intervention usually results in better outcomes.''Persons infected with ''E. coli'' 0157:H7, particularly the elderly, can develop a syndrome similar to HUS called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or TTP with clotting of blood within small blood vessels; anemia due to fragmentation of red blood cells; and a shortage of platelets (thrombocytopenia) that results in ''easy bruising'', neurologic abnormalities, impaired kidney function, and fever. TTP is a serious consequence of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 infection that requires early and aggressive treatment since it results in death in about 10% of all patients who develop it.' "
How can E. coli be prevented ?,"'The CDC recommends the following to prevent infections from ''E. coli'' 0157:H7.''Moreover, many researchers suggest that hamburgers ordered in a restaurant should be cooked through and completely so that no pink hamburger meat is visible inside. This cooking reduces the chance that ''E. coli'' serotypes will remain alive in the meat.''All other foods involved in a recall should be put in the trash. No one should attempt to cook the recalled material and eat it, including hamburger meat.''Because ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is routinely found in the intestines of cattle, companies have developed a vaccine to reduce the number of these bacteria in cattle. The first vaccine for cattle was FDA approved in 2009. There is no vaccine available for ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 in humans.' Wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Wash hands after contact with animals or their environments (at farms, petting zoos, fairs, even your own pets in your own yard or house). Cook meats thoroughly. Ground beef and meat that has been needle-tenderized should be cooked to a temperature of at least 160 F (70 C). It's best to use a thermometer, as color is not a very reliable indicator of ""doneness."" Avoid raw milk, unpasteurized dairy products, and unpasteurized juices (like fresh apple cider). Avoid swallowing water when swimming or playing in lakes, ponds, streams, swimming pools, and backyard ""kiddie"" pools due to E. coli in the water. Prevent cross contamination in food preparation areas by thoroughly washing hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils after they touch raw meat."
What kind of doctor(s) treat E. coli 0157:H7 infections?,"'People who develop only acute symptoms that are mild usually do not require a physician because the illness resolves spontaneously. However, for some children, a pediatrician may be notified and/or may want to see the child. If a person develops severe symptoms, a team of doctors that may include a nephrologist (kidney specialist), a critical care specialist (pediatric or adult), a hematologist, a ''pulmonologist'', cardiologist, and an infectious disease specialist or even a ''kidney transplant'' surgeon may be needed. Hospitalization also may be necessary.' "
"Other enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains (for example, 0145, 026:H11, 0104:H4 and 0121)","'Most enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'' (EHEC or STEC) infections were thought to be variants of strain 0157:H7, but this has been shown not to be the situation. Apparently, many other serotypes such as 0145 can acquire the plasmid that is responsible for the synthesis of Shiga (Vero) toxin, and thus can produce disease almost identical to disease symptoms produced by 0157:H7 in infected humans. Just like the 0157:H7 strains, these other ''E. coli'' serotypes can cause outbreaks of bloody diarrhea with hemorrhagic colitis that can become complicated by hemolytic ''uremia''.''In 2011, an outbreak in Germany began due to ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 due to contamination of sprouts. The outbreak was extensive as over 4000 people in 16 countries became infected. There is some consideration that this strain (and others) may be grouped together as a new EEC group in the future.''Although EHEC strains can be transmitted person to person and on or in contaminated food, the source for the 0145 strain outbreak that has occurred in several states (California, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee) was never identified by the CDC.''Another strain, ''E. coli'' 0121, caused an outbreak in 19 states in the U.S.; it was traced to contaminated Farm Rich brand of frozen foods.''These serotypes produce essentially the same type of disease as 0157:H7 and are diagnosed and treated in the same manner. Consequently, the previous sections use 0157:H7 as the prototypic EHEC so for all practical purposes, it represents all the EHEC serotypes.' "
What is endometrial ablation?,"'Endometrial ablation is the surgical destruction of the lining tissues of the uterus, known as the ''endometrium''. Endometrial ablation is one type of treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding.'  "
Why is endometrial ablation done?,"'Endometrial ablation is a treatment for abnormal bleeding of the uterus that is due to a benign (non-cancerous) condition. Endometrial ablation is not sufficient treatment when the cause of bleeding is ''cancer of the uterus'', since ''cancer'' cells may have grown into the deeper tissues of the uterus and cannot often be removed by the procedure.''Endometrial ablation is only performed on females who are not ''pregnant'' and do not plan to become pregnant in the future. It should not be performed if the woman has an active infection of the genital tract. This treatment is not a first-line therapy for heavy bleeding. It should only be considered when medical and hormonal therapies have not been sufficient to control the bleeding.' "
How is endometrial ablation performed?,"'Prior to the procedure, a woman needs to have an endometrial sampling (biopsy) performed to exclude the presence of ''cancer''. Imaging studies and/or direct visualization with a hysteroscope (a lighted viewing instrument that is inserted to visualize the inside of the uterus) are necessary to exclude the presence of uterine polyps or benign tumors (fibroids) beneath the lining tissues of the uterus. Polyps and fibroids are possible causes of heavy bleeding that can be simply removed without ablation of the entire ''endometrium''. Obviously, the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded, and intrauterine ''contraceptive'' devices (IUDs) must be removed prior to endometrial ablation.''Hormonal therapy may be given in the weeks prior to the procedure (particularly in younger women), in order to shrink the endometrium to an extent where ablation therapy has the greatest likelihood for success. The belief is the thinner the endometrium, the greater the chances for successful ablation.''To begin the procedure, the cervical opening is dilated to allow passage of the instruments into the uterine ''cavity''. Different procedures have been used and are all similarly effective for destroying the uterine lining tissue. These include laser beam, electricity, freezing, and heating.''The choice of procedure depends upon a number of factors, including''The type of anesthesia required depends upon the method used, and some endometrial ablation procedures can be performed with minimal anesthesia during an office visit. Others may be performed in an outpatient surgery center.' the surgeon's preference and experience, the presence of fibroids, the size and shape of the uterus, whether or not pretreatment medication is given, and type of anesthesia desired by the patient."
What are the risks and complications of endometrial ablation?,"'Complications of the procedure are not common but may include:''In very rare cases, fluid used to expand the uterus during the procedure can be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to ''fluid in the lungs'' (''pulmonary edema'').''Some women may experience regrowth of the endometrium and need further surgery (see below).''Minor side effects from the procedure can occur for a few days, include cramping (like ''menstrual cramps''), ''nausea'', and ''frequent urination'' that may last for 24 hours. A watery discharge mixed with blood may be present for a few weeks after the procedure and can be heavy for the first few days.'   accidental perforation of the uterus, tears or damage to the cervical opening (the opening to the uterus), and infection, bleeding, and burn injuries to the uterus or intestines."
What is the outlook after endometrial ablation?,"'The majority of women who undergo endometrial ablation report a successful reduction in abnormal bleeding. Up to half of women will stop having periods after the procedure. Yet, studies indicate the rate of failure (defined as bleeding or ''pain'' after endometrial ablation that required ''hysterectomy'' or reablation) was 16% to 30% at five 5 or years. Failure was most likely to occur in women younger than 45 years and in women with 5 or more children, prior ''tubal ligation'', and a history of painful ''menstrual cramps''. After endometrial ablation, 11% to 36% of women had a repeat ablation or other uterine-sparing procedure.''Although the procedure removes the uterine lining and typically results in ''infertility'', it should not be considered as a ''birth control'' measure, because pregnancy can still occur in a small portion of the endometrium that remains or has regrown. In this case there may be severe problems with the pregnancy, and the procedure should never be performed if the woman may desire pregnancy in the future.' "
What is middle ear infection or inflammation?,"'Middle ear inflammation is also called otitis media. Otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear; however, many doctors consider otitis media to be either inflammation or infection of the middle ear, the area inside the eardrum (tympanic membrane -- see illustration). ""Otitis"" means inflammation of the ear, and ""media"" means middle. This inflammation often begins with infections that cause sore throats, colds, or other respiratory problems, and spreads to the middle ear. Infections can be caused by ''viruses'' or bacteria, and can be acute or chronic. Both ears can be infected at the same time (double ''ear infection''). These infections are not ""swimmer\'s ear"" (also termed ''otitis externa'' or outer ''ear infection'"" because it occurs in the ear canal up to the eardrum), but not beyond. However, some people can have swimmer's ear and a middle ear infection at the same time.""'Acute middle ear infections ''usually are of rapid onset and short duration. They typically are associated with fluid accumulation in the middle ear, signs or symptoms of infections in the ear, a bulging eardrum usually accompanied by pain or a ''perforated eardrum'', and drainage of purulent material (pus, also termed suppurative otitis media). The person also may have a ''fever''.''Chronic middle ear infections'' are a persistent inflammation of the middle ear, typically for a minimum of three months. This is in distinction to an acute ear infection that usually lasts only several weeks. Following an acute infection, fluid (an effusion) may remain behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane) for up to three months before resolving. It may develop after a prolonged period of time with fluid (effusion) or negative pressure behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane). This type of infection can cause ongoing damage to the middle ear and eardrum, and there may be continuing drainage through a hole in the eardrum. Chronic middle ear infections often start painlessly without fever. Ear pressure or popping can be persistent for months. Sometimes a subtle loss of ''hearing'' can result from chronic middle ear infections.' "
What is serious middle ear infection or inflammation?," Serious otitis media is inflammation in the middle ear without infection. Typically, the Eustachian tube is not functioning and cannot ventilate the ear normally. As a result, fluid accumulates in the middle ear. This can lead to a dullness or fullness within the ear along with diminished hearing."
What happens to the eardrum in chronic middle ear infection or inflammation?," The eardrum (tympanic membrane) has three delicate layers that help keep the eardrum thin but strong. A chronic middle ear infection causes changes in the eardrum that weaken it, and often lead to a hole in the eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation). Eventually, the eardrum loses its strength and begins to collapse into the middle ear space. When the eardrum collapses or retracts from negative pressure in the middle ear, it can attach to the other middle ear structures. The eardrum is frequently seen draped around the middle ear bones (ossicles) or the inner wall of the middle ear (promontory). This disrupts the conduction of sound through the middle ear and may diminish hearing."
What happens to the eardrum if a hole develops in the eardrum?,"  A hole that forms in the eardrum (tympanic membrane perforation) usually causes a chronic draining ear, or a condition called chronic otitis media with perforation. Often the drainage (otorrhea) will have a foul odor and can be seen draining from the ear. Hearing can improve after the middle ear fluid is released, or it may worsen secondary to the inflammation in the middle ear."
How common is acute middle ear infection or inflammation?," This type of acute middle ear infection is an extremely common diagnosis. In the U.S., it is estimated that most children experience at least one middle ear infection before the age of three."
Why do infants and young children tend to have ear infections?," The Eustachian tube, a canal that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose and throat, is shorter and more horizontal in infants and young children than in older children and adults. This allows easier entry into the middle ear for the microorganisms that cause infection and leads to otitis media. Young children also have more immature immune systems. The result is that infants and young children are at greater risk of acquiring ear infections than adults."
How does the Eustachian tube change with age?," As a person ages, the Eustachian tube doubles in length and becomes more vertically positioned so that the nasopharyngeal orifice (opening) in the adult is significantly below the tympanic orifice (the opening in the middle ear near the ear drum) than in a child. The greater length and particularly the slope of the tube as it grows serves more effectively to protect, aerate and drain the middle ear."
How do you get a middle ear infection?," Bacteria and viruses can cause middle ear infections. Bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Moraxella account for about 85% of cases of acute otitis media. Viruses account for the remaining 15%. Affected infants under 6 weeks of age tend to have infections from a variety of different bacteria in the middle ear."
Common causes of acute and middle ear infection?," Bottle-feeding: The position of the breastfeeding child is better than that of the bottle-feeding position in terms of the function of the Eustachian tube that leads into the middle ear. If an infant needs to be bottle-fed, it's better to hold babies rather than allowing them to lie down with the bottle. Ideally, they should not take the bottle to bed. (In addition to increasing the chance for acute infection, falling asleep with milk in the mouth enhances the risk of tooth decay.) Upper respiratory tract infection: Children often develop upper respiratory infections prior to developing this type of infection. Exposure to groups of children (as in childcare centers) results in more frequent colds, and therefore more earaches. Exposure to air with irritants, such as tobacco smoke Birth defects: Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome are more prone to ear infections. Eustachian tube problems: Any problems with the Eustachian tubes (for example, blockage, malformation, inflammation) will increase the risk of infection. If the individual has allergies, he or she may have swelling and blockage of one or both Eustachian tubes. Immunosuppressed: Individuals with suppressed immune response are at increased risk for ear infections. Ear infections later in childhood: Children who have episodes of acute infections before six months of age tend to have more later in childhood."
What causes chronic middle ear infection or inflammation?," The Eustachian tube normally prevents the accumulation of fluid by allowing fluid to drain through the tube. Chronic otitis media develops over time, and often starts with a chronic middle ear effusion (fluid) that does not resolve. This persistent fluid will often become contaminated with bacteria, and the bacteria found in chronic otitis media are often different from those found in acute otitis media. Therefore, anything that disturbs the function of the Eustachian tube can lead to chronic otitis media. In some individuals that are ill from other diseases, and there is pus draining from the ear, there is a danger that otitis media (especially bacterial-caused) may invade the mastoid bone and reach the brain. These individuals need to be seen urgently by a health care professional. Do not delay treatment by trying home remedies."
"Signs and symptoms of acute middle ear infection in infants, toddlers, and children","'Signs and symptoms of middle ear infections in babies, toddlers, and children may include the following:''These symptoms are often associated with signs of ''upper respiratory infection'' such as a runny or stuffy nose, or a ''cough''.'   Young nonverbal children may be irritable and pull or tug at their ear(s). Young children with middle ear infections may be irritable, fussy, or have problems feeding or sleeping. Older children may complain about pain and fullness in the ear (earache). A child of any age may have a fever. The buildup of pus within the middle ear causes pain and dampens the vibrations of the eardrum (so there is usually temporary hearing loss during the infection). Severe ear infections may cause the eardrum to rupture. The pus then drains from the middle ear into the ear canal. The hole in the eardrum from the rupture usually heals without medical treatment."
Signs and symptoms of middle ear infections in adults, Ear pain Difficulty hearing Ear(s) may feel plugged up Ringing in ears Dizziness Fever Headache Nausea and/or vomiting
Are ear infections contagious?," Ear infections are not contagious. However, many children develop infections following a cold or other viral infection, and those infections are contagious."
Which specialties of doctors treat middle ear infections?," The majority of children and adults are diagnosed and treated by either pediatricians, primary health care doctors, emergency or urgent care medical providers, or other health care professionals. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists may be consulted for some individuals. On rare occasions, a neurologist or neurosurgeon may be needed to treat a severe infection that may extend to other organ systems."
How is acute middle ear infection diagnosed?,"'The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) have determined the criteria needed to diagnose acute otitis media (AOM), acute onset, middle ear effusion (MEE), and middle ear inflammation.''Identification of the three criteria is dependent on clinical observation; middle ear effusion and middle ear inflammation are the most difficult to observe and as a consequence there are studies that suggest acute otitis media is overdiagnosed.' The new guidelines describe this as ""moderate to severe bulging of the tympanic membrane (ear drum) or new onset of otorrhea (ear drainage) not due to external otitis (inflammation of the ear canal) or mild bulging of the ear drum, and recent ear pain (holding, tugging, rubbing ear in a nonverbal child) or intense reddening of the ear drum."" The guideline also strongly recommends that clinicians should not diagnose AOM without the presence of MEE. Recurrent acute otitis media is defined as at least three well-documented and separate acute otitis media episodes in 6 months or four well-documented and separate AOM episodes in the past 12 months with at least one in the past 6 months. There is no definitive lab test for acute otitis media. One method that helps determine acute otitis media versus otitis media with effusion is pneumatic otoscopy (the normal eardrum moves readily with pressure changes) and the appearance of the tympanic membrane (acute otitis media has abnormal appearance; otitis media with effusion does not). However, not everyone is skilled at this technique; pediatricians, family practice physicians, ENT specialists, and ER doctors who work in pediatric ER's are likely to be skilled in the diagnostic procedure."
How is acute middle ear infection or inflammation treated?,"'The treatment for acute otitis media varies depending upon the age and symptoms of the child. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend the following:''*Observation is an appropriate option only when follow-up can be ensured and antibacterial agents can be started if symptoms persist or worsen within 2-3 days. The guidelines also recommend ""shared decision making"" with the ''caregiver''. Non-severe illness is represented by mild ear pain and fever <39 C (102.2 F) in the past 24 hours. Severe illness is defined as moderate to severe otalgia (ear pain) or any ear pain for at least 48 hours or fever 39 C. These 2013 guidelines are current.''If antibiotics are initiated, ''amoxicillin'' is usually recommended as the first line treatment. This is usually prescribed for 10 days. Some children do not respond within the first 48-72 hours of treatment, and antibiotic therapy may have to be changed. Even after antibiotic treatment, some children are left with some fluid in the middle ear, which can cause temporary hearing loss lasting for up to 3 to 6 weeks. In most children, this fluid eventually disappears spontaneously (on its own). Ceftriaxone (50mg/kg/d) injection is recommended for children who cannot take oral antibiotics; three days of this antibiotic is usually more effective than a single injection.''Children who have recurring bouts of otitis media may be referred to an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist or ENT). Some of these children may benefit from having an ear tube placed (tympanostomy tube) to permit fluid to drain from the middle ear. In addition, if a child has a bulging eardrum and is experiencing severe pain, a procedure to lance the eardrum (myringotomy) may be recommended to release the pus. The eardrum usually heals within a week. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy has not been shown to decrease the frequency of ear infections in those children with recurrent AOM.''Although treatment may cure an ear infection, it is possible for the ear to become re-infected.'  "
How is chronic middle ear infection or inflammation treated?," Initially, antibiotics may resolve the ear infection. If a tympanic membrane perforation also is present, topical antibiotic drops may be used. If eardrum or ossicle scarring has occurred, that will not be reversed with antibiotics alone. Surgery often is indicated to repair the tympanic membrane (eardrum) and remove the infected tissue and scar from the middle ear and the mastoid bone. Long-term prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended."
What are the goals of chronic otitis media surgery?,"'Finally, hearing is to be restored.'   The goals of surgery are to first remove all of the infected tissue so that it can be ""safe"" from recurrent infections. The second goal is to recreate a middle ear space with an intact eardrum. This may seem strange that hearing is the last priority, but if the first two priorities are not met, anything that is done to improve hearing will ultimately fail. If hearing is restored, but the infection returns, the hearing will be lost again. Likewise, if hearing is restored, but the middle ear space is not recreated, the eardrum will re-stick to the middle ear or the ossicles."
Are there any home remedies for acute middle ear infection?,"'There are a number of suggested home remedies for the treatment of ear infections, including''However, there are limited studies suggesting the benefits of these measures over accepted and recommended treatments.'   humidified air, homeopathic treatments, naturopathic ear drops, decongestants, and antihistamines.  Both oral and topical analgesics are effective in controlling the pain associated with ear infections, but the use of decongestants or antihistamines has not been demonstrated to improve symptoms or speed the resolution of acute otitis media."
What limitations are there on a child with middle ear infection or inflammation?," Otitis media is not contagious (although the initial cold that caused it may be). A child with otitis media can travel by airplane but, if the Eustachian tube is not working well, the pressure change as the plane descends may cause the child pain. It is best not to fly (or swim) with a draining ear. You should always consult your doctor if you have specific concerns."
Can otitis media (middle ear infection or inflammation) be prevented?,"  Currently, the best way to prevent acute otitis media is to assure a child is vaccinated. Ensuring that your child receives an annual flu vaccine and is up to date with his/her pneumococcal vaccine is the best way to prevent the most common causes of middle ear infections (otitis media). In addition, both early and sustained breastfeeding (for at least 6 months) and avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure have been shown to be related to fewer ear infections. Recent studies suggest that Xylitol-based gum or lozenges may have a preventive impact on acute otitis media. Unfortunately, it cannot be used in young children, and must be used 3-5 times a day during the cold and flu season to be effective."
What is an ear infection?,"'Ear infections'' can be caused by ''viruses'', bacteria, or rarely yeast. There are three areas in the ear where ''ear infections'' can occur in adults and children.''There are three separate elements of the human ear that anatomically and functionally work together to enable ''hearing'' and interpretation of sounds as well as provide a sense of body position and balance during movements of the head and body.'  Outer ear infections (swimmer's ear): An outer ear infection (otitis externa) most commonly experienced is often known as “swimmer’s ear.” This infection usually is due to bacterial infection of the skin tissue covering the ear canal. Excessive immersion in water or injuring the ear canal by putting things in it (such as using cotton swabs in the canal to remove earwax) makes you more likely to develop an outer ear infection. Middle ear infections: A middle ear infection (otitis media) is an infection just behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane) with pus trapped in the adjacent hollow cavity (middle ear space) of the facial bone. Middle ear infections frequently are a complication of the common cold in children. Most middle ear infections are caused by viruses and will resolve spontaneously. Bacterial infections cause some middle ear infections, which requires antibiotic treatment. Inner ear infections: Inner ear infections are very rare, and usually are caused by a virus. These “infections” are more accurately characterized as inflammation of the structures of the inner ear (labyrinthitis). Since these structures affect hearing and balance, inner ear infections cause symptoms such as ringing of the ears (tinnitus) or dizziness and balance disruption (vertigo). Usually, inner ear infections in adults and children (rare) need medical treatment. The outer ear includes the cartilaginous structure (pinna) and ear canal ending at the eardrum (tympanic membrane). The middle ear is composed of the eardrum and a small hollow area of the facial bone adjacent to the eardrum in which three small bones are linked together. The eardrum moves as a result of air pressure waves that are focused by the pinna and travel down the ear canal. Movement of the tympanic membrane causes a domino like movement of these three small bones that ultimately transfer this stimulus to the inner ear. The inner ear has two structures.The cochlea, which converts movements of the ear bones into nerve impulses that are sent to the brain, which then are “translated” into sounds.The semicircular canals (part of a separate structure), has three parts that interpret motion of the head allowing recognition of your position in space (for example, lying down, bending over, etc.) The cochlea, which converts movements of the ear bones into nerve impulses that are sent to the brain, which then are “translated” into sounds. The semicircular canals (part of a separate structure), has three parts that interpret motion of the head allowing recognition of your position in space (for example, lying down, bending over, etc.)"
What are the signs and symptoms of an ear infection?,   Mild to severe ear pain Problems hearing Redness and inflammation Pus draining from the ear Itching Fever Problems with balance Feeling of fullness in the ear Nausea and vomiting Vertigo Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) Labyrinthitis (inflammation and infection of the inner ear)
Can I treat an ear infection at home?,"'You can treat some outer and middle ear infections at home with remedies and ''over-the-counter'' medication for symptoms like ''pain'' and inflammation.''Usually, prolonged and recurrent immersion in water causes ''outer ear'' infections. The primary treatment for swimmer’s ear is to avoid getting water in the ear canal until the ear ''pain'' is gone.''An outer ''ear infection'' may take several days to heal, but the ''pain'' usually is gone within one week. Moreover, the warmer the water, the higher the likelihood of getting swimmer’s ear, for example, people who swim in the summer are more likely to develop an outer ''ear infection'' than wintertime surfers.''Numerous studies have shown that viruses cause middle ear infections. ''Pain management'' for ear pain for two or three days will allow the body’s natural immune system to fight and cure the infection, much like the ''common cold''. However, some people with middle ear infections may need to see a doctor or other health-care professional for medical treatment.''Inner ear infections and labyrinthitis (''inner ear inflammation'' adults and children are very rare, moreover, the symptoms of inner ear infections may be associated with other non-infectious causes, otolaryngologists (doctors that specialize in ear, nose problems) usually treat inner ear infections in adults and children.' "
What home remedies relieve ear pain and cure ear infections?,"'Natural and ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) nonprescription (not antibiotic) remedies for ear infections' Over the counter pain relievers, for example, acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) and ibuprofen (Advil). Those over 18 years of age can also consider aspirin for pain. Those younger than 18 should avoid aspirin due to its association with Reye's syndrome (a potentially fatal disease associated with liver and brain deterioration). For ear pain associated with a middle ear infection without an eardrum perforation, warm (not hot) oil (olive, vegetable) dripped gently into the ear canal and held in place by a cotton ball may help ease ear pain. Warm oil is less likely to be helpful for swimmer’s ear. A warm or cold compress may help ear pain. Some people find alternating between a warm and cold compress helpful Naturopathic eardrops have been tried in an effort to control ear pain and the primary ear infection with limited success. Naturopathic eardrops have not been approved by the FDA Tea tree oil eardrops are widely used but have the same limitations discussed with regard to naturopathic eardrops. An oil containing ginger may be applied to the pinna. Advocates of this preparation urge avoiding pouring ginger oil into the ear canal. Anecdotal testimonies exist praising the use of garlic oil poured into the ear canal as an effective therapy for outer and middle ear infections. Parents of young children with middle ear infections (otitis media) have long since noted the reluctance to put pressure on the side of the infected ear. Sleeping with the painful side “up” may be of help in the management of ear pain. Prior to antibiotics, a common “natural” technique to treat middle ear infections was for the doctor to make a small incision in the eardrum (myringotomy) to relieve pressure and allow any pus to drain from the ear. Myringotomy is still considered when treating unusual bacterial ear infections in newborns, infants, and those with a compromised immune system and that may require antibiotics not commonly used to treat ear infections. Chiropractic treatment has been used to treat and cure middle ear infections; however, comparative studies have mixed results. Chiropractic treatment to treat and cure ear these infections may increase the risk of injury."
Should ear infections be treated with antibiotics?,"'If you have an ear infection in which antibiotics are not prescribed, follow up for re-evaluation by the doctor is important.'   The most recent policy statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) encourages pain management and not antibiotics as the initial approach to most outer and middle ear infections. Since outer ear infections (swimmer’s ear) are generally bacterial in cause, this type of ear infection can be prevented by avoiding prolonged ear canal immersion. Antibiotic eardrops have been shown to accelerate the healing process in swimmer’s ear, but avoiding prolonged water in the ear canal also is highly recommended. Rarely, severe cases of swimmer’s ear will cause the ear canal tissue become swollen shut. To treat this, an ""ear wick"" is placed in the ear to allow the antibiotic eardrops into the narrowed ear canal. Oral antibiotics often are used in severe cases. AAP guidelines for middle ear infection (otitis media) recommend first line use of antibiotics (in lieu of purely pain management) in children younger than 2 years of age experiencing moderate to severe ear pain and fever greater than 102.2. F (39 C). This recommendation reflects the knowledge that this age group is much more likely to have a bacterial cause of a middle ear infection versus a viral cause in children above two years of age. Children between 6 months to 2 years of age who are not having severe pain and do not have a temperature greater than 102.2 are candidates for parental monitoring without antibiotics. Children older than two years of age should be monitored. Regardless of therapy type (observation or antibiotics), it is important that parents or caregivers have access to medical follow up should symptoms worsen. Inner ear infections are rare, and usually need to be treated by an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist."
When to call the doctor for an ear infection,"'Some symptoms of an ''inner ear infection'' can be the same as a ''stroke''. If you have ''vomiting'', ''headache'', vision changes, ''fever'', ''weakness'' in one side of your body, slurred speech or are unable to walk, seek medical care right away.''Infections involving high ''fever'', discharge or bleeding from the ear canal, ''headache'', ''vomiting'', ''dizziness'', loss of hearing, or severe pain should be seen by a doctor. A doctor should see most people with an ''inner ear infection''.' "
How common is a foreign body in the ear? Is it serious?,"'Foreign objects in the ear are common reasons for emergency room visits, especially in children.'""If a you aren't sure of the potential for harm of the foreign body, seek medical care immediately."" The majority of these things are harmless. Some are extremely uncomfortable (insects or sharp objects) and some can rapidly produce an infection (food or organic matter) requiring emergency treatment."
What types of objects get stuck in the ear?,"'Most objects that get stuck in the ear canal are placed there by the person themselves. Children who are curious about their bodies and interesting objects, are the group most often has this problem (children aged 9 months to 8 years).''The most common things they put in their ears include:''Earwax'':'' Earwax is a naturally occurring substance in the ear canal but can become a problem when it builds up to the point that it clogs the ear canal, and causes ''hearing loss'' or ''pain''. Overuse of cotton swabs such as Q-tips to clean the ear can actually push wax and skin cell debris further into the canal and pack it against the eardrum causing symptoms.''Insects:'"" Insects can also fly or crawl into the ear canal. Usually this happens while sleeping on the floor or outdoors (for example, camping). This is often a frightening and dramatic event as the insect's buzzing and movement is very loud and sometimes painful.""   Beads Food (especially beans) Paper Cotton swabs Rubber erasers Small toys Marbles Small shells"
What are symptoms and signs of a foreign body in ear?,"'Pain'', inflammation, and irritation: ''The skin in the ear canal and the eardrum is very sensitive. Any inflammation or injury is usually readily apparent due to pain or irritation.''In young children:'' The diagnosis can be challenging in young children who are not old enough to verbalize their pain. Redness, swelling, or discharge (blood, inflammatory fluid, or pus) are the main signs of injury to the ear. Small children often scratch or rub the ear repeatedly.''Earwax impaction:'' If impacted earwax is the cause you may experience symptoms of a ""fullness"" or pressure, and a decrease in ''hearing'' on the affected side. In extreme cases, ''dizziness'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', or unsteady ''walking'' results from inflammation of the ear or build-up of pressure on the eardrum causing dysfunction of their middle ear.'  "
How do you remove a foreign body from your ear?,'If the item is very small you can try to gently shake it out. Pulling the back of the ear (the pinna) gently toward the back of the head straightens out the ear canal and the foreign body may roll or slide out with a gentle shake of the ear. Do not strike your head on the opposite side to try to dislodge the stuck item.'  
When should you call a doctor or other health care professional if you have something foreign in your ear?,"'The vast majority of foreign bodies in the ear are not true medical emergencies. Call a doctor or other health care professional if something is in your ear, but the symptoms are minor. This can usually wait until the morning if the office is closed.''Organic material (bugs, plants, or food) should be removed promptly due to the possibility of swelling of the material and rapid onset of infection.'""If you have a swollen (inflamed) ear that's red and is displaced outward, ""'fever'', discharge, bleeding, or increasing pain; see a doctor urgently. If the object in the ear is a battery, seek medical attention immediately. If you are unsure of the severity of the injury, see a doctor.' Insects should be removed quickly as they cause distressing symptoms and great discomfort, and can sting or bite causing further damage. A few drops of mineral oil may be placed in the ear canal prior to going to the doctor to kill the insect and stop the buzzing or scraping sensation on the eardrum. Button-type batteries from household gadgets or watches are particularly dangerous and need to be removed as soon as possible as they may leak chemicals that can burn and severely damage the ear canal even within an hour."
How can a doctor or other medical professional tell if there is something in your ear?,"'A doctor or other health care professional usually can see the foreign body by directly looking in the ear with an instrument called an otoscope. A magnifying light with a ''plastic'' cone tip is slid into the ear canal to look at the structures inside. In cases involving children, it is important to realize there may be more than one foreign body, and other orifices (other ear, mouth, nose and rectum) also may need to be examined. Once the object is seen, there are many ways of retrieving it.' "
How do you remove a foreign body deep in your ear?,"'Foreign bodies stuck deep in the ear:'"" If the item is deeper in the ear than can be seen with the naked eye, a qualified medical professional should remove it. Don't stick anything into the ear to remove an object yourself, as you may push it in further and cause damage or rupture of the eardrum or scratch the skin of the ear canal.""""At the doctor's office or in the emergency room the foreign body can be removed using several techniques. (Don't try these at home.)""'Small children: '""Small children don't tolerate painful or scary interventions, and may need to be sedated medically to have foreign bodies removed from their ears. Often with children, the first try is the most successful, as subsequent attempts to remove an object can be painful and frightening to the child.""'Insects and bugs:'' Insects in the ear canal are often killed with either ''lidocaine'' (an anesthetic) or mineral oil. They are then flushed out with gentle warm water irrigation.''Antibiotics:'' After the foreign body is removed the doctor may put the patient on antibiotic drops for five days to a week to prevent infection from ''trauma'' to the ear canal.' Modified tweezers or forceps can be used to reach in and grab the object with the help of an otoscope so important structures are not damaged. Gentle suction can be used to suck out the object. Irrigation of the canal with warm water and a small catheter can flush certain materials out of the canal and clean out debris. Some doctors have devised ingenious and novel ways to remove objects from ear canals."
What are some other types of ear emergencies?," Ruptured tympanic membrane (eardrum) can be a result of foreign bodies, middle ear infection, or pressure trauma to the ear. Often the patient feels pain, notices a thin bloody discharge from the ear, and has a decreased sense of hearing. If a person experiences these symptoms and thinks the eardrum may be ruptured or damaged, keep the ear dry, and seek medical care. Do not place cotton swabs, liquids, or other objects in ear. Acute otitis externa (swimmer's ear) is an infection of the outer ear canal that is usually caused by irritation of the canal skin that is made worse by water remaining in the ear canal after swimming or bathing. Cellulitis (skin infection) causes the ear canal to turn red and swell. The ear becomes very painful and a thin yellow fluid (infected pus) comes out of the canal. Some patients experience pain with mouth opening and chewing because of inflammation in the ear canal. The infection can spread to the side of the face or the lymph glands in the neck. Treatment of swimmer's ear includes antibiotic drops and, in severe cases, IV or oral antibiotics. Earwax impaction is usually a harmless cause of decreased hearing. Wax is formed in the ear canals naturally. Individuals who over-aggressively clean their ears with cotton swabs can push wax further into the canal, impacting (compressing) it against the ear drum. Over-the-counter (OTC) products, like carbamide peroxide (Auro, Debrox, Murine Earwax Drops) can be used to clean the ear regularly. If the wax impaction is causing pain, decreased hearing or dizziness, a doctor can irrigate (flush) the wax out of the ear gently with warm water and peroxide. If a person has chronic problems with earwax buildup, discuss long-term solutions with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist (an otolaryngologist)."
What is the purpose of ear tube placement?,"'Middle ''ear infections'' (''otitis media'') are common in children. When a child has repeated ''ear infections'' or fluid build-up in the ears that do not go away easily or there are ''hearing'' problems or speech delays, a doctor may recommend surgery to insert an ear tube to allow the eardrum to equalize the pressure.''The surgery, called a myringotomy, is a tiny incision in the eardrum. Any fluid, usually thickened secretions will be removed. In most situations, a small ''plastic'' tube (a tympanostomy tube) is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged period.. These ventilating tubes remain in place for six months to several years. Eventually, they will move out of the eardrum (extrude) and fall into the ear canal. Your doctor may remove the tube during a routine office visit or it may simply fall out of the ear.''Less common conditions that may call for the placement of ear tubes are malformation of the eardrum or Eustachian tube, '""Down's syndrome""', ''cleft palate'', and barotrauma (middle ear injury caused by a reduction of air pressure), according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology.'  "
Ear tubes side effects: What are risks and complications of ear tubes?,"'While ear tube surgery is common, minor complications can occur in up to half of the children who have them inserted. Complications include:'  Failure to resolve the ear infections. Thickening of the eardrum over time, which affects hearing in a small percentage of patients. Persistent perforation after the tube falls out of the eardrum. Chronic ear drainage. Infection Hearing loss Scarring of the eardrum Ear canal skin tissue and material getting trapped inside the eardrum (cholesteatoma) Possible need to keep the ear dry and to use ear plugs Foreign body reaction to the tube itself - for example, an allergic reaction to the tube material (rare) While not a complication, some patients may have a need for further and more aggressive surgery such as tonsil, adenoid, sinus, or ear surgery."
What happens before the ear tubes procedure?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient (no overnight stay usually required), at either the hospital or an outpatient surgery center. An anesthesiologist will monitor your child throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist reviews the medical history before surgery. If your doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, arrange to have these done several days in advance.'""If your child is old enough to understand what surgery is, be honest and up front as you explain the upcoming surgery. A calming and reassuring attitude will greatly ease your child's ""'anxiety''. Most children will feel better having had the pressure relieved in their ears.''Your child must not eat or drink anything 6 to 12 hours prior to their time of surgery; this includes even water or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication.''If your child is sick or has a ''fever'' the day before surgery, call the office. If your child wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. Your doctor will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery. However, if your child has ''chickenpox'', do not bring your child to the office or to the surgical facility.' "
What to do the day of ear tubes surgery,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to check-in with the surgical facility, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. Bring the required papers and forms with you, including the preoperative orders and history sheets. Your child should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes (pajamas are permissible). Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. They may bring a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket.' "
What happens during ear tube placement?,"'Your child may be given a medication to help him or her relax prior to entering the operating room (premedication). In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of ''gas'' and an intravenous medication for sedation. During the procedure, which typically takes 10 to 15 minutes, your child will be continuously monitored including pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation of blood) and cardiac rhythm (''EKG''). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''After the anesthetic takes effect, the doctor, using an operating microscope, makes a tiny incision in the eardrum through the ''outer ear'' canal. There will be no external incisions or ''stitches''. Fluid will be suctioned from the ear, and a tube inserted in the eardrum. Usually, drops will be placed in the ear, and a cotton plug inserted in the ear canal.' "
What happens after ear tubes surgery?,"'After surgery, your child will be taken to the recovery room to be monitored by a nurse. You may be invited into the recovery room as your child becomes aware of their surroundings and starts looking for you. Your child should be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes less than one hour.''Your child may resume a normal ''diet'' after he or she has fully recovered from the anesthetic. Even though they may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to feed them slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, children may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, your doctor may prescribe medication to settle the stomach.' "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care for ear tubes?,"'An appointment for a follow-up ear check-up is usually arranged 14 to 28 days after the procedure. At this visit, the position and function of the tubes will be assessed.'""Usually, eardrops will be given to you the day of surgery. The surgeon will often place the same drops in the ear following the placement of the tubes. They are usually used after surgery for three days (3-4 drops each ear 3 times per day). If there is drainage from the ear after three days, you may be instructed to continue using the drops until the day before your office visit or as per doctor's instructions. Discontinue these drops if they cause severe ""'pain'' or a skin ''rash''.''You can ""pump"" them into the ear by pushing on the soft cartilage tissue located in front of the ear canal (medically termed the tragus).''Ear drainage may occur immediately after the procedure or at any time while the tubes are in place.''Yellow clear fluid or mucous may drain for several days to weeks after the surgery.''It is not unusual to see a bloody discharge following surgery. Cotton can be kept in the ear canal and changed as needed to keep dry.''If after the immediate post-operative period, profuse, foul-smelling discharge drains from the ear, an infection is the possible cause. If this occurs, begin by using eardrops for three days. If the drainage continues beyond three days, call the doctor to determine if additional medicine and/or an office visit is necessary.''Avoiding water for children with ear tubes or routine water precautions (wearing earplugs or headbands) is generally not recommended while tubes are in place with some exceptions. Water protection may be needed if ''pain'' results when the ears get wet, if there is prolonged drainage from the ear or for children who dive more than 6 ''feet'' under water, dunk their head in soapy bath tub water, or swim in areas other than chlorinated pools. There is an increased risk of infection in lake or pond water, as opposed to chlorinated water found in ''swimming'"" pools. Follow your doctor's advice regarding water precautions.""'Tympanostomy tubes usually stay in place from 6 to 18 months. If they stay in longer than two to three years, they may need to be surgically removed. It is important to have an ear check-up about every six months during this period. An audiogram is usually obtained at some point after the ear has healed. The tubes eventually fall out of the eardrum as the ear heals. Some children may have mild discomfort or bloody drainage at this time. The small hole in the eardrum at the old tube site usually heals within several weeks. Your doctor will instruct you when it is safe to allow water in the ears.''In some cases, insertion of ear tubes must be repeated if the tubes fall out and symptoms recur.'  "
What is ear wax?,"'The skin on the outer part of the ear canal has special glands that produce ear wax, also known as cerumen. We have this natural wax is to protect the ear from damage and infections. Normally, a small amount of wax accumulates and then dries up and falls out of the ear canal, carrying with it unwanted dust or sand particles.''Ear wax is helpful to coat the skin of the ear canal where it acts as a temporary water repellent. The absence of ear wax may result in dry, ''itchy'' ears, and even infection. Ear wax is formed in the outer third of the ear canal.''Under ideal circumstances, a person should never need to clean his or her ear canals. However, sometimes the removal of wax is necessary and requires medical treatment.'  "
Why does earwax vary in color and texture?,"'Cerumen varies in form, color, and appearance from person to person.''The ear canals are considered to be self-cleaning. This means that ear wax and sloughed skin cells typically pass on their own from the inside of the ear canal to the outer opening. Old earwax moves from the deeper areas of the canal out to the opening. At the opening of the canal the ear wax usually dries up and falls out of the canal.' It may be almost liquid, firm and solid, or dry and flaky. The color of ear wax varies depending upon its composition. Glandular secretions, sloughed skin cells, normal bacteria present on the surface of the canal, and water may all be in earwax."
What causes wax in the ears to build up?,"'You can have excessive earwax build up and harden by:' Narrowing of the canal resulting from infections or diseases of the skin, bones, or connective tissue Production of a less fluid form of cerumen (more common in older persons due to aging of the glands that produce it). Overproduction of cerumen in response to trauma or blockage within the canal. Things that you put in your ears to clean them like swabs, Q-tips, hair pins or keys. Hearing aids Earphones that are placed inside the ears"
What signs and symptoms are related to excessive or impacted (plug) earwax?,"'Excessive wax in the ears can cause different symptoms and signs, including:''When wax plugs the ear canal it can affect your hearing. Researchers estimate that hearing can be improved by 10 decibels when the plug is removed.'   Earache A sense of fullness in the ears Hearing problems Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Cough Itching Discharge from the ear canal"
Is ear candling safe?,"'Ear candling involves placing a hollow candle (made from a fabric tube soaked in beeswax) in the ear canal and burning it, with the goal of creating a suction force for removal of wax from the ears. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery, ear candling or ear coning is not considered a safe option for ear wax removal. Studies have shown that the procedure does not create a vacuum that can remove the wax effectively, and it the wax left inside candle is from the candle itself, not from the ear. The procedure also carries health risks that include ''burns'' to the ear canal, development of new blockage of the canal from the candling wax, ''ear infection'', and perforation of the eardrum.' "
What are the treatment guidelines for impacted earwax removal?,"'In January, 2017, the American Academy of Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery released new practice guidelines to treat impacted earwax. This guideline was endorsed by a number of other medical organizations including the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP). This guideline discusses four ways to care for and manage impacted earwax.' Observation, since many impactions or blockages may clear on their own Softening agents, known as cerumenolytics. These are oils or ear drops that soften or break up the wax to help in removal. Irrigation, or ear syringing. This is clearing the wax using a stream of warm water into the ear canal. This can sometimes be done at home. This method is not suitable for people who have frequent ear infections or who have a perforated eardrum or surgically inserted ear tubes. Physical removal using a suction device or instrument. This should always be done by a doctor or other health-care professional."
What over-the-counter (OTC) products remove earwax build up safely at home?,"'Many people will respond to treatment with natural and home remedies, for example:''If the ear still feels blocked after using these drops, call a doctor for an exam. If you try OTC earwax softeners, it is imperative to know that you don’t have a punctured (perforated) eardrum prior to using the product. If you have a ''punctured eardrum'' and put softeners in the ear it may cause a middle ''ear infection'' (''otitis media''). Similarly, simply washing the ear with a punctured eardrum may start an infection. If you are uncertain whether or not you have a hole in your eardrum, consult a health-care professional.''Some people may also be hypersensitive to products designed to soften earwax. Therefore, if ''pain'', tenderness or a local skin ''rash'' develops, the use of these drops should be discontinued.''When wax has accumulated so much that it blocks the ear canal (and interferes with hearing), a health-care professional may need to wash it out (known as lavage), remove it by suctioning, or remove it with special instruments. Alternatively, a doctor may prescribe ear drops that are designed to soften the wax (such as trolamine polypeptide oleate-ear drops [''Cerumenex'']).'   Use a few drops of warmed olive oil, mineral oil, almond oil, baby oil, or glycerin ear drops or sprays in the ear to soften the wax. Use hydrogen peroxide drops. Over-the-counter (OTC) products are available for wax removal, such as Debrox or Murine Ear Drops. Syringe bulbs or irrigation home kits"
Is it OK to use Q-tips or other objects to remove excess earwax?,"'Most attempts to clean the ears by using cotton swabs only result in pushing the wax further into the ear canal. Wax is not formed in the deep part of the canal near the eardrum, but only in the outer part of the canal near the external opening. So when a doctor sees with wax pushed up against your eardrum, he or she knows that it often is because you have been probing your ear with things like Q-Tips, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only serve as ramrods to push the wax deeper into the ear and can lead to problems.''The skin of the ear canal and the eardrum is very thin and fragile, and is easily injured. The ear canal is more prone to infection after it has been stripped clean of the ""good,"" coating-type wax. Doctors see many perforated eardrums as a result of the above efforts. If you have symptoms or signs of impacted earwax consult with your doctor.' "
What are risks and complications of cosmetic ear surgery?,"'Your surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results. The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this surgical procedure.'  Infection of the skin or of the cartilage (chondritis) of the ear. Bleeding or hematoma formation. A cosmetic or functional result that does not meet your expectations. An unfavorable result may occur at any time following surgery, and includes inadequate correction, recurrence, contour distortions, or asymmetric correction, all of which may require secondary surgery. Permanent or temporary numbness of the skin of the ear or face. Scar or keloid formation, which is an overgrowth of scar tissue. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Narrowing of the external ear canal. Suture extrusion. When permanent sutures are used to maintain shape, they may become evident through the skin and may eventually require removal. If the surgery is being done because of a tumor, there can be recurrence of the tumor and the need for additional surgery or other therapeutic modalities including radiation therapy or chemotherapy."
What happens before surgery?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or the surgicenter. In both facilities, quality care is provided without the expense and inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will monitor you throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist will call the night before surgery to review the medical history. If he or she is unable to reach you the night before surgery, they will talk with you that morning. If your doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, you should arrange to have these done several days in advance.''You should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days of the date of your surgery. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications (such as ''Advil'', ''Naprosyn'', ''Nuprin'') should not be taken within 4-7 days of the date of surgery depending on the preparation. Many over-the- counter products contain aspirin or antinflammatory ''drugs'"". So it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, please call your doctor's office or consult your pharmacist. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually your doctor will give you your prescriptions at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of your surgery. ''You must not eat or drink anything 6 hour prior to the time of surgery. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding. If you are sick or have a ''fever'' the day before surgery, call the office. If you wake up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. Your doctor will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery.' "
What happens on the day of surgery?,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to check in with the surgical facility, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers and forms with you including any preoperative orders and history sheets. You should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes which do not have to be pulled over the head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Thoroughly wash your face with soap and water. Do not apply make-up or cream to your face.''Do not take any medication unless instructed by your doctor or the anesthesiologist. Usually in the pre- operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and you may be given a medication to help you relax.' "
What happens during surgery?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put you to ''sleep'' and to maintain your anesthetic at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, you will be continuously monitored including ''blood pressure'', pulse, oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter), and ''heart'' rhythm (''EKG''). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''Depending on what is required and whether or not you are also undergoing additional procedures, the surgery may take several hours. Your doctor will typically come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once you are safely to the recovery room.' "
What happens after surgery?,"'After surgery, you will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor you. You will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once you have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. You will need a friend or family member to pick you up from the surgical facility and to take you home. He or she should spend the first night after surgery with you. When you arrive home from the surgical facility, you should go to bed and rest with your head elevated on 2-3 pillows. By keeping your head elevated above your heart, you can minimize ''edema'' and swelling. You may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom. It is best to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once you have recovered fully from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though you may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to go slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, you may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if it persists, your doctor may prescribe medication to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''You will be prescribed antibiotics after surgery, and should finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic will also be prescribed (typically ''hydrocodone''/''Vicodin''), and is to be taken as needed. If you require narcotics you are cautioned not to drive. In some situations your doctor may give you steroids to be taken either preoperatively and/or post-operatively. It is very important that you take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. If you have ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'' post-operatively, you may be prescribed medications for nausea (anti-emesis), such as phenergan. If you have any questions or you feel that you are developing a reaction to any of these medications, you should consult your doctor. You should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless you have discussed it with your doctor.' "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care?,"'In most situations, a bandage will have been placed to cover the ''wound''. If you are undergoing an otoplasty, a compressive dressing will be placed. You should not remove the dressing because these are holding the external ears in the appropriate position. Your doctor will probably check the ear the next day in the office. If you experience severe ''pain'' on only one side, please call the office to report this to the doctor. It may be the first indication of a hematoma. Unless instructed otherwise, the bandages should remain in place for one week. At this time, you are asked to return to the office to have the sutures removed. We usually recommend that you wear an elastic band (ear band-it) at night for the next 6 weeks. It is best to wear the band even during the day when it is ""socially acceptable"". We discourage facial tanning for 6 months after surgery. If you must be in the sun you should use a number 15 or greater sun block. You may use your usual make-up anytime after surgery. Do not wear earrings or glasses (if possible) for 3 weeks.''After the bandages have been removed, clean the wound with a Q-tip soaked in hydrogen peroxide to remove all crusts. By gently removing all crusts, the wound edges will heal better with a less obvious scar. Apply polysporin ointment, or a similar antibiotic ointment of your choice, to the cleaned wound. If you develop a ''rash'', discontinue the ointment and notify your surgeon. You may wash you face and hair after the bandages have been removed. Avoid excessive scrubbing of the wound.''Use a gentle soap and shampoo. We ask that you stay out of the pool for several weeks, and after that to wear the ear band-it for the next 6 weeks. Numbness, slight swelling, ''itching'', and discoloration are normal complaints, and should go away with time. You should plan to stay in town for 3 weeks to allow for after-surgery (postoperative) care.' A fever greater than 101.5 degrees F which persists despite increasing the amount of fluid you drink and acetaminophen (Tylenol). A person with a fever should try to drink approximately one cup of fluid each waking hour.  Persistent sharp pain or severe one- sided pain which is not relieved by the pain medication you were prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the ears. Drainage from the wound."
What home remedies can relieve earaches?,"'Most earaches are not medical emergencies and can often be treated at home. You can try one or a few of the following remedies before visiting a doctor' Warm compresses: Warm compresses held against the back of the ear can help relieve the inflammation and pain. Take care, as you may spill the water into the ear. Cool compresses: If a warm compress does not help relieve the earache, a cool compress or a cloth dipped in cool water can be held against your ear. Do not apply ice. Pain medications: Analgesic pills, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol), can be taken if you do not have any other health conditions. Ask your doctor if you are not sure. Hydrate yourself: Drink plenty of water or energy drinks. Humidifier: You can steam your nose from a safe distance to help the sinuses drain and the ear tube to open. This can help with an earache. Caution is essential with hot water. Ear drops: You can visit a pharmacy for drops to dissolve the ear wax that is stuck in your ear canal. Chew a piece of gum or yawn: Simple things like chewing gum or yawning may be helpful in easing pressure within the middle ear. You can hear a popping sound, which means the pressure inside has released and you can expect to get relief from your ear pain. Suck on a candy: Earaches that happen due to changes in altitude while traveling in a plane can be effectively relieved by sucking on a candy or putting earplugs or cotton in your ears. Nasal spray: A saline nasal spray or oxymetazoline (Afrin) nasal spray can be used in addition to steam to relieve sinusitis-related earache. Try an alternate sleeping position: You can use several different types of self-care measures to treat earache at home.Let the affected ear be higher than the rest of your body by placing two-three pillows under your head. If the left ear has an infection, sleep on your right side and vice versa."
How can you prevent earaches?,"'You can prevent earaches by identifying their cause. Some of the preventive tips include' Carefully drying the ears after swimming or bathing (you can hold a hair dryer at a safe distance). Shaking your head to drain out excess water in the ear. Wearing earplugs while swimming. Avoiding the use of your fingernails or objects, such as paper clips or bobby pins, to remove wax from your ears. Instead, get the excess wax removed regularly by a healthcare professional. Protecting infants from the cold by wrapping their heads in warm caps. Swallowing frequently while on a plane."
When should you see a doctor for your earache?,"'Remember that home remedies are not a one-stop solution to your earache. They may provide temporary relief. If the earache does not subside within 1 to 2 days, it is better to consult a doctor who can examine your ear and find out the root cause of the pain. If you have any of the following other conditions, visit a doctor instead of relying on home remedies\xa0' Fluid (such as pus or blood) oozing out of your ear High fever Headache Dizziness An object that is stuck in your ear Swelling behind your ear Feeling of facial muscle weakness on the side of the affected ear Severe ear pain that suddenly stops (it could be a ruptured eardrum) Ear ringing Reduced hearing in the affected ear"
What is the best way to confirm pregnancy?,"'Pregnancy symptoms'' vary for everyone and are easy to confuse with a menstrual period. That’s why it’s impossible to tell whether a woman is pregnant based on symptoms alone. Alternatively, women can take a home ''pregnancy test'' or see a doctor if they suspect pregnancy. Home ''pregnancy tests'' are fairly reliable but may occasionally be a false-positive. This can occur for several reasons, including having an ''ectopic pregnancy'' (when the fertilized egg grows outside the womb) or even taking certain medications. Following a positive home pregnancy test with a doctor’s visit for a urine or blood test to confirm the pregnancy is the best way to confirm a pregnancy.' "
What are the first steps in prostate cancer treatment?,"'When a man receives a ''prostate cancer'' diagnosis, especially if testing shows the disease is in early stages, the doctor and patient often start with a “watch and wait” approach.''Prostate cancer'' is one of the most common ''cancers'' among men. As a result, there’s a large body of data that show what treatments are most effective at any given stage of the disease. If prostate ''cancer'' is detected early and appears to be slow-growing, invasive procedures, ''chemotherapy'', ''radiation'' and other approaches can sometimes do more harm than good.''Many prostate ''cancer'' treatments come with side effects, like ''incontinence'' or ''impotence'', so it’s in the patient’s interest to put off invasive treatments as long as is medically safe.''As long as your doctor is monitoring your early-stage prostate ''cancer'' and has signed off, you can also try diets and doctor-approved, non-invasive alternative therapy to improve prostate ''cancer symptoms'' or general health. Beware, however; herbal remedies, ''homeopathy'', and ''acupuncture'', etc., have shown limited or no effect on prostate cancer and could interfere with your doctor’s prescribed treatment. The most effective complementary/alternative therapy is focused on symptom relief rather than curing the cancer itself.' "
Observation and active surveillance of prostate cancer,"'These two options are not the same. Both observation and active surveillance therapies share in common the decision up front to hold on treatment of the cancer and to follow the cancer periodically to determine if there is progression. Observation involves monitoring the course of the prostate cancer with the goal of treating the cancer with palliative care for the development of symptoms or changes in physical examination or PSA, that suggest that symptoms will develop soon. Observation treatment is not trying to cure the cancer, rather to treat symptoms of cancer progression. Thus, observation treatment is preferred for men with low-risk prostate cancer and with a life expectancy of less than 10 years.''Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of the prostate cancer with the intent to intervene, with the intention to cure if the cancer appears to be progressing. Active surveillance is preferred for men with very low risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy of < 20 years. Cancer progression may have occurred if a repeat biopsy shows a high ''Gleason score'' (Gleason 4 or 5) or if cancer is found in a greater number of the biopsies or a greater extent of the core compared to prior biopsy.''Active surveillance has advantages and disadvantages: From an advantage standpoint, it avoids unnecessary treatment and possible side effects of such treatments. Disadvantages of active surveillance include the risk of missed opportunity for cure, although the risk of this is very low if you are followed regularly, and the need for periodic prostate biopsies and the side effects of prostate biopsy.''Observation has advantages and disadvantages. From an advantage standpoint, observation avoids/delays the possible side effects of treatment. There is, however, the risk of troubles urinating (''urinary retention'') or bone ''fractures'' occurring before treatment is started.''As reported in the journal ''European Urology'', Dr. Lu-Yao and colleagues performed a population-based cohort study that included 31,137 Medicare patients 65 years of age and older diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in 1992-2009 who initially received conservative management (no surgery, radiotherapy, ''cryotherapy'', or ''androgen''-deprivation therapy) who were followed until death or Dec. 31, 2009 (for prostate cancer specific mortality), and Dec. 31, 2011, for overall mortality and found that the 15-year outcomes with conservative management of newly diagnosed T1c Gleason 5-7 prostate cancer for men 65 years of age and older were excellent (15-year risk of prostate cancer specific mortality of 5.7%), whereas in men with T1c Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer there was a significant risk of prostatic cancer mortality (22%).' The NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer (version 2.2017) note the following for active surveillance for prostate cancer: The PSA test should be obtained no more than every 6 months unless clinical changes support more frequent testing. A DRE should be performed no more than every 12 months unless clinical changes support more frequent examination. A repeat prostate biopsy should be done within 6 months if the initial biopsy removed less than 10 cores or the examination findings were not consistent with the biopsy results. A repeat biopsy should be considered as frequently as every year to assess for progression of the cancer. If one's life expectancy is less than 10 years, then repeat biopsy is not needed. If the PSA is rising and biopsy is negative, consider multiparametric MRI."
Complementary and alternative care approaches,"'In addition to standard types of prostate cancer treatments, there are other approaches that patients may choose during their treatment for their disease.''Some of these treatments are called complementary treatments and may help with control of symptoms or problems the patient may be experiencing. Examples of these include ''acupuncture'' for ''pain'' control, ''yoga'' and meditation for relaxation, as well as guided imagery, aromatherapy, and other techniques. Tell your doctors about all treatment approaches you are engaged in. These approaches usually will be of no harm to you, and may be very beneficial. Knowing what you are doing may help your doctor to better understand and coordinate your treatments and medications.''Herbal therapies have been demonstrated in the lab to affect prostate cancer cells, but in many cases, have not been proven to be clinically effective. PC-SPES is an herbal therapy that has been used in the past for prostate cancer, for example. It was associated with an increased risk of ''blood clots''. Thus, prior to taking this or other herbal therapies, discuss these therapies with your doctor.''Be very careful about alternative treatments. The vast majority of medical professionals keep up-to-date on the latest advances, or are willing to research them for patients when asked. No truly effective treatments are being withheld from patients, though alternative care providers often say they are in an attempt to sell patients on their types of treatment. Such alternative therapies can do harm to patients, and can interfere with conventional treatment. Many alternative care providers prey on the desperation of cancer patients.''If an alternative care professional suggests nutritional ''supplements'' in addition to conventional therapy, tell all your doctors what you are taking. Some nutritional substances can interfere with the effectiveness of some conventional cancer treatments. Some ""natural"" substances can be toxic and can result in side effects or problems your regular doctor may not recognize unless they know what you are taking.''Prostate cancer patients, like all cancer patients, are frightened. Discuss your ''anxiety'' and concerns with your primary care doctor, ''urologist'', and radiation and medical oncologists. They have many ways to help.' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of labor?,"'While there are characteristic changes in the body with impending ''labor'', every woman\'s experience is unique and different. ""Normal"" can vary from woman to woman. The signs and symptoms of normal ''labor'' can begin three weeks prior to the anticipated due date up until two weeks afterward, and there is no precise way to predict exactly when a woman will go into ''labor''. This article describes the 10 most common signs and symptoms that ''labor'' is approaching.'  "
1. The baby drops,"'Medically known as ""lightening,"" this is when the baby ""drops."" The baby\'s head descends deeper into the pelvis. For some women, this occurs up to 2 weeks prior to the beginning of ''labor''; other women may not notice this event at all.' "
2. An increased urge to urinate,"""An increased urge to urinate can be a result of the baby's head dropping into the pelvis. The low position of the baby's head puts even more pressure on the urinary bladder, so many women approaching labor might feel a frequent need to urinate. As the baby drops, ""'breathing'' can become easier since there is less pressure on the ''diaphragm'' from underneath.' "
3. The mucus plug passes,"'Passage of the ''mucus'' plug is a known sign that labor is near. Thick mucus produced by the cervical glands normally keeps the cervical opening closed during ''pregnancy'"". This mucus plug must be expelled before delivery. Pressure from the baby's head causes the mucus plug to be expressed from the vagina, sometimes as blood-tinged ""'vaginal discharge'' (referred to as ""bloody show""). For some women, the mucus plug is not expelled until after labor begins; others may notice the mucus discharge in the days prior to the onset of labor.' "
4. The cervix dilates,"'Dilation of the cervix is a sign that labor is approaching, although this is detected by the health-care professional during a pelvic examination. This begins in the days and even weeks prior to the onset of labor; ""Fully dilated"" means the cervix has dilated to a width of 10 cm.' "
5. Thinning of the cervix,"'In addition to dilation, thinning (effacement) of the cervix also occurs. This occurs in the weeks prior to labor, since a thinned cervix dilates more easily. This sign is also detected by the health-care professional during a ''pelvic exam''.' "
6. Back pain,"'Many women note they experience ''back pain'', especially dull ''pain'' in the lower back that comes and goes, as labor approaches. ''Back pain'' may accompany contractions felt in other locations or may occur on its own. Women also notice loosening of the joints, particularly in the pelvic area, as the ''third trimester'' progresses, in preparation for delivery.' "
7. Contractions,"'Contractions, which can vary among women and can be described as pounding, tightening, stabbing, or similar to ''menstrual cramps'', increase in strength and frequency as labor approaches.''Irregular contractions, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions or ""''false labor'',"" occur toward the end of ''pregnancy'' during the ''third trimester''. Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually milder than those of ''true labor'', and they do not occur at regular intervals. When contractions begin to occur less than ten minutes apart, this frequently signals the onset of ''true labor''.' "
8. A burst of energy,"'In contrast to feeling extra tired as is typical of pregnancy, many women describe feeling a sudden burst of energy and excitement in the weeks prior to labor. Often referred to as ""nesting,"" this impulse often is accompanied by a sense of urgency to get things done or make plans for the baby.' "
9. Feeling the urge to have a bowel movement (diarrhea),'Women often describe the ''pelvic pain'' and pressure as feeling the urge to have a bowel movement. Some women also report experiencing ''diarrhea'' or loose bowel movements in the days preceding labor.' 
10. Your water breaks,"'Rupture of the amniotic membranes, or one\'s ""water breaking,"" usually is a sign that labor has begun. Despite how it is often portrayed in movies, it is typically not a dramatic gush of fluid, but rather a slower dripping or trickle. ''Amniotic fluid'' should be colorless and odorless. It can sometimes be hard to distinguish from urine, but ''amniotic fluid'' does not have an odor. If you are leaking amniotic fluid, it is essential to contact your health-care professional right away.' "
What is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?,"'HIV'' is a blood-borne virus, a member of the Retroviridae family that can be transmitted by sexual intercourse, intravenous drug materials contaminated by the virus, mother-to-child during birth or ''breastfeeding'' and cause immunodeficiency in the person infected. Diagnosis is done by having a positive lab test for ''HIV''. There is no cure for ''HIV''; but antiretroviral treatment can control the virus so patients can live long and healthy lives.' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of HIV infection?,"'The early signs and symptoms of stage 1 ''HIV'' infection resemble those that occur with the ''flu'' and may include:'  Fever Sore throat Muscle pain Joint pain Swollen lymph nodes (often the earliest sign) Rash on skin (trunk, face, limbs) Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Mouth ulcers Thrush Genital ulcers Night sweats Weakness and fatigue"
When do the early signs and symptoms of HIV appear?,"'HIV''\xa0early signs and symptoms may appear after about 2-6 weeks after exposure to the virus. In most patients, the symptoms gradually resolve over a few weeks; some patients have mild or no symptoms. Later in the disease process (progressive immunologic impairment), stages 2 and 3. The early symptoms reoccur and become more severe. Some ''HIV''-related infections are more severe in women (for example, fungal disease especially vaginal yeast infections, and ''cervical dysplasia''). These later, Stage 3 or ''AIDS'', symptoms may also begin, and include:'  Weight loss High fevers Nail changes (fingers and/or toes) Genital and Oral Herpes Breathing problems Chronic cough (persists and does not go away) Diseases and infections associated with immunologic impairment (fungal infections, pneumonias, and others, for example) Mental changes (memory loss, confusion, for example)"
Are the early signs and symptoms of HIV different in men and women?,"'Most of the opportunistic infections that arise when an HIV patient progresses to ''AIDS'' are the same in men and women. Severe ''weight loss'', ''pain'' with eating, skin ''rashes'' and ''cancers'', and recurrent pneumonias are some of the more common problems that occur with ''AIDS'' patients. Some HIV-related infections are more severe in women, for example, ''cervical dysplasia'' (precancer of the cervix), and ''fungal infections'' like vaginal yeast infections.' "
What are the 3 stages of HIV? When does HIV infection transition to AIDs?,"'There are 3 stages of HIV infection.' Stage 1: Flu-like symptoms after initial HIV infection (some patients have few or no symptoms) Stage 2: Clinically latency (HIV inactivity and/or slow progression of immunologic impairment) may last for 10 or more years in some individuals; Stage 3: After HIV reactivation and/or HIV’s progressive attack on the immune system, the damaged immune system has a reduced or an inability to protect the individual from serious infections and other illnesses. This stage is termed AIDS. In this stage, lab testing reveals high viral loads and CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3."
What are the signs and symptoms of AIDS?,"'Having an infection with the HIV virus does not automatically mean that the patient has ''AIDS''. As the HIV virus infects more and more CD4 (immune) cells and makes more copies of itself, the patient’s immune system gets overwhelmed and begins to falter. When the immune system breaks down due to HIV infection, opportunistic infections like fungal infections, pneumonias, and ''cancers'' can occur. When this level of HIV infection occurs, it is called ''AIDS'' (''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'').''Some of the signs and symptoms of progression of HIV to ''AIDS'' are:'  Extreme fatigue Chronic diarrhea Infections and rashes of the mouth, anus, or genitals Extreme weight loss Fever and night sweats Lymph glands swelling Recurrent Pneumonia Chronic cough and shortness of breath Memory loss Depression"

This begins in the days and even weeks prior to the onset of labor; ""Fully dilated"" means the cervix has dilated to a width of 10 cm.' "
5. Thinning of the cervix,"'In addition to dilation, thinning (effacement) of the cervix also occurs. This occurs in the weeks prior to labor, since a thinned cervix dilates more easily. This sign is also detected by the health-care professional during a ''pelvic exam''.' "
6. Back pain,"'Many women note they experience ''back pain'', especially dull ''pain'' in the lower back that comes and goes, as labor approaches. ''Back pain'' may accompany contractions felt in other locations or may occur on its own. Women also notice loosening of the joints, particularly in the pelvic area, as the ''third trimester'' progresses, in preparation for delivery.' "
7. Contractions,"'Contractions, which can vary among women and can be described as pounding, tightening, stabbing, or similar to ''menstrual cramps'', increase in strength and frequency as labor approaches.''Irregular contractions, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions or ""''false labor'',"" occur toward the end of ''pregnancy'' during the ''third trimester''. Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually milder than those of ''true labor'', and they do not occur at regular intervals. When contractions begin to occur less than ten minutes apart, this frequently signals the onset of ''true labor''.' "
8. A burst of energy,"'In contrast to feeling extra tired as is typical of pregnancy, many women describe feeling a sudden burst of energy and excitement in the weeks prior to labor. Often referred to as ""nesting,"" this impulse often is accompanied by a sense of urgency to get things done or make plans for the baby.' "
9. Feeling the urge to have a bowel movement (diarrhea),'Women often describe the ''pelvic pain'' and pressure as feeling the urge to have a bowel movement. Some women also report experiencing ''diarrhea'' or loose bowel movements in the days preceding labor.' 
10. Your water breaks,"'Rupture of the amniotic membranes, or one\'s ""water breaking,"" usually is a sign that labor has begun. Despite how it is often portrayed in movies, it is typically not a dramatic gush of fluid, but rather a slower dripping or trickle. ''Amniotic fluid'' should be colorless and odorless. It can sometimes be hard to distinguish from urine, but ''amniotic fluid'' does not have an odor. If you are leaking amniotic fluid, it is essential to contact your health-care professional right away.' "
What is penile cancer?,"'Penile ''cancer'' is a relatively rare type of ''cancer'' arising from the skin and tissues of the penis. It affects the skin and tissues of the penis. It occurs when normal cells in the penis become cancerous and grow rapidly out of control, forming a tumor. Penile cancer can spread to other parts of the body.' "
What causes penile cancer?,"'Certain factors increase the risk of penile cancer:' Uncircumcised men: Men who are uncircumcised are at a high risk of penile cancer. This is possibly due to the fact that an uncircumcised penis is at a high risk of other conditions such as phimosis (the foreskin becomes tight and difficult to retract) and smegma (a substance formed when dead skin cells and oil accumulate beneath the foreskin). Multiple sexual partners increase the risk of penile cancer. Chronic balanitis (swelling of the head of the penis) is a risk factor for penile cancer. Carcinoma in situ of the penis as seen in erythroplasia of Queyrat and Bowen disease increases the risk of cancer. Penile trauma and micro-tears that spread to prepare may increase the risk of cancer in rare cases. Men who are aged over 60 years are at high risk. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of penile cancer. Men who live in areas of poor hygiene are at an increased risk of penile cancer. Poor personal hygiene, especially of the genitals, increases the risk of penile cancer. Having sexually transmitted diseases such as human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor for penile cancer."
What are the stages of penile cancer?,"'The stage of cancer describes the extent and severity of cancer. The treatment and prognosis of cancer depend on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis:' Stage 0: Cancer is limited to the top layer of the skin and had not spread to any other part of the body. Stage 1: Cancer spreads into the deeper layer and connective tissue below the skin. It is still limited to just the penis and does not spread to other parts of the body. Stage 2: Cancer spreads to the connective tissue below the skin, lymph vessels, and/or blood vessels. It spreads to the urethra and/or erectile tissues. It still doesn’t spread to other parts of the body at this stage. Stage 3A: Cancer spreads to one or two lymph nodes in the groin but not to other parts of the body. Stage 3B: Cancer spreads to multiple lymph nodes in the groin but not to other parts of the body. Stage 4: Cancer spreads to the surrounding areas such as the prostate, scrotum, and pubic bone (hip bone)."
How is penile cancer treated?,"'The treatment of penile cancer depends on the extent of cancer. To decide the treatment plan, penile cancer is categorized into non-invasive (cancer is superficial and limited to the penis) and invasive (cancer spreads deep into the penis tissue and surrounding areas).''Treatment options for non-invasive penile cancer:''Treatment options for invasive penile cancer:\xa0' Topical chemotherapy: Intraepithelial neoplasms such as Bowen disease or erythroplasia of Queyrat may be treated with topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod. This may be followed by topical imiquimod application. Circumcision: The foreskin of the penis is removed if the only prepuce is involved. Chemotherapy: Drugs are administered to kill cancer cells in the body. Radiation therapy: Radiation such as X-rays are used to kill cancer cells. However, squamous cell cancers are resistant. Laser therapy: Laser energy is used to kill cancer cells. Cryosurgery: Liquid nitrogen freezes tumors, causing them to fall off. Excisional surgery: The surgeon only removes the affected area and a rim of healthy tissue surrounding it.  Moh’s surgery: In Moh’s surgery, the goal is to remove as little tissue as possible while removing the tumor. The surgeon removes a thin layer of the affected area that is examined under the microscope to check for cancer cells. The process is repeated until there are no cancer cells in the samples. Partial or total penectomy: A partial penectomy involves removing part of the penis, whereas total penectomy is the total removal of the penis. The choice of surgery depends on the size of the tumor and the extent of the penis affected. Penis reconstructive surgery may be performed following partial or total penectomy. Biological therapy: Certain drugs may be used that only attack the cancer cells and spare normal body cells."
What’s the prognosis of penile cancer?,"'The prognosis of penile cancer depends on the stage of cancer, age of the patient, overall health, and response to treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment can lead to full recovery. The five-year survival rate for people with tumors that are limited to the penis is approximately\xa085%. Once the cancer spreads to the surrounding lymph nodes and tissues, the five-year survival rate decreases to around 59%.' "
15 Early warning signs and symptoms of pregnancy,"'The signs and ''symptoms of pregnancy'' differ from woman to woman. All the signs of ''pregnancy'' may not be seen in one person. Additionally, the signs may appear in different persons at different times. Below are a few common signs and symptoms that may indicate early pregnancy:' Missed menstrual cycle: It is the most common symptom of early pregnancy. If a woman has missed her period by a week or more, there is a chance that she might be pregnant. However, this symptom can be misleading if the menstrual cycle is irregular. Spotting: Blood or spotting on the panty prior to the monthly date is one of the early symptoms of pregnancy. About a week after conception, the embryo pushes itself into the wall of the uterus (or womb). This causes some light bleeding or spots of blood to appear on the panty. Vaginal discharge: Some women experience a thick, milky discharge from the vagina in early pregnancy. It is not associated with itching and foul odor. Vulva changes: Chadwick’s sign is one of the early signs and symptoms of pregnancy. The vulva and vagina turn bluish in color. This happens because more blood is needed in that area to build the tissue for pregnancy. Nausea with or without vomiting: Morning sickness, which may strike at any time of the day or night, often begins about four weeks after a woman becomes pregnant. Some women feel nausea earlier and some never experience it. Research emphasizes that pregnancy hormones may play a role in this symptom.  Increased urination: Some women have increased urination frequency around the sixth to eighth week due to hormonal changes. Fatigue or tiredness: Fatigue is a high-ranked symptom among early symptoms of pregnancy. During early pregnancy, levels of the hormone progesterone increase, which make a patient feel sleepy or tired. Breast and nipple changes: Tender or swollen breasts are an early sign of pregnancy. Hormonal changes might make the breasts sensitive and sore. Usually, nipples may become larger and darker as the pregnancy progresses. Women may also notice small, goose bump or pimple-like white areas on their areola, which may be an early sign of pregnancy. Some women get a tingling feeling in their nipples as one of the early symptoms of pregnancy. The surge in hormones in the body causes an increased blood supply to the breasts, which causes the tingling sensation. Back pain: Having backache is a common symptom and an early sign of pregnancy. It may be accompanied by cramps like those felt during the period. It is because the body is getting ready for the baby. Headaches: The sudden change in hormones in the body can cause these headaches early in pregnancy. Headache with tiredness and sensitivity to light and noise may be an early sign of pregnancy. Leg cramps: It is quite common for women to suffer from leg cramps during pregnancy, and they might notice it a lot more in the early stages. This has been linked to having less calcium in the blood because it’s being taken by the baby. Food habits: Loss of appetite or aversion toward favorite food is one the early signs of pregnancy. Pregnancy can really mess with eating habits. Changes in taste and a heightened sense of smell are very common and can persist throughout pregnancy. This sign is the strongest early on. Many women notice a strange, sour, slightly metallic taste in their mouth when they first become pregnant. This happens because of the pregnancy hormone progesterone. Food cravings: Having random food cravings is one of the most common early signs and symptoms of pregnancy. It’s caused by the body craving for what it needs. For example, some women want combinations such as fish and ice cream; this could be because of a lack of proteins and sugars. Stomach cramping and/or bloating: The pregnancy hormone progesterone can cause the stomach to feel full, rounded, and bloated. Few women experience abnormal feelings inside their stomach in the early stage of pregnancy that replicate the sensation of their muscles being pulled and stretched, usually referred to as abdominal twinges or bloating, which is one of the early signs of pregnancy. Constipation is also a common sign in pregnancy. Mood fluctuations: The flood of hormones in the body in early pregnancy can make women unusually emotional and weepy. Mood swings also are common symptom of pregnancy."
What causes autism?,"'Autism or autistic spectrum disorder is a condition in which the individual cannot process sound, colors, and emotions like an average person. This causes them to have mannerisms like poor speech, anger issues, and certain repetitive behaviors (picking skin, twirling, neck movements).''Autism is diagnosed in childhood at around two years of age. Rarely, it may not be diagnosed until a person is an adult.''The following factors may predispose a person to develop autistic behaviors:' Genetic factors: Scans show differences in brain shape and structure in people with autism. Scientists think these changes are genetic (a part of a child’s deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA). It is more common if a relative is affected by the autistic spectrum. Environmental factors: Autism is more frequently observed in the children conceived to the parents who were aged more than 35 years. If a mother has taken drugs like Thalidomide or antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy, the chances of autistic disorder in a child are high."
How to diagnose,"'There is no single test that can be used to diagnose autism.' Evaluations rule out hearing problems, speech, and language problems. These evaluations are very important because autism has a big effect on overall communication skills. Checklists and surveys from parents, school staff, and other doctors who have observed the person in various situations. The questionnaires ask about the person’s behaviors, relationships with others, body use, verbal communication, and play habits. The modified checklist for autism in toddlers, revised with follow-up (M-CHAT-R/F) is a brief checklist of yes/no items for early detection among children 16 to 30 months of age. Autism diagnostic interview-revised (ADI-R) is a semi-structured interview with the child’s parents used by a trained specialist to help make a definitive diagnosis. Autism diagnostic observation schedule-generic (ADOS-G) is a structured interview with directed activities also used by a trained specialist to help make a definitive diagnosis. The childhood autism rating scale (CARS) observes a child’s behavior and uses a 15-point scale to evaluate a child’s relationship to people, body use, and adaptation to change, listening response, and verbal communication. Think Asperger test is a brief screening tool in a portable mobile app format that aids in the informal detection of autism for parents, teachers, and medical professionals. As per the latest research, magnetic resonance imaging or MRI and a few blood tests may help a doctor diagnose a patient with autism. However, the research is still in clinical trials."
How to treat autism,"'The goal is to reduce symptoms and improve their learning and development.' Applied behavior analysis (ABA): This is usually followed in schools and clinics. It helps the child respond appropriately to positive behaviors and reduce the negative ones. Developmental, individual differences, relationship-based approach (DIR): It is meant to support emotional and intellectual growth by helping him learn skills around communication and emotions. This kind of treatment involves the parent or caretaker getting on the floor with the child to play and do the activities they like. Treatment and education of autistic and related communication-handicapped children (TEACCH): This treatment uses visual cues, such as picture cards, to help the child learn everyday skills like getting dressed. The picture exchange communication system (PECS): It uses symbols instead of picture cards. The child learns to ask questions and communicate through special symbols. Occupational therapy: This treatment helps the child learn life skills like feeding and dressing himself, bathing, and understanding how to relate to other people. The skills he learns are meant to help him live as independently as he can. Sensory integration therapy: If the child is easily upset by things like bright lights, certain sounds, or the feeling of being touched, this therapy can help him learn to deal with that kind of sensory information. Medications: There is currently no medication to treat it. However, some medicines can help with related symptoms like depression, seizures, insomnia, and trouble focusing.Risperidone (Risperdal): It can be prescribed for children between 5 and 16 years old to help with irritability.Some doctors will prescribe other drugs in certain cases, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antianxiety medications, or stimulants, but they are not United States Food and Drug Administration-approved to treat autism spectrum disorder. Risperidone (Risperdal): It can be prescribed for children between 5 and 16 years old to help with irritability. Some doctors will prescribe other drugs in certain cases, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antianxiety medications, or stimulants, but they are not United States Food and Drug Administration-approved to treat autism spectrum disorder."
What is colon cancer?,"'Colon cancer'' or ''colorectal cancer'' is a type of ''cancer'' that affects the gut (intestine). The colon is the first part of the large bowel that measures around 4-5 ''feet''. ''Cancer'' develops because of the uncontrolled growth of cells in the inner lining of the colon or rectum (the passageway that connects the colon to the anus). According to experts, around 5% of Americans will develop ''colorectal cancer'' during their life. The ''cancer'' is often detected at later stages. It may begin as abnormal tissue growths called polyps. Regular screening to detect polyps before they turn into colon cancer may help detect cancer at an early stage when it may be curable.' "
10 Early signs of colon cancer,"'Colon or ''colorectal'' cancer may not cause any symptoms during the early stages of the disease. A person may have polyps or colon cancer but may not have any symptoms till the late stages of the disease. Hence, regular screening may help detect cancer early. Most early signs of colon cancer may be mistaken for other more common diseases and vice versa. For instance, a change in bowel habits may be caused by a bowel infection or the presence of ''blood in the stool'' may be because of ''piles'' or ''hemorrhoids''. Hence, you must consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.''Some of the early signs and ''symptoms of colon cancer'' include:' Presence of blood in stool that may be red or dark in color Change in bowel habits that may be constipation or diarrhea Aches, cramps, or pain in the tummy that do not go away Unintended or unexplained loss of weight Bloating or gas Passing narrowing stools that may last for several days Feeling weak or getting tired easily A constant urge to have a bowel movement coupled with the feeling that the bowel does not empty completely Nausea or vomiting Pale skin"
What are the risk factors for developing colon cancer?,"'Several factors can increase the risk of colon cancer. Some common risk factors are:' Age: The risk of getting colorectal cancer increases with age. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 90% of colorectal cancers occur in people who are of age 50 years or more. Family history: People who have a family history (especially in parents or siblings) of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer may have a higher risk of getting the disease than those without a positive family history. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD): IBD, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Being overweight or obese: Individuals who are overweight or obese may be more likely to get colorectal cancer. Sedentary lifestyle: A lack of physical activity can increase the risk of getting colorectal cancer. Unhealthy diet: A diet rich in processed meats, fatty foods, or fried foods and deficient in fiber (including fruits and vegetables) may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Alcohol: Chances of getting colorectal cancer may be increased because of alcohol consumption. Tobacco: Consumption of tobacco may increase the risk of various cancers including colon cancer. History of other cancers: A personal history of other cancers, such as cancer of the breast, uterus, or ovaries, may increase the risk of colon cancer."
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is a progressive disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). ''MS'' is an autoimmune disease; the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the cells of the nervous system. The immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers, eventually resulting in deterioration of the nerves and permanent damage of the nerves. ''MS'' is a disease with flares and symptom-free intervals. The symptoms of the disease become worse over time (relapsing), followed by periods of less severe symptoms (remitting) without asymptotic periods. The exact cause is not known but there are several risk factors, such as:''The signs and symptoms of\xa0MS\xa0vary depending on the nerves affected and the extent of nerve damage. MS can progress leading to permanent disabilities, while others may experience long periods of remission (asymptomatic periods) without any new symptoms. There is no cure for ''multiple sclerosis''; however, there are several treatment options available to manage symptoms and modify the course of the disease and slow the progression. With treatment, most people with MS have a normal life expectancy. Without treatment, the disease progresses leading to debilitating complications.' Age: MS commonly occurs between 20 and 40 years of age but can occur at any age. Sex: Women are two to three times more prone to develop the disease than men. Family history: The risk of developing the disease increases if one of the parents, grandparents, or siblings have the disease. Certain infections: Infections like infectious mononucleosis (kissing disease) caused by the Epstein-Barr virus can increase the risk of MS. Race: People with lighter skin tone, especially those of Northern European descent, are at the highest risk of developing MS, while Asians have the lowest risk. Vitamin D deficiency: Having low levels of Vitamin D can increase the risk of MS. Other autoimmune diseases: Having other autoimmune disorders, such as psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), can increase the risk of MS. Smoking: Smoking may increase the risk of developing MS."
What are the early signs of multiple sclerosis?,"'MS presents differently in different individuals affected. Some people may only have mild symptoms, while for others, it may be debilitating, losing the ability to read, write, speak, or walk.\xa0The twenty-four early ''symptoms of MS'' include:' Numbness in the hands and feet Tingling and pins and needles sensation over the extremities Shooting pains in the back when in a hot shower Muscle pain and cramps Muscle stiffness Generalized body pain Increased frequency of urination and inability to hold urine Scanning slow speech Twitching of face muscles Diarrhea or constipation Loss of bowel control Facial pain Eye pain Decreased vision Diplopia (double vision) Intolerance to heat Fatigue and weakness Giddiness Reduced attention span, concentration, memory, and judgment Personality changes Depression Seizures Difficulty walking and maintaining balance The symptoms can worsen in women after menopause"
What are the complications of multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' can lead to the following complications:' Stiffness and spasms of the muscles Paralysis, typically in the legs, leading to the inability to walk Loss of bowel and bladder Sexual dysfunction Personality changes Depression Euphoria Epilepsy Pneumonia"
What is rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is a type of inflammatory ''arthritis'' and autoimmune disease.' RA disease is characterized by chronic joint inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis in the knee, hands, fingers, and feet is common. RA may also be called rheumatoid disease because at times rheumatoid arthritis causes systemic illness that impacts many organs of the body. Chronic inflammation of RA can cause permanent joint destruction and deformity."
What are early signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'While early signs and ''symptoms of RA'' can be mimicked by other diseases, the warning signs and symptoms are very characteristic of ''rheumatoid disease''. The 16 early ''RA symptoms'' and signs discussed in this article include the following:'   Fatigue Joint pain Joint tenderness Joint swelling Joint redness Joint warmth Joint stiffness Loss of joint range of motion Many joints affected (polyarthritis) Limping Joint deformity Both sides of the body affected (symmetric) Loss of joint function Anemia Fever Depression"
Fatigue,"'Fatigue'' is a very common symptom in all stages of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', particularly when the ''joint inflammation'' is active. ''Fatigue'' in ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" can be caused by the body's reaction to inflammation, poor ""'sleep'', ''anemia'', and medications.''The ''fatigue'' of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' that results in ''lack of energy'' can adversely affect emotions and mood, occupation, relationships with people, sex drive, productivity, attentiveness, creativity, and ''happiness''. ''Fatigue'' from ''rheumatoid arthritis'' can also be associated with other symptoms and signs, such as ''poor appetite'' and ''weight loss''.' "
Joint pain,"'Joint pain'' from ''rheumatoid arthritis'' is caused by the inflammation present in a joint when the disease is active. Joint ''pain'' can also occur when the disease is inactive or controlled if the joint has been damaged by rheumatoid ''arthritis'' in the past.''Active rheumatoid arthritis flare-ups cause the joint to swell because of both thickening of the joint lining tissue (synovium) and because of excess joint fluid. The swollen, inflamed joint stretches and irritates the capsule that surrounds the joint. The joint capsule has nerves endings within it that immediately send ''pain'' signals to the brain.''Past rheumatoid arthritis can lead to permanent joint destruction with damaged cartilage, bone, and ligaments. When the damaged joint is used, it can cause intense pain.' "
Joint tenderness,"'Rheumatoid arthritis characteristically leads to tenderness of involved joints. This is because the inflamed joint lining tissue has irritated the nerves in the joint capsule. When the irritated joint capsule is compressed by external pressure, such as from touching the joint, it is frequently tender. The pain elicited from compression is immediate. This is one of the reasons that rheumatoid arthritis can lead to difficulty sleeping and ''insomnia''.' "
Joint swelling,"'Swollen joints'' are very common in rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes the ''joint swelling'' is minimal and can be difficult to appreciate. Other times the joint swelling is very apparent. Generally, people who are affected by rheumatoid arthritis can easily tell when their joints are swollen. The joint swelling can lead to loss of range of motion of the joint. Joint swelling in the fingers can make it hard to get rings off and on easily.' "
Joint redness,'Redness occurs over joints when they are inflamed. The redness in the skin over an inflamed joint from rheumatoid arthritis occurs because the capillaries of that skin are widened by the adjacent inflammation. These widened capillaries are referred to as dilated capillaries. ''Joint redness'' does not occur in all inflamed joints from rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes the inflammation in the joint is inadequate to cause the capillaries in the skin to dilate.' 
Joint warmth,"'Warmth of the joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis is a sign of active inflammation. Doctors look for ''joint warmth'' as they monitor the activity of the disease. As rheumatoid arthritis responds to treatment, joint warmth resolves. Sometimes joint warmth is present without visible joint swelling or redness.' "
Joint stiffness,"'Stiffness'' is a typical rheumatoid arthritis symptom. Joints that are affected by active rheumatoid arthritis are inflamed and characteristically stiffer in the morning than later in the day. Doctors use the duration of the morning ''stiffness'' as a measure of the severity of the active joint inflammation. As rheumatoid arthritis responds to treatment, the duration of the morning ''joint stiffness'' diminishes.' "
Joint deformity,'Joint deformity can occur from chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Deformity in rheumatoid arthritis occurs because the unchecked inflammation leads to\xa0erosions of cartilage and bone as well as ligament loosening (laxity). Early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is critical to prevent permanent joint damage and joint deformity.' 
Loss of joint range of motion,"'As the joints of rheumatoid arthritis become more inflamed with active disease, they tend to have incomplete range of motion. The range of motion is limited by the swelling within the joint. This is typically associated with ''weakness'' in the involved areas.''Joints affected by longstanding rheumatoid arthritis commonly lose range of motion permanently.' "
Many joints affected (polyarthritis),"'Usually, but not always, rheumatoid arthritis affects many joints. Classically, ''RA'' affects the small joints of the hands and wrists and balls of the ''feet''. Also, not uncommonly, knees, elbows, hips, ankles, and shoulders can be inflamed.''Sometimes, only a few joints are involved. Less frequently, a singular joint is involved. Both of these scenarios are more common in childhood inflammatory arthritis (''juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'').''When four or more joints are inflamed, the condition is referred to as polyarthritis. When only a few joints are inflamed, it is referred to as oligoarthritis. When a single joint is inflamed, it is referred to as monoarthritis.' "
Limping,"'Limping'' from poor lower extremity function can be caused by many diseases of the nerves, muscles, and bones of the lower extremities. Limping frequently occurs when rheumatoid arthritis affects the hips, knees, ankles, or feet. Pain, loss of range of motion, and joint swelling all can cause a person with rheumatoid arthritis to have a noticeable limp. It is not unusual for a young child with rheumatoid arthritis to have a painless limp as the first sign of the rheumatoid disease.' "
Both sides of the body affected (symmetric),"'Typically, the distribution of the joints involved in a person with rheumatoid arthritis is similar on both sides of the body. This symmetric joint involvement is a feature of classic rheumatoid arthritis. This does not mean that joint involvement is always symmetric, but it is common.''Rheumatoid arthritis usually (not always) involves many joints on both sides of the body. It is, therefore, sometimes referred to as a symmetric polyarticular form of arthritis. Accordingly, the small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet are commonly affected. The knees, ankles, shoulders, hips, and elbows can also be involved in early disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation in these joints. Early manifestations of this inflammation can be gradual or rapidly intense. The joint inflammation causes stiffness, usually worse in the morning or after being sedentary. It also causes warmth, swelling, redness, and pain in varying degrees. The joint can be very subtly affected with slight swelling or markedly affected with substantial loss of range of motion. The pain level can be completely disabling and does not always correlate with the degree of apparent inflammation.''As described above, the manner that each of the symptoms affects an individual can be very different from individual to individual and can vary during the day. The intensity and effect of each of the symptoms is dependent upon the ''RA'"" patient's age, activity, the medications he or she takes, as well as any additional medical conditions that are present."" "
Loss of joint function,"'Because rheumatoid arthritis leads to pain, swelling, and tenderness of the involved joints, there is loss of joint function. The swelling and sensitivity impedes the full motion and stability of the joint and it becomes incapable of carrying the movement with confidence, balance, and completeness. This loss of joint function leads to limping, lack of coordination, loss of grip and dexterity, and disability.' "
Anemia,'The chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis commonly causes the bone marrow to decrease the release of ''red blood cells'' into the circulation. This lowers the red blood count to cause ''anemia'' when rheumatoid arthritis is active. It is not unusual for the ''anemia'' of rheumatoid arthritis to spontaneously correct as the inflammation of the disease is quieted by treatment.' 
Fever,"'Fever'', while not common in rheumatoid arthritis, does occur in some patients when the disease is actively causing inflammation. Typically, there is only mild low-grade temperature elevation and this corrects rapidly as the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis is treated. Because patients with rheumatoid arthritis frequently require medications that can decrease the normal immune response, it is important that when they develop ''fever'', infection is considered as a possible cause. Infections can require aggressive treatment and interruption of some underlying rheumatoid treatments.' "
Depression,"'Because rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic condition potentially associated with pain and disability, it can lead to ''depression''. A person with rheumatoid arthritis can commonly feel frustrated, but it can also lead to real ''depression'' with sadness, hopelessness, and blue mood that goes beyond frustration. Doctors refer to this form of mood change as ""reactive ''depression''"" because it is a person\'s response to a particular situation, in this case, a new chronic disease. When patients feel ''depressed'', regardless of cause, it is essential to share their feelings with their health care provider. Over time, this can lead to a much healthier understanding of their bodies and improvement and resolution of their depression.' "
What are the less common forms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis can begin in less common forms. For example, it can begin with involvement of only a single joint or a few joints. Sometimes, this can later evolve to the more common presentation of many joints on both sides of the body.''Rarely, the earliest symptom of rheumatoid disease is inflammation of a body area that does not even involve a joint. For example, the lining of the ''lungs'' (pleura) can become inflamed to cause ''pleurisy'' many months before the arthritis develops. ''Occasionally, only a few joints are involved and the doctor may suspect another type of inflammatory arthritis. (There are over 100 forms of arthritis!) Again, this can sometimes only later evolve to become the more typical symmetrical polyarthritis by including many joints on both sides of the body. ''The caveat is that by recognizing early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis ''rheumatologists'' and their patients can address the disease early, thereby affording optimal outcomes for those affected.'  "
What is colon cancer?,"'Colon cancer'' is a type of ''cancer'' that begins in the cells lining the ''large intestine'' (colon); some researchers include the rectum and prefer the term ''colorectal cancer''. There are over 101,000 new cases of colon ''cancer'' every year in the U.S. Colon ''cancer'' is the third-leading cause of ''cancer'' death in the U.S. for both men and women.\xa0' "
What are the early warning signs of colon cancer?,"'Unlike some diseases, ''colon cancer'' typically dies not produce symptoms or signs in its early stages. This is why following screening recommendations is critical. The earlier a colon ''cancer'' is detected, the greater the likelihood of successful treatment.''Colon ''cancer'' may begin to produce symptoms and signs as it grows and expands. However, there is no specific sign or symptom that definitely indicates colon cancer is present. When signs and symptoms do occur, the following are some of the most typical signs of colon cancer:'  A persistent change in bowel habits Narrow or pencil-thin stools Diarrhea or constipation Blood in the stool, rectal bleeding (blood may appear as bright red blood or dark stools) Persistent abdominal pain or discomfort, such as cramps or bloating A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely Unexplained weight loss Fatigue, tiredness, or weakness"
What are the stages of colon cancer?,"'The stages of colon cancer refer to the extent of spread of the cancer at the time that it is identified. There are 4 main stages of colon cancer, referred to as stages 1-4.'  Stage 1 colon cancer has spread from the lining of the large intestine into the muscular wall of the large intestine. Stage 2 colon cancer has spread through the wall of the intestine to the outermost layer and may grow into adjacent organs. Stage 3 colon cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the area or to other organs in the area. Stage 4 colon cancer is metastatic colon cancer. It has spread away from the colon to other parts of the body such as the liver, bones, or lungs. The term Stage 0 is sometimes used for a very early cancer that only affects the lining of the intestine. This has been also referred to as carcinoma in situ."
What other conditions have the same signs and symptoms as colon cancer?,"'There are other conditions that can cause the same signs and symptoms as colon cancer. Some of these conditions are very common.'  Bleeding in the stool can be caused by inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis (UC) as well as ulcers and diverticulitis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may cause changes in bowel habits including diarrhea and constipation along with bloating and abdominal discomfort. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to discuss them with your healthcare practitioner to help determine the cause of your symptoms."
What is dementia?,'Dementia'' is a term that describes a chronic or persistent disorder of mental processing.' 
What are the early warning signs and symptoms of dementia?,"'Dementia'' may produce a group of signs and symptoms that become more severe over time. Some doctors believe that the early warning signs and stages include a decline in memory, counting, and reasoning and language abilities. However, early signs of Alzheimer’s (and other types of ''dementia'') may be first noticed by a family member or other person.''Potential early warning signs and symptoms of ''dementia'' include:''Some early warnings symptoms do not appear until later in the disease.'  Memory loss. Misplacing items (keys, glasses). Confusion about time and place (location). Difficulty planning or problem solving. Poor work performance. Problems understanding visual information. Forgetting familiar names. Difficulty doing familiar tasks. Getting lost easily. Poor judgment or decision-making. Withdrawal from socializing. Changes in personality or mood (for example, unusually angry). Can't control emotions. Problems with speaking or writing. Acting impulsively. Problems resisting emotions to use or touch objects while walking past them, for example, walking past the phone ringing but do not answer it. A lack of interested in things they normally enjoy. Have problems starting activities."
What are the 7 stages of dementia?,"'There are multiple staging systems for ''dementia'', the most used are the seven-stage system and the three-stage system. Some doctors believe that an increase in the severity of signs and stages of the disease as mild, moderate or severe ''dementia''. However, all staging methods are based on the symptoms, and because each individual is different; however, all systems describe early (and later) signs and symptoms that increase in severity over time.'  Stage 1: No cognitive decline Stage 2: Age associated memory impairment Stage 3: Mild cognitive impairment Stage 4: Mild dementia Stage 5: Moderate dementia Stage 6: Moderately severe dementia Stage 7: Severe dementia"
What are the early warning signs of pancreatic cancer?,"'Pancreatic cancer'' does not show its signs and symptoms in its early stages. Only when it has grown large enough, it begins to exhibit its warning signs and symptoms.\xa0''But having these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that you have ''pancreatic cancer''. They can be due to some other conditions. Hence, it is important to check with your doctor when you notice them.' Jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin): Most people with pancreatic cancer have jaundice as one of their first symptoms. Darker urine, light-colored or greasy stools, and itchy skin are other signs and symptoms found in pancreatic cancer. Belly or back pain: Pain in the abdomen or back is common in pancreatic cancer. Belly pain is caused due to the large pancreatic tumors pressing on the surrounding organs. Back pain is due to the pressing of the large pancreatic mass on the nerves. Unintended weight loss Poor appetite Nausea and vomiting (usually worsened by eating) Enlarged gallbladder or liver Deep vein thrombosis or DVT (blood clots in a large vein, usually in the leg) Diabetes"
What are the types of pancreatic cancer?,"'Pancreatic ''cancer'' can be either of the two types:\xa0''Exocrine pancreatic ''cancers'','' the most common type of ''pancreas cancer'', make up for 95% of all pancreatic cancers. They are again of the following types based on the presence of the type of cells:''Pancreatic ''adenocarcinoma'':\xa0''More than 90% of cancers of the exocrine pancreas are adenocarcinomas.''Less common exocrine pancreatic cancers are:''Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers,'' also known as endocrine or ''islet cell tumors'' are rare pancreatic tumors that make up for the rest 5% of pancreatic cancers.' Exocrine pancreatic cancer: Cancer of a part of the pancreas (exocrine) that secretes enzymes that aid digestion Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer: Cancer of a part of the pancreas (neuroendocrine) that secretes hormones such as insulin and glucagon Adenosquamous carcinomas Squamous cell carcinomas Signet ring cell carcinomas Undifferentiated carcinomas Undifferentiated carcinomas with giant cells"
What are the stages of pancreatic cancer?,"'The National Cancer Institute has classified the progression of pancreatic cancer into four stages ranging from I to IV with stage 0 being the earliest stage.''Unlike many cancers, however, patients with pancreatic cancer are typically grouped into three categories:\xa0''Initial therapy often differs for patients in these three groups.' Stage 0: Also known as carcinoma in situ, at this stage, cancer is found only in the upper layers of the pancreatic ducts. This stage cannot be identified by imaging tests or even by the naked eye.  Stage I: Cancer has reached deeper into the pancreas. Stage one can be Stage IA: The tumor is ≤2 cm in size Stage IB: The tumor is >2 cm but ≤4 cm in size Stage II: Tumor size is > 4cm and cancer may have spread from the pancreas to lymph nodes or nearby organs.  Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby organs, but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to other nearby organs. Stage III: Cancer has spread to the major blood vessels surrounding the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Stage IV: Also known as end-stage pancreatic cancer or metastatic pancreatic cancer, this stage is characterized by the spread of cancer to other organs, such as the liver, lung, and bones.  those with local disease,  those with locally advanced, unresectable disease, and  those with metastatic disease. "
What is the survival rate for pancreatic cancer?,"'Pancreatic cancer is the ninth most common cancer in women and the tenth most common cancer in men. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in men and women.\xa0''The five-year survival rate tells you what percent of people live at least five years after the cancer is found. The general five-year survival rate for people with pancreatic cancer is 9% i.e., only nine out of every 100 patients of pancreatic cancer will survive for at least five years.\xa0''Survival rates and individual outcomes are based on many factors, including the stage of cancer and response of the patient to cancer therapy.' Early-stage pancreatic cancer (cancer present only in the pancreas)/Stage I: The five-year survival rate is 37%. Pancreatic cancer that has spread to surrounding tissues or organs/Stage II and Stage III: The five-year survival rate is 12%. Pancreatic cancer that has spread to a distant organ of the body (metastasis)/Stage IV: The five-year survival rate is 3%."
Being prepared for an earthquake,"'While California has been the state most \tprone to serious earthquakes in recent years, there are many other fault \tzones in other areas of the United States. For example, geologists and \tseismologists have predicted a 97 percent chance of a major earthquake in \tthe New Madrid seismic zone of the central United States (including \tArkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, and Kentucky) between now and the year 2035. \tWhile earthquakes with the power of the one that hit the greater Los Angeles \tarea in January 1994 are fairly rare, less severe earthquakes can interrupt \tyour normal living patterns and cause substantial injury. ''During a major earthquake, you may hear a roaring or rumbling sound that \tgradually grows louder. You may feel a rolling sensation that starts out \tgently and, within a second or two, grows violent. ''Or, you may first be jarred by a violent jolt. A second or two later, you may feel shaking and find it difficult to stand up or move from one room to another.''The real key to surviving an earthquake and reducing your risk of injury lies in planning, preparing, and practicing what you and your family will do if it happens.' "
Earthquake practice drills,"'By planning and practicing what to do if an earthquake strikes, you and your family can learn to react correctly and automatically when the shaking begins. During an earthquake, most deaths and injuries are caused by collapsing building materials and heavy falling objects, such as bookcases, cabinets, and heating units. Learn the safe spots in each room of your home. If you have children, get the entire family to practice going to these locations. Participating in an earthquake drill will help children understand what to do in case you are not with them during an earthquake.'""Make sure you and your child also understand the school's emergency procedures for disasters. This will help you coordinate where, when, and how to reunite with your child after an earthquake.""'During your earthquake drill:' Get under a sturdy table or desk and hold on to it. If you're not near a table or desk, cover your face and head with your 
arms; and
stand or crouch in a strongly supported doorway, or
brace yourself in an inside corner of the house or building.

 stand or crouch in a strongly supported doorway, or brace yourself in an inside corner of the house or building. Stay clear of windows or glass that could shatter or objects that could 
fall on you. Remember: If inside, stay inside. Many people are injured at entrances of 
buildings by falling debris."
Earthquake evacuation plans,"'If an earthquake occurs, you may need to evacuate a damaged area afterward. By planning and practicing for evacuation, you will be better prepared to respond appropriately and efficiently to signs of danger or to directions by civil authorities.'  Take a few minutes with your family to discuss a home evacuation plan. 
Sketch a floor plan of your home; walk through each room and discuss evacuation 
details. Plan a second way to exit from each room or area, if possible. If you need 
special equipment, such as a rope ladder, mark where it is located. Mark where your emergency food, water, first aid kits, and fire extinguishers are located. Mark where the utility switches or valves are located so that they can be 
turned off, if possible. Indicate the location of your family's emergency outdoor meeting place."
"How to establish 
priorities and personal documentation paperwork","'Take time before an earthquake strikes to write an emergency priority list, including:''Make a list of important information and put it in a secure location. Include on your list:''Gather and Store Important Documents in a Fire-Proof Safe' important items to be hand-carried by you other items, in order of importance to you and your family items to be removed by car or truck if one is available things to do if time permits, such as locking doors and windows, turning

Indoor Safety,"'There are actions you can take, even while an earthquake is happening, that will reduce your chances of being hurt. Lights may be out, and hallways, stairs, and room exits may be blocked by fallen furniture, ceiling tiles, and other debris. Planning for these situations will help you to take action quickly.''High-Rise Buildings'' ''Get under a desk and stay away from windows and outside walls. Stay in the building. The electricity may go out, and the sprinkler systems may come on. ''DO NOT use the elevators. '' ''If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.''Crowded Indoor Public Places'' ''If you are in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. If you can, take cover and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.'  If an earthquake strikes, you may be able to take cover under a heavy desk or 
table. It can provide you with air space if the building collapses. If you get 
under a table and it moves, try to move with it.  Inner walls or door frames are the least likely to collapse and may also 
shield against falling objects. If other cover is not available, go to an inner 
corner or doorway, away from windows or glass panels. Stay away from glass and hanging objects, and bookcases, china cabinets, or 
other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks 
from fireplaces and chimneys, light fixtures, wall hangings, high shelves, and 
cabinets with doors that could swing open. Grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken 
glass. If the lights go out, use a battery-operated flashlight. Don't use candles, 
matches, or lighters during or after the earthquake. If there is a gas leak, an 
explosion could result. If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn off the stove and take cover at the 
first sign of shaking."
Outdoor Safety,"'If outdoors, move away from buildings and utility wires. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls. Once in the open, stay there until the shaking stops. ' "
Automobiles,"'If you are in a moving automobile, stop as quickly and safely as possible and move over to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses. Stay in the vehicle, set the parking brake, and turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information. A car may jiggle violently on its springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops. If you are in a life-threatening situation, you may be able to reach someone with either a cellular or an emergency roadside assistance phone. ''When you drive on, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as breaks in the pavement, downed utility poles and wires, a fallen overpasses and ''bridges''. ' "
Emergency supplies for earthquake preparedness,"'Stock up now on emergency supplies that can be used after an earthquake. These supplies should include a ''first aid'' kit, survival kits for the home, automobile, and workplace, and emergency water and food. Store enough supplies to last at least 3 days.' "
First aid kit,"'Store your first aid supplies in a tool box or fishing tackle box so they will be easy to carry and protected from water. Inspect your kit regularly and keep it freshly stocked. NOTE: Important medical information and most prescriptions can be stored in the refrigerator, which also provides excellent protection from fires.'

Emergency Water Storage And Purification,"'Following are recommendations for storing and purifying water supplies.''Do not store water containers in direct sunlight. Select a place with a fairly constant, cool temperature.' The minimum drinking water supply is 1 gallon per 
person per day. You will also need water for food preparation, bathing, brushing 
teeth, and dish washing. Store a 3-5 day supply of water (at least 5 gallons for 
each person). Water should be stored in sturdy plastic bottles with tight-fitting lids. 
Rinsed chlorine bleach bottles work well for water storage. Plastic containers 
for juice and milk do not work as well because they tend to crack and leak more 
readily. All containers should be labeled. Stored water should be changed every 6 months. Avoid placing water containers in areas where toxic substances, such as 
gasoline and pesticides, are present. Vapors may penetrate the plastic over 
time."
Safe Water Sources In The Home,"'If you do not have enough water stored, there are sources in your home that may provide safe, clean water for drinking purposes.'  Water drained from the water heater faucet, if the water heater has not been 
damaged. Water dipped from the tank of the toilet (not the bowl). The water in the 
bowl can be used for pets. Do not use water that has been chemically treated or 
""blue"" water. Melted ice cubes. Canned fruit, vegetable juice, and liquids from other canned goods. Water from swimming pools and spas can be used for personal hygiene, 
cleaning, and related uses, but not for drinking."
Unsafe Water Sources,"'Never use water from the sources listed below for drinking.''NOTE: Remember that carbonated ''beverages'' do not meet drinking water requirements. ''Caffeinated'' ''drinks'' and alcohol dehydrate the body, which increases the need for drinking water.' Radiators Hot water boilers (home heating system) Water beds (fungicides added to the water or chemicals in the vinyl may make 
water unsafe for use)"
Water for Drinking and Cooking,"'Safe drinking water includes bottled, boiled, or treated water. Your state, local, or tribal health department can make specific recommendations for boiling or treating drinking water in your area. Here are some general rules concerning water for drinking and cooking. Remember:''Containers for water should be rinsed with a bleach solution before using and reusing. Use water storage tanks and other types of containers with caution. For example, fire truck storage tanks, as well as previously used cans or bottles, can be contaminated with microbes or chemicals.' Do not use contaminated water to wash dishes, brush your teeth, wash and 
prepare food, or make ice. If you use bottled water, make sure the seal has not been broken. Otherwise, 
water should be boiled or treated before use. Drink only bottled, boiled, or 
treated water until your supply is tested and found safe. Boiling water kills harmful bacteria and parasites. Bringing water to a 
rolling boil for 1 minute will kill most organisms. If you can't boil water, you can treat water with chlorine tablets, iodine 
tablets, or unscented household chlorine bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite). If 
you use chlorine tablets or iodine tablets, follow the directions that come with 
the tablets. If you use household chlorine bleach, add 1/8 teaspoon (~0.75 
milliliter [mL]) of bleach per gallon of water if the water is clear. For cloudy 
water, add 1/4 teaspoon (~1.50 mL) of bleach per gallon. Mix the solution 
thoroughly and let it stand for about 30 minutes before using it. Treating water 
with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or liquid bleach will not kill many 
parasitic organisms. Boiling is the best way to kill these organisms."
Emergency Food," Keep foods that: have a long storage life require little or no cooking, water, or refrigeration, in case utilities are 
disrupted meet the needs of babies or other family members who are on special diets meet pets' needs are not very salty or spicy, as these foods increase the need for drinking 
water, which may be in short supply"
How To Store Emergency Food," A disaster can easily disrupt the food supply at any time, so plan to have at 
least a 3-day supply of food on hand. When storing food, it is not necessary to buy dehydrated or other types of 
emergency food. Canned foods and dry mixes will remain fresh for about 2 years. Certain storage conditions can enhance the shelf life of canned or dried 
foods. The ideal location is a cool, dry, dark place. The best temperature is 40 
to 60°F. Keep foods away from ranges or refrigerator exhausts. Heat causes many 
foods to spoil more quickly. Keep food away from petroleum products, such as gasoline, oil, paints, and 
solvents. Some food products absorb their smell. Protect food from rodents and insects. Items stored in boxes or in paper 
cartons will keep longer if they are heavily wrapped or stored in airtight 
containers. Date all food items. Use and replace food before it loses freshness."
How To Use Emergency Food,"'Preparing Food''Preparing food after an earthquake may be complicated by damage to your home and loss of electricity, gas, and water. The following items will help you to prepare meals safely:''NOTE: Do not use your fireplace for cooking until the chimney has been inspected for cracks and damage. Sparks may escape into your attic through an undetected crack and start a fire.' Use perishable food in your refrigerator or freezer before using food in your 
emergency supplies. Discard cooked, unrefrigerated foods after 2 hours at room temperature, 
regardless of appearance. Eat only foods that have a normal color, texture, and odor. Discard cans that bulge at the ends or that are leaking. Cooking utensils Knives, forks, and spoons Paper plates, cups, and towels A manual can- and bottle-opener Heavy-duty aluminum foil Gas or charcoal grill; camp stove Fuel for cooking, such as charcoal. (CAUTION: Never burn charcoal indoors. 
The fumes are deadly when concentrated indoors.)"
What is ear wax?,"'The skin on the outer part of the ear canal has special glands that produce ear wax, also known as cerumen. We have this natural wax is to protect the ear from damage and infections. Normally, a small amount of wax accumulates and then dries up and falls out of the ear canal, carrying with it unwanted dust or sand particles.''Ear wax is helpful to coat the skin of the ear canal where it acts as a temporary water repellent. The absence of ear wax may result in dry, ''itchy'' ears, and even infection. Ear wax is formed in the outer third of the ear canal.''Under ideal circumstances, a person should never need to clean his or her ear canals. However, sometimes the removal of wax is necessary and requires medical treatment.'  "
Why does earwax vary in color and texture?,"'Cerumen varies in form, color, and appearance from person to person.''The ear canals are considered to be self-cleaning. This means that ear wax and sloughed skin cells typically pass on their own from the inside of the ear canal to the outer opening. Old earwax moves from the deeper areas of the canal out to the opening. At the opening of the canal the ear wax usually dries up and falls out of the canal.' It may be almost liquid, firm and solid, or dry and flaky. The color of ear wax varies depending upon its composition. Glandular secretions, sloughed skin cells, normal bacteria present on the surface of the canal, and water may all be in earwax."
What causes wax in the ears to build up?,"'You can have excessive earwax build up and harden by:' Narrowing of the canal resulting from infections or diseases of the skin, bones, or connective tissue Production of a less fluid form of cerumen (more common in older persons due to aging of the glands that produce it). Overproduction of cerumen in response to trauma or blockage within the canal. Things that you put in your ears to clean them like swabs, Q-tips, hair pins or keys. Hearing aids Earphones that are placed inside the ears"
What signs and symptoms are related to excessive or impacted (plug) earwax?,"'Excessive wax in the ears can cause different symptoms and signs, including:''When wax plugs the ear canal it can affect your hearing. Researchers estimate that hearing can be improved by 10 decibels when the plug is removed.'   Earache A sense of fullness in the ears Hearing problems Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Cough Itching Discharge from the ear canal"
Is ear candling safe?,"'Ear candling involves placing a hollow candle (made from a fabric tube soaked in beeswax) in the ear canal and burning it, with the goal of creating a suction force for removal of wax from the ears. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery, ear candling or ear coning is not considered a safe option for ear wax removal. Studies have shown that the procedure does not create a vacuum that can remove the wax effectively, and it the wax left inside candle is from the candle itself, not from the ear. The procedure also carries health risks that include ''burns'' to the ear canal, development of new blockage of the canal from the candling wax, ''ear infection'', and perforation of the eardrum.' "
What are the treatment guidelines for impacted earwax removal?,"'In January, 2017, the American Academy of Otolaryngology- Head and Neck Surgery released new practice guidelines to treat impacted earwax. This guideline was endorsed by a number of other medical organizations including the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP). This guideline discusses four ways to care for and manage impacted earwax.' Observation, since many impactions or blockages may clear on their own Softening agents, known as cerumenolytics. These are oils or ear drops that soften or break up the wax to help in removal. Irrigation, or ear syringing. This is clearing the wax using a stream of warm water into the ear canal. This can sometimes be done at home. This method is not suitable for people who have frequent ear infections or who have a perforated eardrum or surgically inserted ear tubes. Physical removal using a suction device or instrument. This should always be done by a doctor or other health-care professional."
What over-the-counter (OTC) products remove earwax build up safely at home?,"'Many people will respond to treatment with natural and home remedies, for example:''If the ear still feels blocked after using these drops, call a doctor for an exam. If you try OTC earwax softeners, it is imperative to know that you don’t have a punctured (perforated) eardrum prior to using the product. If you have a ''punctured eardrum'' and put softeners in the ear it may cause a middle ''ear infection'' (''otitis media''). Similarly, simply washing the ear with a punctured eardrum may start an infection. If you are uncertain whether or not you have a hole in your eardrum, consult a health-care professional.''Some people may also be hypersensitive to products designed to soften earwax. Therefore, if ''pain'', tenderness or a local skin ''rash'' develops, the use of these drops should be discontinued.''When wax has accumulated so much that it blocks the ear canal (and interferes with hearing), a health-care professional may need to wash it out (known as lavage), remove it by suctioning, or remove it with special instruments. Alternatively, a doctor may prescribe ear drops that are designed to soften the wax (such as trolamine polypeptide oleate-ear drops [''Cerumenex'']).'   Use a few drops of warmed olive oil, mineral oil, almond oil, baby oil, or glycerin ear drops or sprays in the ear to soften the wax. Use hydrogen peroxide drops. Over-the-counter (OTC) products are available for wax removal, such as Debrox or Murine Ear Drops. Syringe bulbs or irrigation home kits"
Is it OK to use Q-tips or other objects to remove excess earwax?,"'Most attempts to clean the ears by using cotton swabs only result in pushing the wax further into the ear canal. Wax is not formed in the deep part of the canal near the eardrum, but only in the outer part of the canal near the external opening. So when a doctor sees with wax pushed up against your eardrum, he or she knows that it often is because you have been probing your ear with things like Q-Tips, bobby pins, or twisted napkin corners. These objects only serve as ramrods to push the wax deeper into the ear and can lead to problems.''The skin of the ear canal and the eardrum is very thin and fragile, and is easily injured. The ear canal is more prone to infection after it has been stripped clean of the ""good,"" coating-type wax. Doctors see many perforated eardrums as a result of the above efforts. If you have symptoms or signs of impacted earwax consult with your doctor.' "
What is binge eating disorder?,"'Binge eating disorder is a ''mental health'' condition that is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating without efforts on the part of affected individuals to compensate by undoing the binge episodes. Examples of such undoing behaviors include purging food by inducing ''vomiting'', excessively exercising, and/or inappropriately using medications like laxatives or ''diet'' pills. This illness was often previously described by mental health professionals under the diagnosis of eating disorder, not otherwise specified rather than as its own separate entity, but the most recent revision of the widely accepted diagnostic manual used by mental health professionals has included binge eating disorder as a separate diagnosis.''Statistics about binge eating disorder indicate that this condition is the most common of all eating disorders, affecting about 3.5% of women and 2% of men over the course of a lifetime. As with other eating disorders like ''anorexia nervosa'' or ''bulimia nervosa'', there tends to be no significant difference in the age at which males and females develop binge eating disorder. Males with eating disorders like binge eating disorder tend to have a much higher body mass index (''BMI'') and are more likely to also suffer from ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') compared to males of similar age without the disorder. Females with eating disorders like binge eating disorders are at increased risk for also having ''celiac disease'' and ''diabetes''.''Binge eating disorder is apparently quite common in individuals who seek treatment for ''obesity'' in weight-loss programs that are affiliated with a hospital. About one-third of individuals with this condition are males. Most develop the disorder during adolescence or early adulthood, primarily in early adulthood. There seems to be no difference in the incidence of binge eating disorder among ethnic groups.''Binge eating disorder can have a significant impact on the health of those who suffer from it. Specifically, about 65% of people with binge eating disorder are obese (20% overweight or more), with even more being generally overweight. Individuals who develop binge eating disorder are at higher risk of also having another psychiatric illness, like ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''substance abuse''. Women with this illness tend to suffer from a negative ''body image'', whereas men are more likely develop a substance-use disorder. Other important facts about binge eating disorder include its tendency to last for more than 14 years, with only 7% resolving after the first year of having the illness. When compared to other eating disorders like ''bulimia'' nervosa or ''anorexia'' nervosa, which each tend to last less than six years, binge eating disorder has more of a chronic course.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for binge eating disorder?,"'As with most other mental disorders, there is no one specific cause for binge eating disorder. Rather it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental contributing factors. People who are prone to obesity, either genetically or otherwise, tend to be more at risk for engaging in binge eating episodes and developing binge eating disorder compared to those who are not obese. There is increasing understanding that there can be a genetic component to binge eating disorder, and as with other eating disorders, there are often found to be abnormal levels of brain serotonin and often subtle changes in brain functioning.''Social risk factors for binge eating disorders include a history of being bullied or physically or sexually abused. For Caucasian women as opposed to African-American women, discrimination tends to be a risk factor for this disorder, as well. Other risk factors for binge eating disorder include more exposure to negative comments about shape, weight, and eating. People who participate in competitive sports at an elite level are at higher risk for developing eating disorders in general.''Psychologically, binge eating disorder is thought of by many professionals to be a form of food ''addiction'' that is characterized by compulsive overeating. This condition tends to be associated with increased perfectionism, obsessive-compulsiveness, ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and substance-use disorders. ''Phobias'' and ''panic disorder'' are the most common ''anxiety'' problems experienced by people with binge eating disorder. Eating binges tend to be triggered by a number of things, like dietary restrictions, hunger, and negative ''moods''.' "
What are binge eating disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Binge eating disorder symptoms and signs include recurring episodes of binge eating (consuming excessively large amounts of food) without purging (self-induced ''vomiting''), excessive exercising, the inappropriate use of medications, or any other unhealthy behaviors that are often used by bulimic individuals to attempt to compensate for the binge episodes. People with this mental illness tend to engage in ''stress'' or other ''emotional eating'', take longer to feel full, and are more likely to feel like they are starving when they are not. The binge episodes are associated with at least three of the following characteristics:''Also, the individual with binge eating disorder experiences marked distress regarding their binge eating.'  Eating faster than normal Eating large amounts of food when not physically hungry Eating until uncomfortably full Eating alone because of feeling embarrassed about their eating behaviors Feeling disgusted with oneself, sad, or guilty after overeating"
How do health care professionals diagnose binge eating disorder?,"""As is true with virtually any mental health diagnosis, there is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has binge eating disorder. Therefore, health care professionals assess this disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information. The health care professional will also either conduct a physical examination or ask that the individual's primary care doctor perform one. The medical assessment will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the person has a medical condition that has what appear to be mental health symptoms.""'In asking questions about psychological symptoms, mental health professionals are often exploring if the individual suffers from symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder or another eating disorder, like ''anorexia'' nervosa and ''bulimia'' nervosa, as described in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-V''). To qualify for the diagnosis of binge eating disorder, the person must engage in bingeing at least once per week for three months. The ''DSM-IV-TR'' and earlier editions of the diagnostic handbook did not include binge eating disorder as a diagnosis. Rather, it was captured under the diagnosis of Eating Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (''ED'', NOS).''Practitioners will also explore whether symptoms of ''depression'' and/or ''mania'', ''anxiety'', substance abuse, ''hallucinations'' or ''delusions'', as well as some behavioral disorders are occurring. People with binge eating disorder may seem to engage in compulsive eating, having symptoms in common with ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''). Health care professionals may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Since some of the ''symptoms of binge eating disorder'"" can also occur with other conditions, the mental health screening is designed to determine if the individual suffers from any emotional problem. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care professionals conduct a mental-status examination, as well."" "
What is the treatment for binge eating disorder?,"'As with obese individuals without binge eating disorder, people with this illness tend to ''lose weight'' from adopting a low-calorie diet and engaging in regular ''exercise'', and some will experience repeated ''weight gain'' in the long term. While considered adjunctive rather than primary forms of treatment, home remedies like meditation may help reduce the frequency and severity of binge eating disorder symptoms, thereby decreasing the impact of those symptoms on the self-rating scale.''Medications that have been found to be effective in reducing the number and amount of binge episodes in binge eating disorder include lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), which is used to treat ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat binge eating disorder, topiramate (Topamax), which is used to treat ''seizures'', as well as serotonergic (SSRI) medications that treat anxiety (antianxiety medications) or ''depression'' (''antidepressants''), like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd). Sibutramine (Meridia) is an appetite suppressant that has been found to help decrease binge eating and enhance ''weight loss''. SSRIs tend to be well tolerated and have a low incidence of side effects like stomach upset, ''sleep problems'', and sexual dysfunction. Topiramate was first used to treat ''seizures'"" and is sometimes stopped by patients because of daytime sleepiness, difficulty thinking, and poor coordination. Sibutramine's most common side effects include ""'headache'', ''constipation'', stomach upset, ''insomnia'', and painful menstrual periods. Less common, more serious side effects of sibutramine include ''palpitations'', ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', ''nausea'', and vomiting.''While psychotherapy alone does not tend to result in long-term ''weight loss'' in individuals with binge eating disorder, it can be a key part of the rehabilitation (""rehab"") and recovery from the emotional problems that are often associated with this disorder. Two forms of psychotherapy that have been found to be effective in that regard include ''cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') and ''interpersonal therapy'' (''ITP''). In cognitive behavioral therapy, the mental health practitioner works to help the person with binge eating disorder identify, challenge, and decrease negative thinking and otherwise dysfunctional belief systems that precipitate unwanted behaviors. Dialectical ''behavior therapy'"", which is a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on emotional regulation, has also been found to be an effective means of increasing the length of time between binge episodes (for example, binge abstinence) in preliminary studies. The goal of interpersonal therapy tends to be identifying and managing problems the sufferer of binge eating disorder may have in his or her relationships with others. Participation in one of a number of self-help support groups, like Overeaters Anonymous or Eating Disorders Anonymous, can also be an important part of managing this condition by enhancing the sufferer's self-control in regard to their food intake.""'Understanding and addressing how to treat other mental health problems that might co-occur (comorbidity) with binge eating disorder are important aspects of overcoming this illness. For example, as about 57% of men and 28% of women with binge eating disorder also have a substance-use disorder, treating both problems will enhance the successful recovery from each illness.' "
What are complications and the prognosis of binge eating disorder?,"'People with binge eating disorder seem to be at higher risk of developing substance abuse or another psychiatric illness, ''high blood pressure'' and other forms of ''heart disease'', type II ''diabetes'', ''gallbladder disease'', some forms of ''cancer'', and abnormal ''cholesterol'' levels (for example, high levels of total cholesterol and of so-called bad cholesterol types, plus low levels of good cholesterol) compared to similar-weight individuals without this eating disorder. The obesity that often results from binge eating disorder also puts sufferers at risk for problems like menstrual problems and joint and ''muscle pain''. ''Pregnant'' women are at risk for developing problems with the ''pregnancy'' like hyperemesis, having ''babies'' who have low birth weight, excessively small skulls (''microcephaly''), and are small for gestational age. Given these potentially life-threatening complications of binge eating disorders, the decreased likelihood that ethnic minorities in the United States seek and are referred for specific treatment is an important obstacle to overcome.''After about six years, a little more than half of individuals with binge eating disorder who have engaged in intensive treatment have been found to have some significant decrease in symptoms, while about one-third have only intermediate outcome, about 6% have poor outcome, and 1% may die during that period of time. Having one eating disorder increases the risk that the sufferer will develop another one. Eating disorders in general and binging behavior specifically can increase the likelihood that a person engages in self-injurious behaviors like cutting or has ''suicidal'' thoughts or actions. However, it is important to note that the prognosis of binge eating disorder seems to be quite changeable over time.' "
Is it possible to prevent binge eating disorder?,"""Teaching teens and adults about resisting society's pressure toward thinness, understanding what determines body weight, the negative effects of eating disorders, and encouraging good self-esteem, ""'stress'' management, healthy weight control, and acceptance of their body have been found to be helpful in the ''prevention'' of eating disorders. Educating the adults in the lives of youth about how to positively influence children regarding healthy eating habits, ''exercise'' and body image have also been determined to be helpful components in preventing binge eating disorder. In addition to parents, key adults in this approach can include teachers and other school staff, coaches, pediatricians, and other primary care doctors.' "

Facts you should know about emotional eating," Emotional eating is responding to feelings such as stress by eating high-carbohydrate, high-calorie foods with low nutritional value. The quantity of food that is consumed is the primary difference between emotional eating and binge eating. Like most emotional symptoms, emotional eating is thought to result from a number of factors rather than a single cause. There are a number of potential warning signs for emotional eating, or stress-eating. Health professionals assess emotional eating by screening for physical and mental health issues. Overcoming emotional eating involves teaching the individual healthier ways to view food and develop better eating habits (such as mindful eating), recognize their triggers for engaging in this behavior, and develop other more appropriate ways to prevent and alleviate stress. When untreated, emotional overeating can cause obesity, problems with weight loss, and even lead to food addiction. Reducing stress, using food as sustenance rather than as a way to solve problems, and using constructive ways to handle emotions can help to prevent emotional eating."
What is emotional eating?,"'Emotional eating is the tendency of its sufferers to respond to stressful, difficult feelings by eating, even when not experiencing physical hunger. Emotional eating or emotional hunger is often a craving for high-calorie or high-carbohydrate foods that have minimal nutritional value. The foods that emotional eaters crave are often referred to as comfort foods, like ice cream, cookies, ''chocolate'', chips, French fries, and pizza. About 40% of people tend to eat more when stressed, while about 40% eat less and 20% experience no change in the amount of food they eat when exposed to stress. Consequently, stress can be associated with both ''weight gain'' and ''weight loss''.''While emotional eating can be a symptom of what mental health professionals call atypical ''depression'', many people who do not have ''clinical depression'' or any other mental health issue engage in this behavior in response to momentary feelings or chronic stress. This behavior is highly common and is significant since it can interfere with maintaining a healthy ''diet'' and contribute to obesity.'  "
What is the difference between emotional eating and binge eating?,"'The primary difference between emotional eating and binge eating involves the amount of food that is consumed. While both may involve a sense of trouble controlling a craving for food, emotional eating may involve consuming from moderate to great amounts of food and may be the only symptom that a person has or be part of an emotional illness like ''depression'', ''bulimia'', or ''binge eating disorder''. ''Binge eating disorder'' is a distinctive ''mental illness'' that is characterized by recurrent episodes of ''compulsive overeating'', in that affected people uncontrollably eat an amount of food that is significantly larger than that which most people eat in a distinct period of time (for example, over two hours), even when they are not hungry. The person with ''binge eating disorder'' may eat each much faster than normal, conceal the amount they eat out of shame, and may feel disgusted by their eating after doing so. In order to qualify for this diagnosis, the binges must occur an average of once per week over three months.' "
"What are causes, triggers, or risk factors for emotional eating?","'Like most emotional symptoms, emotional eating is thought to be the result of a number of factors rather than one single cause. Some research is consistent with girls and women being at higher risk for ''eating disorders'', showing they are at higher risk for emotional eating. However, other research indicates that in some populations, men are more likely to eat in response to feeling ''depression'' or anger, and women were more likely to eat excessively in response to failing a ''diet''.'""It is thought that the increase in the hormone cortisol that is one of the body's responses to stress is similar to the medication ""'prednisone'"" in its effects. Specifically, both tend to trigger the body's stress (fight or flight) response, including increased ""'heart'' and ''breathing'' rate, blood flow to muscles, and visual acuity. Part of the stress response often includes ''increased appetite'' to supply the body with the fuel it needs to fight or flee, resulting in cravings for so-called comfort foods. People who have been subjected to chronic rather than momentary stress (like job, school, or family stress, exposure to crime or abuse) are at risk for having chronically high levels of cortisol in their bodies, contributing to developing chronic emotional-eating patterns.''Psychologically, people who tend to connect food with comfort, power, positive feelings, or for any other reasons than providing fuel to their body can be prone to emotional eating. They may eat to fill an emotional void, when physically full, and engage in mindless eating. Some people whose emotions cause them to eat may have been raised to connect food with feelings instead of sustenance, particularly if food was scarce or often used a reward or punishment, or as a substitute for emotional intimacy.' "
What are warning signs of emotional eating?,"'Warning signs for emotional eating include a tendency to feel hunger intensely and all of a sudden, rather than gradually as occurs with a true physical need to eat that is caused by an empty stomach. Emotional eaters tend to crave junk foods rather than seeking to eat balanced meals, and the urge to eat is usually preceded by stress or an uncomfortable emotion of some kind, like boredom, sadness, anger, guilt, or frustration. Other hallmarks of emotional eating are that the sufferer may feel a lack of control while eating and often feels guilty for what they have eaten.'  "
What kind of specialists treat emotional eating?,"'A number of different health care professionals evaluate and treat emotional eating and may also help with ''weight loss'' when this contributes to ''overweight'' or obesity. As this symptom can occur at nearly anytime across the life span, everyone from pediatricians, family practitioners, and other primary care physicians may address this problem. Nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants may be involved in caring for emotional-eating sufferers. Mental health professionals who are often involved in assessing and treating this issue include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, and licensed counselors. While any one of these practitioners may care for people who engage in emotional eating, more than one may work together to help the person overcome this symptom.' "
How do health care providers diagnose emotional eating?,"'The diagnosis of emotional eating is made after first ensuring that the sufferer has had a physical examination and lab work to be certain that the symptom is not part of some genetic or other medical condition like ''Prader-Willi syndrome''. As part of the mental health aspect of the examination, the patient may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of emotional eating. Thorough exploration of any history of mental health symptoms will be conducted such that emotional eating can be distinguished from other eating disorders like ''bulimia'', binge eating, or pica. A mental health professional will also explore whether other forms of mental illness are present.' "
What is the treatment for emotional eating?,"'Overcoming emotional eating tends to involve teaching the sufferer healthier ways to view food and develop better eating habits, recognize their triggers for engaging in this behavior, and develop appropriate ways to prevent and alleviate stress.''An important step in managing stress is ''exercise'', since regular physical activity tends to dampen the production of stress chemicals, even leading to a decrease in ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''insomnia'' in addition to decreasing the tendency to engage in emotional eating.''Engaging in meditation and other relaxation techniques is also a powerful way to manage stress and therefore decrease emotional eating. Therefore, engaging in one or two meditation sessions a day can have lasting beneficial effects on health, even decreasing ''high blood pressure'' and heart rate.''Refraining from ''drug use'' and consuming no more than moderate amounts of ''alcohol'"" are other important ways to successfully manage stress since many of these substances heighten the body's response to stress. Also, indulging in use of those substances often prevents the person from facing their problems directly so they are not able to develop effective ways to cope with or eliminate the stress.""'Other lifestyle changes that can decrease stress include taking breaks at home and at work. Refrain from over-scheduling yourself. Learn to recognize and respond to your stress triggers. Take regular days off at intervals that are right for you. Structure your life to achieve a comfortable way to respond to the unexpected.''For those who may need help dealing with stress, stress-management counseling in the form of individual or group therapy can be very useful. Stress counseling and group therapy have proven to reduce ''stress symptoms'' and improve overall health.''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') has been found to be effective as part of treatment for combating emotional eating. This approach helps to alleviate stress by helping the individual change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals:''If stress produces a full-blown psychiatric problem, like ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), clinical depression, or ''anxiety'' disorders, then psychotropic medications, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can be extremely useful. Examples of SSRIs include ''sertraline'', (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), or ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'').'""Overeaters' Anonymous is a longstanding self-help group that can be an important resource for developing healthier ways to view food and recognizing and coping with triggers for engaging in emotional eating. Nutritionists, therapists, and other support groups can be other invaluable resources.""  Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote the person's cooperation with the treatment process. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence the individual's behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the sufferer to emotional eating. A variation of the cognitive component of therapy is teaching mindfulness, paying nonjudgmental attention to the present moment. Mindfulness involves thinking more reflectively, increasing one's emotional awareness, and tends to lead to an increased ability to separate one's emotions from hunger. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the person how to stop emotional eating and use more effective strategies for dealing with problems."
What is the prognosis of emotional eating?,"'Left untreated, emotional overeating can lead to complications, like difficulties achieving weight loss, obesity, and even to the development of food addiction. On the other hand, people who are prone to emotional eating are also often more responsive to stress reduction in correcting their tendency to emotionally eat compared to individuals who tend to eat less when exposed to stress.' "
Is it possible to prevent emotional eating?,"'The ''prevention'' of emotional eating primarily involves reducing stress, using constructive ways to understand and manage emotions, and by using food as sustenance rather than a way to solve problems (eating to live rather than living to eat). Research also shows that thinking about the future rather than staying focused on satisfying food cravings tends to prevent emotional eating. Other ways to prevent emotional eating behaviors include engaging in meditation, ''exercise'', and other constructive stress prevention and ''stress management techniques'', as well as avoiding ''caffeine'', alcohol, or ''drugs''.' "
What is epidermolysis bullosa?,"'Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of ''inherited'' conditions that affect the supporting tissue of the skin and mucosa. Epidermolysis bullosa is often appears at birth or during infancy and characterized by severe skin fragility, erosions, and ''blisters''. Epidermolysis bullosa is due to one or multiple defective genes that normally synthesize structural proteins that are involved in the adherence of the ''epidermis'' (the superficial layer of skin) to the dermis (the deeper layer of the skin). Another term for this group of conditions is ""mechanobullous disease,"" which distinguishes it from conditions that may appear superficially similar but are produced by autoimmune destruction of some of the same proteins that are defective in epidermolysis bullosa.''Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (another condition) is an inappropriately named example of an autoimmune problem that really does not belong in discussion of the mechanobullous diseases.' "
What are the types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB)?,"'There are four distinctive clinical forms of this condition, and each is associated with different defective proteins:' Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EB simplex)EBS localized (Weber-Cockayne), generalized other EBS, Dowling Meara EBS, EBS with muscular dystrophy, EBS with mottled pigmentation, EBS Ogna, EBS with pyloic atreseia, EBS circinate migratory, lethal acantolythic EB, EBS superficialis (EBSS), and plakophilin deficiency EBS localized (Weber-Cockayne), generalized other EBS, Dowling Meara EBS, EBS with muscular dystrophy, EBS with mottled pigmentation, EBS Ogna, EBS with pyloic atreseia, EBS circinate migratory, lethal acantolythic EB, EBS superficialis (EBSS), and plakophilin deficiency Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (junctional EB),Herlitz JEB and JEB-other (including JEB with pyloric atresia, non-Herlitz JEB, and many other subtypes) Herlitz JEB and JEB-other (including JEB with pyloric atresia, non-Herlitz JEB, and many other subtypes) Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (dystrophic EB)Recessive DEB (RDEB)Hallopeau-SiemensDominant DEB (DDEB) Recessive DEB (RDEB)Hallopeau-Siemens Hallopeau-Siemens Dominant DEB (DDEB) Kindler syndrome."
What are causes and risk factors for epidermolysis bullosa?,"'Since mechanobullous diseases are hereditary, the presence of a family history of this condition is the major risk factor. Mechanobullous diseases are rare. Their prevalence in the U.S. population is estimated to be about eight cases per million. Mechano-bullous diseases have been attributed to at least 1,000 different mutations in 20 separate genes that code for various structural proteins near the junction of the ''epidermis'' and the dermis (the top layers of skin). Some of the proteins involved are keratin, laminin, type VII collagen, type VII collagen, integrins, lectin, desmoplakin, plakophilin, and plakoglobin.' "
Is epidermolysis bullosa contagious?,'Epidermolysis bullosa is not ''contagious''.' 
What are epidermolysis bullosa symptoms and signs?,"'The commonality in presentation of all the mechanobullous diseases is''Health care professionals most frequently note these findings in areas of friction where shear forces are greatest. Elbows, knees, hands, and ''feet'' are generally involved, although EB affects any anatomical area. EB may affect the lining tissues of within the mouth. Although often evident at birth, the condition may occasionally appear in young adults depending on the gene involved. There can be a spectrum of severity so that some affected individuals may have localized disease and reach adulthood with few problems, while others with a more severe form are likely to die during infancy. There are associated conditions in some patients, including muscular dystrophy, pyloric atresia, and reno-urinary defects. In dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, there is a predisposition to scarring, milia formation, and occasionally squamous cell ''ca''rcinoma.' fragile skin, erosions of skin, and blister formation."
"What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose 
and assess epidermolysis bullosa?","'In an infant in whom this diagnosis is considered, it is vital to exclude other treatable diseases first. In addition, it is often impossible to come to an accurate diagnosis based on the clinical appearance of the patient. It is often necessary to involve a dermatologist with special expertise in ''pediatrics'' to evaluate the affected infant. Special tests on the ''skin biopsy'' specimens are required to determine which component of the skin is defective. Immunofluorescence mapping and electron microscopic evaluation may be necessary to pinpoint the precise structural defects. Newly available genetic tools can detect the presence of defective genes in the patient and family members. In families with a history of mechanobullous disease, ''prenatal'' testing is available. Such tests are likely to be available only at university medical centers.' "
What is the treatment for epidermolysis bullosa?,"'Since the problem in all mechanobullous diseases is an absent or defective structural protein, there is no cure. At this time, there is also no specific treatment other than supportive care. The care would be similar to that given in a ''burn'' center environment except that the condition never resolves. ''Pain'', metabolic abnormalities, and infection are major problems in these patients. Preventing erosions is a constant challenge. Occasionally, ''skin cancer'' can develop at the site of erosions.''Attempts to produce the normal proteins by bone marrow transplantation, local fibroblast transplantation, or the addition of ''stem cells'' to affected patients have met with limited success. Such interventions are available only through participation in investigational studies.' "
Are there home remedies for epidermolysis bullosa?,"'In mild localized cases, it is possible to care for the erosions as one would care for any superficial ''wound''. Additionally, it is important to consider techniques for minimizing friction in areas predisposed to ''blisters'' and erosions.' "
What is the prognosis of epidermolysis bullosa?,'The prognosis of epidermolysis bullosa is almost entirely dependent on the specific structural of the genetically altered protein. That is why it is of the utmost importance to make an accurate diagnosis. Mild localized forms of epidermolysis bullosa simplex exist. Most of these patients can expect to live into adulthood.'  
Is it possible to prevent epidermolysis bullosa?,'The only conceivable way to prevent this or any other ''genetic disease'' is by identifying genetic carriers and insuring that any offspring they produce are free from the mutations. Families with a history of mechanobullous disease should seek ''genetic counseling'' to insure that they understand the risks involved in procreation.' 
What is Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease caused by Ebola virus (a member of the ''Filoviridae'' family or filoviruses) that results in nonspecific symptoms (see symptom section of this article) early in the disease and often causes internal and external hemorrhage (bleeding) as the disease progresses. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is one of the most life-threatening viral infections; the mortality rate (death rate) may be very high during outbreaks (reports of outbreaks range from about 25%-100% of people infected, depending on the Ebola strain). Because most outbreaks occur in areas where high-level intensive care supportive public health services are not available, survival rates are difficult to translate to potential outbreaks in Ebola-affected areas with more resources.' "
What is the history of Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Ebola hemorrhagic fever first appeared in Zaire (currently, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or DRC or Congo) in 1976. The original outbreak was in a village named Yambuku near the Ebola River after which the disease was named. During that time, researchers identified the virus in person-to-person contact transmission. Of the 318 patients diagnosed with Ebola, 88% died. The second outbreak occurred in Nzara, South Sudan, in 1976, with 151 deaths.''Since that time, there have been multiple outbreaks of Ebola virus, and researchers have identified five strains; four of the strains are responsible for the high death rates. The four Ebola strains are termed as follows: Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest, and Bundibugyo virus, with Zaire Ebola virus being the most lethal strain. Researchers have found a fifth strain termed Reston in the Philippines. The strain infects primates, pigs, and humans and causes few if any symptoms and no deaths in humans. Most outbreaks of the more lethal strains of Ebola have occurred in sub-Saharan West Africa and mainly in small- or medium-sized towns. Health care professionals believe bats, monkeys, and other animals maintain the non-human virus life cycle in the wild; humans can become infected from handling and/or eating infected animals.''Once an Ebola outbreak is recognized, African officials isolate the area until the outbreak ceases. However, in the outbreak that began in West Africa in March 2014, some of the infected people reached larger city centers before the outbreak was recognized; this caused further spread. The infecting Ebola virus detected during this outbreak was the Zaire strain, the most pathogenic strain of Ebola. Health agencies are terming this outbreak as an ""unprecedented epidemic."" This epidemic spread quickly in the West African countries of Guinea and Sierra Leone. In addition, countries of Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and Mali all reported confirmed infections with Ebola. In addition, a few infections or flare-ups of Ebola virus infection appeared in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom (see for example, the case of Pauline Cafferkey, a nurse who became infected); most of the people with Ebola in these countries either were imported infections from West Africa or were newly spread infections from treating patients who originally became infected in Africa. Another outbreak occurred in the DRC in May 2018 in Bikoro, a small town 80 miles from Mbandaka, with 46 reported infections and 26 deaths. Unfortunately, the large city of Mbandaka, with over 1 million people, has recorded at least three people with Ebola. The DRC hopes to isolate or stop the spread of Ebola in the two areas by vaccinating anyone who may have had some physical contact with an infected person with a new chimeric virus ''vaccine'' that in 2015 showed good results in Ebola-infected patients.''Health officials now report over 1,000 deaths due to Ebola in areas like Butembo in the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries in an ongoing outbreak over the last 9 months. This outbreak is difficult to control because it is happening in a war zone where cooperation between countries to control the outbreak is uncoordinated and even considered unwelcome.' "
Is the Ebola virus contagious?,"'Ebola viruses are highly ''contagious'' once early symptoms such as fever develop. The infected patient sheds infectious viruses in all body secretions (bodily fluids); direct contact with any of these secretions may cause the virus transmission to uninfected individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that infection with Ebola that is airborne is theoretically possible but unlikely. Although Ebola is ''contagious'', careful hygiene and barrier techniques can make the infection low risk for contagion; ''measles'' is considered by some experts to be the fastest-spreading disease.' "
What causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'The cause of Ebola hemorrhagic fever is Ebola virus infection that results in coagulation abnormalities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, development of a ''rash'', cytokine release, damage to the ''liver'', and massive viremia (large number of viruses in the blood) that leads to damaged vascular cells that form blood vessels. As the massive viremia continues, coagulation factors are compromised and the microvascular endothelial cells are damaged or destroyed, resulting in diffuse bleeding internally and externally (bleeding from the mucosal surfaces like nasal passages and/or mouth and gums and even from the eyes [termed ''conjunctival'' bleeding]). This uncontrolled bleeding leads to blood and fluid loss and can cause hypotensive ''shock'' that causes death in many Ebola-infected patients.' "
What are risk factors for Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'The risk factors for Ebola hemorrhagic fever are travel to areas with reported Ebola infections (see current CDC travel advisories for African countries). In addition, association with animals (mainly primates in the area with reported Ebola infections) is potentially a health risk factor according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another potential source of the virus is eating or handling ""bush meat."" Bush meat is the meat of wild animals, including hoofed animals, primates, bats, and rodents. Evidence for any airborne transmission of this virus is lacking. During Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, health care workers and family members and friends associated with an infected person (human-to-human transfer) are at the highest risk of getting the disease. Researchers who study Ebola hemorrhagic fever viruses are also at risk of developing the disease if a laboratory accident occurs. Caring for infected patients who are near-death or disposing of bodies of individuals that have recently died of Ebola infection is a very high-risk factor because in these situations, the Ebola virus is highly concentrated in any blood or bodily secretions. Caregivers should wear appropriate full-length personal protective equipment (See the CDC site ''http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/hospitals/infection-control.html'' for details).' "
What are Ebola virus disease symptoms and signs?,"'Unfortunately, early ''symptoms of Ebola virus disease'' are nonspecific and include''As the disease progresses, patients may develop other symptoms and signs such as'   fever, headache (severe), weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach discomfort or pain in the abdomen, decreased appetite, and joint and muscle discomfort. a rash or red spots on the skin, eye redness, hiccups, sore throat, cough and/or coughing up blood, vomiting up blood, chest pain, mental confusion, bleeding both inside and outside the body (for example, mucosal surfaces, eyes), and difficulty swallowing and breathing."
What types of health care professionals treat Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Because Ebola infections can spread rapidly to others and because patients can easily infect health care workers, the CDC and other agencies recommend that only highly trained personnel treat Ebola patients. This treatment involves high-level barrier techniques to protect all health care professionals (hospital care workers, nurses, doctors, lab technicians, janitors, and hospital infectious-disease-control personnel). Unfortunately, these trained individuals and resources are often not available in the Ebola high-risk areas. Ideally, individuals diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. should be treated in specific designated treatment centers and treatment monitored by the CDC. Types of specialists who may treat Ebola-infected patients are ''emergency medicine'' specialists, infectious disease specialists, critical care doctors and nurses, pulmonologists, hematologists, hospitalists, and hospital infection-control personnel.' "
What is the contagious period for the Ebola virus?,"'For those patients who survive infection, they may remain contagious for approximately 21-42 days after symptoms abate. However, health care professionals can remove the viruses from semen, ''breast milk'', spinal column, and ''ocular'' fluids. It is unclear, according to the CDC, if these fluids can transmit viruses, although the CDC suggests that Ebola can be spread by semen and suggest male survivors of the disease abstain from sex or use a ''condom'' for all sexual activity.' "
What is the incubation period for the Ebola virus?,"'Ebola virus disease symptoms'' and signs may appear from about 2 to 21 days after exposure (average incubation period is e8 to 10 days). It is unclear why some patients can survive and others die from this disease, but patients who die usually have a poor immune response to the virus. Patients who survive have symptoms that can be severe for a week or two; recovery is often slow (weeks to months) and some survivors have chronic problems such as ''fatigue'' and ''eye problems''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Physicians preliminarily diagnose Ebola hemorrhagic fever by clinical suspicion due to association with other individuals with Ebola and with the early symptoms described above. Within a few days after symptoms and signs develop, tests such as ''ELISA'' (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on antigen capture), RT-''PCR'' (reverse transcription ''polymerase chain reaction'""), and/or virus isolation can provide definitive diagnosis. Later in the disease or if the patient recovers, it's possible to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against the infecting Ebola strain. Similarly, health care professionals usually perform studies using immunohistochemistry testing, PCR, and virus isolation in deceased patients for epidemiological purposes."" "
What is the medical treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"""According to the CDC and others, standard treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is still limited to supportive therapy. Supportive therapy is balancing the patient's fluid and ""'electrolytes'', maintaining their oxygen status and ''blood pressure'', and treating such patients for any complicating infections. Any patients suspected of having Ebola hemorrhagic fever should be isolated, and caregivers should wear protective garments. Currently, there is no specific medical treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever according to the CDC. The CDC recommends the following medical treatments for Ebola-infected patients:''Health care professionals transport patients diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. to special hospitals certified to treat Ebola patients. (Contact the CDC immediately for information for experimental ''vaccines'', treatment protocols, and patient care and/or transfer to an appropriate facility.) The special hospitals were certified because of the problems experienced in a Texas hospital where the first patient in the U.S. was diagnosed with Ebola and subsequently spread the disease to hospital workers.

What are complications of Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Ebola hemorrhagic fever often has many complications; organ failures, severe bleeding, ''jaundice'', ''delirium'', ''shock'', ''seizures'', ''coma'', and death (about 50%-100% of infected patients). Those patients fortunate enough to survive Ebola hemorrhagic fever still may have complications that may take many months to resolve. Survivors may experience weakness, ''fatigue'', ''headaches'', ''hair loss'', ''hepatitis'', sensory changes, and inflammation of organs (for example, the testicles and the eyes). Some may have Ebola linger in their semen for months and others may have the virus latently infect their eye(s).''Male patients may have detectable Ebola viruses in their semen for as long as six months after they survive the infection. Researchers consider the chance of being infected with Ebola from semen is very low; however, they recommend utilizing ''condoms'' for six months; some experts suggest a longer time.'""It is apparent that we don't know everything about how to cure Ebola infections. A physician thought to be cured of Ebola, Dr. Ian Crozier, in fall 2014 developed burning light sensitivity in his eyes. He returned to Emory University where he was treated and after several tests, he was found to have Ebola infection in his eyes. However, only the fluid removed by needle from his eyes showed viable virus; his tears and the outer membrane of his eyes had no detectable virus. Consequently, health care professionals considered the patient not to be able to spread the virus. One of the complications was that his blue eye color turned green. Fortunately, for Dr. Crosier, treatment with steroids and antiviral agents allowed his eyes to return to normal. This unusual circumstance has suggested that follow-up eye exams are likely to be important in patients who survive Ebola infections."" "
What is the prognosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"""The prognosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever is often poor; the death rate of this disease ranges from 25%-100%, and those who survive may experience the complications listed above. However, early diagnosis and treatment of Ebola may greatly increase the patient's chance for survival. Unfortunately, this disease has been mainly located in countries where medical care is often difficult to obtain, especially in rural areas of Africa. Statistics available on the ongoing 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola are summarized below:"" Total suspected, probable, and confirmed infections worldwide equal 28,616, and total deaths equal 11,310 for a death rate or death toll of approximately 41%. An occasional new infection (at a low level) and deaths of current patients are unlikely to change these numbers substantially as the epidemic outbreak has ended according to the CDC. Fortunately, this epidemic of 2014-2016 did not become a pandemic but did show how rapidly a relatively rare disease like Ebola can rapidly infect a large number of individuals in this modern-day society."
Is it possible to prevent Ebola hemorrhagic fever? Is there an Ebola vaccine?,"'The main way to prevent getting Ebola hemorrhagic fever is to not travel to areas where it is endemic and by staying away from any patients who may have the disease. Medical caregivers may protect themselves from infection by ''strict adherence'' to barriers to the virus (wearing gloves, gowns, goggles, and a mask). People can disinfect surfaces with ''alcohol''-based (70%) wipes.''The following are the recommendations from the CDC to prevent getting Ebola (EVD) from an infected person. Avoid the following:''In addition, after leaving an area affected by EVD, individuals should monitor their health for 21 days; if a person develops any symptoms, he or she should immediately seek medical care and inform the medical caregivers of his or her exposure to Ebola.''Fortunately, in December 2016, researchers reported on a human clinical trial of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine that was apparently effective and relatively safe for vaccination against Ebola disease. The researchers used people (contacts) exposed to Ebola patients during the outbreak in a trial following similar procedures (""ring of exposure"") used to eliminate ''smallpox''. Researchers randomly assigned the Ebola case exposure patient to get the vaccine at day 0 or 21 days later after being identified as a new case exposure. Although many vaccinated people developed side effects of injection-site ''pain'', mild ''headache'', ''fatigue'' and ''muscle pain'', most individuals recovered within a few days and none develop long-term problems. The study involved 11,841 people. The vaccine was 100% effective in patients who obtained the vaccine at day 0 and those day 0 individuals who had no symptoms within 10 days (due to the approximate average incubation period of Ebola). There were 23 new cases of Ebola in patients who got the vaccine 21 days later. Three adverse events occurred in the vaccinated population; one had a febrile reaction to the vaccine, one experienced ''anaphylaxis'' and one experienced ''flu'' or ''flu-like symptoms'' but all recovered and remained healthy. Consequently, many investigators consider this vaccine to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a stockpile of 300,000 doses in reserve for future outbreaks. The vaccine is in limited supply and not licensed by the FDA. Health care professionals use this vaccine in the same way to limit the spread of Ebola in the DRC in the 2018-2019 outbreak. Time will tell if the ""ring of exposure"" method of vaccination will stop the outbreak.'

What is the latest research on Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Although a relatively safe and effective vaccine is now available to clinicians under certain conditions, research goes on. One problem is that the antibody generated against the glycoprotein in the vaccine may only be effective against one strain of Ebola, but not against the other strains. Readers should expect additional ''vaccines'' to become available in the not-too-distant future.' "
Where can people find more information about Ebola?,'The following are several references that we update periodically to provide recent information about Ebola viruses and Ebola disease:' World Health Organization: http://www.who.int/csr/don/13-may-2017-ebola-drc/en/ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/index.html Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak: https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/
What is Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease caused by Ebola virus (a member of the ''Filoviridae'' family or filoviruses) that results in nonspecific symptoms (see symptom section of this article) early in the disease and often causes internal and external hemorrhage (bleeding) as the disease progresses. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is one of the most life-threatening viral infections; the mortality rate (death rate) may be very high during outbreaks (reports of outbreaks range from about 25%-100% of people infected, depending on the Ebola strain). Because most outbreaks occur in areas where high-level intensive care supportive public health services are not available, survival rates are difficult to translate to potential outbreaks in Ebola-affected areas with more resources.' "
What is the history of Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Ebola hemorrhagic fever first appeared in Zaire (currently, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or DRC or Congo) in 1976. The original outbreak was in a village named Yambuku near the Ebola River after which the disease was named. During that time, researchers identified the virus in person-to-person contact transmission. Of the 318 patients diagnosed with Ebola, 88% died. The second outbreak occurred in Nzara, South Sudan, in 1976, with 151 deaths.''Since that time, there have been multiple outbreaks of Ebola virus, and researchers have identified five strains; four of the strains are responsible for the high death rates. The four Ebola strains are termed as follows: Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest, and Bundibugyo virus, with Zaire Ebola virus being the most lethal strain. Researchers have found a fifth strain termed Reston in the Philippines. The strain infects primates, pigs, and humans and causes few if any symptoms and no deaths in humans. Most outbreaks of the more lethal strains of Ebola have occurred in sub-Saharan West Africa and mainly in small- or medium-sized towns. Health care professionals believe bats, monkeys, and other animals maintain the non-human virus life cycle in the wild; humans can become infected from handling and/or eating infected animals.''Once an Ebola outbreak is recognized, African officials isolate the area until the outbreak ceases. However, in the outbreak that began in West Africa in March 2014, some of the infected people reached larger city centers before the outbreak was recognized; this caused further spread. The infecting Ebola virus detected during this outbreak was the Zaire strain, the most pathogenic strain of Ebola. Health agencies are terming this outbreak as an ""unprecedented epidemic."" This epidemic spread quickly in the West African countries of Guinea and Sierra Leone. In addition, countries of Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and Mali all reported confirmed infections with Ebola. In addition, a few infections or flare-ups of Ebola virus infection appeared in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom (see for example, the case of Pauline Cafferkey, a nurse who became infected); most of the people with Ebola in these countries either were imported infections from West Africa or were newly spread infections from treating patients who originally became infected in Africa. Another outbreak occurred in the DRC in May 2018 in Bikoro, a small town 80 miles from Mbandaka, with 46 reported infections and 26 deaths. Unfortunately, the large city of Mbandaka, with over 1 million people, has recorded at least three people with Ebola. The DRC hopes to isolate or stop the spread of Ebola in the two areas by vaccinating anyone who may have had some physical contact with an infected person with a new chimeric virus ''vaccine'' that in 2015 showed good results in Ebola-infected patients.''Health officials now report over 1,000 deaths due to Ebola in areas like Butembo in the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries in an ongoing outbreak over the last 9 months. This outbreak is difficult to control because it is happening in a war zone where cooperation between countries to control the outbreak is uncoordinated and even considered unwelcome.' "
Is the Ebola virus contagious?,"'Ebola viruses are highly ''contagious'' once early symptoms such as fever develop. The infected patient sheds infectious viruses in all body secretions (bodily fluids); direct contact with any of these secretions may cause the virus transmission to uninfected individuals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that infection with Ebola that is airborne is theoretically possible but unlikely. Although Ebola is ''contagious'', careful hygiene and barrier techniques can make the infection low risk for contagion; ''measles'' is considered by some experts to be the fastest-spreading disease.' "
What causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'The cause of Ebola hemorrhagic fever is Ebola virus infection that results in coagulation abnormalities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, development of a ''rash'', cytokine release, damage to the ''liver'', and massive viremia (large number of viruses in the blood) that leads to damaged vascular cells that form blood vessels. As the massive viremia continues, coagulation factors are compromised and the microvascular endothelial cells are damaged or destroyed, resulting in diffuse bleeding internally and externally (bleeding from the mucosal surfaces like nasal passages and/or mouth and gums and even from the eyes [termed ''conjunctival'' bleeding]). This uncontrolled bleeding leads to blood and fluid loss and can cause hypotensive ''shock'' that causes death in many Ebola-infected patients.' "
What are risk factors for Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'The risk factors for Ebola hemorrhagic fever are travel to areas with reported Ebola infections (see current CDC travel advisories for African countries). In addition, association with animals (mainly primates in the area with reported Ebola infections) is potentially a health risk factor according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another potential source of the virus is eating or handling ""bush meat."" Bush meat is the meat of wild animals, including hoofed animals, primates, bats, and rodents. Evidence for any airborne transmission of this virus is lacking. During Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, health care workers and family members and friends associated with an infected person (human-to-human transfer) are at the highest risk of getting the disease. Researchers who study Ebola hemorrhagic fever viruses are also at risk of developing the disease if a laboratory accident occurs. Caring for infected patients who are near-death or disposing of bodies of individuals that have recently died of Ebola infection is a very high-risk factor because in these situations, the Ebola virus is highly concentrated in any blood or bodily secretions. Caregivers should wear appropriate full-length personal protective equipment (See the CDC site ''http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/hospitals/infection-control.html'' for details).' "
What are Ebola virus disease symptoms and signs?,"'Unfortunately, early ''symptoms of Ebola virus disease'' are nonspecific and include''As the disease progresses, patients may develop other symptoms and signs such as'   fever, headache (severe), weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach discomfort or pain in the abdomen, decreased appetite, and joint and muscle discomfort. a rash or red spots on the skin, eye redness, hiccups, sore throat, cough and/or coughing up blood, vomiting up blood, chest pain, mental confusion, bleeding both inside and outside the body (for example, mucosal surfaces, eyes), and difficulty swallowing and breathing."
What types of health care professionals treat Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Because Ebola infections can spread rapidly to others and because patients can easily infect health care workers, the CDC and other agencies recommend that only highly trained personnel treat Ebola patients. This treatment involves high-level barrier techniques to protect all health care professionals (hospital care workers, nurses, doctors, lab technicians, janitors, and hospital infectious-disease-control personnel). Unfortunately, these trained individuals and resources are often not available in the Ebola high-risk areas. Ideally, individuals diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. should be treated in specific designated treatment centers and treatment monitored by the CDC. Types of specialists who may treat Ebola-infected patients are ''emergency medicine'' specialists, infectious disease specialists, critical care doctors and nurses, pulmonologists, hematologists, hospitalists, and hospital infection-control personnel.' "
What is the contagious period for the Ebola virus?,"'For those patients who survive infection, they may remain contagious for approximately 21-42 days after symptoms abate. However, health care professionals can remove the viruses from semen, ''breast milk'', spinal column, and ''ocular'' fluids. It is unclear, according to the CDC, if these fluids can transmit viruses, although the CDC suggests that Ebola can be spread by semen and suggest male survivors of the disease abstain from sex or use a ''condom'' for all sexual activity.' "
What is the incubation period for the Ebola virus?,"'Ebola virus disease symptoms'' and signs may appear from about 2 to 21 days after exposure (average incubation period is e8 to 10 days). It is unclear why some patients can survive and others die from this disease, but patients who die usually have a poor immune response to the virus. Patients who survive have symptoms that can be severe for a week or two; recovery is often slow (weeks to months) and some survivors have chronic problems such as ''fatigue'' and ''eye problems''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"'Physicians preliminarily diagnose Ebola hemorrhagic fever by clinical suspicion due to association with other individuals with Ebola and with the early symptoms described above. Within a few days after symptoms and signs develop, tests such as ''ELISA'' (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on antigen capture), RT-''PCR'' (reverse transcription ''polymerase chain reaction'""), and/or virus isolation can provide definitive diagnosis. Later in the disease or if the patient recovers, it's possible to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against the infecting Ebola strain. Similarly, health care professionals usually perform studies using immunohistochemistry testing, PCR, and virus isolation in deceased patients for epidemiological purposes."" "
What is the medical treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever?,"""According to the CDC and others, standard treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is still limited to supportive therapy. Supportive therapy is balancing the patient's fluid and ""'electrolytes'', maintaining their oxygen status and ''blood pressure'', and treating such patients for any complicating infections. Any patients suspected of having Ebola hemorrhagic fever should be isolated, and caregivers should wear protective garments. Currently, there is no specific medical treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever according to the CDC. The CDC recommends the following medical treatments for Ebola-infected patients:''Health care professionals transport patients diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. to special hospitals certified to treat Ebola patients. (Contact the CDC immediately for information for experimental ''vaccines'', treatment protocols, and patient care and/or transfer to an appropriate facility.) The special hospitals were certified because of the problems experienced in a Texas hospital where the first patient in the U.S. was diagnosed with Ebola and subsequently spread the disease to hospital workers. Experimental medical treatments of Ebola infections include immune serum, antiviral ''drugs'', possible blood transfusions, and supportive care in an intensive care hospital facility approved by the CDC to treat Ebola infections.'

What is Ebola?,"'Ebola'' (also termed ''Ebola hemorrhagic fever'') is a viral disease that, until the 2014 outbreak in West Africa, was considered a rare but deadly disease that causes a potentially fatal ''fever'' in humans as well as infection of nonhuman primates (for example monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees) and African fruit bats. Before 2014, small outbreaks were usually confined to small isolated villages in Africa. In 2014, an outbreak had villagers going to local cities for treatment and resulted in spreading the disease to a number of countries in Africa. A few individuals transferred the disease to other countries (for example, the U.S., Spain); caregivers got the disease from those individuals being treated for ''Ebola''. The 2014 outbreak of Ebola was the largest in history; current estimates are that about 29,000 individuals were probably infected, with about 15,200 laboratory-confirmed infections that resulted in about 11,200 deaths, according to statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC). The CDC states that there are no current infectious Ebola patients in Senegal, Nigeria, Spain, United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy.\xa0Since the 2014 outbreak, there have been others. The Congo reported an outbreak in May 2018 that is still not stopped as of August 2018.''There is some evidence that four of the five viral types that cause Ebola likely circulate in nonhuman primates; in addition, there is some evidence that ''Ebola virus'' types may be carried by African fruit bats. If these primates and/or bats are handled or eaten (Bush meat) by people, humans may contract the disease and then pass it on to other humans.' "
Is Ebola contagious?,"'Ebola is ''contagious''. The virus spreads through direct contact (via broken skin or mucous membranes, in the nose, mouth, or eyes). Blood or body fluids from infected individuals are capable of causing infection in others. Examples of body fluids include urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, ''breast milk'', and semen. Unfortunately, objects such as needles and syringes that have been contaminated with blood or body fluids can also transmit the disease. Furthermore, contact with animals such as primates and/or African fruit bats may also transmit the ''Ebola virus'' from these animals to humans.'""When a person dies from Ebola, the person's body has high concentrations of the virus both a few days before and after death. Also, the virus is in high ""'concentration'' on contaminated sheets, clothing, or other items that have touched the recently deceased person. In these situations, Ebola is highly ''contagious''.'""Full protective gear is advised to protect health care workers from becoming infected; for more details, the reader is referred to CDC's guidelines (see ""'http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/evaluating-patients/think-ebola.html'').' "
What is the incubation period for the Ebola virus?,"'The incubation period for Ebola varies from about two to 21 days. People are not contagious for the disease until the first symptoms appear (sudden onset of ''fatigue'', ''fever'', ''muscle pain'', ''headache'', and/or ''sore throat'').' "
How will I know if someone is infected with Ebola?,"'It is sometimes difficult to know if a person is infected with the ''Ebola virus''; however, if a person has been a medical ''caregiver'' to a patient with Ebola or if a person has recently spent time in an area where Ebola infection is present, then a person who develops early signs and symptoms, such as ''fever'', ''headache'', ''weakness'', ''stomach pain'', ''fatigue'', ''lack of appetite'', ''diarrhea'', ''vomiting'', joint and muscle ''aches'', or unexplained bleeding, should be suspected to be infected with Ebola until proven otherwise.''The diagnosis of Ebola is usually done by special blood tests (''PCR'' or ''polymerase chain reaction'', virus isolation, and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or ''ELISA'' test). These tests are available in some state labs and the CDC in the United States and can help distinguish between Ebola, Marburg, and other viral diseases that produce similar symptoms.' "
How is the Ebola virus transmitted?,"""Outbreaks often begin with a single individual or small group that contacts an infected primate and/or African fruit bat. Members of such a small group then can pass an Ebola infection from person to person by blood or body fluid contact as the virus travels through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes. Ebola usually does not begin to become contagious to other people until symptoms develop. Rapid spread can occur when an individual is dying or dies because of the massive viral load within the individual's body and body secretions.""""The disease can spread quickly in hospitals, clinics, and among families because of the close proximity to the infected patient's body fluids. Appropriate protective equipment and sterilization of needles and other items are needed to avoid the spread of Ebola ""'viruses'' to other individuals, especially medical caregivers.''Ebola is not spread through the air or by water or foods that have not come in contact with infected humans, primates, or African fruit bats.' "
How will I know if someone is cured of Ebola? What is the contagious period for Ebola?,"'In general, individuals who spontaneously self-cure or, after hospitalization and supportive care, survive the infection, become noncontagious after about 21 days from the onset of symptoms (a few investigators suggest 42 days should be considered the length of time to become noncontagious since the risk is 0.2%-12% that some individuals are contagious longer than 21 days). This time period is complicated by the fact that some men who survived the disease have ''Ebola virus'' in their semen for three months, and in a few men, the semen has had Ebola virus present for over nine months. In addition, some patients may have dormant Ebola virus in their eyes for extended time periods. Researchers are still trying to determine if these dormant ''viruses'' can reactivate and cause disease in the previously infected patient or in uninfected individuals who come in contact with them; they advise precautions be taken to avoid exposure to body fluids in patients with dormant Ebola infection.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about Ebola?,"'Because Ebola can be a devastating disease, anyone who is likely to have been exposed to Ebola should immediately contact a medical ''caregiver'', preferably someone at the CDC in the United States. This notification allows the CDC to do close monitoring of potentially infected or infectious individuals according to current CDC guidelines and will afford those individuals who develop the infection early treatment, to increase their chances for survival and decrease the possibility of transferring infection to others.\xa0In addition, an experimental ''vaccine'' (rVSV-ZEBOV) helps to prevent infections with Ebola, and a new antiviral drug, mAb114, helps the body render the Ebola virus ineffective.''Individuals and health care workers who have been exposed to Ebola-infected patients and develop early symptoms of Ebola need to isolate themselves from other uninfected individuals and go to a clinic or hospital in their country that is capable of taking care of Ebola-infected patients. Ideally, such individuals should be careful (use barrier techniques and/or inform EMS or other transporters) not to contaminate anyone while they are transported to the appropriate health care facilities.' "
Facts you should know about Epstein-Barr virus infections," The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that is found worldwide and is a common cause of viral pharyngitis (infectious mononucleosis). The cause of an Epstein-Barr infection (mononucleosis) is EBV; risk factors include intimate contacts with body secretions (especially saliva) and objects that may be exposed to body secretions of infected people. The Epstein-Barr virus is contagious and is spread from person to person. EBV is contagious during the incubation period and while symptoms are present; some individuals may be contagious for as long as 18 months. EBV is transmitted from person to person mainly by saliva; however, other body fluids may transmit the disease. Items contaminated with bodily fluids like saliva (toys, utensils, cups, for example) may also transmit the disease. The incubation period for an Epstein-Barr virus infection is about four to seven weeks. The symptoms and signs of an EBV infection may include malaise, fever, muscle aches, headaches, sore throat, lymph node swelling, liver swelling, rash, and spleen swelling. Preliminary diagnosis of EBV infection is based on the patient's history and physical exam; physicians may also use immunological tests that vary in specificity. Treatment of EBV infection is mainly supportive (see home remedies section); some health care providers use cortisone treatment. Home remedies that may help reduce symptoms are rest, fluids, over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications, and avoiding trauma that can further injure organs like a swollen spleen. The possible complications of EBV infection may include an enlarged spleen, jaundice, liver inflammation, anemia, splenic rupture, swollen tonsils, breathing difficulties, rash, irregular heartbeats, and a possible increased risk for cancer. The majority of people with EBV have a good prognosis; a few have a more guarded prognosis. There is no vaccine for EBV, and prevention is difficult. Risk can be reduced by not contacting body fluids from infected individuals and practicing good hand-washing techniques."
What is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)?,"'The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the ''herpes'' virus family (human ''herpesvirus'' 4). EBV is found worldwide and is a common cause of viral ''pharyngitis'', especially in young adults. EBV is transmitted from person to person and then infects human B cells, which in turn spread the infection throughout the entire reticuloendothelial system (RES, or the liver, spleen, and peripheral ''lymph nodes''). About 50% of the population has antibodies to the virus by age 5; about 12% of susceptible adults (college-age) develop antibodies to the virus, and one half of those adults develop the disease termed ''mononucleosis'' (also termed ''infectious mononucleosis'', ''mono'', ''glandular fever'', and kissing disease), which produces symptoms of ''lymph node'', spleen, and liver swelling, ''fever'', inflamed throat, malaise, and ''rash''.' "
What are causes and risk factors for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'The cause of an Epstein-Barr virus infection or ''mono'"" is the infection of circulating B cells by EBV and the body's response to the presence of the virus. Risk factors include"" intimate contact with body secretions (primarily mouth secretions but including other body fluids like those found in the cervix and semen); young age (children, adolescents, and young adults are most often infected); sharing items such as eating utensils, toys, or toothbrushes; rarely, blood transfusions or organ transplants."
Is the Epstein-Barr virus contagious?,"'Yes, the Epstein-Barr virus is contagious and easily passed from person to person mainly by mouth secretions. EBV can be spread by sharing contaminated objects like cups, toothbrushes, or eating utensils.' "
How long is an Epstein-Barr virus infection contagious?,"'An Epstein-Barr virus is contagious during its long incubation period (four to seven weeks, see below) and then until symptoms are gone; however, there is evidence that some people may still spread the virus to others for many months even after symptoms are gone. Some studies indicate that some individuals can be contagious for as long as 18 months.' "
How do people transmit the Epstein-Barr virus?,"'EBV is transmitted mainly through the saliva secreted in the mouth during kissing or sharing items that can pass saliva to other individuals (for example, cups, spoons, straws, and other utensils). There is evidence that semen and the fluid from the cervix may also contain transmittable EBV. The disease is sometimes subclinical (meaning there are no symptoms in the infected individual), and the virus has been transmitted rarely by ''blood transfusion'' and/or organ transplants. In addition, EBV remains in the individual for life and occasionally may become reactivated (the person develops symptoms). If EBV is reactivated, the person becomes contagious. A person may be contagious even during the incubation period (see below).' "
What is the incubation period for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,'The incubation period (time period between initial infection and development of symptoms) for EBV is unusually long. It takes about four to seven weeks for symptoms to develop.' 
What are symptoms and signs of an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'The symptoms and signs of an Epstein-Barr virus infection are as follows:''Symptoms may last about two to four weeks; however, some individuals still feel tired for a few weeks more.'   Malaise or tiredness Fever Muscle aches Headaches Sore throat Rash Lymph node swelling Liver swelling Spleen swelling"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'Many EBV infections are diagnosed simply by the symptoms. However, there are tests for EBV, but they need to be interpreted appropriately. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends the following for EBV testing:''The CDC does not recommend the Monospot test for general use because of both false-positive and false-negative results and because the antibodies detected can be caused by other conditions. However, the test is still used to detect antibodies that are often present in EBV-infected patients about two to nine weeks after EBV infection. It is used as a screening test and is not specific for EBV infection.''The above tests can help differentiate EBV infection from other medical problems (for example, ''chronic fatigue syndrome'' or ''multiple sclerosis'').' Susceptibility to infection: People are considered susceptible to EBV infection if they do not have antibodies to the VCA (viral capsid antigen). Primary (new or recent) infection: People are considered to have a primary EBV infection if they have anti-VCA IgM but do not have antibody to EBNA (EBV nuclear antigen). Other results that strongly suggest a primary infection are a high or rising level of anti-VCA IgG and no antibody to EBNA after at least four weeks of illness. Resolution of the illness may occur before the diagnostic antibody levels appear. In rare cases, people with active EBV infections may not have detectable EBV-specific antibodies. Past infection: The presence of antibodies to both VCA and EBNA suggests past infection (from several months to years earlier). Since over 90% of adults have been infected with EBV, most adults will show antibodies to EBV from infection years earlier. High or elevated antibody levels may be present for years and are not diagnostic of recent infection."
What is the treatment for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for EBV. However, some physicians may use ''corticosteroids'' to reduce ''swelling of tissues'' (for example, swelling in the throat, ''enlarged spleen''). Most of the treatments are designed to reduce symptoms (see home remedies below).'  "
Are there any home remedies for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'Although home remedies do not cure EBV infections, some provide relief from the symptoms of the disease. The most common home remedies are as follows:''Avoid any potential ''trauma'' (such as sports like football or boxing) because the spleen is especially vulnerable to rupture or laceration until its swelling abates.' Rest Fluids Over-the-counter pain medications (Do not give aspirin to children.)"
What are possible complications of an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,'Possible complications of EBV are as follows:' Enlarged spleen Red spots and/or rash Liver inflammation and/or swelling Jaundice Anemia Splenic rupture Severe swollen tonsils Breathing difficulties (usually due to swollen throat tissue) Irregular heartbeat Possible increased risk for cancer (lymphomas)
What is the prognosis of an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'The prognosis for most individuals who are infected with EBV is usually good as most people recover completely without any of the complications described above. If complications develop, the majority of patients usually recover, even if the recovery time is prolonged. Rarely, splenic rupture occurs, which requires surgery and can result in death.' "
Is it possible to prevent an Epstein-Barr virus infection? Is there an EBV vaccine?,"'There is no vaccine available to prevent EBV infections. Individuals can reduce their risk of infection by not using utensils, toys, or other objects used by infected individuals and by practicing good hand-washing techniques. Avoiding contact with any body fluids, especially saliva, may reduce the chance of infection. Prevention is difficult because EBV is widespread in populations and can be transmitted even when an infected person has no symptoms.' "
"What is an electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG)?","'The electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a noninvasive test that is used to reflect underlying ''heart'' conditions by measuring the electrical activity of the heart. By positioning leads (electrical sensing devices) on the body in standardized locations, health care professionals can learn information about many heart conditions by looking for characteristic patterns on the EKG.' "
What does an ECG (EKG) measure? What heart problems can it diagnose?,"   The underlying rate and rhythm mechanism of the heart The orientation of the heart (how it is placed) in the chest cavity Evidence of increased thickness (hypertrophy) of the heart muscle Evidence of damage to the various parts of the heart muscle Evidence of acutely impaired blood flow to the heart muscle Patterns of abnormal electric activity that may predispose the patient to abnormal cardiac rhythm disturbances Abnormally fast or irregular heart rhythms Abnormally slow heart rhythms Abnormal conduction of cardiac impulses, which may suggest underlying cardiac or metabolic disorders Evidence of the occurrence of a prior heart attack (myocardial infarction) Evidence of an evolving, acute heart attack Evidence of an acute impairment to blood flow to the heart during an episode of a threatened heart attack (unstable angina) Adverse effects on the heart from various heart diseases or systemic diseases (such as high blood pressure, thyroid conditions, etc.) Adverse effects on the heart from certain lung conditions (such as emphysema, pulmonary embolus [blood clots to lung]) Certain congenital heart abnormalities Evidence of abnormal blood electrolytes (potassium, calcium, magnesium) Evidence of inflammation of the heart or its lining (myocarditis, pericarditis)"
How do I prepare for an ECC (EKG)?,"'EKG leads are attached to the body while the patient lies flat on a bed or table. Leads are attached to each extremity (four total) and to six pre-defined positions on the front of the chest. A small amount of gel is applied to the skin, which allows the electrical impulses of the heart to be more easily transmitted to the EKG leads. The leads are attached by small suction cups, Velcro straps, or by small adhesive patches attached loosely to the skin. The test takes about five minutes and is painless. In some instances, men may require the shaving of a small amount of chest hair to obtain optimal contact between the leads and the skin.'  "
When is an ECG (EKG) performed?,"   As part of a routine physical examination or screening evaluation As part of a cardiac exercise stress test As part of the evaluation of symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or fainting, palpitations, or As part of the preoperative workup for surgery in patients who may be at an age where heart disease could potentially be present"
What are the limitations of the ECG (EKG)?," The EKG is a static picture and may not reflect severe underlying heart problems at a time when the patient is not having any symptoms. The most common example of this is in a patient with a history of intermittent chest pain due to severe underlying coronary artery disease. This patient may have an entirely normal EKG at a time when he or she is not experiencing any symptoms. In such instances, the EKG as recorded during an exercise stress test may reflect an underlying abnormality while the EKG taken at rest may be normal. Many abnormal patterns on an EKG may be nonspecific, meaning that they may be observed with a variety of different conditions. They may even be a normal variant and not reflect any abnormality at all. These conditions can often be sorted out by a physician with a detailed examination, and occasionally other cardiac tests (for example, echocardiogram, exercise stress test). In some instances, the EKG may be entirely normal despite the presence of an underlying cardiac condition that normally would be reflected in the EKG. The reasons for this are largely unknown, but it is important to remember that a normal EKG does not necessarily preclude the possibility of underlying heart disease. Furthermore, a patient with heart symptoms can frequently require additional evaluation and testing."
What is an echocardiogram? What is the definition of echocardiogram?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump that circulates blood throughout the body. The anatomy includes four chambers and four valves. For the heart to function normally these structures need to be intact and the heart muscle needs to beat in a coordinated fashion, so that blood flows in and out of each chamber in the proper direction.''An echocardiogram (echo=sound + card=heart + gram=drawing) is an ''ultrasound'' test that can evaluate the structures of the heart, as well as the direction of blood flow within it. Technicians specially trained in ''echocardiography'' produce the images and videos, often using a special probe or transducer that is placed in various places on the chest wall, to view the heart from different directions. Cardiologists, or heart specialists, are trained to evaluate these images to assess ''heart function'' and provide a report of the results.The echocardiogram is just one of the many tests that can be done to evaluate heart anatomy and function.''An ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'') is the most common heart tracing done. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall and collect information about the electrical activity of the heart. Aside from the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat, the EKG can provide indirect evidence of blood flow within arteries to heart muscle and the thickness of heart muscle.''Cardiac catheterization'' is an invasive test performed by a cardiologist, where a catheter is threaded into the coronary arteries (those arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood) through the femoral artery in the groin, the radial artery in the wrist, or the brachial artery in the elbow. Dye is injected into the coronary arteries looking for blockage. In some instances, the blockage can be corrected by ''balloon angioplasty'' where a balloon is inflated at the level of blockage, re-establishing blood flow. A ''stent'' can be used to keep the artery open. This test can also assess the size and function of the heart chambers and valves, and the major arteries and veins that enter and leave the heart.' "
What are the different types of echocardiograms?,"   Transthoracic echocardiogram: In the transthoracic echocardiogram procedure, the echocardiographer places the transducer, or probe, on the chest wall and bounces sound waves off the structures of the heart. The return signals are received by the same transducer and converted by a computer into the images seen on the screen. Transesophageal echocardiogram: In some situations, a clearer view of the heart is required and instead of placing the transducer on the chest wall, a cardiologist will direct the probe through the mouth into the esophagus. The esophagus is located right next to the heart in the middle of the chest and the sound waves can travel to the heart without the interference of the ribs and muscles of the chest wall.This test usually requires intravenous medications to sedate the patient. Because of the sedation, monitors will also be used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the blood. This test usually requires intravenous medications to sedate the patient. Because of the sedation, monitors will also be used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the blood. Doppler echocardiogram: In addition to sound waves bouncing off the solid structures of the heart, they also bounce off the red blood cells as they circulate through the heart chambers. Using Doppler technology, the echocardiogram can assess the speed and direction of blood flow, helping increase the amount and quality of information available from the test. The computer can add color to help the doctor appreciate that information. Color flow Doppler is routinely added to all echocardiogram studies and is the same technology used in weather reports. Stress echocardiogram: A stress echocardiogram helps uncover abnormalities in the function of the heart wall muscle. The patient may be asked to exercise by either walking on a treadmill or riding an exercise bicycle. The echocardiogram is performed before exercise as a baseline, and then immediately after the test. When coronary arteries narrow due to atherosclerotic heart disease, the heart muscle may not receive enough blood supply during exercise. During a stress echocardiogram, the areas of heart muscle not receiving enough blood flow may not squeeze as well as other parts of the heart, and will appear to have motion abnormality. This can indirectly indicate narrowing, or stenosis, of the coronary arteries. This can cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or you may have no symptoms. For a stress echocardiogram to be effectively interpreted, the exercise done needs to achieve certain minimum intensity. If the patient is unable to exercise adequately, medications can be injected intravenously to chemically make the heart respond as if exercise is occurring. Contrast may be injected into the patient's vein to help enhance the images and increase the information that is obtained. The contrast material (Optison, Density) are microscopic protein shells filled with gas bubbles. The decision to use contrast depends upon the patient's specific situation."
What is an echocardiogram used to diagnose?,"'The purpose of an echocardiogram is to assess the structure and function of the heart. It is recommended as a noninvasive procedure as part of assessing potential and established heart problems.''Regarding structure, the test can assess the general size of the heart, the size of the four heart chambers, and the appearance and function of the four heart valves. It can look at the two septa of the heart; the atrial septum separates the right and ''left atrium'' and the ventricular septum separates the right and left ventricles. It can also assess the pericardium (the sac that lines the heart) and the ''aorta''.''Regarding function, the echocardiogram can determine how the heart valves open and close. It can evaluate whether the heart muscle squeezes appropriately and how efficiently. Cardiac output measures how much blood the heart pumps. Ejection fraction measures what percent of blood within the heart is pumped out to the body with each heartbeat. It can also measure how well the heart relaxes in between beats, when the heart fills for the next pump.''Some heart issues that the echocardiogram can help evaluate include the following:'  Heart valve disorders: Stenosis (narrowed), insufficiency or regurgitation (leaking), and endocarditis (infection of the valves) Abnormalities of the septum: Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent foramen ovale Wall motion abnormalities: Cardiomyopathy, atherosclerotic heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease), and trauma Diseases of the pericardium (the sac that lines the heart): This includes pericardial effusion (assessment of fluid in the pericardial sac)"
How should you prepare for an echocardiogram?,"'There is no preparation for a transthoracic echocardiogram.''When a transesophageal echocardiogram is performed, the patient usually requires some sedation to tolerate the procedure. The stomach should be empty to prevent ''vomiting'' and aspiration into the ''lungs''. For that reason, the patient should have nothing to eat or drink for many hours before the procedure. Due to the sedation, the patient will need a family member or friend to escort the patient home.''For a stress echocardiogram, the patient may need to walk on a treadmill or ride a bicycle. Comfortable shoes are recommended.'  "
What happens during an echocardiogram test?,"'An echocardiogram is an office or outpatient procedure. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall to monitor heart rate and rhythm. The lights in the room may be dimmed to help see the images on the computer monitor. If contrast is used, an intravenous line will need to be started.''In transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient\'s chest will need to be exposed. The technician will press the transducer or probe firmly on the chest wall to get the heart images. The patient may be asked to roll on their left side take deep breaths to help the probe better ""see"" the heart. The patient will be monitored because of the need for intravenous sedation. A heart monitor and oxygen monitor will be placed; supplemental oxygen is usually provided by prongs placed in the nose and an intravenous line will be started. Once sedated, the cardiologist will pass a tube, with the transducer on its tip, through the mouth and position it in the esophagus at a level near the heart. The patient may or may or remember the procedure because many of the sedative medicines have an amnestic effect; but once the patient is fully awake, they may be discharged home with an escort.' "
What are the potential risks of having an echocardiogram?,"'There are no risks associated with a transthoracic echocardiogram.''The risks of a transesophageal echocardiogram are due to the sedation required to perform the procedure or, very rarely, damage to the esophagus.' "
What will the results of an echocardiogram indicate?,"'The purpose of the echocardiogram is to assess the structure and function of the heart. The results will provide information that can help the health care professional make a diagnosis that involves the heart.''Echocardiograms may be repeated over time, monitoring heart function and the results may help decide whether previous treatment has been effective and whether any changes in that treatment program are required.'

"
What is an ultrasound?,"""While the patient's history and physical examination are the initial steps of making a medical diagnosis, the ability to peer inside the body can be a powerful tool. Ultrasound is an imaging technique that provides that ability to medical practitioners.""'Ultrasound produces sound waves that are beamed into the body causing return echoes that are recorded to ""visualize"" structures beneath the skin. The ability to measure different echoes reflected from a variety of tissues allows a shadow picture to be constructed. The technology is especially accurate at seeing the interface between solid and fluid filled spaces. These are actually the same principles that allow SONAR on boats to see the bottom of the ocean.'  "
What is ultrasonography?,"'Ultrasonography is a form of body imaging using sound waves to facilitate makeing a medical diagnosis. A skilled ultrasound technician is able to see inside the body using ultrasonography to answer questions that may be asked by the medical practitioner caring for the patient. Usually, a radiologist will oversee the ultrasound test and report on the results, but other types of physicians may also use ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. For example, obstetricians use ultrasound to assess the fetus during ''pregnancy''. Surgeons and emergency physicians use ultrasound at the bedside to assess ''abdominal pain'' or other concerns.''A transducer, or probe, is used to project and receive the sound waves and their echoes. A gel is wiped onto the patient\'s skin so that the sound waves are not distorted as they cross through the skin. Using their understanding of human anatomy and the machine, the technician can evaluate specific structures and try to answer the question asked by the patient\'s physician. This may take a fair amount of time and require the probe to be repositioned and pointed in different directions. As well, the technician may need to vary the amount of pressure used to push the probe into the skin. The goal will be to ""paint"" a shadow picture of the inner organ that the health care practitioner has asked to be visualized.''The physics of sound can place limits on the test. The quality of the picture depends on many factors.''Ultrasound can be enhanced by using Doppler technology which can measure whether an object is moving towards or away from the probe. This can allow the technician to measure blood flow in organs such as the ''heart'' or ''liver'', or within specific blood vessels.' Sound waves cannot penetrate deeply, and an obese patient may be imaged poorly. Ultrasound does poorly when gas is present between the probe and the target organ. Should the intestine be distended with bowel gas, organs behind it may not be easily seen. Similarly, ultrasound works poorly in the chest, where the lungs are filled with air. Ultrasound does not penetrate bone easily. The accuracy of the test is very much operator dependent. This means that the key to a good test is the ultrasound technician."
For what purposes are ultrasounds used?,"'Ultrasound is not limited to diagnosis, but can also be used in screening for disease and to aid in treatment of diseases or conditions. ' "
Diagnostic uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound is routinely used for assessing the progression of a pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasounds can be obtained trans-abdominally where the probe is placed on the abdominal wall, or trans-vaginally, where the probe is placed in the vagina. For example ultrasound in obstetrics/gynecology is used to diagnose growths or tumors of the ovary, uterus, or, Fallopian tubes.''Echocardiography'"" (echo=sound + cardio=heart + graphy=study) evaluates the heart, the heart valve's motion, and blood flow through them. It also evaluates the heart wall motion and the amount of blood the heart pumps with each ""'stroke''.''Echocardiography can be performed in two ways:''Anatomically, the esophagus sits near the heart and allows clearer images. However, this approach is a little more invasive.''Different groups of illnesses can be assessed by echocardiography:''Ultrasound can detect blood clots in veins (superficial or deep venous thrombosis) or artery blockage (stenosis) and dilatation (aneurysms). Some examples of ultrasound testing include:''Aside from its use in obstetrics, ultrasound can evaluate most of the solid structures in the abdominal ''cavity''. This includes the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, prostate, testicles, uterus, and ovaries.''The thyroid gland can be imaged using ultrasound looking for nodules, growths, or tumors.''Ultrasound can be used to detect bulging of fluid from a swollen ''knee joint'' into the back of the knee, called a '""Baker's cyst""'.'   trans-thoracic: the probe is place on the chest wall to obtain images, and trans-esophageal: where the probe is placed through the mouth into the esophagus. Valves in the heart keep blood flowing in one direction when the heart pumps. For example, when the heart beats, blood is pumped from the left ventricle through the aortic valve into the aorta and the rest of the body. The aortic valve prevents blood from back-flowing into the heart as it fills for the next beat. Echocardiography can determine if the valve is narrow or leaking (regurgitating, insufficient). By following how the patient fares clinically, repeated echocardiograms can help determine whether valve replacement or repair is warranted. The same principles apply to the mitral valve which keeps blood flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The heart muscle pumps blood to the body. If the heart weakens, the amount of blood it pumps with each beat can decrease, leading to congestive heart failure. The echocardiogram can measure the efficiency of the heart beat and how much blood it pumps; which assists in determining whether medications are needed. It also is used to monitor how well medications are working. Echocardiography can visualize the heart chambers to detect blood clots in conditions such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm). In other situations, the test can help diagnose endocarditis (an infection of the heart valves) by visualizing ""vegetations"" (an infected mass) on the valves themselves. Echocardiography also can detect abnormal fluid collections (pericardial effusions) in the pericardium. Echocardiograms are used to diagnose and monitor pulmonary artery hypertension. Carotid ultrasound is performed in patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes to determine whether the major arteries in the neck are blocked causing the decreased blood supply to the brain. The aorta is the large blood vessel leaving the heart that supplies blood to the rest of the body. The walls of the aorta are under significant pressure from the force of the heartbeat and over time, may weaken and widen. This is called an aneurysm, and it can be detected in the abdomen by ultrasound (abdominal aortic aneurysm). For those patients with small aneurysm, observation may be recommended and the aneurysms size followed over time by repeated tests. Veins can also be evaluated by ultrasound and it is a common test to assess whether swelling in a leg is due to a blood clot, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or another cause. Ultrasound is the preferred technique to test for gallstones or an infected gallbladder. The ultrasound can reveal the stones as well as signs of infection, including thickening of the gallbladder wall and fluid surrounding the gallbladder. The ultrasound may find blockage in the bile ducts. For those patients where the radiation of a CT scan (computerized tomography) is a potential risk (pregnant patients or children), ultrasound may be used to look for diseases like appendicitis or kidney stones. Ultrasound is the test of choice to diagnose testicular torsion. Pelvic ultrasound is used in gynecology to help assess non-pregnancy related issues like lower abdominal pain, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, uterine growths, and endometriosis."
Screening uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound may be used to screen for blood vessel diseases. By measuring blood flow and blockage in the carotid arteries, the test can predict potential risk for future ''stroke''. Similarly, by measuring the diameter of the aorta in the abdomen, ultrasound can screen for aneurysm (abnormal dilatation) and the risk of rupture. These tests may be indicated for an individual patient or they may be offered as a community wide health screening assessment.' "
Therapeutic uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound may be used to help physicians guide needles into the body.''In situations where an intravenous line is required but it is difficult to find a vein, ultrasound guidance may be used to identify larger veins in the neck, chest wall, or groin.''Ultrasound may be used to guide a needle into a ''cavity'' that needs to be drained (for example, an ''abscess'') or a mass that needs to be biopsied, where a small bit of tissue is removed for analysis.' "
What are the risks of ultrasound?,"""There are no known risks to ultrasound, and as technology has improved, the machines have become smaller, portable and available for use at the patient's bedside. "" "
How do patients prepare for an ultrasound?,"'Preparation for ultrasound is minimal. Generally, if internal organs such as the gallbladder are to be examined, patients are requested to avoid eating and drinking with the exception of water for six to eight hours prior to the examination. This is because food causes gallbladder contraction, minimizing the size, which would be visible during the ultrasound.''In preparation for examination of the baby and womb during pregnancy, sometimes it is recommended that mothers drink at least four to six glasses of water approximately one to two hours prior to the examination for the purpose of filling the bladder. This helps improve the images captured during the exam.' "
How are the results of ultrasound interpreted and communicated to the physician?,"'The ultrasound is generally performed by a technician. The technician will notice preliminary structures and may point out several of these structures during the examination. The official reading of the ultrasound is done by a radiologist, a physician who is an expert at interpreting ultrasound images. The radiologist records the interpretation and transmits it to the practitioner requesting the test. Occasionally, during the ultrasound test the radiologist will ask questions of the patient and/or perform an examination in order to further define the purpose for which the test is ordered, or to clarify preliminary findings.''Plain ''x-rays'' might be ordered to further evaluate early findings.'""A summary of results of all of the above is reported to the health care practitioner who requested the ultrasound. They are then discussed with the patient in the context of the patient's overall health status."" "
What are preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Preeclampsia is a condition that can develop during pregnancy characterized by ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'') and protein in the urine (proteinuria). If not properly recognized and managed, preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia, which is defined as the development of seizures in a woman with preeclampsia. Eclampsia is serious for both mother and baby and can even be fatal. Preeclampsia was formerly known as toxemia of pregnancy. Without treatment, it has been estimated that 1 out of 200 cases of preeclampsia will progress to seizures (eclampsia). Estimates of the incidence of preeclampsia range from 2% to 7% in healthy women who have never before given birth.''Preeclampsia occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and can occur during the days following birth. Some reports describe preeclampsia as occurring up to 4 to 6 weeks after birth, although most cases of postpartum preeclampsia occur within 48 hours of delivery. A mahority of cases occur after the 34th week of gestation, and 6% occur after birth.''Preeclampsia and eclampsia are most common in first-time ''pregnancies''. Pregnant teens and women over 40 are also at increased risk.' "
What causes preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'The exact cause of preeclampsia and eclampsia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a disorder of the lining of blood vessels. Abnormalities of the placenta have also been described. It likely arises due to a combination of factors, including both genetic and environmental influences. A number of genes have been studied as being potentially involved in preeclampsia, and there is an increased risk for women with affected family members. Nutritional factors, ''obesity'', and the immune system may also play a role in its development although this is not yet fully understood. Some studies of the immune response in preeclampsia have shown problems in the way certain cells of the immune system interact with each other to regulate the immune response.'  "

What are the symptoms of preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Most women with mild preeclampsia do not have any symptoms.''Other symptoms and signs that can occur with severe preeclampsia include\xa0''Symptoms of eclampsia include those of preeclampsia along with the development of seizures. When seizures occur, they are most often preceded by neurological symptoms like ''headache'' and vision disturbances. Women with severe preeclampsia may have a reduced ''platelet count'' (below 100,000).''Signs and symptoms of preeclampsia go away within 1 to 6 weeks after delivery of the baby.'   The hallmark signs, as mentioned previously, are the presence of protein in the urine and elevated blood pressure. Swelling of the feet, legs, and hands is also common, but this can occur in normal pregnancy and is not necessarily related to preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia may experience sudden weight gain over 1 to 2 days. dizziness, headaches, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, vision changes, changes in reflexes, altered mental state, fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), and a decrease in urine output."
How are preeclampsia and eclampsia diagnosed?,"'Preeclampsia may be diagnosed at a regular pregnancy health screening.''Recent research has shown that Congo red (CR) ''spotting'' tests may be better indicators of preeclampsia than standard urine dipstick tests for proteinuria. The test is based on the fact that the urine and placentas of women with preeclampsia contain abnormally folded proteins that bind to the Congo red stain. Since preeclampsia may be asymptomatic (produce no symptoms), it is important for pregnant women to have routine health checkups. Tests to monitor the health of mother and baby will also be ordered.''There are no predictive tests to show whether or not a woman will develop preeclampsia.' Protein in the urine is diagnosed by urinalysis, and blood pressure measurements taken in the clinic may show elevated values. Blood pressure in preeclampsia is usually over 140/90. Blood tests, such as blood cell counts and tests for blood clotting ability, can also be done."
What is the treatment for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'There is no cure for preeclampsia and eclampsia other than delivery of the baby. The decision about whether to induce ''labor'' or perform a Cesarean section depends upon the severity of the condition, as well as the gestational age and health of the fetus.'""Women with mild preeclampsia are often induced at 37 weeks' gestation. Prior to this time, they can be managed at home or in the hospital with close monitoring. During this time steroid ""'drugs'"" may be given to promote maturation of the baby's lungs. Women with mild preeclampsia prior to 37 weeks' gestation are often placed on bed rest with frequent medical monitoring.""'In severe preeclampsia, delivery (induction of ''labor'' or Cesarean delivery [''C-section'']) is usually considered after 34 weeks of gestation. The risks to the mother and baby from the disease must be balanced against the risk of prematurity in each case. Intravenous magnesium sulfate can be given to women with severe preeclampsia to prevent seizures. This medication is safe for the baby. Oral ''supplements'' containing magnesium are not effective in preventing seizures and are not recommended. Medications such as ''hydralazine'' to lower blood pressure may also be given.''Eclampsia is a medical emergency. It is treated with medications to control seizures and maintain a stable blood pressure with the goal of minimizing complications for both mother and baby. Magnesium sulfate is used as a first-line treatment when eclamptic seizures do occur. If the seizures are not controlled by magnesium sulfate, other medications such as ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin'', ''Dilantin-125'') can be administered.' "
What are complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia?,"'Preeclampsia reduces the amount of blood flow to the placenta and the fetus. Therefore, the baby may have delayed growth and low birth weight. Preterm delivery is also more common. Oligohydramnios, a decrease in the volume of ''amniotic fluid'',\xa0is a frequent accompaniment of preeclampsia.''Severe preeclampsia can affect liver and kidney function. HELLP syndrome,\xa0''hemolysis'' (destruction of ''red blood cells''), elevated ''liver enzymes'', and low platelets, is a rare complication of preeclampsia. Symptoms include ''headache'', ''nausea'',\xa0''vomiting'', and right upper quadrant\xa0''abdominal pain''. In some cases, HELLP syndrome develops before the typical signs of preeclampsia are apparent.''Other uncommon complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia include decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in a ''stroke''.' Preeclampsia increases the risk of placental abruption, or separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. When this is severe, life-threatening bleeding and fetal death can occur."
Can preeclampsia and eclampsia be prevented?,"'There is no way known to prevent preeclampsia and eclampsia. However, the outcome can be improved with prompt recognition and management, so it is important for pregnant women to have routine health screenings.' "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for preeclampsia and eclampsia?,'Most women with mild preeclampsia have good pregnancy outcomes. Eclampsia is a serious condition with about a 2% mortality (death) rate.''The recurrence risk for preeclampsia varies according to the onset and severity of the condition.''Women with preeclampsia may be at increased risk for ''cardiovascular disease'' later in life. This risk is greatest in women with early onset of severe preeclampsia. Research is ongoing to further clarify this potential risk.' Women with severe preeclampsia who had an onset of the condition early in pregnancy have the highest recurrence risk. Studies show recurrence rates of 25% to 65% for this population. Only 5% to 7% of women with mild preeclampsia will have preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy.
What is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)? What is the history of ECT? Why is electroconvulsive therapy controversial?,"'Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-medication medical treatment that addresses severe psychiatric symptoms, after trials of medications and ''psychotherapy'' have been unsuccessful or a ''mental health'"" disorder is determined to be severe and acute enough to warrant this intervention. During this brain stimulation procedure, a health care professional passes an electric current through the patient's brain to produce controlled convulsions (""'seizures'') while the person is sedated using general anesthesia. This device is often used in a hospital but can be done on an outpatient basis (the individual receiving the treatment does not stay overnight in a mental hospital or medical hospital).''Formerly called electroshock therapy or ''shock'' therapy, ECT is a form of mental health therapy that can be a life-saving treatment for people with some severe mental illnesses. It was based on a procedure in which ''seizures'' were chemically induced in patients using a ''heart'' medication (Metrazol). Health care professionals first performed the procedure in 1934 in Hungary to treat ''schizophrenia'"". In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti delivered electrical currents directly to a person's brain to induce seizures to treat ""'schizophrenia'' for the first time. By 1940, psychiatrists were using ECT in the United States. The U.S. military often used ECT during World War II, after which it became widely used in American and European psychiatric hospitals. It was in the late 1940s that doctors started placing electrodes on one side of the brain (unilaterally) rather than both sides (bilaterally), which resulted in less side effects like ''memory loss'' or speech problems.''Despite those advances, ECT fell out of favor for at least a generation in psychiatry, starting in the 1960s. Rather than the popularity of psychoanalysis or the rise of medication treatments from pharmaceutical companies, it is thought that in addition to the significant adverse effects on memory and personality that bilateral ECT treatment caused, a cultural bias against psychiatry in general and against ECT specifically is the reason that this highly effective medical treatment became controversial. Novels like ''Asylum'' in 1961 and '""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""' in 1962, as well as the film based on the latter novel, released in 1975, are thought to have fueled some of that backlash by emphasizing the worst characterization of this treatment as shock therapy. The anti-psychiatry stance of groups like the Church of Scientology is also thought to have contributed to the stigma that mental health treatments, particularly ECT, incurred during that period.''Appreciation of the effectiveness of ECT started regaining ground in psychiatry during the mid-1980s with the publication of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference on Electroconvulsive Therapy, published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' (''JAMA''), which documented how well this medical treatment improves symptoms of ''depression''. By the mid-1990s, several guidelines for conducting ECT were published, providing predictability, standardizing, and thus credibility of this brain stimulation therapy in providing care for severe mental health disorders.' "
"Why do physicians perform electroconvulsive therapy? What types of 
health care professionals administer electroconvulsive therapy?","'ECT is quite useful in psychiatry for the care of certain patients with significant ''depression'', particularly for those who cannot take or are not responding to ''antidepressants'', suffer from severe ''depression'', or are at a high risk for ''suicide''. ECT often is effective in cases where ''antidepressant'' medications and psychotherapy do not provide sufficient relief of symptoms. Physicians often consider if a treatment known as magnetic stimulation therapy is ineffective. The effectiveness of this medical treatment has been shown for the depressive symptoms of both major depressive (unipolar) and ''manic''-depressive (bipolar) disorders. Studies also show it to be a sound treatment in the care of people who suffer from ''mania'', psychosis in the form of ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', schizophreniform disorder, and any severe decrease in movement and speech (''catatonia''). ECT is an effective treatment for people of a wide range of ages, from children and adolescents to elderly patients.''Availability of psychiatric hospitals that conduct this mental health treatment seems to be lower for ethnic minorities compared to Caucasians in the United States, and therefore minorities are less likely to receive this clinical intervention. Beyond what could be explained by age, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, or by severity of the ''mental illness'' (severe ''major depression'' or ''bipolar disorder'') of the patient, African Americans tend to receive this therapy less often than Caucasians in the United States. Worldwide, while older women with symptoms of ''depression'' tend to be the most frequent recipients of ECT in western countries, younger men with schizophrenia make up the group most often receiving this therapy in Asian countries.'""Given the need for the ECT recipient to receive general anesthesia, medical professionals, usually psychiatrists, administer this medical therapy. Prior to starting a course of this medical intervention, the medical team will consult the patient's primary care doctor in order to determine that the person is physically able to receive the anesthetic and undergo ECT. Physicians, primarily psychiatrists, usually perform this therapy, assisted by an anesthesiologist and nurse, as well as a physician assistant and/or nurse practitioner to assure the safety and comfort of the patient by providing ongoing medical assessment and care."" "
How does electroconvulsive therapy work? How does it treat depression and other illnesses?,"""This procedure works by triggering a massive neurochemical release in the patient's brain due to a controlled ""'seizure''. Research also raises the possibility that the seizures induced by ECT result in the generation of more neurons in the brain (neurogenesis). It is highly effective, in that the American Psychiatric Association describes it as being effective in about 80% of people with the potentially life-threatening mental illnesses previously described, often in people whose depression or other mental health symptoms have failed to respond to other treatments, like medicines and psychotherapy. ECT relieves symptoms of depression within one to two weeks after beginning treatments. After a course of ECT, some patients will continue to have maintenance ECT, while others will return to or continue antidepressant or other psychiatric medications to maintain their mental health on a long-term basis.' "
How do doctors perform electroconvulsive therapy today? What are the side effects of ECT? Why does ECT cause memory loss?,"'In recent years, the technique of ECT has improved. A psychiatrist usually performs this mental health treatment in a hospital, with muscle relaxant medicine and under anesthesia so that people receiving this procedure do not feel ''pain'"" or discomfort. In addition to having the person's ""'breathing'', temperature, heart functioning, and ''blood pressure'' monitored during the procedure, the doctor will monitor for the desired presence of ''seizure'' activity in the brain using an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), since seizure activity is not always physically visible. Most patients undergo six to 10 treatments. A physician places electrodes on the ''scalp'', usually on just one side of the brain (unilaterally). Then, the device passes an electrical current through the brain to cause a controlled seizure, which typically lasts for 20 to 90 seconds. A person usually needs six to 12 treatments for this medical therapy to be effective. The patient is awake in five to 10 minutes.''The most common side effects of ECT include brief ''confusion'' immediately after the procedure, as well as a temporary loss of ''short-term memory'', which usually resolves within about six weeks. While placing electrodes on both sides of the brain (bilaterally) is thought to be more effective than unilateral placement, ''memory loss'' tends to worsen, even to the level of ''brain damage'' with bilateral treatment. Other side effects may include ''headache'', high or ''low blood pressure'', rapid heartbeat, ''nausea'', and sore muscles, although the muscle relaxant given to the ECT recipient decreases the frequency and severity of muscle soreness. This mental health therapy usually can be done safely as an outpatient procedure as long as someone transports the recipient.'  "
What does ECT cost?,"'The cost to the consumer for ECT varies depending on if the person has health insurance, if the insurance covers this procedure, and to what extent. The cost of each ECT session is about $2,500, for a total of $25,000 for the 10 sessions an average course of treatment entails. That does not include the cost of a hospital stay if necessary.'  "

What should I know about ectopic pregnancy?,"'An ''ectopic pregnancy'' is a ''pregnancy'' located outside the inner lining of the uterus. The Fallopian tubes are the most common locations for an ectopic pregnancy.''The three symptoms (characteristics) of ectopic pregnancy are ''abdominal pain'', absence of menstrual periods (''amenorrhea''), and ''vaginal bleeding''. However, only about 50% of women have all three of these symptoms.''Ectopic or ''tubal pregnancy'' is caused when a fertilized egg lodges in a Fallopian tube or other location instead of continuing its journey to the uterus, where it is supposed to implant. The egg can become stuck when a Fallopian tube is damaged, scarred, or distorted.''Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include previous ectopic ''pregnancies'' and conditions (surgery, infection) that disrupt the normal anatomy of the Fallopian tubes. The major health risk of an ectopic pregnancy is rupture, leading to ''internal bleeding''.''Ectopic pregnancy occurs in 1%-2% of all pregnancies.''Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is usually established by blood hormone tests and pelvic ''ultrasound''.''Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include both surgery and medication.'  "
What is the medical definition of ectopic pregnancy?,'An ectopic pregnancy is an early pregnancy that occurs outside of the normal location (uterine lining) for a developing pregnancy. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy cannot progress normally and typically results in the death of the embryo or fetus.' 
What is an ectopic pregnancy? What does an ectopic pregnancy look like (picture)?,"'An ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a condition in which a fertilized egg settles and grows in any location other than the inner lining of the uterus. The vast majority of ectopic pregnancies are so-called tubal pregnancies and occur in the Fallopian tube. However, they can occur in other locations, such as the ovary, cervix, and abdominal ''cavity''. An ectopic pregnancy occurs in about one in 1%-2% of all pregnancies. A molar pregnancy differs from an ectopic pregnancy in that it is usually a mass of tissue derived from an egg with incomplete genetic information that grows in the uterus in a grape-like mass that can cause symptoms to those of pregnancy.''The major health risk of ectopic pregnancy is rupture leading to internal bleeding. Before the 19th century, the mortality rate (death rate) from ectopic pregnancies exceeded 50%. By the end of the 19th century, the mortality rate dropped to five percent because of surgical intervention. Statistics suggest that with current advances in early detection, the mortality rate has improved to less than five in 10,000. The survival rate from ectopic pregnancies is improving even though the incidence of ectopic pregnancies is also increasing. The major reason for a poor outcome is failure to seek early medical attention. Ectopic pregnancy remains the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy.''In rare cases, an ectopic pregnancy may occur at the same time as an intrauterine pregnancy. This is referred to as heterotopic pregnancy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has risen in recent years due to the increasing use of ''IVF'' (''in vitro fertilization'') and other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs).''For additional diagrams and photos, please see the last reference listed below.' "
What are the early and later signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy?,"'The woman may not be aware that she is ''pregnant''. The three classic signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include ''abdominal pain'', the absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and ''vaginal bleeding'' or intermittent bleeding (''spotting''). The however, about 50% of females with an ectopic pregnancy will not have all three signs. These characteristic symptoms occur in ruptured ectopic pregnancies (those accompanied by severe internal bleeding) and non-ruptured ectopic pregnancies. However, while these symptoms are typical for an ectopic pregnancy, they do not mean an ectopic pregnancy is necessarily present and could represent other conditions. In fact, these symptoms also occur with a threatened abortion (''miscarriage'') in nonectopic pregnancies.''The signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy typically occur six to eight weeks after the last normal ''menstrual period'', but they may occur later if the ectopic pregnancy is not located in the Fallopian tube. Other ''symptoms of pregnancy'' (for example, ''nausea'' and breast discomfort, etc.) may also be present in ectopic pregnancy. ''Weakness'', ''dizziness'', and a sense of passing out upon standing can (also termed near-''syncope'') be signs of serious internal bleeding and ''low blood pressure'' from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and require immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, some women with a bleeding ectopic pregnancy do not recognize they have symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. Their diagnosis is delayed until the woman shows signs of ''shock'' (for example, ''low blood pressure'', weak and rapid pulse, ''pale skin'' and ''confusion'') and often is brought to an emergency department.'' This situation is a medical emergency.'  "
What are risk factors for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Age:'' Ectopic pregnancy can occur in any woman, of any age, who is ovulating and is sexually active with a male partner. The highest likelihood ectopic pregnancy occurs in women aged 35-44 years.''History:'' The greatest risk factor for an ectopic pregnancy is a prior history of an ectopic pregnancy.''Fallopian tube abnormalities:'' Any disruption of the normal architecture of the Fallopian tubes can be a risk factor for a tubal pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy in other locations.''Previous gynecological surgeries:'' Previous surgery on the Fallopian tubes such as tubal sterilization or reconstructive, procedures can lead to scarring and disruption of the normal anatomy of the tubes and increases the risk of an ectopic pregnancy.''Infections:'' Infection in the pelvis (''pelvic inflammatory disease'') is another risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic infections are usually caused by sexually-transmitted organism, such as ''Chlamydia'' or ''N. gonorrhoeae'', the bacteria that cause ''gonorrhea''. However, non-sexually transmitted bacteria can also cause pelvic infection and increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. Infection causes an ectopic pregnancy by damaging or obstructing the Fallopian tubes. Normally, the inner lining of the Fallopian tubes is coated with small hair-like projections called cilia. These cilia are important to transport the egg smoothly from the ovary through the Fallopian tube and into the uterus. If these cilia are damaged by infection, egg transport becomes disrupted. The fertilized egg can settle in the Fallopian tube without reaching the uterus, thus becoming an ectopic pregnancy. Likewise, infection-related scarring and partial blockage of the Fallopian tubes can also prevent the egg from reaching the uterus.''Multiple sex partners:'"" Because having multiple sexual partners increases a woman's risk of pelvic infections, multiple sexual partners also are associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.""'Gynecological conditions:'' Like pelvic infections, conditions such as ''endometriosis'', ''fibroid'' tumors, or pelvic ''scar tissue'' (pelvic adhesions), can narrow the Fallopian tubes and disrupt egg transportation, thereby increasing the chances of an ectopic pregnancy.''IUD'' use:'' Approximately half of pregnancies in women using intrauterine devices (IUDs) will be located outside of the uterus. However, the total number of women ''becoming pregnant'' while using IUDs is extremely low. Therefore, the overall number of ectopic pregnancies related to IUDs is very low.''Cigarette smoking'':'' ''Cigarette smoking'' around the time of ''conception'"" has also been associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. This risk was observed to be dose-dependent, which means that the risk is dependent upon the individual woman's habits and increases with the number of cigarettes smoked.""'Infertility'':'' A history of ''infertility'' for two or more years also is associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.'""Other causes: Infection, congenital abnormalities, or tumors of the Fallopian tubes can increase a woman's risk of having an ectopic pregnancy.""  "
Is there a test to diagnose ectopic pregnancy?,"'The first step in the diagnosis is an interview and examination by the doctor. The usual second step is to obtain a qualitative (positive or negative for pregnancy) or quantitative (measures hormone levels) ''pregnancy test''. Occasionally, the doctor may feel a tender mass during the pelvic examination. If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, the combination of blood hormone ''pregnancy tests'' and pelvic ultrasound can usually help to establish the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound is the most useful test to visualize an ectopic pregnancy. In this test, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the vagina, and pelvic images are visible on a monitor. Transvaginal ultrasound can reveal the gestational sac in either a normal (intrauterine) pregnancy or an ectopic pregnancy, but often the findings are not conclusive. Rather than a gestational sac containing a visible embryo, the examination may simply reveal a mass in the area of the Fallopian tubes or elsewhere that is suggestive of, but not conclusive for, an ectopic pregnancy. The ultrasound can also demonstrate the absence of pregnancy within the uterus.''Pregnancy tests are designed to detect specific hormones; the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta HCG) blood levels are also used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Beta HCG levels normally rise during pregnancy. An abnormal pattern in the rise of this hormone can be a clue to the presence of an ectopic pregnancy. In rare cases, ''laparoscopy'' may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. During laparoscopy, viewing instruments are inserted through small incisions in the abdominal wall to visualize the structures in the abdomen and pelvis, thereby revealing the site of the ectopic pregnancy.'  "
Is an ectopic pregnancy dangerous? Can you die from it?,"'Some women spontaneously absorb the fetus from the ectopic pregnancy, and have no apparent side effects. In these instances, the woman can be observed without treatment. However, the true incidence of spontaneous resolution of ectopic pregnancies is unknown. It is not possible to predict which women will spontaneously resolve their ectopic pregnancies.''The most feared complication of an ectopic pregnancy is rupture, leading to internal bleeding, pelvic and ''abdominal pain'', shock, and even death. Therefore, bleeding in an ectopic pregnancy may require immediate surgical attention. Bleeding results from the rupture of the Fallopian tube or from blood leaking from the end of the tube as the growing placenta erodes into the veins and arteries located inside the tubal wall. Blood coming from the tube can be very irritating to other tissues and organs in the pelvis and abdomen, and result in significant ''pain''. The pelvic blood can lead to ''scar'' tissue formation that can result in problems with becoming pregnant in the future. The scar tissue can also increase the risk of future ectopic pregnancies.''Obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are the specialists who typically treat ectopic pregnancies. However, ''emergency medicine'' specialists and surgeons treat ruptured ectopic pregnancies. If you think you may have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy go to your nearest emergency room right away.' "
What are the treatments for ectopic pregnancy?,"'Treatment options for ectopic pregnancy include observation, laparoscopy, laparotomy, and medication. Selection of these options is individualized. Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve on their own without the need for any intervention, while others will need urgent surgery due to life-threatening bleeding. However, because of the risk of rupture and potential dire consequences, most women with a diagnosed ectopic pregnancy are treated with medications or surgery.''For those who require intervention, the most common treatment is surgery. Two surgical options are available; laparotomy and laparoscopy. Laparotomy is an open procedure whereby a transverse (bikini line) incision is made across the lower abdomen. Laparoscopy involves inserting viewing instruments into the pelvis through tiny incisions in the skin. For many surgeons and patients, laparoscopy is preferred over laparotomy because of the tiny incisions used and the speedy recovery afterwards. Under optimal conditions, a small incision can be made in the Fallopian tube and the ectopic pregnancy removed, leaving the Fallopian tube intact. However, certain conditions make laparoscopy less effective or unavailable as an alternative. These include massive pelvic scar tissue and excessive blood in the abdomen or pelvis. In some instances, the location or extent of damage may require removal of a portion of the Fallopian tube, the entire tube, the ovary, and even the uterus.'  "
What medications treat ectopic pregnancy? Can an ectopic pregnancy go full term?,"'Medical therapy can also be successful in treating certain groups of women who have an ectopic pregnancy. Medical treatment method involves the use of an anti-''cancer'' drug called ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''). This drug acts by killing the growing cells of the placenta, thereby inducing miscarriage of the ectopic pregnancy. Some patients may not respond to methotrexate, and will require surgical treatment. Methotrexate is gaining popularity because of its high success rate and low rate of side effects.''There are certain factors, including the size of the mass associated with the ectopic pregnancy and the blood beta HCG concentrations that help doctors decide which women are candidates for medical rather than surgical treatment. The optimal candidates for methotrexate treatment are women with a beta-subunit (HCG) concentration less than or equal to 5000 mIU/mL. In a properly selected patient population, methotrexate therapy is about 90% effective in treating ectopic pregnancy. There is no evidence that the use of this drug causes any adverse effects in subsequent pregnancies. Additional tests (HCG) are usually ordered to confirm that methotrexate treatment is effective.''Although there have been a few reported cases of women giving birth by cesarean section to live infants that were located outside the uterus, this is extremely rare. The chance of carrying an ectopic pregnancy to full term is so remote, and the risk to the woman so great, that it can never be recommended. It would be ideal if an ectopic pregnancy in the Fallopian tube could be saved by surgery to relocate it into the uterus. This concept has yet to become accepted as a successful procedure. Overall, there have been great advances in the early diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy, and the death rate from this condition has decreased dramatically.' "
What is atopic dermatitis?,"""Atopic dermatitis is a common, often persistent skin disease that affects a large percentage of the world's population. Atopy is a special type of ""'allergic'' hypersensitivity that is associated with ''asthma'', ''inhalant'' ''allergies'' (''hay fever''), and a chronic dermatitis. There is a known hereditary component of the disease, and it is more common in affected families. Criteria that enable a doctor to diagnose it include the typical appearance and distribution of the ''rash'' in a patient with a personal or family history of ''asthma'' and/or hay ''fever''. The term ''atopic'' is from the Greek meaning ""strange."" The term ''dermatitis'' means inflammation of the skin. Many physicians and patients use the term ''eczema'' when they are referring to this condition. Sometimes it is called neurodermatitis.''In atopic dermatitis, the skin becomes extremely ''itchy'' and inflamed, causing redness, swelling, vesicle formation (minute ''blisters''), cracking, weeping, crusting, and scaling. This type of eruption is termed eczematous. In addition, ''dry skin'' is a very common complaint in almost all those afflicted with atopic dermatitis.''Although atopic dermatitis can occur in any age, most often it affects infants and young children. Occasionally, it may persist into adulthood or may rarely appear at that time. Some patients tend to have a protracted course with ups and downs. In most cases, there are periods of time when the disease is worse, called exacerbations or flares, which are followed by periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely, called remissions. Many children with atopic dermatitis enter into a permanent remission of the disease when they get older, although their skin may remain somewhat dry and easily irritated.''Multiple factors can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis, including low humidity, seasonal ''allergies'', exposure to harsh soaps and detergents, and ''cold'' weather. Environmental factors can activate symptoms of atopic dermatitis at any time in the lives of individuals who have inherited the atopic disease trait.'  "
How common is atopic dermatitis?," Atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and increasing in prevalence. It affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). Atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children, and its onset decreases substantially with age. Of those affected, 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life, and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. Onset after age 30 is uncommon and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. People who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. About 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. Roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood. This means that more than 15 million people in the United States have symptoms of the disease."
What are the symptoms and signs of atopic dermatitis?,"'Although symptoms and signs may vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin.' Itch is the hallmark of the disease. Typically, affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face, and neck. The itchiness is an important factor in atopic dermatitis, because scratching and rubbing can worsen the skin inflammation that is characteristic of this disease. People with atopic dermatitis seem to be more sensitive to itching and feel the need to scratch longer in response. They develop what is referred to as the ""itch-scratch"" cycle. The extreme itchiness of the skin causes the person to scratch, which in turn worsens the itch, and so on. Itching is particularly a problem during sleep, when conscious control of scratching decreases and the absence of other outside stimuli makes the itchiness more noticeable."
What are the causes and risk factors of atopic dermatitis?,"'The cause of atopic dermatitis is not known, but the disease seems to result from a combination of genetic (hereditary) and environmental factors. There seems to be a basic cutaneous hypersensitivity and an increased tendency toward itching. Evidence suggests that the disease is associated with other so-called atopic disorders such as hay ''fever'' (seasonal ''allergies'') and ''asthma'', which many people with atopic dermatitis also have.' In addition, many children who outgrow the symptoms of atopic dermatitis go on to develop hay fever or asthma. Although one disorder does not necessarily cause another, they may be related, thereby giving researchers clues to understanding atopic dermatitis. Many of those affected seem to have either a decreased quantity of or a defective form of a protein called filaggrin in their skin. This protein seem to be important in maintaining normal cutaneous hydration. It is important to understand that food sensitivities do not seem to be a major inciting factor for most cases of atopic dermatitis. This is an area of active research. Patients with atopic dermatitis seem to have mild immune system weakness. They are predisposed to develop fungal foot disease and cutaneous staphylococcal infections, and they can disseminate herpes simplex lip infections (eczema herpeticum) and smallpox vaccination (eczema vaccinatum) to large areas of skin. While emotional factors and stress may sometimes exacerbate the condition, they do not seem to be a primary or underlying cause for the disorder."
Can atopic dermatitis affect the face?,"'Yes. Atopic dermatitis may affect the skin around the eyes, the eyelids, the eyebrows, and lashes. Scratching and rubbing the eye area can cause the skin to change in appearance. Some people with atopic dermatitis develop an extra fold of skin under their eyes, called an atopic pleat or Dennie-Morgan fold. Other people may have hyperpigmented eyelids, meaning that the skin on their eyelids darkens from the inflammation or hay fever (allergic shiners). Patchy eyebrows and eyelashes may also result from scratching or rubbing.''The face is very commonly affected in ''babies'', who may drool excessively, and become irritated from skin contact with their abundant saliva.''The skin of a person with atopic dermatitis loses excessive moisture from the epidermal layer. Some patients with atopic dermatitis lack a protein called filaggrin that is important in retaining moisture. This defective genetic trait allows the skin to become very dry, which reduces its protective abilities. In addition, the skin is very susceptible to infectious disorders, such as staphylococcal and streptococcal bacterial skin infections, ''warts'', herpes simplex, and ''molluscum contagiosum'' (which is caused by a virus).' Lichenification: thick, leathery skin resulting from constant scratching and rubbing Lichen simplex: refers to a thickened patch of raised skin that results from repeat rubbing and scratching of the same skin area Papules: small, raised bumps that may open when scratched, becoming crusty and infected Ichthyosis: dry, rectangular scales on the skin, commonly on the lower legs and shins Keratosis pilaris: small, rough bumps, generally on the face, upper arms, and thighs. These are also described as gooseflesh or chicken skin and may have a small coiled hair under each bump. Hyper-linear palms: increased number of skin creases on the palms Urticaria: hives (red, raised bumps), often after exposure to an allergen, at the beginning of flare-ups, or after exercise or a hot bath Cheilitis: inflammation of the skin on and around the lips Atopic pleat (Dennie-Morgan fold): an extra fold of skin that develops under the eye Dark circles under the eyes: may result from allergies and atopy Hyperpigmented eyelids: scaling eyelids that have become darker in color from inflammation or hay fever Prurigo nodules also called ""picker's warts"" are not really warts at all. These are small thickened bumps of skin caused by repeated picking of the same skin site."
Is atopic dermatitis contagious?,"'No. Atopic dermatitis itself is definitely not ''contagious'', and it cannot be passed from one person to another through skin contact. There is generally no cause for concern in being around someone with even an active case of atopic dermatitis, unless they have active skin infections.''Some patients with atopic dermatitis get secondary infections of their skin with ''Staphylococcus'' (""''staph''""), other bacteria, herpes virus (''cold sores''), and less commonly yeasts and other ''fungal infections''. These infections may be contagious through skin contact.' "
Atopic dermatitis vs. eczema,"'Eczema'' is a nonspecific term for many types of skin inflammation (dermatitis). There are different categories of ''eczema'', which include allergic, contact, irritant, and ''nummular eczema'', which can be difficult to distinguish from atopic dermatitis. These types of eczema are listed and briefly described below.''Atopy is a medical syndrome that includes three associated conditions that tend to occur in the same individual: atopic dermatitis, inhalant allergies, and asthma. All three components need not be present in the same individual simultaneously.' Contact eczema: a localized reaction that includes redness, itching, and burning where the skin has come into direct contact with an irritant such as an acid, a cleaning agent, or other chemical Allergic contact eczema: a red, itchy, weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign, such as poison ivy or certain chemicals or antibiotics in creams and lotions like neomycin (Neosporin) or bacitracin (Baciguent) Seborrheic eczema (also called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea) is a very common form of mild skin inflammation of unknown cause that presents as yellowish, oily, scaly patches of skin on the scalp, face, ears, and occasionally other parts of the body. Often this is also called dandruff in adults or ""cradle cap"" in infants. Nummular eczema: coin-shaped (round), isolated patches of irritated skin -- most commonly on the arms and lower legs -- that may be crusted, scaling, and extremely itchy Lichen simplex chronicus (localized neurodermatitis): a dermatitis localized to a particular anatomical area induced by long-term rubbing, scratching, or picking the skin. The underlying cause may be a sensitivity or irritation that sets off a cascade of repeated itching and scratching cycles. It may be seen as scratch marks and pick marks. Areas of thickened plaques form on the skin of the neck, shins, wrists, or forearms. This condition has certain similarities to calluses, and it will resolve if the patient stops irritating the area. Stasis dermatitis: a skin irritation on the lower legs, generally related to circulatory problems and congestion of the leg veins. It may have a darker pigmentation, light-brown, or purplish-red discoloration from the congestion and back up of the blood in the leg veins. It's sometimes seen more in legs with varicose veins. Dyshidrotic eczema or pompholyx: irritation of the skin on the palms of hands (mostly) and less commonly soles of the feet characterized by clear, very deep-seated blisters that itch and burn. It's sometimes described as a ""tapioca pudding""-like rash on the palms. Xerotic eczema: areas of very dry skin most often seen on the lower legs of the elderly"
What are the stages of atopic dermatitis?,"'Atopic dermatitis seems to have a differing pattern of involvement depending on the age of a patient.''In infants, atopic dermatitis typically begins around 6 to 12 weeks of age.''In childhood, the rash tends to occur behind the knees and inside the elbows, on the sides of the neck, and on the wrists, ankles, and hands.''In those with more heavily pigmented skin, especially the face, areas of lighter skin color appear. This condition is called pityriasis alba. It is usually self-limited and the color will eventually normalize.''The disease may go into remission (disease-free period) for months or even years.' It may first appear around the cheeks and chin as a patchy facial rash, which can progress to red, scaling, oozing skin. The skin may become infected. Once the infant becomes more mobile and begins crawling, exposed areas such as the knees and elbows may also be affected. An infant with atopic dermatitis may be restless and irritable because of the itching and discomfort. Many infants improve by 18 months of age, although they remain at greater than normal risk for dry skin or hand eczema later in life. Often, the rash begins with papules that become hard and scaly when scratched. The skin around the lips may be inflamed, and constant licking of the area may lead to small, painful cracks. Severe eczema cases may affect growth, and the child may be shorter than average. In most children, the disease disappears after puberty. Although a number of people who developed atopic dermatitis as children also experience symptoms as adults, it is less common for the disease to show up first in adulthood. The pattern in adults is similar to that seen in children; that is, the disease may be widespread or limited. In some adults, only the hands or feet may be affected and become dry, itchy, red, and cracked. Sleep patterns and work performance may be affected, and long-term use of medications to treat the condition may cause complications. Adults with atopic dermatitis also have a predisposition toward irritant contact dermatitis, especially if they are in occupations involving frequent hand wetting, hand washing, or exposure to chemicals. Some people develop a rash around their nipples. These localized symptoms are difficult to treat, and people often do not tell their doctor because of modesty or embarrassment. Adults may also develop cataracts that are difficult to detect because they cause no symptoms. Therefore, the doctor may recommend regular eye exams."
Which types of doctors treat atopic dermatitis?,"'Pediatricians, allergists, and dermatologists care for most patients with atopic dermatitis.' "
What tests diagnose atopic dermatitis?,"'The diagnosis is made on the physical examination and visual inspection of the skin. The personal history of inhalant allergies and family history will often support the diagnosis. Although itching is necessary but not sufficient to diagnose atopic dermatitis, consideration of other itchy eruptions is often necessary.''A ''skin biopsy'' (a sample of a small piece of skin that is sent to the lab for examination under the microscope) is rarely helpful to establish the diagnosis. Many patients with severe atopic disease may have elevated numbers of a certain type of white blood cells (eosinophils) and/or elevated serum IgE level. These tests can support the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Additionally, skin swab (long cotton tip applicator or Q-tip) samples may be sent to the lab to exclude staphylococcal infections of the skin, which may complicate atopic dermatitis.''Skin scratch/prick tests (which involve scratching or pricking the skin with a needle that contains a small amount of a suspected allergen) and blood tests for airborne allergens generally are not as useful in diagnosing atopic dermatitis. Positive skin scratch/prick test results are difficult to interpret in people with atopic dermatitis and are often inaccurate.''Major features''Some minor features' Itching Characteristic rash in locations typical of the disease (arm folds and behind knees) Chronic or repeatedly occurring symptoms Personal or family history of atopic disorders (eczema, hay fever, asthma) Early age of onset Dry, rough skin High levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody, in the blood Ichthyosis Hyper linear palms Keratosis pilaris Hand or foot dermatitis Cheilitis (dry or irritated lips) Nipple eczema Susceptibility to skin infection Positive allergy skin tests"
How can you prevent and avoid aggravating factors for atopic dermatitis?,"'Patients with atopic dermatitis should limit exposure to environmental and chemical factors known to cause exacerbations. These include dry skin, quick changes in temperature, the low humidity encountered during cold weather, and wool clothing.' "
What are skin irritants for atopic dermatitis?,"'Irritants are substances that directly damage the skin, and when used in high enough concentrations for long enough, cause the skin to become inflamed. Soaps, detergents, and even water may produce inflammation. Some perfumes and ''cosmetics'' may irritate the skin. Chlorine and alcoholic solvents, dust, or sand may also aggravate the condition. ''Cigarette'' smoke may irritate the eyelids.' Wool or synthetic fibers Soaps and detergents Some perfumes and cosmetics Substances such as chlorine, mineral oil, or solvents Dust or sand Dust mites Cigarette smoke Animal fur or dander Flowers and pollen"
What food allergies trigger atopic dermatitis?,"'Allergens are substances from foods, plants, or animals that provoke an overreaction of the immune system and cause inflammation (in this case, the skin). The importance of ''food allergy'' in atopic dermatitis is controversial. Although not all researchers agree, most experts think that ''breastfeeding'' the infant for at least four months may have a protective effect for the child. New lines of evidence even support exposing young children to normal environmental contaminants such as peanuts. Although such exposures may prevent the development of atopic dermatitis, there is no consensus on how to prevent the development of atopic diseases.''If a ''food allergy'' is suspected, it may be helpful to keep a careful diary of everything the patient eats, noting any reactions. Identifying the food allergen may be difficult and require supervision by an allergist if the patient is also being exposed to other allergens. One helpful way to explore the possibility of a food ''allergy'' is to eliminate the suspected food and then, if improvement is noticed, reintroduce it into the ''diet'' under carefully controlled conditions. A two-week trial is usually sufficient for each food. If the food being tested causes no symptoms after two weeks, a different food can be tested in like manner afterward. Likewise, if the elimination of a food does not result in improvement after two weeks, other foods may be eliminated in turn.''Changing the ''diet'"" of a person who has atopic dermatitis may not always relieve symptoms. A change may be helpful, however, when a patient's medical history and specific symptoms strongly suggest a food ""'allergy''. It is up to the patient and his or her family and physician to judge whether the dietary restrictions outweigh the impact of the disease itself. Restricted diets often are emotionally and financially difficult for patients and their families to follow. Unless properly monitored, diets with many restrictions can also contribute to nutritional problems in children.' "
What are aeroallergens?,"'Some allergens are called aeroallergens because they are present in the air. They may also play a role in atopic dermatitis.'""No reliable test is available that determines whether a specific aeroallergen is an exacerbating factor in any given individual. If the doctor suspects that an aeroallergen is contributing to a patient's symptoms, the doctor may recommend ways to reduce exposure to the offending agents. For example, the presence of the house dust ""'mite'' can be limited by encasing mattresses and pillows in special dust-proof covers, frequently washing bedding in hot water, and removing carpeting. However, there is no way to completely rid the environment of aeroallergens.' Common aeroallergens are dust mites, pollens, molds, and dander from animal hair or skin. These aeroallergens, particularly the house dust mite, may worsen the symptoms of atopic dermatitis in some people. Although some researchers think that aeroallergens are an important contributing factor to atopic dermatitis, others believe that they are insignificant."
What are home remedies for atopic dermatitis?,"""Treatment involves a partnership between the doctor and the patient and family members. The doctor will suggest a treatment plan based on the patient's age, symptoms, and general health. The patient and family members play a large role in the success of the treatment plan by carefully following the doctor's instructions. Some of the primary components of treatment programs are described below. Most patients can be successfully managed with proper ""'skin care'' and lifestyle changes and do not require the more intensive treatments discussed.''Skin care'': A simple and basic regimen is key. Staying with one recommended soap and one moisturizer is very important. Using multiple soaps, lotions, fragrances, and mixes of products may cause further issues and skin sensitivity.'""Healing the skin and keeping it healthy are of primary importance both in preventing further damage and enhancing the patient's quality of life. Developing and following a daily skin care routine is critical to preventing recurrent episodes of symptoms. The key factor is proper bathing and the application of an emollient to the wet skin without towel drying. Generally, an effective emollient is a reasonably stiff ointment or cream (one that does not move out of an opened inverted jar). People with atopic dermatitis should avoid hot baths and showers. A lukewarm bleach bath with a capful of chlorine bleach (Clorox) helps to cleanse and disinfect the skin. The doctor may recommend limited use of a mild bar soap or non-soap cleanser because soaps can be drying to the skin. Oatmeal baths are often helpful. Red, irritated areas can be treated with 1% hydrocortisone cream (two to three times a day), which can be obtained at most pharmacies and does not require a physician's prescription.""""Once the bathing is finished, apply an emollient immediately without towel drying. This restores the skin's moisture and inhibits the evaporation of water, increasing the rate of healing, and establishing a barrier against further drying and irritation. Lotions generally are discouraged because they have a high water or ""'alcohol'' content and evaporate quickly. Creams and ointments work better at healing the skin. Tar preparations can be very helpful in healing very dry, lichenified areas. Whatever preparation is chosen, it should be as free of fragrances and chemicals as possible.''Another key to protecting and restoring the skin is taking steps to avoid repeated skin infections. Although it may not be possible to avoid infections altogether, the effects of an infection may be minimized if they are identified and treated early. Patients and their families should learn to recognize the signs of skin infections, including tiny pustules (pus-filled bumps) on the arms and legs, appearance of oozing areas, or crusty yellow blisters. If symptoms of a skin infection develop, the doctor should be consulted to begin treatment as soon as possible.'   Give lukewarm baths. Apply an emollient immediately following the bath. Keep a child's fingernails filed short. Select soft cotton fabrics when choosing clothing. Consider using antihistamines to reduce scratching at night. Keep the child cool; consider a humidifier. Learn to recognize skin infections and seek treatment promptly. Attempt to distract the child with activities to keep him or her from scratching."
What is the treatment for atopic dermatitis?,"'If the disease does not respond to mild local ''over-the-counter'' treatment then a physician is required. With proper treatment, most symptoms can be brought under control within three weeks.''Additional available treatments may help to reduce specific symptoms of the disease.''Phototherapy is treatment with light that uses ultraviolet A or B light waves or a combination of both. This treatment can be an effective treatment for mild to moderate dermatitis in older children (over 12 years old) and adults. Photochemotherapy, a combination of ultraviolet light therapy and a drug called psoralen, can also be used in cases that are resistant to phototherapy alone. Possible long-term side effects of this treatment include premature skin ''aging'' and ''skin cancer''. If the doctor thinks that phototherapy may be useful in treating the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, he or she will use the minimum exposure necessary and monitor the skin carefully.''When other treatments are not effective, the doctor may prescribe systemic ''corticosteroids'', drugs that are taken by mouth or injected into muscle instead of being applied directly to the skin. An example of a commonly prescribed corticosteroid is ''prednisone''. Typically, these medications are used only in resistant cases and are only given for short periods of time. The side effects of systemic corticosteroids can include skin damage, thinned or weakened bones, ''high blood pressure'', ''high blood sugar'', infections, and ''cataracts''. It can be dangerous to suddenly stop taking corticosteroids, so it is very important that the doctor and patient work together in changing the corticosteroid dose.''In adults, immunosuppressive drugs, such as ''cyclosporine'', are also used to treat severe cases of atopic dermatitis that have failed to respond to any other forms of therapy. Immunosuppressive drugs restrain the overactive immune system by blocking the production of some immune cells and curbing the action of others.'""In extremely rare cases, when no other treatments have been successful, the patient may have to be hospitalized. A five- to seven-day hospital stay allows intensive skin care treatment and reduces the patient's exposure to irritants, allergens, and the stresses of day-to-day life. Under these conditions, the symptoms usually clear quickly if environmental factors play a role or if the patient is not able to carry out an adequate skin care program at home.""'Despite the symptoms caused by atopic dermatitis, it is possible for people with the disorder to maintain a high quality of life. The keys to an improved quality of life are education, awareness, and developing a partnership among the patient, family, and doctor. Good communication is essential for all involved. It is important that the doctor provides understandable information about the disease and its symptoms to the patient and family and demonstrate any treatment measures recommended to ensure that they will be properly carried out.''When a child has atopic dermatitis, the entire family situation may be affected. It is important that families have additional support to help them cope with the ''stress'' and frustration associated with the disease. The child may be fussy and difficult and often is unable to keep from scratching and rubbing the skin. Distracting the child and providing as many activities that keep the hands busy are key but require effort and work on the part of the parents or caregivers. Another issue a family may face is the social and emotional stress associated with disfigurement caused by atopic dermatitis. The child may face difficulty in school or other social relationships and may need additional support and encouragement from family members.' Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments are the most frequently used treatment. Since many of these are quite potent it will be necessary to have frequent physician visits to assure that the treatment is successful. Tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) are non-steroid topical ointments that contain molecules that inhibit a substance called calcineurin which is important in inflammation. They rather expensive topical medicated creams that are used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. They are particularly effective in when used on the faces of children since they seem less likely to produce atrophy. These new drugs are referred to as ""immune modulators."" Crisaborole (Eucrisa), a recently approved topical treatment for children and adults with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) which seems to work by inhibiting a different portion of the inflammatory cascade in skin. Dupilumab (Duxipent) was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults. It is an anti-IL-4 antibody that is given by injection twice a month and shows great promise in the control of severe atopic dermatitis. A newer class of OTC (over the counter) creams have been recently developed which claim to repair and improve the skin's barrier function in both children and adults. They include Atopiclair, MimyX, and CeraVe. These creams may be used in combination with topical steroids and other emollients to help repair the overall dryness and broken skin function. Oral antibiotics to treat staphylococcal skin infections can be helpful in the face of pyoderma. Certain antihistamines that cause drowsiness can reduce nighttime scratching and allow more restful sleep when taken at bedtime. This effect can be particularly helpful for patients whose nighttime scratching aggravates the disease. If viral or fungal infections are present, the doctor may also prescribe medications to treat those infections. The side effects of cyclosporine can include high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, kidney problems, headaches, tingling or numbness, and a possible increased risk of cancer and infections. There is also a risk of relapse after the drug is discontinued. Because of their toxic side effects, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are used only in severe cases and then for as short a period of time as possible. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs should be referred to a dermatologist or an allergist specializing in the care of atopic dermatitis to help identify trigger factors and alternative therapies."
What is the prognosis of atopic dermatitis? Is there a cure?," Although symptoms of atopic dermatitis can be very difficult and uncomfortable, the disease can be successfully managed. People with atopic dermatitis, as well as their families, can lead healthy, normal lives. Long-term management may include treatment with an allergist to control inhalant allergies and a dermatologist to monitor the skin care component."
What is eczema?,"'Eczema'' is an inflammatory condition of the skin where patches of skin become rough and inflamed, often producing tiny fluid-filled ''bumps'' that can leak clear fluid. ''Eczema'' can occur at any age and is often chronic. The condition has a tendency to periodically worsen and then subside. ''Eczema'' is a general term that includes many different types of skin problems. ''Eczema'' is also referred to as ''atopic dermatitis''.'  "
Is eczema contagious?,"'The most common form of eczema (''dermatitis'') is ''atopic dermatitis'' and is not ''contagious''. However, if the raw, irritated skin of eczema becomes infected, the infecting agent may be contagious. The exact cause of ''atopic dermatitis'"" is not known, but because it often occurs in family members, it is felt that a person's ""'inherited'' genes may play a role in its development.' "
When does eczema appear? How will I know if I have eczema?,"'Some forms of ''atopic dermatitis'' start early in life (before 2 years of age) while others begin after 20 years of age. Rough, inflamed patches of skin may suggest eczema, particularly if the skin lesions intensify and then subside. The following criteria help physicians diagnose the disease:'""No specific test or blood markers exist for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis so the diagnosis is made by skin's appearance."" Itchiness Skin changes that very with age Chronic and relapsing skin changes Xerosis (dry skin) Elevated immunoglobulin E activity History of asthma or hay fever History of close relatives with eczema Symptom onset younger than 2 years of age"
How does eczema spread?,"'Eczema does not spread from person to person. However, it can spread to various parts of the body (for example, the face, cheeks, and chin [of infants] and the neck, wrist, knees, and elbows [of adults]). Scratching the skin can make eczema worse.' "
Is there a cure for eczema?,"'Unfortunately, there is no known cure for atopic dermatitis. Topical steroids along with skin moisturization currently are the major treatments for eczema. Severe eczema treatment usually includes several ''drugs'' and is carefully monitored by a dermatologist.' "
When should someone seek medical care for eczema?,"'Eczema is usually not considered a medical emergency. People with eczema should contact a doctor if ''itching'' is interfering with daily activities and/or ''sleep'', the crusting and oozing is increasing, the ''rash'' is becoming more widespread on the body, and/or painful cracks develop in the skin of the extremities. If areas of eczema produce pus and/or ''red streaks are extending from the eczema skin lesions'', and/or there is ''fever'', medical care should be sought immediately as a secondary infection may be present.' "
What is eczema?,"'Rather than a specific health condition, eczema is a reaction pattern that the skin produces in a number of diseases. It begins as red, raised tiny blisters containing a clear fluid atop red, elevated plaques. When the blisters break, the affected skin will weep and ooze. In older eczema, chronic eczema, the blisters are less prominent and the skin is thickened, elevated, and scaling. Eczema almost always is very ''itchy''.'  "
11 different types of eczema: What causes and risk factors of eczema?,"'There are at least 11 distinct types of ''skin conditions'' that produce eczema. In order to develop a rational treatment plan, it is important to distinguish them. This is often not easy.'   Atopic dermatitis: This health condition has a genetic basis and produces a common type of eczema. Atopic dermatitis tends to begin early in life in those with a predisposition to inhalant allergies, but it probably does not have an allergic basis. Characteristically, rashes occur on the cheeks, neck, elbow and knee creases, and ankles. Irritant dermatitis: This occurs when the skin is repeatedly exposed to excessive washing or toxic substances. Allergic contact dermatitis: After repeated exposures to the same substance, an allergen, the body's immune recognition system becomes activated at the site of the next exposure and produces dermatitis. An example of this would be poison ivy allergy. Stasis dermatitis: It commonly occurs on the swollen lower legs of people who have poor circulation in the veins of the legs. Fungal infections: This can produce a pattern identical to many other types of eczema, but the fungus can be visualized with a scraping under the microscope or grown in culture. Scabies: It's caused by an infestation by the human itch mite and may produce a rash very similar to other forms of eczema. Pompholyx (dyshidrotic eczema): This is a common but poorly understood health condition which classically affects the hands and occasionally the feet by producing an itchy rash composed of tiny blisters (vesicles) on the sides of the fingers or toes and palms or soles. Lichen simplex chronicus: It produces thickened plaques of skin commonly found on the shins and neck. Nummular eczema: This is a nonspecific term for coin-shaped plaques of scaling skin most often on the lower legs of older individuals. Xerotic (dry skin) eczema: The skin will crack and ooze if dryness becomes excessive. Seborrheic dermatitis: It produces a rash on the scalp, face, ears, and occasionally the mid-chest in adults. In infants, in can produce a weepy, oozy rash behind the ears and can be quite extensive, involving the entire body."
What are eczema symptoms and signs?,"'Almost all patients with eczema complain of ''itching''. Since the appearance of most types of eczema is similar, elevated plaques of red, bumpy skin, the distribution of the eruption can be of great help in distinguishing one type from another. For example, stasis dermatitis occurs most often on the lower leg while ''atopic dermatitis'' occurs in the front of the elbow and behind the knee.'  "
What specialists treat eczema?,"'Eczema often is treated by family physicians, but since there are many causes of eczema, it may be necessary to seek help from a health specialist if things are not improving. Most dermatologists specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of all forms of eczema.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose eczema?,"'An accurate diagnosis requires an examination of the entire skin surface and a careful health history. It is important for a doctor to rule out curable conditions caused by infectious organisms. Occasionally, a sample of skin (biopsy) may be sent for examination in a laboratory.' "
What is the treatment for eczema?,"'The treatment of acute eczema where there is significant weeping and oozing requires repeated cycles of application of dilute solutions of vinegar or tap water often in the form of a compress followed by evaporation. This is most often conveniently performed by placing the affected body part in front of a fan after the compress. Once the acute weeping has diminished, then topical steroid (such as triamcinolone cream) applications can be an effective treatment. In extensive disease, systemic steroids may need to be utilized either orally or by an injection (shot).'

What are home remedies for eczema?,'Mild eczema may respond to compresses composed of tepid water followed by room air evaporation. Chronic eczema can be improved by applying water followed by an emollient (moisturizing cream or lotion). Mild eczema can be effectively treated with nonprescription 1% hydrocortisone cream.'  
Does diet affect eczema?,"'The role of ''diet'' in atopic dermatitis is controversial. There is little compelling evidence that ''diet'' plays a significant role for majority of people who have eczema, no matter which type they have.' "
Is there a cure for eczema?,'Each type of eczema requires a specific sort of therapy. The easiest eczemas to cure permanently are those caused by fungi and ''scabies''. ''Allergic contact eczema'' can be cured if a specific allergenic substance can be identified and avoided.' 
Is eczema contagious?,'Eczema caused by fungi and ''scabies'' is transmissible to others. None of the other types of eczema are ''contagious''.' 
What is the prognosis of eczema?,"'Most of the patients with eczema do quite well under the care of a dermatologist who has made an accurate diagnosis. Occasionally, eczema can become infected by microorganisms, such a staphylococci or ''herpes'' simplex virus. This is because the normal barrier function of the skin has been damaged by the inflammatory condition. In this situation, the infection could be contagious and require antibiotics treatment. An important signal would be the development of ''fever'' and pustules, plus ''pain'' at the site of the rash.' "
Is it possible to prevent eczema?,'The judicious use of moisturizing creams or ointments can be an effective treatment for many people in preventing certain types of eczema. ' 
What is erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"'Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as ''impotence'"", is the inability to achieve or sustain a hard enough erection for satisfactory completion of sexual activity. Erectile dysfunction is different from other health conditions that interfere with male sexual function, such as lack of sexual desire (decreased libido) and problems with ejaculation release of the fluid from the penis (ejaculatory dysfunction) and orgasm/climax (orgasmic dysfunction), and penile curvature (Peyronie's disease), although these problems may also be present. ED affects about 50% of men age 40 and over. This article focuses on the evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction."" "
What is normal penis anatomy?,"'The penis contains three cylinders, the two ''corpora cavernosa'', which are on the top of the penis (see figure 1 below). These two cylinders are involved in erections. The third cylinder contains the urethra, the tube that the urine and ejaculate passes through, runs along the underside of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra. Spongy tissue that has muscles, fibrous tissues, veins, and arteries within it makes up the corpora cavernosa. The inside of the corpora cavernosa is like a sponge, with potential spaces that can fill with blood and distend (known as sinusoids). A layer of tissue that is like Saran Wrap, called the tunica albuginea, surrounds the corpora. Veins located just under the tunica albuginea drain blood out of the penis.' "
How common is erectile dysfunction?,"'Erectile dysfunction (ED, impotence) varies in severity; some cannot have an erection at all, whereas other men sometimes have troubles getting a hard erection, and others get a hard erection but it only lasts for a short period of time. Approximately 50% of men over the age of 40 have troubles with erectile dysfunction.''While erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, the risk of developing erectile dysfunction increases with age. According to the Massachusetts Male ''Aging'' Study, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 52% in men 40-70 years of age. The prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction increases from 5% at 40 years of age to 15% among men 70 years of age and older.'  "
How does erection occur?,"'Erections are neurovascular events, meaning that nerves and blood vessels (arteries and veins) are involved in the process of an erection and all must work properly to develop a hard erection that lasts long enough. Erection begins with sexual stimulation. Sexual stimulation can be tactile (for example, by a partner touching the penis or by ''masturbation'') or mental (for example, by having sexual fantasies, viewing porn). Sexual stimulation or sexual arousal causes the nerves going to the penis to release a chemical, nitric oxide. Nitric oxide increases the production of another chemical, cyclic GMP (cGMP), in the muscle of the corpora cavernosa. The cGMP causes the muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, and this allows more blood to flow into the penis. The incoming blood fills the corpora cavernosa, making the penis expand.' "
How does a man sustain an erection?,"'As blood flows into the penis, the corpora cavernosa swell, and this swelling compresses the veins (blood vessels that drain the blood out of the penis) against the tunica albuginea. Compression of the veins prevents blood from leaving the penis. This creates a hard erection. When the amount of cGMP decreases by the action of a chemical called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the muscles in the penis tighten, and the blood flow into the penis decreases. With less blood coming into the penis, the veins are not compressed, allowing blood to drain out of the penis, and the erection goes down.' "
What causes erectile dysfunction?,"'The ability to achieve and sustain erections requires the following:'""Erectile dysfunction can occur if a man doesn't meet one or more of these requirements. The following are 13 common causes of erectile dysfunction, and many men have more than one potential cause:""

   A healthy nervous system that conducts nerve impulses in the brain, spinal column, and penis Healthy arteries in and near the corpora cavernosa that when stimulated can bring increased blood flow into the penis Healthy muscles and fibrous tissues within the corpora cavernosa, which can distend to allow the penis to fill with blood Adequate levels of nitric oxide in the penis Normal-functioning tunica albuginea that allows for compression of the veins Appropriate psychosocial interactions Aging: There are two reasons why older men are more likely to experience erectile dysfunction than younger men. First, older men are more likely to develop diseases (such as heart attacks, angina, cardiovascular disease, strokes, diabetes mellitus, and high blood pressure) that are associated with erectile dysfunction. Second, the aging process alone can cause erectile dysfunction in some men by causing changes in the muscle and tissue within the penis. Diabetes mellitus: Erectile dysfunction tends to develop 10 to 15 years earlier in diabetic men than among nondiabetic men. The increased risk of erectile dysfunction among men with diabetes mellitus may be due to the earlier onset and greater severity of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that narrows the arteries and thereby reduces the delivery of blood to the penis. Atherosclerosis can affect the arteries in the penis, as well as the arteries in the pelvis that supply the penile arteries. Diabetes mellitus also causes erectile dysfunction by damaging nerves that go to the penis, much like the effect of diabetes on nerves in other areas of the body (diabetic neuropathy). Diabetes can also affect the muscles in the penis, leading to troubles with erections. Smoking cigarettes, obesity, poor control of blood glucose levels, and having diabetes mellitus for a long time further increase the risk of erectile dysfunction in people with diabetes. Hypertension (high blood pressure): Men with high blood pressure have an increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction. Hypertension can cause trouble with erections related to atherosclerosis or from low levels of nitric oxide production from the arteries in the penis. Medications to treat hypertension may cause erectile dysfunction. Cardiovascular diseases: The most common cause of cardiovascular diseases in the United States is atherosclerosis, the narrowing, and hardening of arteries that reduces blood flow. Atherosclerosis (a type of vascular disease) typically affects arteries throughout the body; hypertension, high blood cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus aggravate atherosclerosis. Hardening of the arteries to the penis and pelvic organs, atherosclerosis, causes insufficient blood flow into the penis. There is a close correlation between the severity of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries and erectile dysfunction. For example, men with more severe coronary artery atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries in the heart) also tend to have more erectile dysfunction than men with mild or no coronary artery atherosclerosis. Some doctors suggest that men with new onset erectile dysfunction undergo evaluation for silent coronary artery diseases (advanced coronary artery atherosclerosis that has not yet caused angina or heart attacks). Metabolic syndrome is associated with multiple risk factors for erectile dysfunction including diabetes, abnormal lipid profile, hypertension, and obesity. Cigarette smoking: Cigarette smoking aggravates atherosclerosis and can cause vasospasm (spasms of the arteries) and thereby increases the risk for erectile dysfunction. Nerve or spinal cord damage: Damage to the spinal cord and nerves in the pelvis can cause erectile dysfunction. Nerve damage can be due to disease, trauma, or surgical procedures. Examples include injury to the spinal cord from automobile accidents, injury to the pelvic nerves from prostate surgery for cancer (prostatectomy), and some surgeries for colorectal cancer, radiation to the prostate, surgery for benign prostatic enlargement, multiple sclerosis (a neurological disease with the potential to cause widespread damage to nerves), and long-term diabetes mellitus. BPH: Benign enlargement of the prostate is associated with erectile dysfunction. Trauma: Trauma to the pelvis, including pelvic fracture, may cause erectile dysfunction, and an untreated penile fracture may result in erectile dysfunction. Substance abuse: Marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines, crystal meth, and narcotic and alcohol abuse contribute to erectile dysfunction. Alcoholism, in addition to causing nerve damage, can lead to atrophy (shrinking) of the testicles and lower testosterone levels. Low testosterone levels: Testosterone (the primary sex hormone in men) is not only necessary for sex drive (libido) but also is necessary to maintain nitric oxide levels in the penis. Therefore, men with hypogonadism (low testosterone with symptoms) can have a low sex drive and erectile dysfunction. Medications: Many common medicines produce erectile dysfunction as a side effect. Medicines that can cause erectile dysfunction include many used to treat high blood pressure, antihistamines, antidepressants, tranquilizers, and appetite suppressants. Examples of common medicines that can cause erectile dysfunction include propranolol (Inderal) or other beta-blockers, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin (Lanoxin), amitriptyline (Elavil), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), metoclopramide (Reglan), naproxen, indomethacin (Indocin), lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Isoptin), phenytoin (Dilantin), gemfibrozil (Lopid), amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall), and phentermine. Prostate cancer medications that lower testosterone levels such as leuprolide (Lupron) may affect erectile function. Some chemotherapies such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may affect erectile function. Recreational drugs: Recreational drugs, including alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, nicotine, heroin, and cocaine, are associated with erectile dysfunction. Depression and anxiety: Psychological factors may be responsible for erectile dysfunction. These factors include stress, anxiety, guilt, depression, widower syndrome, low self-esteem, posttraumatic stress disorder, and fear of sexual failure (performance anxiety). It is also worth noting that many medications used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders may cause erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory problems."
What are erectile dysfunction risk factors?,"'The common risk factors for ED include the following:'   Advanced age Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Diabetes mellitus High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Recreational drug use Depression or other psychiatric disorders Pelvic surgery, including radical prostatectomy and colorectal surgery Pelvic radiation, such as for prostate cancer and some colorectal cancers Trauma to the pelvis (pelvic fracture), penis (penile fracture), and perineum"
What are erectile dysfunction symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of erectile dysfunction may include the following:' Penile erection occurs, but the penis does not remain hard enough for completion of sex. Penile erections are not hard enough for penetration. There is an inability to obtain a penile erection. One can still achieve an orgasm and ejaculate with erectile dysfunction."
How do health care professionals diagnose erectile dysfunction?,"'Physicians make a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction in men who complain of troubles having a hard enough erection or a hard erection that does not last long enough. It is important as you talk with your doctor that you be candid in terms of when your troubles started, how bothersome your erectile dysfunction is, how severe it is, and discuss all your medical conditions along with all prescribed and nonprescribed medications that you are taking. Your doctor will ask several questions to determine if your symptoms are suggestive of erectile dysfunction and to assess its severity and possible causes. Your doctor will try to get information to answer the following questions:''The physical examination can reveal clues for physical causes of erectile dysfunction. A doctor will perform an assessment of ''BMI'' and waist circumference to evaluate for abdominal obesity. A genital examination is part of the evaluation of erectile dysfunction. The examination will focus on the penis and testes. The doctor will ask you about penile curvature and will examine the penis to see if there are any plaques (hard areas) palpable. The doctor will examine the testes to make sure they are in the proper location in the scrotum and are normal in size. Small testicles, lack of facial hair, and enlarged breasts (''gynecomastia'') can point to hormonal problems such as hypogonadism with low testosterone levels. A health care provider may check pulses in your groin and ''feet'' to determine if there is a suggestion of hardening of the arteries that could also affect the arteries to the penis.'""The lab testing obtained for the evaluation of erectile dysfunction may vary with the information obtained on the health history, physical examination, and recent lab testing. A testosterone level is not necessary in all men; however, a physician will order labs to determine a patient's testosterone level if other signs and symptoms of hypogonadism (low testosterone) such as decreased libido, loss of body hair, muscle loss, breast enlargement, ""'osteoporosis'', ''infertility'', and decreased penile/testicular size are present.''A doctor may ask for the following laboratory tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction:''Health care professionals do not routinely obtain imaging tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction.''Ultrasound'' with Doppler imaging (ultrasound plus evaluation of blood flow in the arteries and veins) can provide additional information about blood flow of the penis and may help in the evaluation of patients prior to surgical intervention. This study is typically performed after the injection of a chemical that causes the arteries to open up, a vasodilator (prostaglandin E1), into the corpora cavernosa in order to cause dilation of blood vessels and promote blood flow into the penis. The rate of blood flow into the penis can be measured along with an evaluation of problems with compression of the veins.''Rarely, a doctor may perform an ''angiogram'' (injecting a dye into the arteries that supply the penis and taking ''X-rays'' to look for areas of narrowing of the arteries) in cases in which possible vascular surgery could be beneficial.''Monitoring erections that occur during sleep (''nocturnal'' penile tumescence) can help you and your doctor to understand if the erectile dysfunction is due to psychological or physical causes. The nocturnal penile tumescence test is a study to evaluate erections at night. Normally men have three to five erections per eight hours of sleep. The test can be performed at home or in a sleep lab. The most accurate way to perform the test involves a special device that is connected to two rings. The rings are placed around the penis, one at the tip of the penis and the other at the bottom (base) of the penis. The device records how many erections occur, how long they last, and how rigid they are. The test is limited in that it does not assess the ability to penetrate.''If there seems to be a psychological cause contributing to your erectile dysfunction, the doctor may ask the patient questions to help determine stressor, events, and relationship issues that may be causing your erectile troubles. It may be helpful to have your sexual partner involved in this assessment.' Is the patient suffering from erectile dysfunction or from some other form of sexual dysfunction such as loss of libido or a disorder of ejaculation (for example, premature ejaculation) or orgasm, or problems with penile curvature/pain (Peyronie's disease)? Is your erectile dysfunction due to psychological (stress, relationship problems, etc.) or physical factors? Your doctor may ask if you note erections at night or in the early morning. Men have involuntary erections in the early morning and during REM sleep (a stage in the sleep cycle with rapid eye movements). Men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction (erectile dysfunction due to psychological factors such as stress and anxiety rather than physical factors) usually maintain these involuntary erections. Men with physical causes of erectile dysfunction (for example, atherosclerosis, smoking, and diabetes) usually do not have these involuntary erections. Men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction may relate the onset of problems to a ""stressor,"" such as failed relationship. Your doctor may suggest a test to determine if you have erections during sleep, which may suggest that there may be a psychological cause of the erectile dysfunction. 3. Are there physical causes of erectile dysfunction? Erectile dysfunction may be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, which if not detected may cause further medical problems. A prior history of cigarette smoking, heart attacks, strokes, and poor circulation in the extremities (for example, intermittent claudication or cramping in your leg[s] when you walk) suggest atherosclerosis as the cause of the erectile dysfunction. Loss of sexual desire and drive, lack of sexual fantasies, gynecomastia (enlargement of breasts), and diminished facial hair suggest low testosterone levels. A prior history of pelvic surgery or radiation and trauma to the penis/pelvis/perineum can cause problems with the nerves and blood vessels. Symptoms of intermittent claudication of the lower extremities with exercise may suggest a vascular problem as a cause of the erectile dysfunction. Is the patient taking medications that can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see causes above), including prescribed, over-the-counter, or recreational drugs? It is important to discuss your prescribed medications, as well as over-the-counter medications and drugs of abuse such as opiates, alcohol, etc. Complete blood counts Urinalysis: A high level of sugar (glucose) in the urine may be a sign of diabetes mellitus, and high protein in the urine may suggest kidney damage, which can cause erectile troubles. Lipid profile: High levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood can cause atherosclerosis. Blood glucose levels: Abnormally high blood glucose (sugar) levels may be a sign of diabetes mellitus. Blood hemoglobin A1C: Abnormally high levels of blood hemoglobin A1C in patients with diabetes mellitus indicate that there is poor control of blood glucose levels. Serum creatinine: An abnormal serum creatinine, a chemical that reflects kidney function, may be the result of kidney damage. Liver enzymes and liver function tests: Liver disease (cirrhosis) can cause low testosterone. Thus, a physician may need to test some men for liver disease. Total testosterone levels: Health care professionals should obtain a patient's blood samples for total testosterone levels in the early morning (before 8 a.m.) because the testosterone levels go up and down throughout the day. If you have a low testosterone level, a health care professional should check it again to confirm that it is truly low. In some men, a specialized test measuring the active form of testosterone (free or bioavailable testosterone) may be recommended. Other hormone levels: Measurement of other hormones beside testosterone (luteinizing hormone [LH], prolactin level, and cortisol level) may provide clues to other underlying causes of testosterone deficiency and erectile problems, such as pituitary disease or adrenal gland abnormalities. Doctors may check thyroid levels in some individuals as both hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid function) can contribute to erectile dysfunction. PSA levels: PSA (prostate specific antigen) blood levels and prostate examination to exclude prostate cancer is important before starting testosterone treatment since testosterone can aggravate prostate cancer. Other blood tests: Evaluation for hemochromatosis, lupus, scleroderma, zinc deficiency, sickle cell anemia, and cancers (leukemia, colon cancer) are some of the other potential tests that a physician may perform based on each individual's health history and symptoms."
What drugs treat erectile dysfunction?,"'A number of medical treatment options exist for erectile dysfunction include the following:''A doctor can help decide what medication(s) may be the best for the patient. This is an important step to do so the doctor can help choose the best and safest drug(s) and other treatments so that men with other medical problems can get individualized care appropriate for their medical conditions.' Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil [Viagra], vardenafil [Levitra and the generic formulation Staxyn], tadalafil [Cialis]), and avanafil [Stendra]) Intracavernosal injections (papaverine, phentolamine, and PGE1 [Trimix], Bimix, and alprostadil injection [Caverject, Edex]) Intraurethral suppositories (MUSE) Testosterone in individuals with ED and other signs/symptoms of hypogonadism and an unequivocally low serum testosterone"
What is the treatment for erectile dysfunction?,"'The following are treatment options for erectile dysfunction:''Many common medications for treating hypertension, depression, and high blood ''lipids'' (''high cholesterol'') can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see above). Treatment of hypertension is an example. There are many different types (classes) of ''medications for high blood pressure''; these include beta-blockers, ''calcium channel blockers'', diuretics (medications that increase urine volume), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (''ACE inhibitors''), and angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs''). Patients may use these medications alone or in combination to control blood pressure. Some of these medications can cause troubles with erections. For example, Inderal (a ''beta-blocker'') and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) cause erectile dysfunction, while calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors do not seem to affect erectile function. On the other hand, other medications (such as angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB] including ''losartan'' [''Cozaar''] and ''valsartan'' [''Diovan'']) may actually help with erections. Therefore, if possible, you may benefit from changing your medications, but this requires approval by your prescribing health care provider.''Quitting smoking, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, curtailing excessive alcohol consumption, controlling hypertension, and optimizing blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes are not only important for maintaining good health but also may improve or even prevent progression of erectile dysfunction. It is unclear if such lifestyle changes can reverse erectile dysfunction. However, lifestyle improvements may prevent progression of the erectile dysfunction. Some studies suggest that men who have made lifestyle improvements experience increased rates of success with oral medications.'

What are erectile dysfunction treatments for men with cardiovascular disease?,"'ED is often the result of atherosclerosis, and as a result, men with ED frequently have cardiovascular disease. Sexual activity is associated with increased physical exertion, which in some men may increase the risk of having a ''heart attack'' (''myocardial infarction'' or MI). The major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease are age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, abnormal lipid/cholesterol levels in the blood, and lack of ''exercise''. Individuals with three or more of these risk factors are at increased risk for a heart attack during sexual activity. The Princeton Consensus Panel developed guidelines for treating ED in men with cardiovascular disease. Thus, if you have ED and cardiovascular disease (for example, angina or prior heart attack), you should discuss whether or not treatment of ED and sexual activity are appropriate for you.' "
Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors,"'The common PDE5 inhibitor drugs approved in the United States are sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra and Staxyn, the generic form), tadalafil (Cialis), or avanafil (Stendra). All of the currently approved PDE5 inhibitors work in the same way. They differ in the number of available doses, how quickly they work and last in your system, the dosing, and to some extent in the side effects. However, they generally share the same indications and contraindications. Currently, tadalafil is the only medication that patients can take on a daily basis and is approved for the treatment of both ED and ''BPH'' (benign enlargement of the prostate).''When sexually stimulated there is a release of a chemical, nitric oxide (NO) in the blood vessels of the corpus cavernosum. The NO stimulates the production of a compound called cGMP, which causes relaxation of the smooth muscle in the blood vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum. PDE 5 is an enzyme that breaks down cGMP. By inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP by PDE5, these medications allow cGMP to build up in the penis. cGMP causes muscles in the corpora cavernosa of the penis to relax. When the muscle is relaxed, more blood can flow into the penis and fill the spaces in the penis. As the penis fills with blood, the veins in the penis are compressed, and this results a hard erection. When the effect on PDE5 decreases, the cGMP levels go down and the muscle in the penis contracts, causing less blood to flow into the penis and allowing the veins to open up and drain blood out of the penis.''Some men should not take PDE5 inhibitors. They can cause ''hypotension'' (abnormally ''low blood pressure'' that can lead to ''fainting'' and even ''shock'') when given to patients who are taking ''nitrates'' (medications taken for ''heart disease''). Therefore, patients taking nitrates daily should not take any of the PDE5 inhibitors. Nitrates relieve angina (''chest pain'' due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle because of narrowing of the coronary arteries); these include nitroglycerine tablets, patches, ointments, sprays, and pastes, as well as ''isosorbide dinitrate'' and ''isosorbide mononitrate''. Other nitrates such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate also are in some recreational drugs called ""poppers.""''If you are taking medications (alpha-blockers) for problems with an ''enlarged prostate'', you should discuss your prostate medications with your doctor. Alpha-blockers also can cause lowering of the blood pressure. Thus your doctor will need to carefully watch your blood pressure when you start the PDE5 inhibitor. Common alpha-blockers include doxazosin (''Cardura''), ''terazosin'' (''Hytrin''), and ''tamsulosin'' (''Flomax'').''PDE 5 inhibitors are broken down primarily by enzyme, cytochrome P450enzyme CYP3A4. Medications that decrease or increase the activity of CYP3A4 may affect levels and effectiveness of PDE 5 inhibitors. Such drugs include medications for the treatment of ''HIV'' (''protease inhibitors'') and the antifungal medications ''ketoconazole'' and ''itraconazole''. Thus caution is recommended.''The various PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of ED share several common side effects, including ''headache'', flushing, ''nasal congestion'', ''nausea'', ''dyspepsia'' (stomach discomfort), and ''diarrhea''. Differences exist in side effects of the different PDE5 inhibitors, and thus it is important to be familiar with the prescribing information of the PDE5 inhibitor you are prescribed.''There have been rare reports of ''priapism'' (prolonged and painful erections lasting more than six hours) with the use of PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Patients with blood cell diseases such as ''sickle cell anemia'', ''leukemia'', and ''multiple myeloma'' have higher than normal risks of developing ''priapism''. Untreated priapism can cause injury to the penis and lead to permanent impotence. Therefore, if your erection lasts four hours, you should seek emergency medical care.''Rare side effects of all PDE5 inhibitors include a sudden ''loss of vision'' in one or both eyes (nonarteritic anterior ischemic ''optic neuropathy'' [NAION]) and sudden loss of ''hearing''. Patients have reported these rare side effects with all of the PDE5 inhibitors. Seek immediate medical care if you develop loss of vision or hearing.''Doctors have not tested the PDE5 inhibitors in patients with ''retinitis pigmentosa'', an eye condition that affects the retina and can cause ''blindness'', and so caution is recommended if you have this health condition.' "
Sildenafil (Viagra),"'Sildenafil (Viagra) was the first oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor approved by the FDA in the United States for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (it is not approved for women). Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, which is an enzyme that destroys cGMP. By inhibiting the destruction of cGMP by PDE5, sildenafil allows cGMP to accumulate. The cGMP in turn prolongs relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. Relaxation of the corpora cavernosa smooth muscle allows blood to flow into the penis resulting in increased engorgement of the penis. In short, sildenafil increases blood flow into the penis and decreases blood flow out of the penis.''Sildenafil treats erectile dysfunction of either physical or psychological cause. It is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men with ''coronary artery disease'', diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting (''CABG''), and men who are taking antidepressants and several classes of antihypertensives.''In randomized placebo-controlled trials, an estimated 60% of men with diabetes, and 80% of men without diabetes experienced improved erections with sildenafil.'""Sildenafil is available as oral tablets at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. Patients should take sildenafil approximately one hour before sexual activity. In some men, the onset of action of the drug may be as early as 11-20 minutes. It's best for men to take sildenafil on an empty stomach for best results since absorption and effectiveness of sildenafil can be diminished if it is taken shortly after a meal, particularly a meal that is high in fat. Sildenafil and the other PDE5 inhibitors don't cause an immediate erection. Sexual stimulation is necessary for these medications to work.""'In prescribing sildenafil, a doctor considers the age, general health status, and other medication(s) the patient is taking. The usual starting dose for most men is 50 mg, however, the doctor may increase or decrease the dose depending on side effects and effectiveness. The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg every 24 hours. However, many men will need 100 mg of sildenafil for optimal effectiveness, and some doctors are recommending 100 mg as the starting dose.''Aging, ''liver'' and kidney problems, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as ''erythromycin'' [an antibiotic] and protease inhibitors for ''HIV'') slows the metabolism (breakdown) of sildenafil. Slowed breakdown allows sildenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially may increase the risk of side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age, in men with significant kidney and liver disease, and in men who also are taking medications called protease inhibitors, the doctor will initiate sildenafil at a lower dose (25 mg) to avoid accumulation of sildenafil in the body. A ''protease inhibitor'' ''ritonavir'' (''Norvir'') is especially potent in increasing the accumulation of sildenafil, thus men who are taking Norvir should not take sildenafil doses higher than 25 mg and at a frequency of no greater than once in 48 hours. Other medications that may affect the level of sildenafil include erythromycin and ketoconazole.''Sildenafil (Viagra) may affect another phosphodiesterase enzyme in the eye causing transient abnormal vision (seeing a bluish hue or brightness).' "
Vardenafil (Levitra and the generic formulation Staxyn),"'Vardenafil (Levitra) was the second oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) inhibits PDE5, which destroys cGMP (as discussed earlier). It is the only PDE 5 inhibitor that has a generic form available.''Vardenafil is effective in men of all ages, different nationalities, and in men with such medical conditions as diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate surgery.''The recommended starting dose of vardenafil is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher or lower depending on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg, and the maximum recommended dosing frequency is no more than once per day. Patients can take vardenafil with or without food. As with sildenafil, for vardenafil to be effective, sexual stimulation must occur.''Vardenafil shares the same side effects as sildenafil but is not associated with the abnormal vision that may occur with sildenafil.''The same concerns regarding the use of sildenafil with nitrates and alpha-blockers apply to vardenafil.''Men with a rare heart condition known as long QT syndrome should not take vardenafil since this may lead to ''abnormal heart rhythms'"". The QT interval is the time it takes for the heart's muscle to recover after it has contracted. An ""'electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') measures the QT interval. Some people have longer than normal QT intervals, and they may develop potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, especially when given certain medications. Men with a family history of long QT syndrome should not take vardenafil, as it is possible to inherit long QT syndrome. Furthermore, vardenafil is not recommended for men who are taking medications that can affect the QT interval such as ''quinidine'' (Quinaglute, Quinidex), ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl, Procan-SR, Procanbid), ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), and ''sotalol'' (''Betapace'').''There is insufficient information on the safety of vardenafil in men with the following health disorders:''Therefore, men with these health conditions should not use vardenafil without having these conditions evaluated and stabilized first. For example, men with uncontrolled high blood pressure should have their blood pressure controlled; and men with potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms should have these rhythms controlled.''When there is angina or heart failure, the doctor may need to determine whether the heart has enough reserve to carry out the work necessary for sexual activity by performing cardiac treadmill stress testing.''Metabolism (breakdown) of vardenafil can be slowed by aging, liver disease, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as erythromycin [an antibiotic], ketoconazole [''Nizoral'', a medication for fungal/yeast infections], and protease inhibitors [medications used to treat ''AIDS'']). Slowed breakdown allows vardenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially increase the risk for side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age with liver disease, or who are also taking medication(s) that can slow the breakdown of vardenafil, the doctor will initiate vardenafil at low doses to avoid its accumulation. For example,' Unstable angina (chest pain due to coronary artery disease that occurs at rest or with minimal physical exertion) Low blood pressure (a resting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (greater than 170/110 mm Hg) Recent stroke or heart attack (within six months) Uncontrolled, potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms Severe liver disease Severe kidney failure requiring dialysis Severe heart failure or disease of the heart's valves, for example, aortic stenosis (hardening of the main artery in the body) Retinitis pigmentosa (a condition that affects the retina of the eye and can cause blindness) men taking erythromycin or ketoconazole should not take more than 5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men taking high doses of ketoconazole (Nizoral) should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men with moderately severe liver disease also should not take more than a 5 mg dose of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men taking the protease inhibitor (for the treatment of HIV/AIDS) indinavir (Crixivan) should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; and men taking another protease inhibitor ritonavir (Norvir), erythromycin, or ketoconazole, should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil every 72 hours."
Tadalafil (Cialis),"'Tadalafil (Cialis) is the third oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra) and vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil inhibits PDE5 (as described earlier). Unlike the other PDE 5 inhibitors, patients should take tadalafil once daily and is approved for the treatment of BPH (benign enlargement of the prostate).''Tadalafil is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men of all ages and has been shown to be effective in men with diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer surgery. Studies demonstrated that tadalafil improved the ability to get a hard erection and to have the hard erection last long enough.''Patients may take tadalafil as needed as with sildenafil, vardenafil, and avanafil or once a day. It is the only ED oral medication that patients can take on a daily basis.''The recommended starting dose of tadalafil for use as needed for most patients is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher to 20 mg or lower to 5 mg depending on efficacy and side effects. Doctors recommended that patients take tadalafil no more frequently than once per day. Some patients can take tadalafil less frequently since the improvement in erectile function may last 36 hours. Patients may take tadalafil with or without food. Tadalafil is currently the only PDE5 inhibitor that is FDA-approved for daily use for erectile dysfunction and is available in 2.5 mg or 5 mg dosages for daily use.''Tadalafil shares the common side effects of the PDE5 inhibitors, however, due to its effect on PDE11, another phosphodiesterase located in muscle, tadalafil has been associated with muscle aches. ''Back pain'' and muscle aches occur in less than 7% of men taking tadalafil and in most patients will go away without treatment within 48 hours. When treatment was necessary, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') or naproxen (''Aleve'') were effective. Rarely do the muscle aches and ''back pain'' cause men to stop using tadalafil.''Men taking nitrates should not use tadalafil as with the other PDE5 inhibitors.''Tadalafil should not be used with alpha-blockers (except ''Flomax''), medicines used to treat high blood pressure, and benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) because the combination of tadalafil and an alpha-blocker may lower the blood pressure greatly and lead to ''dizziness'' and ''fainting''. Examples of alpha-blockers include ''tamsulosin'' (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), ''alfuzosin'' (''Uroxatral''), and ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''). Tamsulosin (Flomax) is the only alpha-blocker that patients can use safely with tadalafil. When tadalafil (20 mg) was given to healthy men taking 0.4 mg of Flomax daily, there was no significant decrease in blood pressure and so patients on this dose of tamsulosin (Flomax) can be prescribed tadalafil. The only alpha-blocker not tested with tadalafil is alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and no recommendations can be made regarding the interaction between the two.''As with vardenafil, doctors do not recommend tadalafil for men with the following conditions:''Therefore, men with these health conditions should not use tadalafil without having these conditions evaluated and stabilized first. For example, men with uncontrolled high blood pressure should have their blood pressure controlled; and men with potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms should have these rhythms controlled.''When there is angina or heart failure, the doctor may need to determine whether the heart has enough reserve to carry out the work necessary for sexual activity by performing cardiac treadmill stress testing.''In most healthy men, some of the drug will remain in the body for more than two days after a single dose of tadalafil. Metabolism (clearing of the drug from the body) of tadalafil can be slowed by liver disease, ''kidney disease'', and concurrent use of certain medications (such as erythromycin, ketoconazole, and protease inhibitors). Slowed breakdown allows tadalafil to stay in the body longer and potentially increase the risk for side effects. Therefore, doctors have to lower the dose and frequency of tadalafil in the following examples:' Unstable angina (chest pain due to coronary artery disease that occurs at rest or with minimal physical exertion) Low blood pressure (a resting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (greater than 170/110 mm Hg) Recent stroke or heart attack (within six months) Uncontrolled, potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms Severe liver disease Severe heart failure or disease of the heart valves (for example, aortic stenosis) Retinitis pigmentosa Medications such as erythromycin, ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), ritonavir (Norvir), and indinavir (Crixivan) can slow the breakdown of tadalafil. Therefore, men taking these medications should not take more than 10 mg of tadalafil and should not take tadalafil more frequently than every 72 hours. If you have kidney troubles, your doctor may recommend that you try a lower dose of tadalafil or change how often you use the tadalafil depending on your kidney function. Men with severe liver disease should not take tadalafil. Men with mild to moderate liver disease should not exceed tadalafil dose of 10 mg once daily."
Avanafil (Stendra),"'Avanafil is the most recently FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitor to treat erectile dysfunction.''Avanafil has been demonstrated to be effective in treating ED in men of various ages and has been shown to be effective in men with ED related to diabetes mellitus.''The recommended starting dose is 100 mg taken as early as 15 minutes prior to sexual activity, no more than once a day. The maximum dose is 200 mg. Avanafil may be taken with or without food. As with the other PDE5 inhibitors, sexual stimulation is necessary for avanafil to work.''If an individual is taking ketoconazole, erythromycin, or ritonavir, it is recommended that the maximum dose of avanafil not exceed 50 mg in 24 hours.''Similarly, if you are taking an alpha-blocker for prostate symptoms, the recommended starting dose of avanafil is 50 mg.''Avanafil shares the common PDE5 inhibitor side effects, contraindications, and cautions. No changes in dose are need for men with mild or moderate kidney disease. Individuals with severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, or those on ''kidney dialysis'' should not use avanafil.' "
What are intracavernosal injections?,"'Patient can inject medications directly into the corpora cavernosa to help attain and maintain erections. Medications such as papaverine hydrochloride, phentolamine, and prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) can be used alone or in combinations to attain erections. All of these medications are ''vasodilators'' and work by increasing blood flow into the penis. Prostaglandin E1 (Caverject, Edex) is easier to obtain; however, it is associated with ''penile pain'' in some individuals. The use of combinations of two or three of these medications can decrease the risk of having penile pain.''Risks associated with injection therapy including bleeding, pain with injection, penile pain, priapism, and corporal fibrosis (scarring inside of the corpora cavernosa). There is also concern that repetitive injections in the same area could cause ''scar tissue'' to build up in the tunica albuginea that could create penile curvature. Thus, doctors recommended that one alternate sides with injection and perform injections no more frequent than every other day.''If you are on a blood thinner, you must be careful. After injection, patients should pressure to the site to minimize bleeding.''Patients should start with a low dose and increase in small doses until the dose that results in a rigid enough erection for completion of sexual activity is achieved. If one injects and there is an inadequate response, one should not reinject another dose of the medication at that time, due to the risk of priapism.' "
What are intraurethral suppositories?,"'Prostaglandin E1 (intraurethral alprostadil or MUSE) can be inserted in a pellet (suppository) form into the urethra to attain erections. It is available in four dosage strengths: 125 mcg, 250 mcg, 500 mcg, and 1,000 mcg. Most individuals need 500 mcg to 1,000 mcg for a satisfactory response.''The prostaglandin E1 is contained in a small suppository located at the tip of an applicator. You should urinate first as this lubricates the urethra and makes it easier to insert the applicator into the tip of the urethra (urethral meatus, the opening at the tip of the penis that urine passes through). A patient can release the suppository into urethra by gently wiggling the applicator and pressing the button at the end. Rubbing the penis allows the suppository to dissolve, and the prostaglandin is absorbed through the tissue of the urethra into the penis. It takes 15 to 30 minutes for this occur. Once into the penis, the prostaglandin causes increased blood flow into the penis. The prostaglandin can be present in the ejaculate, and thus doctors recommend that men use a ''condom'' when having intercourse with a ''pregnant'' partner. Men may need to use a condom if vaginal irritation occurs in female partner.'""It is recommend that the first trial of intraurethral prostaglandin be performed in the doctor's office due to the risk of ""'hypotension'' with this medication.''Men with a known hypersensitivity to alprostadil should not use intraurethral prostaglandin E1.''Alprostadil should not be used in men with ''urethral stricture'' (scarring and narrowing of the tube that urine and the ejaculate pass through), ''balanitis'' (inflammation/infection of the glans [tip] of the penis, severe hypospadias (a condition where the opening of the urethra is not at the tip of the penis, rather on the underside of the penis), penile curvature (abnormal bend to the penis), and ''urethritis'' (inflammation/infection of the urethra).''Alprostadil should not be used in men at higher risk for priapism (erection lasting longer than six hours) including men with sickle cell ''anemia'', ''thrombocytopenia'' (''low platelet count''), ''polycythemia'' (increased red blood cell count), multiple ''myeloma'' (a cancer of the white blood cells), and is contraindicated in men prone to venous thrombosis (''blood clots'' in the veins) or hyperviscosity syndrome who are at increased risk for priapism.''Patients report success rates up to 65% with intraurethral alprostadil.''Side effects of intraurethral alprostadil include pain in the penis and sometimes in the testicles, mild urethral bleeding, ''dizziness'', and ''vaginal itching'"" in the sex partner. Patients rarely report syncopal (fainting) episodes with initial use, and thus the first trial of this medication should be performed in the physician's office."" "
What is the role of testosterone therapy in the treatment of erectile dysfunction?,"'In patients with low testosterone, testosterone treatment can improve libido and erectile dysfunction, but many men still may need additional oral medications such as sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil. Some studies suggest that men with ED and low testosterone may respond better to PDE5 inhibitors when given testosterone therapy; however, this is controversial.''Men with ED without hypogonadism (a low testosterone level and symptoms related to this) should not use testosterone therapy.''Prior to starting testosterone therapy, it is important for a doctor to perform a thorough evaluation on the patient.''Evaluation should include a breast examination, rectal examination of the prostate, and a PSA level (prostate specific antigen) blood test. Patients who have breast and ''prostate cancers'' should not use testosterone.''Patients should continue testosterone therapy only if there is improvement in the symptoms of hypogonadism and should be monitored regularly. You will need periodic blood tests for testosterone levels and blood tests to monitor your blood count and PSA. Testosterone therapy has health risks, and thus doctors should closely monitor its use. Testosterone therapy can worsen ''sleep apnea'' and ''congestive heart failure''.''A variety of testosterone therapies are available, including oral, topical (gel, spray, patch), intramuscular, and pellets. Patient should review the advantages and disadvantages of each of these with a physician, as well as the health risks and benefits of testosterone therapy.''Certain medications can alter testicular function, including some diuretics (water pills), some ''seizure'' medications, long-acting oral opiate pain medications, antipsychotic medications, and oral steroids.' "
Can a penis pump (vacuum device) help erectile dysfunction?,"'Mechanical vacuum devices cause an erection by creating a vacuum around the penis that draws blood into the penis, engorging it, and expanding it. The devices have three components:''The vacuum device creates a vacuum to pull blood into the penis. Unlike a normal erection, the inflow of blood does not continue once the individual removes the vacuum device. The rubber band placed at the base of the penis constricts the penis to prevent the blood from leaving the penis. As there is no inflow or outflow of blood when the rubber band is in place, it is uncommon for the tip of the penis (the glans) to appear a little blue and the penis to be cooler. Once intercourse is completed, the individual removes the rubber band and the blood drains out of the penis.''Yes, the vacuum device is effective. In fact, with use of the vacuum device, 88% of men will have an erection that is satisfactory for completion of sexual activity. The vacuum device may be the only therapy that is effective after the removal of a penile prosthesis. Patients also use vacuum devices as part of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy to help preserve the tissue of the penis and prevent scarring within the penis and loss of penile length. Its use, however, is limited by the mechanical nature of it and the time taken to pump the device and apply the band. Sex partners may complain of the penis being cool to touch.''Individuals must remove the rubber band immediately after completing intercourse. Leaving the band on too long can harm the penis. Rarely, ''bruising'' of the penis or blood in the ejaculate/urine may occur.' A plastic cylinder, in which the individual places his penis A pump, which draws air out of the cylinder An elastic band, which is placed around the base of the penis, to maintain the erection after the cylinder is removed and during intercourse by preventing blood from flowing back into the body (see figure 2). The vacuum device may be operated by hand or be battery operated."
What about psychological therapy for erectile dysfunction?,"""Experts often treat psychologically based impotence using techniques that decrease anxiety associated with intercourse. The patient's partner can help apply the techniques, which include gradual development of intimacy and stimulation. Such techniques also can help relieve anxiety during treatment of physical impotence. If these simple behavioral methods at home are ineffective, a doctor may refer an individual to a sex counselor."" "
Surgery for erectile dysfunction,"'Surgery for erectile dysfunction may have the following as its goal:''Currently, there are several different types of penile prostheses. The simplest is the malleable penile prosthesis and the most complex, the three-piece inflatable penile prosthesis.''Malleable implants usually consist of paired rods, inserted surgically into each of the corpora cavernosa. The rods are stiff, and to have an erection, one bends them up and then when finished with intercourse one bends them down. They do not change in length or width. The malleable implants are the least mechanical and thus have the lowest risk of malfunction. However, also have the least ""normal appearance.""''The most common inflatable prosthesis is the three-piece penile prosthesis. It is composed of paired cylinders, which doctors surgically insert inside the penis. Patients can expand the cylinders using pressurized fluid (see figure 3). Tubes connect the cylinders to a fluid reservoir and pump, which doctors also surgically implant. The reservoir is usually in the pelvis. A doctor places the pump in the scrotum. By pressing on the pump, sterile fluid transfers from the reservoir into the cylinders in the penis. An erection is produced primarily by expansion of the width of the penis, however, one model can increase in length a small amount also. Lock-out valves in the tubing prevent the fluid from leaving the cylinder until a release valve is pressed. By pressing the relief valve and gently squeezing the penis, the fluid within the cylinders transfers back into the reservoir.''The surgery for placement of a penile prosthesis is typically an outpatient surgery. Doctors often perform a penile prosthesis through a single incision, and all of the components are hidden under the skin. Health care professionals often give patients antibiotics at the time of surgery and often after the surgery to decrease the risk of developing an infection. Depending on your health history, a health care provider may leave a catheter in your penis to drain your bladder overnight.''Penile prostheses are very effective, and most patients who have a prosthesis placed are satisfied with the prosthesis. However, placement of a prosthesis causes scarring of the tissue within the corpora cavernosa, and if the prosthesis requires removal, other forms of therapy, except for the vacuum device, are often not effective. Thus, most physicians reserve placement of a prosthesis for men who have tried and failed or have contraindications to other therapies.'""Infection is a concern after placement of a prosthesis and is a reported complication in 8%-20% of men undergoing placement of a penile prosthesis. If a prosthesis becomes infected (redness, pain, and swelling of the penis and sometimes purulent drainage are signs of infection), the prosthesis must be removed. Depending on the timing and severity of the infection and your surgeon's preference, the area can be irrigated extensively with antibiotic solutions and a new prosthesis placed at the same time or removal of the infected prosthesis and an attempt to place a new prosthesis made at a later time when the infection is totally cleared.""'Mechanical malfunction is another risk of the prosthesis. However, advancements including lock-out valves and special covering over areas of the tubing have decreased the risk of mechanical malfunction.''Erosion of the prosthesis, whereby it presses through the corporal tissue into the urethra, may occur. Symptoms and signs may include pain, ''blood in the urine'', discharge, abnormal urine stream, and malfunction. If the prosthesis erodes into the urethra, a physician must remove it. If the other cylinder remains intact, it can be left in place. A physician leaves a catheter in place to allow the urethra to heal.''Other risks of penile prosthesis include over- or undersizing of the prosthesis, which can cause an abnormal appearance to the erect penis or reservoir or pump migration into abnormal locations.''Surgery to repair arteries (penile arterial reconstructive surgery) can reduce impotence caused by obstructions that block the flow of blood to the penis. The best candidates for such surgery are young men with discrete blockage of an artery because of a physical injury to the pubic area or a fracture of the pelvis. The procedure is less successful in older men with widespread blockage of arteries.''Physicians do not recommend surgery on the penile veins.'   to reconstruct arteries in order to increase the flow of blood to the penis; and to block veins that drain blood from the penis (currently not recommended). Currently, placement of a penile prosthesis is the most common surgical procedure performed for erectile dysfunction. Penile prosthesis placement is typically reserved for men who have tried and failed (either from efficacy or tolerability) or have contraindications to other forms of therapy including PDE5 inhibitors, intraurethral alprostadil, and injection therapy."
Can over-the-counter (OTC) and/or natural or home remedies treat erectile dysfunction?,"'The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has a list of 29 OTC products that claim to treat erectile dysfunction. Patients should avoid these because many contain harmful ingredients. Other natural or herbal remedies such as DHEA, L-arginine, ''ginseng'', and ''yohimbe'' are ''supplements'' that have been used but have not been proven safe and effective according to some researchers. Before using such compounds, individuals should consult their doctor. According to some experts, ''acupuncture'' does not effectively treat erectile dysfunction. Other home remedies for reducing ED symptoms include ''diet'' changes such as eating blueberries and citrus fruits and drinking red wine.' "
Is it possible to prevent erectile dysfunction?,"'Prevention'' of some of the causes that contribute to the development of erectile dysfunction can decrease the chances of developing the problem. For example, if a person decreases their chances of developing diabetes, ''heart disease'', and hypertension, they will decrease their chances of developing erectile dysfunction. Other things like stopping smoking, eating a healthy ''diet'"" (heart healthy with adequate vitamin intake), and exercising daily may reduce a person's risk."" "
What is the prognosis for erectile dysfunction?,"'Currently, there are no therapies that cure erectile dysfunction. However, a number of effective therapies are available that allow an individual to have an erection when desired. Depending on the cause of the erectile dysfunction, certain therapies may be more effective than others. Although there is limited data on lifestyle modification, intuitively, decreasing risk factors for erectile dysfunction may help prevent progression of disease.' "
What erectile dysfunction studies are under way? What are future treatment options?,"'Combination therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction has been under investigation. Most of these studies have been small trials, and long-term data regarding their effectiveness and safety are lacking. However, with thorough evaluation and counseling, there may be a use for combination therapy for certain individuals with ED.''An alprostadil cream that patients apply into the tip of the penis (the urethral meatus, the opening that urine passes through) is currently available in the UK and Europe. It is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After application of the cream, an erection occurs within five to 30 minutes, and the erection lasts one to two hours in men who respond to the cream. Doctors recommend that one use the cream for a maximum frequency of two to three times per week and no more frequent than once every 24 hours. It has essentially the same contraindications and side effects as the other formulations of alprostadil. The cream may cause vaginal burning in roughly 4% of partners. Men should not use alprostadil cream for sexual intercourse with women of childbearing potential unless a condom is used. Researchers have performed controlled trial studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this drug. Overall, 52% of men reported improvement in their erections compared to 20% of men receiving placebo. A later analysis demonstrated that 36% of men using the alprostadil cream had a clinically relevant improvement in vaginal penetration ability and 31% clinically relevant improvement in ability to have successful intercourse to ejaculation.''Other medical therapies under evaluation include ROCK inhibitors and soluble guanyl cyclase activators. Melanocortin receptor agonists are a new set of medications being developed in the field of erectile dysfunction. Their action is on the nervous system rather than the vascular system. PT-141 is a nasal preparation that appears to be effective alone or in combination with PDE5 inhibitors. The main side effects include flushing and ''nausea''. These drugs are currently not approved for commercial use.''Research in stem cell therapy and gene therapy for erectile dysfunction is also ongoing.' "
What should you know about edema?,  
What is edema?,"'The definition of edema is observable swelling from fluid accumulation in body tissues. When parts of the body are affected with edema, they are considered edematous. Edema most commonly occurs in the ''feet'', ankles, legs, and/or hands where it is referred to as peripheral edema. Edema of the foot is sometimes called pedal edema. The swelling is the result of the accumulation of excess fluid under the skin in the spaces within the tissues.''All tissues of the body are made up of cells, blood vessels, and connective tissues that hold the cells together called the interstitium. Most of the body\'s fluids that are found outside of the cells are normally stored in two spaces; the blood vessels (as the ""liquid"" or serum portion of your blood) and the interstitial spaces (not within the cells). In various diseases, excess fluid can accumulate in either one or both of these compartments.'""The body's organs have interstitial spaces where fluid can accumulate, and there are a number of different types of edema. An accumulation of fluid in the interstitial tissue around the air spaces (alveoli) in the ""'lungs'' occurs in a disorder called ''pulmonary edema''. In addition, excess fluid sometimes collects in what is called the third space, which includes ''cavities'' in the abdomen (abdominal or peritoneal ''cavity'' - called ""''ascites''"") or in the chest (lung or pleural ''cavity'' - called ""''pleural effusion''""). Anasarca, also known as extreme generalized edema is severe, widespread accumulation of fluid in the all of the tissues and ''cavities'' of the body at the same time.''The information provided here is about edema on the legs and feet (pitting or peripheral edema); however, other forms of edema are typically named depending on what part of the body is affected.''Cerebral edema'' is an accumulation of excess fluid in the brain.''Angioedema'' is swelling underneath the skin. Unlike ''hives'', which affect the surface of the skin, ''angioedema'' affects the deeper layers of the skin and often occurs on the face.''Hereditary angioedema'' ''is a rare genetic condition that causes the capillaries to release fluids into surrounding tissue, which results in edema.''Papilledema'' is swelling of the ''optic nerve'' of the eye that is a result of pressure inside the skull and around the brain (intracranial pressure).''Macular edema'' is a swelling of the portion of the eye that perceives central, detailed vision (the macula).''Dependent edema'"" usually is edema of the legs and lower body, which is affected by gravity and is dependent on a person's position. This edema usually occurs in the legs when a person is standing, and in the buttocks and hands if a person is lying down.""'Scrotal ''lymphedema'' is an enlargement of the scrotum due to fluid accumulation around the testes.''Lipedema'' is a disorder of the fatty (adipose) tissue that causes swelling of the legs and hips, and can lead to ''lymphedema''.'  "
What is pitting edema?,"'Pitting edema'' can be demonstrated by applying pressure to the swollen area by depressing the skin with a finger. If the pressing causes an indentation that persists for some time after the release of the pressure, the edema is referred to as pitting edema. Any form of pressure, such as from the elastic in socks, can induce pitting with this type of edema. This type of edema may be normal depending on the severity. Almost everyone who wears socks all day will have mild pitting edema by the end of the day.' "
What are the symptoms of pitting edema?,"'Symptoms of pitting edema include swelling, which causes the skin surrounding it to tighten, the position that you are in will affect edema, and the skin over the swollen area appears shiny and light, and, often when a finger is placed on the swollen area and indentation is left on the skin.' "
What causes pitting edema?,"'Edema is caused by either systemic diseases, that is, diseases that affect the various organ systems of the body, or by local conditions involving just the affected extremities. The most common systemic diseases associated with edema involve the ''heart'', ''liver'"", and kidneys. In these diseases, edema occurs primarily because of the body's retention of too much salt (sodium chloride). The excess salt causes the body to retain water, which then leaks into the interstitial tissue spaces, where it appears as edema. Medications also can cause pitting edema.""'The most common local conditions that cause edema are ''varicose veins'' and ''thrombophlebitis'' (inflammation of the veins) of the deep veins of the legs. These conditions can cause inadequate pumping of the blood by the veins (''venous insufficiency''). The resulting increased back-pressure in the veins forces fluid stay in the extremities (especially the ankles and feet). The excess fluid then leaks into the interstitial tissue spaces, causing edema.'  "
What causes pitting edema in heart disease?,"'Heart failure'' is the result of poor cardiac function and is reflected by a decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart, called cardiac output. Heart failure can be caused by ''weakness'' of the heart muscle, which pumps blood out through the arteries to the entire body, or by dysfunction of the heart valves, which regulate the flow of blood between the chambers of the heart. The diminished volume of blood pumped out by the heart (decreased cardiac output) is responsible for a decreased flow of blood to the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys sense there is a reduction of the blood volume in the body. To counter the seeming loss of fluid, the kidneys retain salt and water. In this instance, the kidneys are fooled into thinking the body needs to retain more fluid volume when, in fact, the body already is holding too much fluid.''This fluid increase ultimately results in the buildup of fluid within the lungs, which causes ''shortness of breath'"" (cardiogenic pulmonary edema or CPE). Because of the decreased volume of blood pumped out by the heart, the volume of blood in the arteries is also decreased, despite the actual increase in the body's total fluid volume. An associated increase in the amount of fluid in the blood vessels of the lungs causes shortness of breath because the excess fluid from the lungs' blood vessels leaks into the airspaces (alveoli) and interstitium in the lungs. This accumulation of fluid in the lung is called pulmonary edema. At the same time, accumulation of fluid in the legs causes pitting edema. This edema occurs because the build-up of blood in the veins of the legs causes leakage of fluid from the legs' capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the interstitial spaces.""'An understanding of how the heart and lungs interact will help you better comprehend how fluid retention works in heart failure. The heart has four chambers; an ''atrium'' and a ventricle on the left side of the heart and an ''atrium'' and ventricle on the right. The ''left atrium'' receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and transfers it to the ''left ventricle'', which then pumps it through the arteries to the entire body. The blood then is transported back to the heart by veins into the ''right ventricle'' and transferred to the right ventricle, which then pumps it to the lungs for re-oxygenation.''Left-sided heart failure, which is due primarily to a weak left ventricle, usually is caused by ''coronary artery disease'', ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure''), or disease of the heart valves. Typically, when these people initially come to the doctor, they are troubled by shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down at night (orthopnea). These symptoms are due to pulmonary edema that is caused by pooling of the blood in the vessels of the lungs.''In contrast, right-sided heart failure, which often is due to obstructive ''sleep apnea'' or chronic lung diseases such as ''emphysema'', initially causes salt retention and peripheral edema. Persistent salt retention in these patients, however, may lead to an expanded blood volume in the blood vessels, thereby causing fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary ''congestion'') and shortness of breath.''In people with heart failure due to weak heart muscle (''cardiomyopathy''), both the right and left ventricles of the heart are usually affected. These people initially can suffer from swelling both in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and in the legs and feet (peripheral edema). The physician examining a patient who has ''congestive heart failure'' with fluid retention looks for certain signs, including:' Pitting edema of the legs and feet Rales in the lungs (moist crackle sounds from the excess fluid that can be heard with a stethoscope) A gallop rhythm (three heart sounds instead of the normal two due to muscle weakness) Distended neck veins (The distended neck veins reflect the accumulation of blood in the veins that are returning blood to the heart.)"
What causes pitting edema during pregnancy?,"'When a woman is ''pregnant'', her body produces 50% more blood and other body fluids than usual to help support the developing fetus. This causes edema of the hands, face, legs, ankles and feet, and is a normal part of ''pregnancy'' Swelling can also be pronounced in the legs and feet because of the enlarged womb (uterus) taking up space in the abdomen and inhibiting return of fluids from the legs.''Edema during pregnancy can happen any time through gestation, but most women start to experience it around the fifth month, and edema may be worst in the ''third trimester''.''Mild swelling is common, but sudden swelling of the hands or face can be a sign of ''preeclampsia'', a complication of pregnancy. See your obstetrician of you experience facial edema, leg edema, or any sudden or severe swelling while pregnant.''Edema may continue even after you have given birth. Postpartum edema usually gradually resolves within a week or so after giving birth and is generally not a serious condition. If the postpartum swelling does not resolve within about a week or you experience ''headaches'' or ''pain'' in your legs, this may be a sign of ''high blood pressure'' and ''preeclampsia''. Tell your doctor if this occurs.' "
What causes pitting edema in liver disease?,"'In people with chronic diseases of the liver, fibrosis (scarring) of the liver often occurs. When the scarring becomes advanced, the condition is called ''cirrhosis'' of the liver. Ascites is excessive fluid that accumulates in the abdominal (peritoneal) cavity. It is a complication of ''cirrhosis'' and appears as an abdominal bulge. The peritoneum is the inner lining of the abdominal cavity, which also folds over to cover the organs inside the abdomen such as the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and ''intestines''. Ascites develops because of a combination of two factors, increased pressure in the vein system that carries blood from the stomach, intestines, and spleen to the liver (''portal hypertension''). A low level of the protein albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia). Albumin, which is the predominant protein in the blood and which helps maintain blood volume, is reduced in cirrhosis primarily because the damaged liver is not able to produce enough of it.''Other consequences of portal ''hypertension'' include dilated veins in the ''esophagus'' (varices), prominent veins on the abdomen, and an ''enlarged spleen''. Each of these conditions is due primarily to the increased pressure and accumulation of blood and excess fluid in the abdominal blood vessels. The fluid of ascites can be removed from the abdominal cavity by using a syringe and a long needle, a procedure called paracentesis. Analysis of the fluid can help differentiate ascites that is caused by cirrhosis from other causes of ascites, such as ''cancer'', ''tuberculosis'', congestive heart failure, and nephrosis. Sometimes, when ascites does not respond to treatment with diuretics, paracentesis can be used to remove large amounts of the ascitic fluid.''Peripheral edema'', which is usually seen as pitting edema of the legs and feet, also occurs in cirrhosis. The edema is a consequence of the hypoalbuminemia and the kidneys retaining salt and water.''The presence or absence of edema in patients with cirrhosis and ascites is an important consideration in the treatment of the ascites. ''In patients with ascites without edema'', diuretics must be given with extra caution. Diuresis (induced increased volume of urine by use of diuretics) that is too aggressive or rapid in these patients can lead to a low blood volume (hypovolemia), which can cause kidney and liver failure. In contrast, ''when patients who have both edema and ascites'' undergo diuresis, the edema fluid in the interstitial space serves as somewhat of a buffer against the development of low blood volume. The excess interstitial fluid moves into the blood vessel spaces to rapidly replenish the depleted blood volume.' "
What causes pitting edema in people with poor kidney function?,"""In this situation, people who have kidney diseases that impair renal function develop edema because of a limitation in the kidneys' ability to excrete sodium into the urine. Thus, people with ""'kidney failure'' from whatever cause will develop edema if their intake of sodium exceeds the ability of their kidneys to excrete the sodium. The more advanced the ''kidney failure'', the greater the problem of salt retention is likely to become. The most severe situation is the patient with end-stage kidney failure who requires ''dialysis'"" therapy. This patient's salt balance is totally regulated by dialysis, which can remove salt during the treatment. Dialysis is a method of cleansing the body of the impurities that accumulate when the kidneys fail. Dialysis is accomplished by circulating the patient's blood over an artificial membrane (""'hemodialysis'"") or by using the patient's own abdominal cavity (peritoneal membrane) as the cleansing surface. Individuals whose kidney function declines to less than 5% to 10% of normal may require dialysis."" "
What causes pitting edema in kidney disease?,"'Edema forms in people with ''kidney disease'' for two reasons, a heavy loss of ''protein in the urine'', and impaired kidney (renal) function.' "
What causes pitting edema by loss of protein in the urine?,"'In this situation, the people have a problem with kidney function due to a filtration problem involving proteins. Proteins spills through the kidney and into the urine. The heavy loss of protein in the urine (over 3.0 grams per day) with its accompanying edema is termed the ''nephrotic syndrome''. Nephrotic syndrome results in a reduction in the concentration of albumin in the blood (hypoalbuminemia). Since albumin helps to maintain blood volume in the blood vessels, a reduction of fluid in the blood vessels occurs. The kidneys then register that there is depletion of blood volume and attempt to retain salt. Consequently, fluid moves into the interstitial spaces causing pitting edema.' "
How does venous insufficiency cause edema?,"'The veins in the legs are responsible for transporting blood up to the veins of the torso, where it is then returned to the heart. The veins of the legs have valves that prevent the backward flow of blood within them. Venous insufficiency is incompetence of the veins that occurs because of dilation, or enlargement, of the veins and dysfunction of their valves. This happens, for example, in people with ''varicose veins''. Venous insufficiency leads to a backup of blood and increased pressure in the veins, thereby resulting in edema of the legs and feet. Edema of the legs also can occur with an episode of deep vein thrombophlebitis (''DVT''), which is a ''blood clot'' within an inflamed vein. In this situation, the clot in the deep vein blocks the return of blood, and consequently causes increased back-pressure in the leg veins.''Venous insufficiency is a problem localized to the legs, ankles, and feet. One leg may be more affected than the other (asymmetrical edema). In contrast, systemic diseases that are associated with fluid retention generally cause the same amount of edema in both legs, and can also cause edema and swelling elsewhere in the body. The response to therapy with diuretic ''drugs'' in patients with venous insufficiency tends to be unsatisfactory. This is because the continued pooling of fluid in the lower extremities makes it difficult for the diuretics to mobilize the edema fluid. Elevation of the legs periodically during the day and the use of compression stockings may alleviate the edema. Some patients require surgical treatment to relieve chronic edema that is caused by venous insufficiency.' "
What medications treat pitting edema caused by urine loss?,"'The treatment of fluid retention in these people is to reduce the loss of protein into the urine and to restrict salt in the ''diet''. The loss of protein in the urine may be reduced by the use of ''ACE inhibitors'"" (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB's). Both categories of drugs, which ordinarily are used to lower ""'blood pressure'', prompt the kidneys to reduce the loss of protein into the urine.''ACE inhibitor drugs include:''Angiotensin receptor blockers include:''Certain kidney diseases may contribute to the loss of protein in the urine and the development of edema. A biopsy of the kidney may be needed to make a diagnosis of the type of kidney disease, so that treatment may be given.' enalapril (Vasotec) quinapril (Accupril) captopril (Capoten) benazepril (Lotensin) trandolapril (Mavik) lisinopril (Zestril or Prinivil) ramipril (Altace) losartan (Cozaar) valsartan (Diovan) candesartan (Atacand) irbesartan (Avapro)"
What is idiopathic edema?,"'Idiopathic edema is a pitting edema of unknown cause that occurs primarily in pre-menopausal women who do not have evidence of heart, liver, or kidney disease. In this condition, the fluid retention at first may be seen primarily pre-menstrually (just prior to ''menstruation''), which is why it sometimes is called ""cyclical"" edema. However, it can become a more constant and severe problem.' "
What is the treatment for idiopathic edema?,"'Patients with idiopathic edema often take diuretics to decrease the edema in order to lessen the discomfort of ''bloating'' and swelling. Paradoxically, the edema in this condition can become more of a problem after the use of diuretics. The people can develop fluid retention as a rebound phenomenon each time they discontinue diuretics. Talk to your doctor before using any diuretics.''Patients with idiopathic edema appear to have a leak in the capillaries (tiny peripheral blood vessels that connect the arteries with the veins) so that fluid passes from the blood vessels into the surrounding interstitial space. Thus, a patient with idiopathic edema has a decreased blood volume, which leads to the typical reaction of salt retention by the kidneys. The leg edema in these people is exaggerated in the standing position, since edema tends to accumulate in those parts of the body that are close to the ground at the time. These people often have edema around the eyes (periorbital edema) in the morning because the edema fluid accumulates during the night around their eyes as they lay sleeping flat. In contrast, edema around the eyes does not tend to develop in cardiac people who keep their heads elevated at night because of shortness of breath when they lie flat. These people characteristically experience varying amounts of edema in different parts of the body at different times of the day.' "
How is the degree of pitting edema measured (diagnosed)?,"'Some doctors may use a scale to determine the severity of the pitting edema. These scales are subjective based on either how deep the pitting is, or how long the pitting persists.''Following are two examples of edema measurement using 4-point scales, with 1 point being minor edema, to 4 points being severe edema.''In ''non-pitting edema'', which usually affects the legs or arms, pressure applied to the skin does not result in a persistent indentation. Non-pitting edema can occur in certain disorders of the lymphatic system such as lymphedema, which is a disturbance of the lymphatic circulation that may occur after a ''mastectomy'', ''lymph node'' surgery, ''radiation therapy'', morbid ''obesity'', venous insufficiency, or be present from birth (congenitally).''Another cause of non-pitting let edema is called pretibial myxedema, which is a swelling over the shin that occurs in some people with ''hypothyroidism''. Non-pitting leg edema is difficult to treat. Diuretic medications are generally not effective, although elevation of the legs periodically during the day and compressive devices may reduce the swelling.''The focus of the rest of this article is on pitting edema, as it is the most common form of edema.' "
Will salt in your diet affect edema?,"""The body's balance of salt is usually well-regulated. Most people can consume salt in the ""'diet'' without concern for developing salt depletion or retention. The intake of salt is determined by dietary patterns and the removal of salt from the body is accomplished by the kidneys. The kidneys have a great capacity to control the amount of salt in the body by changing the amount of salt eliminated (excreted) in the urine. The amount of salt excreted by the kidneys is regulated by hormonal and physical factors that signal whether retention or removal of salt by the kidneys is necessary.''If blood flow to the kidneys is decreased by an underlying condition such as heart failure, the kidneys react by retaining salt. This salt retention occurs because the kidneys perceive the body needs more fluid to compensate for the decreased blood flow. If the patient has a kidney disease that impairs the function of the kidneys, the ability to excrete salt in the urine is limited. In both conditions, the amount of salt in the body increases, which causes the patient to retain water and develop edema.''People with edema experiencing a disturbance in their ability to normally excrete salt may need to either be placed on a diet limited in salt and/or given diuretic medications (water pills). In the past, patients with diseases associated with edema were placed on diets very restricted in salt intake. With the development of new and very potent diuretics, this marked restriction in dietary salt intake is generally less strict. These diuretics work by blocking the reabsorption and retention of salt by the kidneys, thereby increasing the amount of salt and water eliminated in the urine.'  "
What other foods in the diet cause edema?,"'Some diuretics frequently cause an excessive loss of potassium in the urine, leading to the depletion of body potassium. These drugs include the loop diuretics, the ''thiazide diuretics'', and ''metolazone''. Patients on these diuretics are commonly advised to take potassium ''supplements'' and/or to eat foods high in potassium. ''High potassium'' foods include certain fruits such as:''Patients with impaired kidney function often do not require potassium ''supplements'' with diuretics because their damaged kidneys tend to retain potassium. In certain instances, the volume of urine induced by the diuretic can be improved by adding a potassium-sparing diuretic, one that does not cause depletion of potassium. These diuretics include ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone''), ''triamterene'' (''Dyrenium'', a component of Dyazide), and ''amiloride'' (''Midamor'""). Adding one of these diuretics to the patient's diuretic regimen may preclude the need for potassium supplements. Another diuretic that can be used is ""'acetazolamide'' (''Diamox''), which counteracts the development of an increased concentration of bicarbonate (too much alkali) in the blood. Increased bicarbonate sometimes occurs in patients receiving other diuretics.' Bananas Orange juice Tomatoes Potatoes"
Which diuretics treat edema?,"'Edema can become a problem in systemic diseases of the heart, liver or kidneys. Diuretic therapy can be initiated, often alleviating the edema. The most potent diuretics are loop diuretics, so-called because they work in the portion of the kidney tubules referred to as the loop of Henle. The kidney tubules are small ducts that regulate salt and water balance, while transporting the forming urine. Clinical loop diuretics available are:'""The doses of these diuretics vary depending upon the patient's clinical circumstances. These drugs can be given orally, although seriously ill patients in the hospital may receive them intravenously for more prompt or effective response. If one of the loop diuretics is not effective alone, it may be combined with an agent that works further down (more distally) in the tubule. These agents include the thiazide type diuretics, such as ""'hydrochlorothiazide'' (''HydroDIURIL''), or a similar but more potent type of diuretic called metolazone (''Zaroxolyn''). Other thiazide diuretics include ''chlorthalidone'' (''Thalitone'') methyclothiazide (Enduron), chlorthalidone (Hygroton), ''indapamide'' (Lozol), and metolazone (Zaroxolyn, Diulo, Mykrox). When diuretics that work at different sites in the kidney are used together, the response often is greater than the combined responses to the individual diuretics (synergistic response).'   furosemide (Lasix), torsemide (Demadex), butethamine (Bumex), ethacrynate (Edecrin)"
What drugs treat idiopathic edema?,"'People with idiopathic edema often take diuretics to decrease the edema in order to lessen the discomfort of bloating and swelling. Paradoxically, the edema in this condition can become more of a problem after the use of diuretics. The people can develop fluid retention as a rebound phenomenon each time they discontinue diuretics. Talk to your doctor before using any diuretics.''People with idiopathic edema often become dependent on diuretics, and this dependence may be difficult to interrupt. A period as long as three weeks off diuretics may be required to break the dependency cycle. The withdrawal from diuretics may lead to fluid retention that produces major discomfort and swelling. Moreover, there are definite risks associated with the prolonged use of diuretics in these individuals, which are compounded by the tendency to increase the doses of the diuretics.''As a result of chronic diuretic use and abuse, people may develop:''Other side effects of diuretics include:''Although withdrawal from diuretics is the most important factor in treating these patients, other medications have been used to try to minimize the fluid retention. These medications include ACE inhibitors, low-dose ''amphetamines'', ''ephedrine'', ''bromocriptine'' (''Parlodel''), or ''levodopa-carbidopa'' (''Sinemet'') in combination. However, their effectiveness is uncertain and side effects of these drugs may occur. For example, ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure'') may be seen with the use of ACE inhibitors, especially if the patient is also taking diuretics.' A deficiency of potassium Depletion of blood volume in the blood vessels Kidney insufficiency or failure High blood sugar (diabetes) High uric acid (gout) Muscle cramps Tender and enlarged breasts (gynecomastia) Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)"
Can diuretics treat other health problems?,"'Diuretics have several other uses in addition treating edema.'   A diuretic may be used as part of the treatment program for patients with hypertension. (High blood pressure may be caused by salt retention, or caused by some antihypertensive medications). Most medications that dilate the blood vessels and reduce blood pressure, except for ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, lead to secondary salt retention by the kidneys. Thiazide diuretics also have been used to prevent the formation of kidney stones. These drugs reduce the urinary excretion of calcium, which is a component of the kidney stone. Acetazolamide (Diamox) taken a few days before going to high altitudes, appears to reduce the tendency for people to develop altitude sickness."
Which types of specialties treat edema?,"'The type of doctor who treats edema depends on the type and cause of the edema. Because edema is multifactorial (many possible causes), several doctors will likely be involved in your care. This includes your primary care physician (PCP) or internist, a nephrologist (kidney specialist), cardiologist (heart specialist), or ''gastroenterologist'' (digestive tract or liver specialist).''Some of the complications of edema are managed by other specialists, such as ''wound care'' specialists for edema that leads to leg ulcers, or obstetrician/gynecologists for edema during pregnancy.' "
What is pulmonary edema?,"'Edema, in general, means swelling. This typically occurs when fluid from inside blood vessels seeps outside the blood vessel into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. This can happen either because of too much pressure in the blood vessels or not enough proteins in the bloodstream to hold on to the fluid in the plasma (the part of the blood that does not contain any blood cells).''Pulmonary edema is the term used when edema happens in the lungs. The immediate area outside of the small blood vessels in the lungs is occupied by very tiny air sacs called the alveoli. This is where oxygen from the air is picked up by the blood passing by, and carbon dioxide in the blood is passed into the alveoli to be exhaled out. Alveoli normally have a thin wall that allows for this air exchange, and fluids are usually kept out of the alveoli unless these walls lose their integrity.''Pulmonary edema occurs when the alveoli fill up with excess fluid seeped out of the blood vessels in the lung instead of air. This can cause problems with the exchange of ''gas'' (oxygen and carbon dioxide), resulting in breathing difficulty and poor oxygenation of blood. Sometimes, this can be referred to as ""water in the lungs"" when describing the condition to patients.''Pulmonary edema can be caused by many different factors. It can be related to ''heart failure'', called cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or related to other causes, referred to as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.'  "
What are the symptoms of pulmonary edema?,"'The most common symptom of pulmonary edema is ''shortness of breath'' or breathlessness. This may be of gradual onset if the process slowly develops, or it can have a sudden onset in the case of acute pulmonary edema.''Other common symptoms may include easy ''fatigue'', more rapidly developing shortness of breath than normal with usual activity (dyspnea on exertion), rapid breathing (tachypnea), ''dizziness'', or ''weakness''.''Low blood oxygen level (''hypoxia'') may be detected in patients with pulmonary edema. Furthermore, upon examination of the lungs with a stethoscope, the doctor may listen for abnormal lung sounds, such as rales or crackles (discontinuous short bubbling sounds corresponding to the splashing of the fluid in the alveoli during breathing).'  "
What are the risk factors for pulmonary edema?,"""The risk factors for pulmonary edema are essentially the underlying causes of the condition. There isn't any specific risk factor for pulmonary edema other than risk factors for the causative conditions."" "
What causes pulmonary edema?,"'As mentioned earlier, pulmonary edema can be broadly divided into cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic causes. Some of the common causes are listed below.''Cardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema results from high pressure in the blood vessels of the lung due to poor ''heart function''. ''Congestive heart failure'' due to poor ''heart'' pumping function (arising from various causes such as arrhythmias and diseases or weakness of the heart muscle), ''heart attacks'', or abnormal heart valves can lead to accumulation of more than the usual amount of blood in the blood vessels of the lungs. This can, in turn, cause the fluid from the blood vessels to be pushed out to the alveoli as the pressure builds up.''Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be commonly caused by the following:'   Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially serious condition caused by severe infections, trauma, lung injury, inhalation of toxins, lung infections, cocaine smoking, or radiation to the lungs. In ARDS, the integrity of the alveoli become compromised as a result of underlying inflammatory response, and this leads to leaky alveoli that can fill up with fluid from the blood vessels. Kidney failure and inability to excrete fluid from the body can cause fluid build-up in the blood vessels, resulting in pulmonary edema. In people with advanced kidney disease, dialysis may be necessary to remove the excess body fluid. High altitude pulmonary edema, which can happen due to rapid ascent to high altitudes of more than 10,000 feet. Brain trauma, bleeding in the brain (intracranial hemorrhage), severe seizures, or brain surgery can sometimes result in fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing neurogenic pulmonary edema. A rapidly expanding lung can sometimes cause re-expansion pulmonary edema. This may happen in cases when the lung collapses (pneumothorax) or a large amount of fluid around the lung (pleural effusion) is removed, resulting in rapid expansion of the lung. This can result in pulmonary edema on the affected side only (unilateral pulmonary edema). Rarely, an overdose on heroin or methadone can lead to pulmonary edema. Aspirin overdose or chronic high dose use of aspirin can lead to aspirin intoxication, especially in the elderly, which may cause pulmonary edema. Other more rare causes of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may include pulmonary embolism (blood clot which has traveled to the lungs), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), some viral infections, or eclampsia in pregnant women."
What are the complications of pulmonary edema?,"'Most complications of pulmonary edema may arise from the complications associated with the underlying cause. More specifically, pulmonary edema can cause severely compromised oxygenation of the blood by the lungs. This poor oxygenation (hypoxia) can potentially lead to diminished oxygen delivery to different body organs, such as the brain.' "
How do medical professionals diagnose pulmonary edema?,"'Pulmonary edema is typically diagnosed by a ''chest X-ray''. A normal chest radiograph (X-ray) consists of a central white area pertaining to the heart and its main blood vessels plus the bones of the vertebral column, with the lung fields showing as darker fields on either side, enclosed by the bony structures of the chest wall.''A typical chest X-ray with pulmonary edema may show a more white appearance over both lung fields than usual. More severe cases of pulmonary edema can demonstrate significant opacification (whitening) over the lungs with minimal visualization of the normal lung fields. This whitening represents filling of the alveoli as a result of pulmonary edema, but it may give minimal information about the possible underlying cause.'""To identify the cause of pulmonary edema, a thorough assessment of the patient's clinical picture is essential. A careful medical history and physical examination often provide invaluable information regarding the cause.""'Other diagnostics tools used in assessing the underlying cause of pulmonary edema include the measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP. This is a protein marker (a hormone) that will rise in the blood due to the stretch of the chambers of the heart. Elevation of the BNP nanogram (one billionth of a gram) per liter greater than a few hundred (300 or more) is highly suggestive of cardiac pulmonary edema. On the other hand, values less than 100 essentially rule out heart failure as the cause.''More invasive methods are occasionally necessary to distinguish between cardiac and noncardiac pulmonary edema in more complicated and critical situations. A pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz) is a thin, long tube (catheter) inserted into the large veins of the chest or the neck and advanced through the right-sided chambers of the heart and lodged into the pulmonary capillaries (small branches of the blood vessels of the lungs). This device has the capability of directly measuring the pressure in the pulmonary vessels, called the pulmonary artery wedge pressure.''A Swan-Ganz catheter placement and data interpretation is done only in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.'   A wedge pressure of 18 mmHg or higher is consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, whereas a wedge pressure of less than 18 mmHg usually favors a non-cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema."
What is the treatment for pulmonary edema?,"'The treatment of pulmonary edema largely depends on its cause and severity.''Most cases of cardiac pulmonary edema are treated by using diuretics (water pills) along with other medications for heart failure. In some situations, appropriate treatment can be achieved as an outpatient by taking oral medications. If the pulmonary edema is more severe or it is not responsive to oral medications, then hospitalization and the use of intravenous diuretic medications may be necessary.''The treatment for noncardiac causes of pulmonary edema varies depending on the cause. For example, severe infection (''sepsis'') is treated with antibiotics and other supportive measures, or ''kidney failure'' needs to be properly evaluated and managed.''Oxygen supplementation is necessary if the measured oxygen level in the blood is too low. In serious conditions, such as ARDS, placing a patient on a mechanical breathing machine is necessary to support their breathing while other measures are taken to treat pulmonary edema and its underlying cause.'  "
When should I seek medical care for pulmonary edema?,"'Medical attention should be sought for anyone who is diagnosed with pulmonary edema of any cause. Many causes of pulmonary edema require hospitalization, especially if they are caused acutely. In some cases of chronic (long term) pulmonary edema, for example, with congestive heart failure, routine follow-up visits with the treating doctor may be recommended.''Most cases of pulmonary edema are treated by internal medicine doctors (internists), heart specialists (cardiologists), or lung doctors (pulmonologists).' "
Is it possible to prevent pulmonary edema?,"'In terms of preventive measures, depending on the cause of pulmonary edema, some steps can be taken. Long-term ''prevention'' of ''heart disease'' and ''heart attacks'', slow elevation to high altitudes, or avoidance of drug overdose can be considered preventive.''On the other hand, some causes may not completely avoidable or preventable, such as ARDS due to an overwhelming infection or a trauma.' "
Facts you should know about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome," Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of disorders which share common features including easy bruising, joint hypermobility (loose joints), skin that stretches easily (skin hyperelasticity or laxity), and weakness of tissues. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are inherited in the genes that are passed from parents to offspring. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes symptoms and signs are joints that are more flexible than normal and loose skin that stretches away from the body. The diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is based upon the clinical findings of the patient and the family history. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are treated according to the particular manifestations present in a given individual."
What is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?,"'Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of disorders which share common features including ''easy bruising'', joint hypermobility (loose joints), skin that stretches easily (skin hyperelasticity or laxity), and weakness of tissues.''The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are inherited in the genes that are passed from parents to offspring. They are categorized according to the form of genetic transmission into different types with many features differing between patients in any given type. The fragile skin and loose joints is often a result of abnormal genes that produce abnormal proteins that confer an inherited frailty of collagen (the normal protein ""glue"" of our tissues).''In 2001, researchers discovered a new form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that is caused by an inherited abnormality in a protein other than collagen that also normally plays a role in binding together the cells of our tissues (including the skin, tendons, muscle, and blood vessels). Abnormalities in this protein, called tenascin, also lead to a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Researchers suspect that tenascin could play a role in regulating the normal distribution of collagen in the connective tissues of the body.'  "
What are the types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes?,"'In this form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, spontaneous rupture of arteries and bowel is a serious manifestation that can lead to death.''Other rare variant types have been reported in single families.'   Marked joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility (laxity), and fragility are characteristic of the classic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The smooth, velvety skin is fragile and tears or bruises easily with minor trauma. Joint dislocations and scoliosis are common. Joint instability can lead to sprains and strains. This classical type is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait (directly passed on from one parent to child). Joint hypermobility is the major manifestation of this form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Any joint can be affected, and dislocations are frequent. This type is also inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Clubfoot can be present at birth. Skin laxity is of varying degrees. Veins can be very visible through the skin. It is primarily inherited as an autosomal dominant (directly passed on from one parent to child) genetic trait, but recessive (not seen in family members or only in one generation of members of the same family, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutation, one from each parent) trait inheritance has been described. Fragile globe of the eyes, significant skin and joint laxity, and severe curvature of the spine (scoliosis) are typical features. Its inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. Patients are short in height and severely affected by joint laxity and dislocations. Skin involvement is variable. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance is possible. A skin biopsy can be used to diagnose this disorder. Patients have severely fragile skin that is soft and doughy with sagging and folding. This rare form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy. Joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, and fragile tissue are seen. Patients with this type lack the multiple shrinking (atrophied) scars in the skin that are often seen in classic Ehlers-Danlos. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive genetic trait."
What are the signs and symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?,'Symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes include''Signs of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes include'   loose skin that stretches away from the body easily and excessively. The skin can appear saggy and soft and may tear easily and be fragile. easy bruising without significant trauma and joints that can move beyond the normal range of motion. Joint hypermobility in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes can lead to multiple joint dislocations.
How do doctors diagnose Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?,"'The diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is based upon the clinical findings of the patient and the family history. For some types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a skin biopsy to determine the chemical ''makeup'' of the connective tissue can help to suggest the diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?,"'Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are treated according to the particular manifestations present in a given individual.''Joint injury must be avoided for a person with\xa0Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.\xa0'   Skin protection (from injury of trauma and sun, etc.) is critical. Wounds must be tended with great care and infections treated and prevented. Suturing can be difficult as the skin can be extremely fragile. Occasionally, bracing may be necessary to maintain joint stability. Exercises that strengthen the muscles that support the joints can help to minimize joint injury. Contact sports and activities involving joint impact should be avoided."
What are enterovirulent E. coli (EEC)?,"'Enterovirulent ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') are composed of a number of serotypes (''strains'' of related bacteria identified by their slightly different antigenic structures) of bacteria that have a strong propensity to cause infections, initially in the gastrointestinal tract (""entero"" in Greek means intestine; virulent means deadly or disease-causing). Enterovirulent ''Escherichia coli'' (EEC) are members of the bacterial genus ''Escherichia'', named after T. Escherich, who first isolated the bacteria in 1885. The majority of the genus ''Escherichia'' is composed of one species termed ""coli"" (Latin for colon); however there are over 700 serotypes of this bacterial species. Many ''E. coli'' serotypes may cause infections other than in the intestine, but the focus of this article is on the enterovirulent groups (EEC groups), with symptoms of the disease primarily limited to the gastrointestinal tract.''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') are gram-negative bacteria that are rod-shaped, have the ability to survive in ''aerobic'' and ''anaerobic'' environments (termed a facultative anaerobe), and may or may not produce flagella and pili (thin hair-like projections) depending on environmental needs.''E. coli'' ''strains'' are found worldwide and live in significant numbers in humans and other animals as part of the normal bacterial population found in their large ''intestines''. The organisms have likely co-existed with humans for eons in the normal flora (bacterial populations usually found in healthy individuals) of human and other animal colons. However, among the 700 ''strains'' of ''E. coli'', there are a few strains that cause disease. These ''E. coli'' strains are some of the most frequent causes of many common ''bacterial infections'', including diarrhea, ''cholecystitis'', ''bacteremia'', cholangitis, ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), '""traveler's diarrhea""', and other clinical infections such as ''neonatal'' ''meningitis'', ''pneumonia'', abdominal abscesses, and ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'' (''HUS'').''A classic example of such an ''E. coli'' strain is ''E. coli'' ''0157:H7''. The name ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 seems complex; however scientists use the numbers and letters to specifically designate small differences in ''E. coli'' strains. The 0157 is the ""O"" serotype antigen that identifies one of the over 700 strains and the ""H"" of H7 represents the antigen type on the bacterium\'s flagella. Some ''E. coli'' also possess K antigens (protein/polysaccharide surface components) that have been used to identify certain strains. These designations (O, H, and K) may be used to identify strains causing specific diseases and have been utilized to identify outbreaks of disease.' "
What are the symptoms caused by enterovirulent E. coli (EEC)?,"'The major symptom that all enterovirulent ''E. coli'' (EEC) produce in common is diarrhea; these organisms are the leading cause of bacterial ''gastroenteritis''. However, the type of diarrhea (for example, bloody, chronic, or self-limiting) and the complications that may accompany the infections differ somewhat from each other. These symptoms have caused researchers and clinicians to arrange ''E. coli'' serotypes into groups according to their different symptoms and disease causing (pathogenic) mechanisms. Depending on which research or clinical physicians publications are read, there are 4 to 6 groups of ''E. coli'' that comprise all of the enterovirulent ''E. coli'' (EEC). Unfortunately, some investigators have more than one term for some members of the groups. The following is a summary of the groups that are currently in the literature and the symptoms ''E. coli'' group members cause: ''As one can surmise, there are unfortunate overlaps in disease syndromes and that is one reason that authors disagree on the actual number of groups (EPEC, EAEC, and EAggEC or EACE and EAggEC are often lumped together). It seems unlikely that the group names will remain stable in the future (see next section). '   EHEC (enterohemorrhagic E. coli): bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP); additional terms for EHEC are VTEC and STEC which stand for Vero toxin-producing E. coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, respectively. One serotype, E. coli 0157:H7, is responsible for the majority of the bloody diarrhea that occurs due to the production of Shiga toxins.  ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli):traveler's diarrhea, a watery diarrhea with nausea, abdominal cramping, and fever, caused by several serotypes of E. coli (0169:H47, 0148:H28 and several others) that produce two toxins that cause the gastrointestinal tract to secrete fluid (secretory exotoxins)  EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli): childhood diarrhea, caused by E. coli bacteria (many different serotypes) that can attach to gastrointestinal tissues, especially in infants, and produces a watery or bloody diarrhea in infants by producing a toxin similar to that produced by the bacterium named Shigella dysenteriae.  EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli): Shigella-like dysentery with blood and mucus, due to E. coli that invade epithelial cells of people of all ages, also producing vomiting, fever and chills. These serotypes are closely related to Shigella spp. (a few children develop HUS) EAEC (enteroadherent E. coli): childhood watery diarrhea, some cases of traveler's diarrhea in adults, and some urinary tract infections. This group is composed of E. coli strains (for example, 0119 or 055) that are able to adhere to human cells (gastrointestinal and other cell types). About one-half of this group is able to cause mild diarrhea, usually in children, while other E. coli serotypes that can adhere, do not cause any disease. Like EAggEC, these enteroadherent E. coli do not produce any Shiga toxins or secretory-causing exotoxins. EAggEC (enteroaggregative E. coli): persistent diarrhea in developing countries especially in children that usually lasts more than 14 days. The diarrhea is watery, mucus-containing, and in about one-third of individuals, bloody. Those with EAggEC usually have only a low fever (less than 101 F or 38.3 C) and almost no vomiting. These E. coli serotypes (for example, 042 and 044) do not produce any Shiga toxins or secretory exotoxins that cause secretions but cause intestinal inflammation that is linked to abnormally high intestinal secretion that leads to watery diarrhea. These strains are unique because they ""aggregate"" (form small masses comprised of cultured tissue cells and bacteria) human gastrointestinal cells by attaching via fimbriae (pili)."
A new EEC group? (E. coli 0104:H4),"'As an update to this article, the addition of the newest EEC E. strain will be presented. It recently arose in Germany in early 2011 and has now been documented in 11 European countries; at least four people who traveled to Germany and returned to the US have been infected with this strain. In most people, the exposure to the infection source occurred while people were visiting Germany, most likely through contaminated food (salads).''The strain has been identified as ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 (also termed ''STEC'' 0104:H4). It is presented in this section because as stated in the previous paragraph, there are unfortunate overlaps in ECC caused disease and this new strain seems to exhibit some of the worst overlap features of the ECC group members. For example, ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 is reported to contain about 93% of the genome of EHEC and produces the Shiga (Vero) toxin; however, it also seems to have the ability like EAEC strains to attach well to gastrointestinal cells.''The outbreak in Germany was the third largest ever reported for ''E. coli'' (about 4320 infected people) and the most lethal (at least 82 dead). In addition, most strains isolated are resistant to multiple antibiotics (aminoglycosides, macrolides and Beta-lactams). The source of the infection may be contaminated bean sprouts grown organically and then shipped to many German ''restaurants''. One major difference in ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 from other ''E. coli'' that cause ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'' or HUS (mainly ''E. coli'' 0157:H7) is that the organism is causing HUS in young adult females and other adults. Often, HUS caused by ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is seen in children and the elderly, not relatively healthy adults. This outbreak had 850 people develop HUS. This new strain had three disease causing (pathogenic) mechanisms; 1) Shiga toxin, 2) adherent fimbriae (pili), and 3) EXPEC (extra-intestinal pathogenic ''E. coli''). ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 may constitute a new group as yet unnamed.''The CDC suggested the following guidelines for ''E. coli'' 0104:H4. It is not recommended to give antibiotics to individuals with suspected STEC infections until complete diagnostic testing can be performed and STEC infection is ruled out. Some studies have shown that administering antibiotics to people with STEC infections might increase their risk of developing HUS. However, clinical decision making must be tailored to each affected individual. There may be indications for antibiotics in those with severe intestinal inflammation if perforation is of concern. Of note, isolates of STEC O104:H4 from patients in Germany have demonstrated resistance to multiple antibiotics.''CDC guidelines to ensure as complete as possible detection and characterization of STEC infections include the following:''The benefits of adhering to the recommended testing strategy include early diagnosis, improved patient outcome, and detection of all STEC serotypes.''All patients with Shiga toxin-positive diarrheal illness or HUS should be reported to health departments, regardless of a travel history to Germany.' All stools submitted for testing from patients with acute community-acquired diarrhea should be cultured for STEC O157:H7. These stools should be simultaneously assayed for non-O157 STEC with a test that detects the Shiga toxins or the genes encoding these toxins. Clinical laboratories should report and send E. coli O157:H7 isolates and Shiga toxin-positive samples to state or local public health laboratories as soon as possible for additional characterization. Specimens or enrichment broths in which Shiga toxin or STEC are detected, but from which O157:H7 STEC isolates are not recovered, should be forwarded as soon as possible to a state or local public health laboratory so that non-O157:H7 STEC can be isolated. It is often difficult to isolate STEC in stool by the time a patient presents with HUS. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) has been shown to increase recovery of STEC from HUS patients. For any patient with HUS without a culture-confirmed STEC infection, stool can be sent to a public health laboratory that performs IMS or to the CDC (through a state public health laboratory). In addition, serum can be sent to CDC (through a state public health laboratory) for serologic testing of common STEC serogroups."
How do enterovirulent E. coli groups cause disease?,"'In general, all EEC groups cause disease by disruption of the normal secretory mechanisms of the intestines which leads to diarrhea. As outlined previously, different groups use different methods that ultimately results in diarrhea; the type of diarrhea and the intensity of the disease are related to the mechanisms used by the bacteria. ' EHEC secrete Shiga toxins that can not only destroy intestinal cells, but can be spread to other organ systems to cause additional disease. E. coli 0157:H7 is the major EHEC pathogen responsible and is considered to be one of the most virulent organisms in all of the EEC groups because of Shiga toxin production.  EPEC group organisms also can produce a toxin closely related to Shigella toxin that has many of the same properties of Shiga toxin although the serotypes cause the disease (sometimes milder) mainly in children.  The ETEC group does not produce Shiga toxins or their closely related 
toxins, but ETEC do produce two other exotoxins that stimulate the intestines to 
secrete fluid and mucus.  EIEC organisms, these bacteria have the ability to penetrate the epithelial cells that line areas of the human intestines. EIEC organisms then cause many of the cells to lyse thus disrupting the fluid adsorption and secretion capacity of the intestines.  Both EAEC and EAggEC groups of bacteria, by attaching to intestinal cells, cause irritation or inflammation of the intestinal cells. This physiologic and immunologic response also disrupts adsorption and secretion in the intestines."
When should one seek medical care for enterovirulent E. coli infection?,"'Many people (the large majority) do not need to seek medical care as most of the infections are self-limiting, unless the affected individual is immunocompromised or is an undernourished child in a developing country. Because a number of patients are children; their progress in self-limiting the disease needs to be carefully watched as they can, in some instances, rapidly deteriorate. This is the situation for all the EEC groups. Most infected individuals, unless diagnosed, will not even know they are infected with EEC since many bacterial and viral diseases have similar symptoms of ''nausea'', low-grade fever, and diarrhea.''Many health care professionals suggest that affected individuals should seek medical care if:' there are signs of dehydration (for example, decreased urination, dry mucous membranes), especially in children under 5 years of age and the elderly; sustained fever over 101 F (37.7 C); presence of blood in the stool; known ingestion of E. coli 0157:H7 or contaminated food or fluid or close personal contact with individuals known to have any E. coli infection caused by a EEC group bacteria; and/or any complication of an E. coli EEC group infection (see complication section below)."
How are enterovirulent E. coli infections diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis is usually made by an accurate history, physical exam, and analysis of a fecal sample from the patient. A presumptive diagnosis is often made if the patient's history indicates an association with persons, foods, or fluids known to contain ""'E. coli'' 0157:H7 or other EEC group bacteria; such a presumptive diagnosis is often made during outbreaks of the disease. However, in patients who require hospitalization, a definitive diagnosis is usually sought.''A definitive diagnosis is often made by culture of ''E. coli'' strains from a fecal specimens on selective media (''sorbitol''-MacConkey agar) when colonies react with antiserum directed against specific ""O"" antigen strains. The selective medium and antiserum help distinguish ''E. coli'' serovars from other similar pathogens such as ''Listeria'', ''Salmonella'' and ''Shigella.'' Other tests include ''PCR'' (''polymerase chain reaction'') and immunofluorescence tests to help identify the ''E. coli'' serovar. ''The CDC has recommended (2009) that all patients being evaluated for community-acquired diarrhea have their stool samples analyzed by immunologic test systems that detect all types of Shiga toxins as this test will likely detect almost all bacteria that produce Shiga toxins, especially ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 strains. The CDC suggests that this test is even better than bacterial culture techniques, but recommends that both culture and immunologic tests should be done at the same time. This is suggested since ''E. coli'' that produces Shiga or Shiga-like toxins usually have the potential to be very damaging to the infected person(s).''In 2013, the FDA approved a new test that can detect and differentiate between eleven pathogens (bacterial and viral) that include ''Escherichia coli'' O157, enterotoxigenic ''E coli'' LT/ST, ''Salmonella'',''Shigella'', and Shiga-like toxin producing ''E coli'' stx 1/stx 2) by detecting their nucleic acids. These types of tests will help health care professionals identify and differentiate the many causes of ''gastroenteritis''.' "
How are enterovirulent E. coli infections treated?,"'Initial treatment methods are similar for all of the EEC groups; hydration is the main treatment, both oral and IV (intravenous) hydration. However, additional treatment measures may be needed. If the patient is infected with EHEC, antibiotics are not used unless the patient is septic. Studies have shown that antibiotics in the EHEC group (especially with ''E. coli'' 0157:H7) induce bacteria that produce Shiga toxin to increase toxin release and make the disease and complications worse. In addition, investigators suggest that other toxin producing ''E. coli'' serovars in other groups (EPEC, ETEC and EIEC) may not be helped by antibiotics since on some rare occasions; they can develop complications similar to those of EHEC.'""Although some cases of traveler's diarrhea have been treated with antibiotics (for example, ""'sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim'' [''Septra'']), in general, antibiotics may reduce symptoms by only about 24/48 hours. EAEC and EAggEC frequently are self-limiting and many of the serovars are resistant to one or more antibiotics. If the decision to use antibiotics in any EEC infection is made, investigators suggest the ''E. coli'' serovar causing the infection be tested to determine antibiotic susceptibilities.' "
How is self-care at home done for enterovirulent E. coli?,"'The majority of enterovirulent ''E. coli'' (EEC) infections are self-limited; they require no treatment except to keep the person well hydrated (oral hydration). This is especially the case for children and the elderly, who may quickly dehydrate during home care. If the person is unable to stay well hydrated at home, medical care should be sought. Most health care professionals warn people not to treat patients at home with any ""left-over"" antibiotics or ''over-the-counter'' ''drugs'' such as ''diphenoxylate and atropine'' (''Lomotil''), because such treatment may make the symptoms worse and cause complications (see complications section).' "
What are the complications associated with enterovirulent E. coli (EEC)?,"'All of the EEC groups may have complications associated with infection. However, some groups have far fewer and potentially less serious complications than other groups. All of the groups, however, have one potentially serious complication; dehydration. If left untreated, dehydration can lead to multiple organ damage and death. Severe dehydration happens infrequently in developed countries, but in developing countries, the death rate can reach 50% in children (ETEC). In general, in developed countries, ETEC, EAEC and EAggEC group infections have few complications develop.''A relatively frequent complication of EHEC, EPEC and EIEC is ''blood in the stool''. Some individuals will have only a small amount of blood but others may have large amounts and may require a ''blood transfusion'' (severe ''hemorrhagic diarrhea'').''However, about 10% of all persons infected with EHEC (usually ''E. coli'' 0157:H7) develop some complication. Occasionally, the complication(s) may lead to disability or death. EHEC strains (and sometimes, EIEC group organisms) may produce the serious problems listed below;' Hemorrhagic (bloody) diarrhea: This complication can prolong the disease by about a week, and cause severe abdominal pain. The individual may also develop dehydration, anemia and may need a blood transfusion. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS): This condition also prolongs the disease as it usually becomes apparent about 7 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Children under 10 years of age are the most likely to get this complication; HUS is the most common cause of kidney failure in children. The toxin produced by EHEC bacteria (mainly E. coli 0157:H7) enters the blood, causing blood cells to be damaged and small clots to form. The toxin can also lodge in the kidneys and eventually destroy kidney tissue; sometimes the damage is severe enough to cause kidney failure. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): This complication is a variation of HUS that usually occurs in the elderly. The same mechanisms as those for HUS are responsible for TTP. However, the elderly develop more clotting problems and use up more platelets resulting in easy or ""spontaneous"" bruising over the body. The elderly experience more fever and neurologic changes, in addition to kidney damage. Until the 1980's, TTP was considered a fatal disease. However, treatment with plasma exchange and infusion techniques has reduced the mortality rate (deaths) of TTP to about 10%."
How are enterovirulent E. coli (EEC) infections prevented?,"'Almost every person who gets infected with EEC has touched and eventually ingested either foods or fluids contaminated with EEC bacteria. Numerous outbreaks occur worldwide each year due to a food or fluid source contamination with these organisms; some of the most serious problems are often related to contaminated meat products by the EHEC group. However, the potential sources of EEC group infections are vast. Fortunately, there are guidelines that can help reduce the chance of getting EEC infections.''The following guidelines on preventing EHEC, especially ''E. coli'' 0157:H7, are recommended by the CDC, but they are applicable to all EEC groups:''One of the major sources of numerous outbreaks is hamburger meat contaminated with ''E. coli'' 0157:H7; such infections have been termed ""hamburger disease"". Many authors recommend that hamburgers ordered in a restaurant should be ""medium or well done,"" with no pink hamburger meat visible in the middle of the burger. Any ""pink"" hamburger meat should be cooked until brown to reduce the chance that viable ''E. coli'' are still present. ''In addition, any food or liquid involved in a recall due to possible ''E. coli'' contamination should be disposed of immediately. On August 8, 2010 about I million pounds of beef in California was recalled due to possible ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 contamination. In 2010, the FDA has recalled several productions of beef, including material put into dry pet foods due to this organism. Other FDA recalls due to EEC in 2010 included spinach and romaine lettuce.''Some researchers suggest that ''babies'' who are ''breastfed'"", especially in third world countries, may reduce the infant's exposure to EEC bacteria.""'There is controversy about the use of antibiotics to prevent EEC, some physicians suggest the use of ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan''); other physicians do not. Data to support such use of the antibiotic is not available. There are no commercially available anti-EEC ''vaccines'' available in the US, although ''vaccine'' research is ongoing.' Wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or changing diapers and before preparing or eating food. Wash hands after contact with animals or their environments (at farms, petting zoos, fairs, even your own pets in your own yard). Cook meats thoroughly. Ground beef and meat that has been needle-tenderized should be cooked to a temperature of at least 160 F (70 C). It's best to use a thermometer, as meat color is not a very reliable indicator of ""doneness."" Avoid raw milk, unpasteurized dairy products, and unpasteurized juices (like fresh apple cider). Avoid swallowing water when swimming or playing in lakes, ponds, streams, swimming pools, and backyard ""kiddie"" pools. Prevent cross contamination in food preparation areas by thoroughly washing hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils after they touch raw meat. (This recommendation is especially important for anyone who prepares and serves food to others.)"
What are the prognoses (outcomes) of enterovirulentE. coli infections?,"'Although individuals are frequently uncomfortable with EEC infections, most individuals that live in industrialized countries that get these infections have few if any serious complications. However, people that are immunocompromised and children in developing countries often have complications. Some countries report a death rate in children as high as 50%, with dehydration playing a central role in these deaths due to EEC bacteria. People infected with strains that are highly virulent like ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 are at risk for complications and a less favorable prognosis.''People with EHEC group infections (''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is the major serotype) usually (about 90%) have a self-limited disease and the outcome is excellent. However, the prognosis declines, depending on the development of complication(s). Good hydration decreases the chances of complications and improves the outcome. Individuals who develop ''hemorrhagic diarrhea'' and are treated promptly have better outcomes with reduced hospitalization. Complications such as HUS and TTP have a wide range of prognosis from good to poor, depending on the overall health of the individual and how quickly the complications are diagnosed and treated. For example, some individuals can recover completely, but others may require IV fluids, plasma exchange, plasma infusion, or ''dialysis'' and may have end-organ failure (usually ''kidney failure'') and neurologic problems. A few (about 10%) of TTP patients will die.''Although infrequent, even relatively healthy children and adults have died from EEC infections due to dehydration.' "
EEG Introduction,"'An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that can help diagnose ''epilepsy'"". During an EEG, the electrical signals of the brain are recorded. This electrical activity is detected by electrodes, or sensors, placed on the patient's ""'scalp'' and transmitted to a polygraph that records the activity.''Electrical signals produced by the brain neurons are picked up by the electrodes and transmitted to a polygraph, where they produce separate graphs on moving paper using an ink writing pen or on a computer screen.' "
How Do I Prepare For an EEG?,"'To prepare for your EEG you should:''Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor prior to your procedure.''Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use hair cream, oils, or spray afterward.' "
What Happens During the EEG?,"'During an EEG, you lie down on the examining table or bed while about 20 electrodes are attached to your scalp. You are asked to relax and lie first with your eyes open, then later with them closed. You may be asked to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light -- both of these activities produce changes in the brain-wave patterns. If you are prone to ''seizures'', it is rare that you may experience one during the test. If you are being evaluated for a ''sleep'' disorder, EEG may be performed continuously during the night while you are asleep. Such a recording, which may involve an evaluation of other body functions during ''sleep'', such as ''respiration'' and pulse, is referred to as polysomnography.' "
What Happens After an EEG?,"'When the EEG is done, the electrodes are removed and the glue that held them in place is washed away with acetone. You may have to use additional acetone at home to completely remove the glue. Unless you are actively having ''seizures'' or are restricted by your doctor, you may drive home. If the EEG was performed overnight, you should arrange to have someone drive you home. If you stopped taking anticonvulsant ''drugs'' for the EEG, you can usually start taking them again.''A ''neurologist'' examines the EEG recording for abnormalities in the brain-wave pattern, which may reflect diseases of the nervous system.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is pleural effusion?,"'''A ''pleural effusion'' is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space, an area between the layers of tissue that line the ''lungs'' and the chest wall. It may also be referred to as effusion or pulmonary effusion. The type of fluid that forms a ''pleural effusion'' may be categorized as either ''transudate'' or ''exudate''.' Transudate is usually composed of ultrafiltrates of plasma due to an imbalance in vascular hydrostatic and oncotic forces in the chest (heart failure, cirrhosis). Exudate is typically produced by inflammatory conditions (lung infection, lung cancer). Exudative pleural effusions are usually more serious and difficult to treat."
What causes pleural effusion?,"'There are many causes of pleural effusions. The following is a list of some of the major causes:''The development of a pleural effusion occurs from fluid seeping into the pleural space, a thin area between the visceral and pleural membranes in the chest ''cavity'', which normally contains a small amount of fluid to facilitate smooth lung movement. Fluid under pressure, ''malignant'' cells, and infectious agents can occasionally enter the pleural ''cavity'' and cause it to expand with abnormal amounts of fluid and other compounds (see diagnosis section).'   Congestive heart failure Kidney failure Infection Malignancy Pulmonary embolism Hypoalbuminemia Cirrhosis Lung cancer Trauma"
What are the risk factors for pleural effusion?,"'Pleural effusions are caused by the underlying medical problems listed previously, therefore the presence of any of these medical problems are risk factors for the development of pleural effusions. It is important to note, however, that not all individuals with these medical problems will develop pleural effusions. ''Congestive heart failure'' is the most common cause of ''transudative ''pleural effusions, while infection (''pneumonia'') and malignancy are the most common causes of ''exudative ''pleural effusions.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of pleural effusion?,"'Common symptoms associated with pleural effusion may include the following:''Deep breathing typically increases the ''pain''. Symptoms of ''fever'', ''chills'', and ''loss of appetite'' often accompany pleural effusions caused by infectious agents.'   chest pain, difficulty breathing, painful breathing (pleurisy), and cough (either a dry cough or a productive cough)."
What procedures and tests diagnose pleural effusions?,"""The patient's history and physical exam may indicate a presumptive diagnose of pleural effusion. For example, a patient with a history of congestive ""'heart failure'' or ''cirrhosis'' with symptoms of ''cough'', difficulty breathing, and pleuritic ''chest pain'' may have a pleural effusion. Findings from the physical exam, such as dullness to percussion of the lung area (when tapping the area of the lung with a finger, the percussion or sound is dull -- if no fluid exists in the area the sound will be lighter), decreased vibration (decreased tactile fremitus), and asymmetrical chest expansion (the ''lungs'' do not inflate or deflate equally) may also be evidence of a pleural effusion. Other physical exam findings detected with a stethoscope may include reduced or inaudible breath sounds on the affected side, egophony (patient voices the letter ""e,"" but when listening [auscultation] it sounds like ""a""), and a friction rub (if there is fluid in the pleural area, the ''heart'' will rub against the inflamed or fluid-filled space).''Chest X-ray'' can detect pleural effusions, as they usually appear as whitish areas at the lung base, and they may occur on only one side (unilateral) or on both sides (bilateral). If a person lies on their side for a few minutes, most pleural effusions will move and layer out along that side of the chest cavity which is positioned downward (because of the effects of gravity). This movement of the pleural effusion can be seen on a ''chest X-ray'' taken with the person lying on their side (a lateral decubitus X-ray).''Other imaging tests, such as ''CT scan'', may be ordered to further identify the possible cause and the extent of the pleural effusion.''Diagnosing the cause(s) of a pleural effusion often begins with determining whether the fluid is transudate or exudate. This is important because the results of this fluid analysis may provide a diagnosis and determine the course of treatment. Thoracentesis (a procedure to remove the fluid from the pleural space) followed by laboratory analysis of the fluid can differentiate between transudate and exudate. The results from the fluid obtained from the thoracentesis are compared to certain blood tests (for example, LDH, glucose, protein, pH, ''cholesterol'' and others). Additional testing of the pleural fluid may also include a cell count, cytology, and cultures. Criteria are then used to differentiate exudate from transudate. Exudative effusions have the following characteristics:''Other health care professionals may use different criteria to determine the presence of exudate, such as the ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein levels > 0.5, LDH ratio > 0.6 and LDH ratio > 2/3 the upper limits of normal. Other pleural fluid analysis test results (cytology or amylase, for example) may also reveal the source of the effusion.' Pleural fluid LDH > 0.45 of the upper limits of normal blood values Pleural fluid protein level > 2.9g/dL Pleural fluid cholesterol level > 45mg/dL"
What is the treatment for pleural effusion?,"'Small transudative effusions may require no treatment, while larger ones and most exudative pleural effusions require treatment. The initial treatment of choice is drainage of the pleural fluid. This is done by thoracentesis (this procedure may be both diagnostic and therapeutic), where a chest tube is inserted into the effusion, and the effusion is drained out. This procedure needs monitoring, and in some instances, the tube may need to remain in the pleural space for a longer period of time for continued drainage. The need for repeated thoracentesis varies from patient to patient depending on the underlying cause, the amount of effusion fluid, the type of effusion (thick, thin, ''malignant'', or infectious, for example) and if there is recurrence of the pleural effusion.''Some pleural effusions (mainly exudative) may require surgery to break up adhesions, while others may require pleurodesis (pleural sclerosis), a procedure whereby different irritant substances or medications are inserted into the pleural space in order to fibrose and ''scar'' the visceral and pleural surfaces together. This procedure seals the pleural space so that pleural effusions have difficulty reaccumulating.''The use of medications for pleural effusions depends on the underlying cause. Antibiotics are used when there is an infectious cause, whereby diuretics such as ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') may be used to slowly help reduce the size of the pleural effusion.'  "
What are the complications of pleural effusion?,"'The potential complications associated with pleural effusion are:'   lung scarring, pneumothorax (collapse of the lung) as a complication of thoracentesis, empyema (a collection of pus within the pleural space), and sepsis (blood infection) sometimes leading to death."
Can you prevent a pleural effusion?," The development of pleural effusions may sometimes be prevented by the early treatment of the underlying causes listed above. However, in certain cases, the development of pleural effusions may not be preventable. Some pleural effusions may be prevented from reoccurring by having individuals undergo pleurodesis, a procedure that seals up the pleural space."
What is upper endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to examine the ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope with a camera on the tip through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.'  "
How do I prepare for endoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's ""'allergies''. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.'  "
Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.' "
What is an electrogastrogram?,"'An electrogastrogram is similar to an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') of the ''heart'"".  It is a recording of the electrical signals that travel through the muscles of the stomach and control the muscles' contraction."" "
When is an electrogastrogram used?,"'An electrogastrogram is used when there is a suspicion that the muscles of the stomach or the nerves controlling those muscles are not working normally. Usually this suspicion arises when there is a problem with recurrent ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'"", signs that the stomach is not emptying food normally. If the electrogastrogram is abnormal, it confirms that the problem probably is with the stomach's muscles or the nerves that control the muscles. The electrogastrogram can be considered an experimental procedure since its exact role in the diagnosis of diseases of the stomach has not been defined yet."" "
How is an electrogastrogram done?,"""For an electrogastrogram, several electrodes are taped onto the abdomen over the stomach in the same manner as electrodes are placed on the chest for an electrocardiogram. The electrodes sense the electrical signals coming from the stomach's muscles, and the signals are recorded on a computer for analysis. Recordings are made both fasting and after a meal with the patient lying quietly. The study takes two or three hours."" "
How are the results of the electrogastrogram evaluated?,"'In normal individuals there is a regular electrical rhythm generated by the muscles of the stomach--just as in the heart--and the power (voltage) of the electrical current increases after the meal.  In patients with abnormalities of the muscles or nerves of the stomach, the rhythm often is irregular or there is no post-meal increase in electrical power.' "
Are there any side effects of an electrogastrogram?,'There are no side effects.  The study is painless.' 
Are there alternatives to the electrogastrogram?,"'No, there are no alternatives to this study. Other studies, however, for example, antro-duodenal motility studies or gastric emptying studies may give additional information since abnormal electrical activity of the stomach often results in abnormal muscular activity and reduced or delayed emptying of food from the stomach.' "
Facts you should know about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome," Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of disorders which share common features including easy bruising, joint hypermobility (loose joints), skin that stretches easily (skin hyperelasticity or laxity), and weakness of tissues. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are inherited in the genes that are passed from parents to offspring. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes symptoms and signs are joints that are more flexible than normal and loose skin that stretches away from the body. The diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is based upon the clinical findings of the patient and the family history. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are treated according to the particular manifestations present in a given individual."
What is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?,"'Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of disorders which share common features including ''easy bruising'', joint hypermobility (loose joints), skin that stretches easily (skin hyperelasticity or laxity), and weakness of tissues.''The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are inherited in the genes that are passed from parents to offspring. They are categorized according to the form of genetic transmission into different types with many features differing between patients in any given type. The fragile skin and loose joints is often a result of abnormal genes that produce abnormal proteins that confer an inherited frailty of collagen (the normal protein ""glue"" of our tissues).''In 2001, researchers discovered a new form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that is caused by an inherited abnormality in a protein other than collagen that also normally plays a role in binding together the cells of our tissues (including the skin, tendons, muscle, and blood vessels). Abnormalities in this protein, called tenascin, also lead to a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Researchers suspect that tenascin could play a role in regulating the normal distribution of collagen in the connective tissues of the body.'  "
What are the types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes?,"'In this form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, spontaneous rupture of arteries and bowel is a serious manifestation that can lead to death.''Other rare variant types have been reported in single families.'   Marked joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility (laxity), and fragility are characteristic of the classic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The smooth, velvety skin is fragile and tears or bruises easily with minor trauma. Joint dislocations and scoliosis are common. Joint instability can lead to sprains and strains. This classical type is inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait (directly passed on from one parent to child). Joint hypermobility is the major manifestation of this form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Any joint can be affected, and dislocations are frequent. This type is also inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. Clubfoot can be present at birth. Skin laxity is of varying degrees. Veins can be very visible through the skin. It is primarily inherited as an autosomal dominant (directly passed on from one parent to child) genetic trait, but recessive (not seen in family members or only in one generation of members of the same family, meaning that an individual must inherit two copies of the mutation, one from each parent) trait inheritance has been described. Fragile globe of the eyes, significant skin and joint laxity, and severe curvature of the spine (scoliosis) are typical features. Its inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. Patients are short in height and severely affected by joint laxity and dislocations. Skin involvement is variable. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance is possible. A skin biopsy can be used to diagnose this disorder. Patients have severely fragile skin that is soft and doughy with sagging and folding. This rare form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy. Joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, and fragile tissue are seen.

The most common myths,"'So much wrong information about ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'') gets passed around that it’s no surprise the diseases do too.\xa0''Myth 1:'' You do not need treatment for ''chlamydia'' as it goes away on its own.''Fact:'' It is highly unlikely for ''chlamydia'' to go away on its own. Although the symptoms may subside temporarily, the infection persists in the body in the absence of treatment (subclinical infection). The body’s immunity cannot destroy ''chlamydia'' infection. It is important to seek diagnosis and timely treatment to get rid of the infection.''If treatment is not sought, chlamydia can lead to serious complications such as:''Myth 2'': You can get chlamydia from a toilet seat''Fact:'' ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', the bacteria that causes chlamydia infection, cannot survive outside the ''human body''. Thus, you cannot get chlamydia from a toilet seat. Chlamydia can also not be transmitted through other means of casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or by sharing towels, bed linen, ''swimming'' pools, or cutlery.''Myth 3'': Once you get cured for chlamydia you cannot be re-infected''Fact'"": Once cured, it is possible to be re-infected with chlamydia since you won’t be immune after the infection. Once you have had chlamydia if you don't protect yourself by following practices such as the use of latex male ""'condoms'' you have chances of getting re-infected. These condoms, when used consistently and correctly, can reduce the risk of getting or giving chlamydia.\xa0You must be re-tested about three months after you are treated, even if your sex partner(s) got treated for chlamydia.''Myth 4'': You should share your chlamydia medications with your partner''Fact'': You must not share medications for chlamydia with anyone, not even your partner. Chlamydia is curable with the right treatment. Testing and treatment is the best approach to get rid of chlamydia and prevent complications. You need to take all of the medication prescribed by your doctor to cure the infection.''Myth 5:'' You can get chlamydia by coming in contact with a freshly infected droplet in a swimming pool''Fact:'' Merely coming in contact with the droplet just because it touched your skin or buttocks is not sufficient for you to get the infection. The bacteria need to come in contact with suitable body tissue such as the cervix, urethra, or ''cornea'' of the eye to survive.''Myth 6:'' You cannot get chlamydia through oral or anal sex''Fact:'' Almost all the sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) including chlamydia can be transmitted through vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Thus, even gay, bisexual, and other men who may have sex with men can get the infection as chlamydia can spread through oral and anal sex. Using condoms and dental dams can help prevent the infection.''Myth 7:'' You cannot get chlamydia if you had sex only once''Fact:'' you are at risk of chlamydia infection even if you had sex only once. If your partner was infected you can get the infection too.\xa0''Myth 8:'' You cannot get chlamydia from your partner if they do not have any symptoms''Fact:'' Many times you won’t know if your partner is infected with chlamydia. ''Symptoms of chlamydia'' infection often go unnoticed. Some people experience symptoms within a few weeks of exposure (unprotected sex) while for others symptoms may take months to appear. Sometimes the symptoms disappear on their own but the infection persists (subclinical chlamydia)' Pelvic inflammatory diseases or PID (infection of a woman’s uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes) Infertility  Fitz-Hugh-Curtis Syndrome (inflammation of the liver capsule and surrounding tissue) Untreated chlamydia in pregnant women can cause serious consequences such as pre-term delivery (delivery before 37 weeks of pregnancy) and ophthalmia neonatorum (conjunctivitis) and pneumonia in the newborn. Reactive arthritis (joint inflammation) may develop in men and women following chlamydial infection.  Males have lesser health conditions linked to chlamydia as compared to females. Chlamydia infection can sometimes spread to the tube that carries sperm from the testicles, causing pain and fever. Rarely, chlamydia can cause infertility in males. Infection with chlamydia can increase the chances of infection with other STDs like HIV"

What are the limitations of the ECG (EKG)?," The EKG is a static picture and may not reflect severe underlying heart problems at a time when the patient is not having any symptoms. The most common example of this is in a patient with a history of intermittent chest pain due to severe underlying coronary artery disease. This patient may have an entirely normal EKG at a time when he or she is not experiencing any symptoms. In such instances, the EKG as recorded during an exercise stress test may reflect an underlying abnormality while the EKG taken at rest may be normal. Many abnormal patterns on an EKG may be nonspecific, meaning that they may be observed with a variety of different conditions. They may even be a normal variant and not reflect any abnormality at all. These conditions can often be sorted out by a physician with a detailed examination, and occasionally other cardiac tests (for example, echocardiogram, exercise stress test). In some instances, the EKG may be entirely normal despite the presence of an underlying cardiac condition that normally would be reflected in the EKG. The reasons for this are largely unknown, but it is important to remember that a normal EKG does not necessarily preclude the possibility of underlying heart disease. Furthermore, a patient with heart symptoms can frequently require additional evaluation and testing."

"What is the design of the elbow, and what is its function?","'The elbow is the joint where three long bones meet in the middle portion of the arm. The bone of the upper arm (humerus) meets the inner bone of the forearm (ulna) and the outer bone of the forearm (radius) to form a hinge joint. The radius and ulna also meet in the elbow to allow for rotation of the forearm. The elbow functions to move the arm like a hinge (forward and backward) and in rotation (twisting outward and inward). The biceps muscle is the major muscle that flexes the elbow hinge. The triceps muscle is the major muscle that extends the elbow hinge. The outer bone of the elbow is referred to as the lateral epicondyle and is a part of the humerus bone. Tendons are attached to this area which can be injured, causing inflammation or tendinitis (''lateral epicondylitis'', or ""''tennis elbow''""). The inner portion of the elbow is a bony prominence called the medial epicondyle. Additional tendons from the muscles attach here and can be injured, causing medial epicondylitis, ""golfer\'s elbow."" A fluid-filled sac (bursa), which serves to reduce friction, overlies the tip of the elbow (olecranon bursa). The elbow can be affected by inflammation of the tendons or the bursae (plural for bursa) or conditions that affect the bones and joints, such as ''fractures'', ''arthritis'', or nerve irritation. ''Joint pain'' in the elbow can result from injury or disease involving any of these structures.'  "
What injuries can cause elbow pain? What signs and symptoms may be associated with elbow pain?,"'Olecranon ''bursitis'' (inflammation of the bursa at the tip of the elbow) can occur from injury or minor ''trauma'' as a result of systemic diseases such as ''gout'' or ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or it can be due to a local infection. Olecranon bursitis is typically associated with swelling over the tip of the elbow, while range of motion of the inner elbow joint is maintained.''The bones of the elbow can break (''fracture'') into the elbow joint or adjacent to the elbow joint. Typically, elbow fracture causes sharp pain in the elbow, and X-ray imaging is used to make a diagnosis. Fractures generally require immobilization and casts and can require orthopedic surgery, involving pinning or open joint procedures.''A sprain is a stretch or tear injury to a ligament. One or more ligaments can be injured during a sprain. This might occur when the elbow is hyperextended or simply jammed, such as in a ""stiffarm"" collision. The severity of the injury will depend on the extent of injury to a single ligament (whether the tear is partial or complete) and the number of ligaments involved. Treatment involves rest, ice, immobilization, compression, and anti-inflammation medications.'   Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow): The lateral epicondyle is the outside bony portion of the elbow where large tendons attach to the elbow from the muscles of the forearm. These tendons can be injured, especially with repetitive motions of the forearm, such as using a manual screwdriver, washing windows, or hitting a backhand in tennis play. Tennis elbow then leads to inflammation of the tendons, causing pain over the outside of the elbow, occasionally with warmth and swelling but always with local tenderness. The elbow maintains its full range of motion, as the inner joint is not affected, and the pain can be particularly noticed toward the end of the day. Repeated twisting motions or activities that strain the tendon typically elicit increased pain. These include lifting and throwing. X-rays are usually normal, but if chronic tendinitis has occurred, X-rays can reveal calcium deposits in the tendon or reveal other unforeseen abnormalities of the elbow joint.The treatment of lateral epicondylitis may include ice packs, resting the involved elbow, and anti-inflammatory medications. Anti-inflammatory medications typically used include aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen (Naprosyn), diclofenac (Voltaren), and ibuprofen (Motrin). Bracing the elbow can help. Simple braces for tennis elbow can be found in community pharmacies and athletic goods stores. Local cortisone injections are given for persistent pain. Activity involving the elbow is resumed gradually. Ice application after activity can reduce or prevent recurrent inflammation. Occasionally, supportive straps can prevent reinjury. In severe cases, an orthopedic surgical repair is performed. Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow): Medial epicondylitis is inflammation at the point where the tendons of the forearm attach to the bony prominence of the inner elbow. As an example, this tendon can become strained in a golf swing, but many other repetitive motions can injure the tendon. Golfer's elbow is characterized by local pain and tenderness over the inner elbow. The range of motion of the elbow is preserved because the inner joint of the elbow is not affected. Those activities which require twisting or straining the forearm tendon can elicit pain and worsen the condition. X-rays for epicondylitis are usually normal but can indicate calcifications of the tendons if the tendinitis has persisted for extended periods of time.The usual treatment involves combinations of ice packs, resting the elbow, and medications including aspirin and other NSAIDs. With severe inflammation, local corticosteroid (cortisone) injections are sometimes given. Using a strap can prevent reinjury. After a gradual rehabilitation exercise program, return to usual activity is best accompanied by ice applications after use. This helps to avoid recurrent inflammation."
What are diseases and conditions that can cause elbow pain?,"'Inflammation of the elbow joint (arthritis) can occur as a result of many systemic forms of arthritis, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''osteoarthritis'', ''gouty arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', and ''reactive arthritis'"" (formerly called Reiter's disease). Generally, they are associated with signs of inflammation of the elbow joint, including heat, warmth, swelling, pain, tenderness, and decreased range of motion. Range of motion of the elbow is decreased with arthritis of the elbow because the swollen joint impedes the range of motion.""'Inflammation of the skin related to infection (''cellulitis'') commonly occurs as a result of abrasions of the skin. When abrasions or ''puncture wounds'' occur, bacteria on the surface of the skin can invade the deeper layers of the skin. This causes inflamed skin characterized by redness, warmth, and swelling. The most common bacteria that cause cellulitis include '' ''Staphylococcus'' and '' ''Streptococcus''. Patients can have an associated low-grade ''fever''. Cellulitis generally requires antibiotic treatment, either orally or intravenously. Heat application can help in the healing process. Cellulitis can lead to infection of the olecranon bursa, causing olecranon bursitis, as described above.''Infection of the elbow joint with bacteria (''septic arthritis'') is uncommon. It is most often seen in patients with suppressed immune systems or ''diabetes'', those taking cortisone medications, or intravenous drug abusers. The most common bacteria that cause infection of the elbow joint are ''Staphylococcus'' and ''Streptococcus''. Septic arthritis of the elbow requires antibiotic treatment and often surgical drainage. It is characterized by heat, swelling, redness, and pain, with limited range of motion of the elbow joint. Septic arthritis is often associated with ''fever'', sweats, and ''chills''.''Osteochondritis dissecans'' is an uncommon disease of cartilage in the joint whereby the cartilage effectively flakes away from the bone. This can lead to locking, pain, and loss of range of motion of the elbow. Osteochondritis dissecans is diagnosed by ''MRI'' scan or contrast ''CT scan'' imaging of the involved elbow joint. This is generally treated by arthroscopic surgical repair and removal of the diseased cartilage.''Bone tumors of the elbow joint are rare. Primary ''bone cancer'' can occur. It can be painless or associated with pain in the elbow joint. It is usually detectable by X-ray testing. Nuclear medicine bone scanning can also be helpful for detection.''The ulnar nerve is the ""funny bone"" nerve which travels between the tip of the elbow and the inner elbow bone. At this site it can be ""pinched"" by normal structures or swollen structures after injury. This pinching is referred to as entrapment. When ulnar ''nerve entrapment'' occurs, numbness and tingling of the little and ring finger of the hand may be felt. Pain may occur in the entire forearm, usually the inner side. Hand dexterity can be affected. Sometimes, the numbness is reproduced by elevating the hand. Treatment consists of avoiding repeated trauma or pressure to the elbow area and resting the elbow joint. Occasionally, ice can help. In severe cases, surgical repositioning of the ulnar nerve can be required. This relocates the ulnar nerve to a position where it will not be continually compressed by the surrounding structures.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose elbow pain?,"'Elbow pain'' is most commonly diagnosed simply with a review of the history and physical examination. Most causes of elbow pain require no further testing. As described above, for some diseases, further testing can include X-ray examination, MRI scanning, arthrogram testing, and aspiration of fluid from the involved elbow area.' "
What are treatments for elbow pain?,"'The treatment for elbow pain depends on the precise cause of the pain. Treatments for simple inflammation can include immobilization, anti-inflammatory medications, and ''cold'' application. Treatments for fracture include casting and surgical repair. Treatments for infection include drainage and antibiotics.' "

What is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)? What is the history of ECT? Why is electroconvulsive therapy controversial?,"'Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a non-medication medical treatment that addresses severe psychiatric symptoms, after trials of medications and ''psychotherapy'' have been unsuccessful or a ''mental health'"" disorder is determined to be severe and acute enough to warrant this intervention. During this brain stimulation procedure, a health care professional passes an electric current through the patient's brain to produce controlled convulsions (""'seizures'') while the person is sedated using general anesthesia. This device is often used in a hospital but can be done on an outpatient basis (the individual receiving the treatment does not stay overnight in a mental hospital or medical hospital).''Formerly called electroshock therapy or ''shock'' therapy, ECT is a form of mental health therapy that can be a life-saving treatment for people with some severe mental illnesses. It was based on a procedure in which ''seizures'' were chemically induced in patients using a ''heart'' medication (Metrazol). Health care professionals first performed the procedure in 1934 in Hungary to treat ''schizophrenia'"". In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti delivered electrical currents directly to a person's brain to induce seizures to treat ""'schizophrenia'' for the first time. By 1940, psychiatrists were using ECT in the United States. The U.S. military often used ECT during World War II, after which it became widely used in American and European psychiatric hospitals. It was in the late 1940s that doctors started placing electrodes on one side of the brain (unilaterally) rather than both sides (bilaterally), which resulted in less side effects like ''memory loss'' or speech problems.''Despite those advances, ECT fell out of favor for at least a generation in psychiatry, starting in the 1960s. Rather than the popularity of psychoanalysis or the rise of medication treatments from pharmaceutical companies, it is thought that in addition to the significant adverse effects on memory and personality that bilateral ECT treatment caused, a cultural bias against psychiatry in general and against ECT specifically is the reason that this highly effective medical treatment became controversial. Novels like ''Asylum'' in 1961 and '""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""' in 1962, as well as the film based on the latter novel, released in 1975, are thought to have fueled some of that backlash by emphasizing the worst characterization of this treatment as shock therapy. The anti-psychiatry stance of groups like the Church of Scientology is also thought to have contributed to the stigma that mental health treatments, particularly ECT, incurred during that period.''Appreciation of the effectiveness of ECT started regaining ground in psychiatry during the mid-1980s with the publication of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Conference on Electroconvulsive Therapy, published in the ''Journal of the American Medical Association'' (''JAMA''), which documented how well this medical treatment improves symptoms of ''depression''. By the mid-1990s, several guidelines for conducting ECT were published, providing predictability, standardizing, and thus credibility of this brain stimulation therapy in providing care for severe mental health disorders.' "
"Why do physicians perform electroconvulsive therapy? What types of 
health care professionals administer electroconvulsive therapy?","'ECT is quite useful in psychiatry for the care of certain patients with significant ''depression'', particularly for those who cannot take or are not responding to ''antidepressants'', suffer from severe ''depression'', or are at a high risk for ''suicide''. ECT often is effective in cases where ''antidepressant'' medications and psychotherapy do not provide sufficient relief of symptoms. Physicians often consider if a treatment known as magnetic stimulation therapy is ineffective. The effectiveness of this medical treatment has been shown for the depressive symptoms of both major depressive (unipolar) and ''manic''-depressive (bipolar) disorders. Studies also show it to be a sound treatment in the care of people who suffer from ''mania'', psychosis in the form of ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', schizophreniform disorder, and any severe decrease in movement and speech (''catatonia''). ECT is an effective treatment for people of a wide range of ages, from children and adolescents to elderly patients.''Availability of psychiatric hospitals that conduct this mental health treatment seems to be lower for ethnic minorities compared to Caucasians in the United States, and therefore minorities are less likely to receive this clinical intervention. Beyond what could be explained by age, socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, or by severity of the ''mental illness'' (severe ''major depression'' or ''bipolar disorder'') of the patient, African Americans tend to receive this therapy less often than Caucasians in the United States. Worldwide, while older women with symptoms of ''depression'' tend to be the most frequent recipients of ECT in western countries, younger men with schizophrenia make up the group most often receiving this therapy in Asian countries.'""Given the need for the ECT recipient to receive general anesthesia, medical professionals, usually psychiatrists, administer this medical therapy. Prior to starting a course of this medical intervention, the medical team will consult the patient's primary care doctor in order to determine that the person is physically able to receive the anesthetic and undergo ECT. Physicians, primarily psychiatrists, usually perform this therapy, assisted by an anesthesiologist and nurse, as well as a physician assistant and/or nurse practitioner to assure the safety and comfort of the patient by providing ongoing medical assessment and care.""

How does it treat depression and other illnesses?,"""This procedure works by triggering a massive neurochemical release in the patient's brain due to a controlled ""'seizure''. Research also raises the possibility that the seizures induced by ECT result in the generation of more neurons in the brain (neurogenesis). It is highly effective, in that the American Psychiatric Association describes it as being effective in about 80% of people with the potentially life-threatening mental illnesses previously described, often in people whose depression or other mental health symptoms have failed to respond to other treatments, like medicines and psychotherapy. ECT relieves symptoms of depression within one to two weeks after beginning treatments. After a course of ECT, some patients will continue to have maintenance ECT, while others will return to or continue antidepressant or other psychiatric medications to maintain their mental health on a long-term basis.' "
How do doctors perform electroconvulsive therapy today? What are the side effects of ECT? Why does ECT cause memory loss?,"'In recent years, the technique of ECT has improved. A psychiatrist usually performs this mental health treatment in a hospital, with muscle relaxant medicine and under anesthesia so that people receiving this procedure do not feel ''pain'"" or discomfort. In addition to having the person's ""'breathing'', temperature, heart functioning, and ''blood pressure'' monitored during the procedure, the doctor will monitor for the desired presence of ''seizure'' activity in the brain using an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), since seizure activity is not always physically visible. Most patients undergo six to 10 treatments. A physician places electrodes on the ''scalp'', usually on just one side of the brain (unilaterally). Then, the device passes an electrical current through the brain to cause a controlled seizure, which typically lasts for 20 to 90 seconds. A person usually needs six to 12 treatments for this medical therapy to be effective. The patient is awake in five to 10 minutes.''The most common side effects of ECT include brief ''confusion'' immediately after the procedure, as well as a temporary loss of ''short-term memory'', which usually resolves within about six weeks. While placing electrodes on both sides of the brain (bilaterally) is thought to be more effective than unilateral placement, ''memory loss'' tends to worsen, even to the level of ''brain damage'' with bilateral treatment. Other side effects may include ''headache'', high or ''low blood pressure'', rapid heartbeat, ''nausea'', and sore muscles, although the muscle relaxant given to the ECT recipient decreases the frequency and severity of muscle soreness. This mental health therapy usually can be done safely as an outpatient procedure as long as someone transports the recipient.'  "
What does ECT cost?,"'The cost to the consumer for ECT varies depending on if the person has health insurance, if the insurance covers this procedure, and to what extent. The cost of each ECT session is about $2,500, for a total of $25,000 for the 10 sessions an average course of treatment entails. That does not include the cost of a hospital stay if necessary.'  "

EEG Introduction,"'An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that can help diagnose ''epilepsy'"". During an EEG, the electrical signals of the brain are recorded. This electrical activity is detected by electrodes, or sensors, placed on the patient's ""'scalp'' and transmitted to a polygraph that records the activity.''Electrical signals produced by the brain neurons are picked up by the electrodes and transmitted to a polygraph, where they produce separate graphs on moving paper using an ink writing pen or on a computer screen.' "
How Do I Prepare For an EEG?,"'To prepare for your EEG you should:''Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor prior to your procedure.''Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use hair cream, oils, or spray afterward.' "
What Happens During the EEG?,"'During an EEG, you lie down on the examining table or bed while about 20 electrodes are attached to your scalp. You are asked to relax and lie first with your eyes open, then later with them closed. You may be asked to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light -- both of these activities produce changes in the brain-wave patterns. If you are prone to ''seizures'', it is rare that you may experience one during the test. If you are being evaluated for a ''sleep'' disorder, EEG may be performed continuously during the night while you are asleep. Such a recording, which may involve an evaluation of other body functions during ''sleep'', such as ''respiration'' and pulse, is referred to as polysomnography.' "
What Happens After an EEG?,"'When the EEG is done, the electrodes are removed and the glue that held them in place is washed away with acetone. You may have to use additional acetone at home to completely remove the glue. Unless you are actively having ''seizures'' or are restricted by your doctor, you may drive home. If the EEG was performed overnight, you should arrange to have someone drive you home. If you stopped taking anticonvulsant ''drugs'' for the EEG, you can usually start taking them again.''A ''neurologist'' examines the EEG recording for abnormalities in the brain-wave pattern, which may reflect diseases of the nervous system.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is an electrogastrogram?,"'An electrogastrogram is similar to an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') of the ''heart'"".  It is a recording of the electrical signals that travel through the muscles of the stomach and control the muscles' contraction."" "
When is an electrogastrogram used?,"'An electrogastrogram is used when there is a suspicion that the muscles of the stomach or the nerves controlling those muscles are not working normally. Usually this suspicion arises when there is a problem with recurrent ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'"", signs that the stomach is not emptying food normally. If the electrogastrogram is abnormal, it confirms that the problem probably is with the stomach's muscles or the nerves that control the muscles. The electrogastrogram can be considered an experimental procedure since its exact role in the diagnosis of diseases of the stomach has not been defined yet."" "
How is an electrogastrogram done?,"""For an electrogastrogram, several electrodes are taped onto the abdomen over the stomach in the same manner as electrodes are placed on the chest for an electrocardiogram. The electrodes sense the electrical signals coming from the stomach's muscles, and the signals are recorded on a computer for analysis. Recordings are made both fasting and after a meal with the patient lying quietly. The study takes two or three hours."" "
How are the results of the electrogastrogram evaluated?,"'In normal individuals there is a regular electrical rhythm generated by the muscles of the stomach--just as in the heart--and the power (voltage) of the electrical current increases after the meal.  In patients with abnormalities of the muscles or nerves of the stomach, the rhythm often is irregular or there is no post-meal increase in electrical power.' "
Are there any side effects of an electrogastrogram?,'There are no side effects.  The study is painless.' 
Are there alternatives to the electrogastrogram?,"'No, there are no alternatives to this study. Other studies, however, for example, antro-duodenal motility studies or gastric emptying studies may give additional information since abnormal electrical activity of the stomach often results in abnormal muscular activity and reduced or delayed emptying of food from the stomach.' "
What Causes Unwanted Hair Growth?,"'Hair growth is the result of heredity and hormonal levels. Also, some ''drugs'',temporary methods of ''hair removal'', and some illnesses can stimulate hairgrowth. Usually, hair growth is desirable. But when the hair is the wrong partof your ''body -- a'"" woman's upper lip or chin or bikini line, for ""'example -- you'' may beconsidering electrolysis.' "
How Many Electrolysis Treatments Will I Need?,"'Since many factors influence hair growth, you will need to return forseveral electrolysis visits. The total number of sessions needed to remove hair permanentlyfrom a particular area will vary from person to person. Most clients returnonce a week or every other week, as necessary. But the unwanted hair will begone forever once the series of treatments have been completed. Each treatmentlasts between 15 minutes and one hour.' "
Myths About Electrolysis,"'Electrolysis is painful. The truth is, electrolysis usually does not causemuch discomfort. Modern electrolysis methods have reduced the discomfort to amere tingling. A topical anesthetic may be used in some cases.''The electric tweezer method is permanent. The truth is, the Food and DrugAdministration and the American Medical Association recognize only electrolysisas a permanent method of removing hair. In fact, some states prohibit those whouse the electric ''tweezer -- which'' can also be purchased for consumer ''use -- from''claiming it provides permanent hair removal.''Temporary methods of hair removal can be better. Chemicaldepilatories (liquids or creams) are often used to remove body hair. Theseproducts contain irritating chemicals, and can be time-consuming and messy.Likewise, bleaches contain harsh chemicals and do little to disguise dark hair.They may also discolor the skin. Waxing is another temporary method of hairremoval and is usually done in salons. A hot wax is applied to the skin andremoved once it has dried over the hair. The hair is stripped off when the waxis removed. Waxing can be painful and costly. Home waxing kits are available,but they can be difficult to use and messy. There are electrical electrolysisdevices available for home use that try to copy the devices used byprofessionals. These devices are often unsafe for use by anyone who is nottrained in electrolysis.' "
Facts About Electrolysis," Electrolysis is a time-tested method that was invented more than 100 years
ago to remove irritating, in-grown eyelash hairs. Most areas of the body can be
treated with electrolysis, including the eyebrows, face, thighs, abdomen,
breasts, and legs. There are no permanent side effects. Sometimes, a slight reddening of the
skin occurs during or immediately after treatment, but this will only last for
a short time. Electrolysis is very safe and, unlike depilatories or bleaches,
no harsh chemicals are used."
How Do I Choose an Electrologist?,"'Electrologists are people who have undergone training to professionallyadminister the electrolysis procedure. If you are considering undergoingelectrolysis, it is very important that you do your research before committingto an appointment. The wrong decision can mean extra sessions and cost andunnecessary discomfort. By following the guidelines listed below, you can takecomfort in knowing that you will be making an educated and informed decisionwhen choosing an electrologist.''WebMD Medical Reference' Know their qualifications.  Many states require that electrologists be
licensed or certified within the state in order to practice electrolysis. If
you live in those states, be sure the practitioner's
certificate is current and fully on display. For states that do not regulate
electrolysis, look for electrologists who have a certification from an
accredited electrology school. Ask around.  One of the best ways to find any good service is to ask friends
and family for recommendations. If you know anybody who has undergone
electrolysis, ask for his or her input. Get a consultation.  Many places will give you a free consultation. During
the consultation, be sure that any and all of your questions about the
procedure are answered. Some of the questions you can ask include: how the
procedure will feel; an estimate on the number of visits you will likely need;
the cost of each visit (this will vary from place to place, and it is best to
call around); the length of each session; how long they have been in business;
and the number of clients they have treated. Make sure they use the right technique. Make sure the practitioner uses
needle electrolysis, which is the only permanent form of hair removal. Some
places may advertise electrolysis, but in reality they use electronic tweezers
or photoepilators. These are not permanent hair removal procedures. Use common sense. When you go to your consultation, look around. Does the
place look clean? Do the workers look clean? Do they use disposable gloves or
probes? Ask to meet to person who will be performing the electrolysis for you.
Does he or she strike you as professional? If you are not personally
comfortable with somebody, do not go to him or her. Personal comfort is
essential to knowing you have made the right decision in choosing an
electrologist."

People having which skin color can go for the treatment''6. Downtime''7. Side effects''If the procedure is performed by an experienced dermatologist or under their direct supervision, other side effects are very rare.''The less common side effects of laser hair removal include\xa0' Electrolysis: This is a method of hair removal in which an electrical current is sent through a hair follicle. The current will damage the follicle and prevent hair growth. Laser hair removal: This is a method of hair removal in which a laser (a concentrated beam of light) is used to remove unwanted hair. Electrolysis: Because hair growth occurs in cycles, several sessions of electrolysis are needed for getting permanent hair removal. Laser hair removal: Around six treatment sessions are needed from a dermatologist to completely destroy the hair follicles. The hair, however, grows back thinner and finer after each treatment session. In the case of use-at-home laser hair removal, a much longer series of laser treatments is needed to get the results. The use-at-home laser has to be used periodically to maintain the results. Electrolysis: This removes unwanted hair permanently. Laser hair removal: Hair removal is permanent except for a woman’s facial hair. Electrolysis: This technique works on all hair types, including the light-colored hair that cannot be removed by laser hair removal. Laser hair removal: This does not work on blonde, white, gray or red hair. This is because lasers cannot effectively target light-colored hair. Electrolysis: This can be done for people who have various skin colors. People with darker skin, however, are at a risk of developing a raised scar called a keloid. Laser hair removal: This can be done for people of all skin colors. Laser hair removal is most effective for people with light skin and dark hair. For hair removal for people of color, the person performing the procedure must have experience performing laser hair removal on those who have darker skin tones. People with a tan must go for laser hair removal after the tan has faded away. Electrolysis: There is no downtime. People can resume their everyday routine soon after treatment.

What are electrolytes?,"'Chemically, electrolytes are substances that become ions in solution and acquire the capacity to conduct electricity. Electrolytes are present in the ''human body'', and the balance of the electrolytes in our bodies is essential for normal function of our cells and our organs. ''Common electrolytes that are measured by doctors with blood testing include sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. The functions and normal range values for these electrolytes are described below. ' "
Sodium,"'Sodium is the major positive ion (cation) in fluid outside of cells. The chemical notation for sodium is Na+. When combined with chloride, the resulting substance is table salt. Excess sodium (such as that obtained from dietary sources) is excreted in the urine. Sodium regulates the total amount of water in the body and the transmission of sodium into and out of individual cells also plays a role in critical body functions. Many processes in the body, especially in the brain, nervous system, and muscles, require electrical signals for communication. The movement of sodium is critical in the generation of these electrical signals. Therefore, too much or too little sodium can cause cells to malfunction, and extremes in the blood sodium levels (too much or too little) can be fatal.''A Normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased sodium (hypernatremia) in the blood occurs whenever there is excess sodium in relation to water. There are numerous causes of hypernatremia; these may include kidney disease, too little water intake, and loss of water due to diarrhea and/or vomiting. A decreased concentration of sodium (hyponatremia) occurs whenever there is a relative increase in the amount of body water relative to sodium. This happens with some diseases of the liver and kidney, in patients with congestive heart failure, in burn victims, and in numerous other conditions."
Potassium,"'Potassium is the major positive ion (cation) found inside of cells. The chemical notation for potassium is K+. The proper level of potassium is essential for normal cell function. Among the many functions of potassium in the body are regulation of the heartbeat and the function of the muscles. A seriously abnormal increase in potassium (''hyperkalemia'') or decrease in potassium (''hypokalemia'') can profoundly affect the nervous system and increases the chance of irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), which, when extreme, can be fatal.''The normal blood potassium level is 3.5 - 5.0 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 3.5 - 5.0 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).' Increased potassium is known as hyperkalemia. Potassium is normally excreted by the kidneys, so disorders that decrease the function of the kidneys can result in hyperkalemia. Certain medications may also predispose an individual to hyperkalemia. Hypokalemia, or decreased potassium, can arise due to kidney diseases; excessive losses due to heavy sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, eating disorders, certain medications, or other causes."
Chloride,"'Chloride is the major anion (negatively charged ion) found in the fluid outside of cells and in the blood. An anion is the negatively charged part of certain substances such as table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl) when dissolved in liquid.\xa0Chloride plays a role in helping the body maintain a normal balance of fluids.''The balance of chloride ion (Cl-) is closely regulated by the body. Significant increases or decreases in chloride can have deleterious or even fatal consequences:''The normal serum range for chloride is 98 - 108 mmol/L.' Increased chloride (hyperchloremia): Elevations in chloride may be seen in diarrhea, certain kidney diseases, and sometimes in overactivity of the parathyroid glands. Decreased chloride (hypochloremia): Chloride is normally lost in the urine, sweat, and stomach secretions. Excessive loss can occur from heavy sweating, vomiting, and adrenal gland and kidney disease."
Bicarbonate,"'The bicarbonate ion acts as a buffer to maintain the normal levels of acidity (pH) in blood and other fluids in the body. Bicarbonate levels are measured to monitor the acidity of the blood and body fluids. The acidity is affected by foods or medications that we ingest and the function of the kidneys and ''lungs''. The chemical notation for bicarbonate on most lab reports is HCO3- or represented as the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). The normal serum range for bicarbonate is 22-30 mmol/L. ''The bicarbonate test is usually performed along with tests for other blood electrolytes. ''Disruptions in the normal bicarbonate level'' may be due to diseases that interfere with respiratory function, kidney diseases, metabolic conditions, or other causes.' "
What is an electromyogram?,"'An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.''EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs), ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (''ALS''), ''myasthenia gravis'', ''disc herniation'', and others.'  "
Why is an EMG test done?,"'An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle ''weakness''. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because of ''pain'' or lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.'  "
How is an intramuscular EMG done?,"'A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.''Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.''After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).''The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each muscle ''fiber'' that contracts produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.' "
Is an EMG painful?,"'Yes. There is some discomfort at the time the needle electrodes are inserted. They feel like shots (intramuscular injections), although nothing is injected during an EMG. Afterwards, the muscle may feel a little sore for up to a few days.'  "
How do you prepare for an intramuscular EMG?,"""For adults, no special preparation is needed. For infants and children, the physical and psychological preparation depends on the child's age, behavior, and prior experience. (For instance, has the child been traumatized by another medical or dental procedure?)"" "
What other test is done during an intramuscular EMG?,"""A nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is often done at the same time as an EMG. In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated while a second electrode detects the electrical impulse 'down-stream' from the first. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease.''The NCV test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as neuropathy) or conditions whereby muscles are affected by nerve injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome''). Normal body temperature must be maintained for the NCV test, because low body temperatures slow nerve conduction.''Previous contributing authors and editors: Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor: Barbara K. Hecht, Ph.D.' "
Electron Beam (Ultrafast) CT (EBCT) Introduction,"'EBCT, also called calcium-score screening ''heart'' scan, is a test used to detect calcium deposits found in ''atherosclerotic'' plaque in the coronary arteries of ''heart disease'' patients. State-of-the-art ''computerized tomography'' (CT) methods, such as this one, are the most effective way to detect coronary calcification from ''atherosclerosis'', before symptoms develop. More coronary calcium means more ''coronary atherosclerosis'', suggesting a greater likelihood of significant narrowing somewhere in the coronary system and a higher risk of future cardiovascular problems.''Your doctor uses the calcium-score screening heart scan to evaluate risk for future ''coronary artery disease''.''Because there are certain forms of coronary disease, such as ""soft plaque"" atherosclerosis, that escape detection during this ''CT scan'', it is important to remember that this test is not absolute in predicting your risk for a life-threatening event, such as a ''heart attack''.''Your doctor may also order a coronary CT ''angiogram'' (CTA) to look directly at the arteries of the heart. With the CTA, pictures of your coronary arteries are made.  This is regularly performed in addition to a heart CT scan now.' "
How Should I Prepare for a Heart CT Scan?,"'You may continue to take any medications but should avoid ''caffeine'' and ''smoking'' for four hours before the test. CT scanners use ''X-rays''. For your safety, the amount of ''radiation'' exposure is kept to a minimum. But, because X-rays can harm a developing fetus, this procedure is not recommended if you are ''pregnant''. Tell your technologist and your doctor if you are:' Pregnant. Undergoing radiation therapy."
What Can I Expect During a Heart CT Scan?,"'During the CT scan of your heart:' You will change into a hospital gown. The nurse will record your height, weight, and blood pressure. He or she may draw your blood for a lipid analysis. You will lie on a special scanning table. The technologist will clean three small areas of your chest and place small, sticky electrode patches on these areas. Men may expect to have their chest partially shaved to help the electrodes stick. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph (ECG) monitor, which charts your heart's electrical activity during the test. You may also be given an injection of a contrast material to help the CT scanner directly visualize your coronary arteries. During the scan, you will feel the table move inside a donut-shaped scanner. The high-speed CT scan captures multiple images, synchronized with your heartbeat. A sophisticated computer program, guided by the cardiovascular radiologist, analyzes the images for presence of calcification within the coronary arteries. Absence of calcium is considered a ""negative"" exam. But, it does not exclude the presence of ""soft"" noncalcified plaque. If calcium is present, the computer will create a calcium ""score"" that estimates the extent of coronary artery disease. The calcium-score screening heart scan takes only a few minutes."
What Happens After a Heart CT Scan?,"'You may continue all normal activities and eat as usual after the heart CT scan.''The results of the scan will be reviewed. The following information will be obtained:''Your heart CT scan results will be examined and reviewed by a team of cardiovascular specialists, including a cardiovascular radiologist and a preventive cardiologist. The team will evaluate the calcium score and/or your CT angiogram, along with other risk factor measurements (risk factor evaluation, blood pressure, lipid analysis), to determine your risk for future coronary artery disease and will make recommendations regarding your lifestyle, medications, or additional cardiac testing.''You and your primary care doctor will receive the full report outlining your risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the calcium-score screening heart scan.' The number and density of calcified coronary plaques in the coronary arteries. Calcium score."
Is the Heart CT Scan Covered by Insurance?,"'Because this CT scan is a screening examination, it is not currently covered under most insurance companies and Medicare. Therefore, you will likely be responsible for all involved costs at the time of the exam. The examination cost is about $350.00 and includes all lab, technical, medical and professional interpretation charges.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Electrophysiology Testing Introduction,"'An electrophysiology (EP) study is a test that records the electrical activity and the electrical pathways of your ''heart''. This test is used to help determine the cause of your heart rhythm disturbance and the best treatment for you. During the EP study, your doctor will safely reproduce your abnormal heart rhythm and then may give you different medications to see which one controls it best or to determine the best procedure or device to treat your heart rhythm.' "
Why Do I Need an EP Test?,'An electrophysiology study is used:' To determine the cause of an abnormal heart rhythm. To locate the site of origin of an abnormal heart rhythm. To decide the best treatment for an abnormal heart rhythm.
How Should I Prepare for The EP Study?," Ask your doctor what medications you are allowed to take. Your doctor may ask you to stop certain medications one to five days before your EP study. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how you should adjust your diabetes drugs. Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before the EP study. If you must take medications, take them only with a small sip of water. When you come to the hospital, wear comfortable clothes. You will change into a hospital gown for the procedure. Leave all jewelry or valuables at home. Your doctor will tell you if you can go home or must stay in the hospital after the procedure. If you are able to go home, bring a companion to drive you home."
What Can I Expect During the Electrophysiology Study?,"'The EP study takes about two to four hours to perform. However, it can take longer if additional treatments such as catheter ablation are performed at the same time.' Before an electrophysiology study, you will lie on a bed and the nurse will start an intravenous (IV) line into your arm or hand. This is so you can receive medications and fluids during the electrophysiology study. You will be given a medication through your IV to relax you and make you drowsy, but it will not put you to sleep. The nurse will connect you to several monitors. Your groin will be shaved and cleansed with an antiseptic solution. Sterile drapes are used to cover you, from your neck to your feet. A soft strap will be placed across your waist and arms to prevent your hands from coming in contact with the sterile field. An electrophysiologist (a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal heart rhythms) will numb your groin with medication and then insert several catheters into the vein in your groin. Guided by the fluoroscopy machine, the catheters are threaded to your heart. The catheters sense the electrical activity in your heart and are used to evaluate your heart's conduction system. The doctor will use a pacemaker to deliver the electrical impulses through one of the catheters to increase your heart rate. You may feel your heart beating faster or stronger. Your nurses and doctor will want to know about any symptoms you are feeling. If your arrhythmia occurs, your doctor may give you medications through your IV to test their effectiveness in controlling it. If necessary, a small amount of energy may be delivered by the patches on your chest to bring back a normal heart rhythm. Based on the information collected during the study, the doctor may continue with an ablation procedure."
What Happens After the EP Study?,"'The doctor will remove the catheters from your groin and apply pressure to the site, to prevent bleeding. You will be on bed rest for about one to two hours.''An EP study can be frightening, but this test allows the doctor to decide the best treatment for you. In many cases, EP testing and the therapy following can greatly reduce the likelihood of spontaneous arrhythmia. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask your doctor or nurse.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is electroretinography (ERG)?,"'Electroretinography (ERG) is an eye test that detects function of the retina (the light-detecting portion of the eye). The retina is comprised of layers of specialized cells, including photoreceptors (rods and cones), that detect light and ''ganglion'' cells that transmit images to the brain. Specifically, the ERG picks up electrical signals from the photoreceptors, as well as other cells (Muller cells and bipolar cells) that act as intermediaries between the photoreceptors and the ''ganglion'' cells. Abnormal ERG readings can detect certain abnormalities of these cell layers. During the test, a medical professional places an electrode on the ''cornea'' (at the front of the eye) to measure the electrical responses to light of these cells.' "
How do health care professionals perform an ERG?,"'ERG is one type of ophthalmic ''electrophysiology test''. Depending on which eye condition is being studied, ERG may be performed in conjunction with other tests, such as electrooculography (EOG) or dark adaptometry testing. ERG is usually well tolerated, painless, and medical professionals can perform ERG even in cooperative children and infants. Occasionally, sedation may be necessary.'""The patient assumes a comfortable position either lying down or sitting up. An eye doctor dilates the patient's eyes with standard dilating eyedrops. Anesthetic drops are also given. The doctor then props the eyelids open with a speculum and gently places a contact ""'lens'' electrode or an electrode resembling a fine thread on each eye. The physician places an additional electrode on the forehead skin.'""During an ERG recording session, the patient looks into a bowl displaying different amounts of light. Retinal cells emit small electrical signals when stimulated by certain types of light. The ERG machine records the resulting electric signals' amplitude (voltage) and time course.""'The visual stimuli vary; some are done with no light in the background (dark-adapted, or scotopic readings), and some are done with light in the background (light-adapted, or photopic readings). The light stimuli include flashes of light (flash ERG) and flickering lights.' "
What do the electrodes do?,'The electrodes measure the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. The information that comes from each electrode transmits to a monitor where it displays as wave patterns.' 
"How do medical professionals make electroretinography 
readings?","'Dark-adapted readings are taken when light flashes are presented after the patient has adapted to the dark for 20 minutes, and light-adapted readings are taken when light flashes are presented after the patient has adapted to light for 10 minutes. Generally, dark-adapted readings correlate with the health of the cells known as rods, while light-adapted readings correlate with the health of the cone cells.' "
Why do medical professionals perform an ERG?,'An ERG is useful in evaluating both ''inherited'' (hereditary) and acquired disorders of the retina.' 
What diseases is my doctor looking for with an ERG?,"'There are a number of retinal conditions in which the ERG may provide useful information, including'  retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, disorders that mimic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), as well as carriers of RP genes who otherwise show little sign of the disease, Leber's congenital amaurosis, choroideremia, congenital stationary night blindness, X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, achromatopsia, cone and rod dystrophies and degenerations, total retinal detachment, and retinal abnormalities due to metallic foreign bodies, autoimmune disease, inflammatory diseases, toxic drug damage, retinal vascular occlusion, malnutrition, and metabolic storage diseases."
What is a multifocal ERG?,"'While a standard ERG detects activity of the entire retina, the multifocal ERG tests different areas of the retina, looking for localized areas of abnormality. This test takes longer than a standard ERG.' "
What is a normal outcome for an ERG?,'A normal ERG shows an a-wave (photoreceptor activity) and b-wave (Muller and bipolar cells activity) patterns in dark-adapted (scotopic) and light-adapted (photopic) settings. Wave patterns that are diminished in size or delayed or prolonged in time provide clues about the types of damaged cells.' 
What do abnormal ERG results mean?,"'Abnormal ERG results provide clues as to which specific retinal cells are affected by disease. There are retinal diseases in which specific cells are missing or weak at birth, while other abnormalities are acquired over time.' "
What are the risks of an ERG test?,"'Some patients experience mild ''ocular'' discomfort during or after the procedure, but if you have irritation following an ERG, you should let your eye doctor know, so that he or she can rule out a ''corneal abrasion'' (scratch of the surface of the eye).' "
Does the ERG test hurt?,"'The test does not hurt. However, the electrode that rests on the eye may produce a foreign body sensation like having an eyelash on the eye. This sensation may persist up to several hours following completion of the ERG.'  "
How long does the ERG test take?,"'The standard ERG typically takes about an hour. For the dark-adapted portion of the test, the patient sits in the dark for 20 minutes. Dim light flashes that gradually increase in brightness then appear and the retinal responses recorded. This part takes another 10 to 15 minutes. Next is the light-adapted portion of the test. The patient views a medium-bright light for 10 minutes. Once the eyes are light-adapted, another series of flashes and flickering lights are presented and the retinal responses recorded. This takes another 10 to 15 minutes.''A multifocal ERG may take an additional hour to complete.' "
What happens after the ERG test?,"'One should not rub the eyes for an hour after an ERG (or any test in which the cornea has been anesthetized), so as not to injure the cornea.''An ophthalmologist or electrophysiologist who has special training in interpretation of ERGs will review the results of the test.' "
Electrical nerve stimulation history,"'For several thousand years, people have recognized that electrical stimulation can have an impact on ''pain''. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, is said to have used electric fish to cause numbness, and a report of ''gout'' being “cured” by accidental contact with a fish called an electric ray dates back to the first century. Later reports also described ''pain'' resolution that occurred when similar types of “electric” fish were placed on afflicted body parts.'""It wasn't until the 18th century when a more formal device to deliver electricity to decrease pain was created. Although initially developed in Europe, Benjamin Franklin is credited with reforming the original electric condenser, which was used to ""'shock'' patients in an effort to treat various ailments.\xa0' "
What is a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit?,"'Today, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation units, or TENS units, are commonly used to treat many types of pain, including chronic back and ''neck pain''. Unlike the early devices, where the amount of electricity delivered might vary, TENS units supply a controlled electrical current to stimulate nerve endings through surface electrodes, which are placed over the affected region.'  "
How does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation work?,"'The rationale for using a TENS unit for pain control is based on the inability of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves to multi-task -- that is, impulses that are being carried along a pathway within the nervous system effectively block that pathway from transmitting other signals. In essence, flooding a pathway with low-level stimulation keeps pain signals from reaching the brain.''TENS units are reported to work rapidly, although it can take some adjustment to find the correct level of stimulation. Additionally, TENS units are portable, which can improve the mobility of a patient experiencing ''chronic pain''. However, not all types of pain respond to this method of treatment and any effect tends to be short-lived; pain quickly recurs once the stimulator is removed.' "
Who is a good candidate for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation?,"""Although this therapy isn't for everyone, individuals looking for a relatively inexpensive, well-tolerated treatment option with few side effects may find a TENS unit a good option to explore.""  "
What is the definition of homocysteine? What is it?,"'Homocysteine is an amino acid produced by the body by chemically altering adenosine. Amino acids are naturally made products, which are the building blocks of all the proteins in the body. Most labs report normal ranges of homocysteine as about 4-15 µml/L.''Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a ''genetic disorder'' called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced ''atherosclerosis'' in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "
What are hyperhomycysteinemia and homocystinuria? Are they inherited (genetic)?,"'Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a genetic disorder called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced atherosclerosis in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "
"How many people have elevated homocysteine levels, and who gets the condition?","'Mild elevation in homocysteine levels (hyperhomocysteinemia) are common, and seen in about 5% to 12% of the general population. In specific populations such as, alcoholics (due to poor vitamin intake) or patients with chronic ''kidney disease'', this may be more common. The severe genetic form, homocystinuria, is rare (0.02%).'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria?,"'Homocystinuria has a constellation of signs and symptoms that include:'  Developmental delay Osteoporosis (thin bones) Visual abnormalities Formation of blood clots Advanced atherosclerosis or narrowing and hardening of blood vessels, a type of heart disease."
What are the more common causes of hyperhomocysteinemia?,"'More common causes of elevated homocysteine levels in the blood are milder genetic variations of homocystinuria. In these conditions, the mediator molecules malfunction and are less efficient because of a minor abnormality in their structure. They also lead to elevation of homocysteine levels (above 15 µmol/L), although much milder than in homocystinuria (above 100 µmol/L), by slowing down the breakdown of homocysteine.' "
How can homocysteine levels be lowered?,"'Eating cereals that are fortified with ''folic acid'', and to a lesser extent ''vitamins'' B6 and B12, can lower blood homocysteine levels. These ''supplements'' may even be beneficial in people with mild genetic hyperhomocysteinemia to lower their homocysteine levels. However, it is noteworthy that so far there is no compelling data to support the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia for ''prevention'' of ''heart disease'' or treatment of known ''heart disease'' or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with ''heart'' disease (atherosclerosis) or other diseases.'  "
Who should get tested for elevated homocysteine levels? How is it treated?,"'Currently, there are no official recommendations as to who should undergo testing for homocysteine blood levels. Before data that are more scientific become available from the currently ongoing studies, many experts do not recommend a screening test for blood homocysteine levels, even in patients with unexplained ''blood clot'' formation. In addition, the consensus recommendation is against treating elevated homocysteine levels with ''vitamins'' to prevent heart disease. Rarely, a few specialists may test for elevated homocysteine levels in patients with early onset of ''blood clot'' formation, ''heart attacks'', ''strokes'', or other symptoms related to atherosclerosis, especially if these patients do not have typical risk factors, such as ''smoking'' cigarettes, ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', or high LDL ''cholesterol levels'' and they suspect genetic causes''There is also no consensus as to the optimal dose of folic acid and other B vitamins for the treatment of elevated blood homocysteine levels. (For example, treatment of patients with high homocysteine levels may require higher doses of folic acid and other B vitamins than the amounts contained in a multivitamin.) Therefore, a decision regarding testing should be individualized after consulting with your doctor and/or a specialist in genetic diseases. Some researchers recommend treatment guidelines that result in levels of homocysteine below 100 µmol/L but say the recommendation may change (possibly lowered) with new data.'  "
Does lowering homocysteine level prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'Currently, there is no direct proof that taking folic acid and B vitamins to lower homocysteine levels prevents ''heart attacks'' and strokes. However, in a large population study involving women, those who had the highest consumption of folic acid (usually in the form of ''multivitamins'') had fewer ''heart attacks'' than those who consumed the least amount of folic acid. In this study, the association between dietary intake of folate and vitamin B6 and risk of heart disease was more noticeable than between dietary intake of vitamin B12 and heart disease, which was minimal.''Many other observational studies have been performed to assess the effect of folate and the other B vitamins on heart disease. Most of these studies have concluded that oral intake of folate has been associated to lower risk of heart disease, possibly because due to lowering of homocysteine levels. The relation between oral intake of vitamin B12 and B6 and heart disease was not as obvious in many of these studies. In one study, it was concluded that even in people with elevated homocysteine levels due to genetic reasons, oral intake of folate and possibly the other B vitamins was related to lower incidence of heart disease.''Most of these data, however, are obtained from observational studies rather than purely controlled scientific data. Therefore, it is important to mention that despite these studies suggesting an association between the intake of these vitamins and the lower incidence of heart disease, in general, there is no compelling clinical evidence to treat hyperhomocysteinemia other than homocystinuria (the severe genetic form) in regards to heart disease, ''stroke'', or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with these problems.' "

Facts you should know about ELISA tests,"'ELISA is an abbreviation for ""enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."" In 1974, P. Perlmann and E. Engvall developed the test as a substitute for certain radioimmunoassay tests, and eventually, it replaced the western blot test for ''HIV'' confirmation. The ELISA test is versatile and medical professionals can perform it easily as compared to other more complicated tests; many variations are available commercially.'  "
What is an ELISA test?,"'An ELISA test uses components of the immune system (such as IgG or IgM antibodies) and chemicals for the detection of immune responses in the body (for example, to infectious microbes). The ELISA test involves an enzyme (a protein that catalyzes a biochemical reaction). It also involves an antibody or antigen (immunologic molecules) that may form an antigen-antibody reaction to provide a positive result or, if they do not react, a negative result. Examples of the uses of an ELISA test include diagnosing infections such as ''HIV'' (''human immunodeficiency virus'') and some ''allergic'' diseases like ''food allergies'' and experimental investigations to identify compounds (antigens from a cell lysate in a wide array of organisms). ELISA tests are also known as an immunosorbent assay or an enzyme immunoassay when an enzyme is bound to another substance as an indicator (can cause a color change, for example).''The test is based on a microtiter plate that has a solid phase substrate (target protein, antigen) at a known concentration fixed to the plate that when exposed to an antibody that has an indicator attached (dye for color change or enzyme-labeled antibody) that can produce a color change. Depending on a standard curve for absorption of enzyme-labeled antibody versus antigen level as related to the dye color change, tests may provide semi-quotative, quantitative, and/or identification of many diverse substances. This type of test is termed a direct ELISA.''There are other types of ELISA tests. Indirect ELISA uses a secondary antibody to attach to the substrate, and the sandwich ELISA that uses the antibody as the substrate fixed to the microtiter plate. For examples and additional details, see http://ruo.mbl.co.jp/bio/e/support/method/elisa.html.' "
What is the use of an ELISA test?,"'ELISA tests primarily detect proteins (as opposed to small molecules and ions such as glucose and potassium). Medical professionals frequently use ELISA tests as blood tests to detect antigens that may be present in the blood. The substances detected by ELISA tests can include hormones, an ''allergen'', viral antigens (''dengue fever'', for example), bacterial antigens (''TB'', for example), and antibodies that the body has made in response to infection (antibodies to ''hepatitis B'', for example) or vaccination. They can also identify an infectious disease agent in patients.' "
What is an ELISA kit?,"'An ELISA kit is a commercially available ELISA test that usually contains pre-coated polystyrene plates, detection antibodies, and usually all of the chemicals needed to perform an ELISA test. However, people can purchase special kits with substances designated by the customer.' "
How does ELISA testing work?,"'There are variations of the ELISA test (see below), but the most utilized type consists of an antibody attached to a solid surface (polystyrene plate). This antibody has affinity for (will latch on to) the substance of interest, such as a hormone, bacteria, or another antibody. For example, human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG), the commonly measured protein that indicates ''pregnancy'', can be detected by ELISA. A mixture of purified HCG linked to an enzyme and the test sample (blood or urine) are added to the test system. If no HCG is present in the test sample, then only the linked enzyme will bind to the solid surface. The more substance of interest that is present in the test sample, the less linked enzyme will bind to the solid surface. The more of the substance of interest is present it will cause a reaction and show up on the test plate in some way, such as a color change of the solution (or like a ''pregnancy test'' ""two pink lines"" or a ""+"" mark).' "
What are the types of ELISA tests? What is a direct ELISA?,"'There are four types or kinds of ELISA tests:' Direct ELISA: attachment of an antigen to a polystyrene plate followed by an enzyme-labeled antibody that can react with the antigen and a substrate that can be measured Indirect ELISA: attachment of an antigen to a polystyrene plate followed by an unlabeled or primary antibody followed by an enzyme-labeled antibody that can react with both the primary antibody and substrate Sandwich ELISA: A capture antibody is attached to the polystyrene plate, then antigen is added that specifically attaches or captures the antigen. A second antibody, also specific for the antigen but not the same as the capture antibody is added and ""sandwiches"" the antigen. This second antibody is then followed by an enzyme-labeled antibody specific for the second antibody that can react with a substrate that can be measured Competitive ELISA: This test is like the sandwich ELISA but involves the addition of competing antibodies or proteins when the second antibody is added. This results in a decrease in the substrate signal generated. This test gives good, highly specific results."
How do health care workers perform an ELISA test?,"""Health care personnel who perform the test are trained laboratory technicians who use special kits that measure the antigens' interactions with the antibodies in the kit. They will inform your doctor of the test results."" "
What are the advantages of ELISA testing?,"'ELISA tests are generally good and accurate tests. They are considered highly sensitive and specific (accurate) and compare favorably with other methods used for the detection of substances in the body. The ELISA testing method is more straightforward and easier to perform than older laboratory techniques, which often required radioactive materials.' "
How do people prepare for an ELISA test? Is an ELISA test painful? What risks are involved with an ELISA procedure?,"'In general, people do not need to prepare for an ELISA test. Medical professionals perform the test in a lab. If your blood is required, the only hurt is in blood collection. The risks associated with an ELISA test are rare and associated with blood withdrawal (infection, vessel damage, for example).' "
How long does it take to get ELISA test results?,"'Depending on what the test is being used for, you may get results as quickly as about 24 hours if the test is done locally. However, there are some tests that may take days to weeks.' "
What do the results of an ELISA test mean?,"'There are many hundreds of variations of ELISA tests. The results and their meaning depend on what is being tested. For example, an ELISA test for viral RNA can detect it (a positive test), not detect it (a negative test), or be indeterminate (borderline test). Rarely, it may result in a false negative or false positive result. If you have an ELISA test done, the best approach is to ask your physician what the results of the test mean to your individual situation.' "
Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung) overview,"   Pulmonary embolism (PE) describes a blockage of one of the pulmonary arteries by a blood clot that forms elsewhere in the body and travels to the lung. The blood clot (thrombus) usually forms in a vein deep in an arm or leg (DVT=deep vein thrombosis), and breaks off, traveling into and through the heart into the lung where it gets trapped, blocking blood supply to portions of the lung. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) describes the medical condition that includes both PE and DVT. Classic symptoms of pulmonary embolism may include:pleuritic chest pain,shortness of breath,rapid heart rate, andanxiety. pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and anxiety. The condition can also cause less obvious symptoms including anxiety, cough, bloody sputum, abdominal pain, or syncope (passing out). Some risk factors for VTE include:prolonged immobilization,surgery or trauma,cancer,pregnancy,oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy,smoking, andhypercoagulable states (inborn errors of coagulation). prolonged immobilization, surgery or trauma, cancer, pregnancy, oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy, smoking, and hypercoagulable states (inborn errors of coagulation). Pulmonary embolism may cause sudden death. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is sometimes difficult to make and may be missed. It is a diagnosis that needs to be considered in everyone complaining of chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis is most often confirmed by lung CT scan or pulmonary angiography. Anticoagulation (blood thinning) is the treatment for pulmonary embolism. Depending upon the situation, anticoagulation may continue for 3 to 6 months or it may last a lifetime. The major complication of anticoagulation is bleeding."
What is a pulmonary embolism? What does it look like (picture)?,"'The ''lungs'' are responsible for taking oxygen from the air and delivering it to the body. They also take carbon dioxide (a waste product of metabolism) from the blood stream and exhale it, removing it from the body.''The exchange of the air between the lungs and blood are through the arterial and venous system. Both arteries and veins carry and move blood throughout the body, but the process for each is very different.''Arteries carry blood away from the heart, and veins return blood. Every time the heart pumps, it sends blood both to the lungs and the rest of the body.''The circulation pathway is as follows:'""If a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the body's deep veins (""'deep vein thrombosis'' or ''DVT''), it has the potential to break off and travel (embolize) back to the heart and into one of the pulmonary arteries where it can become stuck.''A pulmonary embolus blocks blood flow and prevents functioning of that part of the lung. Not only does it prevent the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, but it also decreases blood supply to the lung tissue itself, potentially causing part of the lung tissue to die (infarct=tissue death).''A pulmonary embolus is one of the life-threatening causes of chest ''pain'' that should always be considered when patients complain of chest ''pain'' and shortness of breath to their health care professionals.''There are special types of pulmonary embolus that are not due to ''blood clots'', but instead are due to other body materials. These are rare occurrences and include:''The signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are caused by decreased lung function and the inability of the lung to provide adequate oxygen to the rest of the body.' The pulmonary arteries and their branches send blood from the heart to the lungs. Oxygen from the air is loaded onto hemoglobin in the red blood cells and then travels back to the heart through the pulmonary veins. The heart then pumps that oxygen-rich blood through the aorta and its branches to all the organs and tissues in the rest of the body, including the brain, the abdomen, and the arms and legs. After the hemoglobin delivers the oxygen into the tissues, it collects carbon dioxide, the waste product of metabolism. The carbon dioxide-laden blood then returns through veins back to the heart. The heart pumps this blood through the pulmonary arteries back to the lung. There, the carbon dioxide is returned to exhaled air and a new cargo of oxygen is uploaded to begin the circulation cycle again. fat emboli from the interior of a large bone like a femur (thigh bone), which can occur because of a fracture or as a complication of surgery, an amniotic fluid embolus in pregnancy, tumor tissue from cancer, air embolus, usually a complication of a medical procedure such as neurosurgery, dye injection, or central intravenous line placement."
What are the signs and symptoms of pulmonary embolism?,"'The most common symptoms of a pulmonary embolus are the acute onset of:''Vital signs (''blood pressure'', heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) may be normal or abnormal, depending upon the size of the embolus and how much lung tissue is affected. The larger the clot burden or load, the less stable the vital signs.''Abnormal vital signs may include:''The condition progresses as follows:''Sudden death is the initial sign of the condition in up to 25% of cases. The person collapses, stops breathing, and his or her heart stops beating (''cardiac arrest'') without prior symptoms. Pulmonary embolus is the second leading cause of sudden death, behind ''coronary artery disease''.'   Chest pain: The pain is often described as pleuritic, a sharp pain that worsens when taking a deep breath. Shortness of breath: The person may have difficulty catching his or her breath at rest, and the shortness of breath often worsens with activity. Hypoxia or hypoxemia: decreased oxygen concentration in the blood. (hypo=less + ox=oxygen + ia or emia= blood). Tachycardia: elevated heart rate (tachy=fast + cardia=heart); Tachypnea: elevated respiratory (breathing) rate.(tachy=fast + pnea= breathing); Hypotension: decreased blood pressure (hypo=low + tension=blood pressure); Hypoxia: decreased SaO2. Oxygen saturation described how many hemoglobin molecules are carrying oxygen. Normal oxygen level is usually greater than 92%-93%. The heart rate and respiratory rate may elevate as the body tries to compensate for the decreased oxygen transfer capabilities in the lung. This allows the oxygen that is available to be circulated more quickly, supplying the body's organ and tissue needs as best as possible. This may lead to anxiety, weakness and lightheadedness as the body's organs are deprived of the necessary oxygen to function. If the clot burden is large enough, it may make it harder for the heart to pump blood through the blocked pulmonary arteries. This increases the work that the heart has to do, raising pressures inside the heart and straining the heart muscle itself."
What are the causes and risk factors for pulmonary embolism?,"'Pulmonary embolus is the end result of a ''deep vein thrombosis'' or blood clot elsewhere in the body. Most commonly, the DVT begins in the leg and lower abdomen (pelvis) or arm.'""The risk factors for a pulmonary embolism are the same risks for developing deep vein thrombosis. These are referred to as Virchow's triad and include:""'Examples of these include:''Prolonged immobilization''Increased blood clotting potential''Damage to vessel wall'   prolonged immobilization or alterations in normal blood flow (stasis), increased clotting potential of the blood (hypercoagulability), damage to the walls of the veins. Extended travel (sitting in a car, airplane, train) Hospitalization or prolonged bed rest Surgery Medicationsbirth control pillsestrogen supplementationphenothiazines birth control pills estrogen supplementation phenothiazines Smoking Genetic predisposition. Examples include:Factor V Leiden deficiencyMHFTHR mutationProtein C or Protein S deficienciesantithrombin III deficiencyHomocystinemiaHomocystinuriaHyperlipidemia Factor V Leiden deficiency MHFTHR mutation Protein C or Protein S deficiencies antithrombin III deficiency Homocystinemia Homocystinuria Hyperlipidemia Blood disordersPolycythemiaincreased number of red blood cells(the opposite of anemia)ThrombocytosisElevated platelet count Polycythemiaincreased number of red blood cells(the opposite of anemia) increased number of red blood cells (the opposite of anemia) ThrombocytosisElevated platelet count Elevated platelet count Cancer Pregnancy, including the postpartum period up to 6 to 8 weeks after delivery Prior deep venous thrombosis Trauma to the lower leg with or without surgery or casting Venography Pacemaker insertion IV drug abuse"
What tests diagnose pulmonary embolism?,"'The health care professional should keep a high level of suspicion that a pulmonary embolus may be the cause of chest pain or shortness of breath. The first step in the diagnosis is taking a history of the chest pain, including its characteristics, its onset, and any associated symptoms that may direct the diagnosis to pulmonary embolism. The provider may also ask questions about risk factors for deep vein thrombosis.''Physical examination will concentrate initially on the heart and lungs, since chest pain and shortness of breath may also be the major complaints for ''heart attack'', ''pneumonia'', ''pneumothorax'' (collapsed lung), dissection of an ''aortic aneurysm'', among other conditions.''In pulmonary embolism, the chest examination is often normal, but if there is some associated inflammation on the surface of the lung (the pleura), a rub may be heard (pleura inflammation may cause friction, which can be heard with a stethoscope).''The physical examination may also include examining the arms and legs, looking for signs of a DVT, including warmth, redness, tenderness, and swelling.''People with a pulmonary embolus may have no physical findings and have a normal physical exam.'  "
PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolus,"'It is important to be able to determine the risk for pulmonary embolus to decide whether testing is needed to look for a PE.''One risk stratification tool is the PERC rule. If the patient has no risk factors for PE and normal vital signs, the potential for pulmonary embolism is low (less than 2%). No further testing may be necessary, depending upon the situation.''A negative PERC test requires that NO is the answer to the following statements:''If the answer is YES to any of these questions, then the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus still needs to be considered.' Age older than 50 Heart rate faster than 100 SaO2 on room air less than 95% Prior DVT or PE Trauma or surgery within the last 4 weeks Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) Hormone use Unilateral leg swelling (only one leg involved)"
"Basic testing (CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine blood test, chest X-ray, EKG)","'Basic testing in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism may include:''Chest X-ray is often normal in pulmonary embolism.''EKG may be normal, but may also show indirect signs of PE. These include tachycardia (heart rate >100), and changes associated with ''right ventricle'' strain.' CBC (complete blood count), Electrolytes, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), Creatinine blood test (to assess kidney function; see below), INR, PTT (to measure blood clotting capabilities), Chest X-ray, and Electrocardiogram (Electrocardiography; EKG, ECG)."
D-dimer blood test,"'If the suspicion for pulmonary embolism is low, a D-dimer blood test can be used for reassurance that a blood clot may not be present. The D-dimer blood test measures one of the breakdown products of a blood clot. If this test is normal, then the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism is very low. Unfortunately, this test is not specific for blood clots in the lung. It can be positive for a variety of reasons including pregnancy, injury, recent surgery, cancer, or infection.''D-dimer is not helpful if the potential risk for a blood clot is high.''The purpose for the PERC rule and D-dimer test is to minimize the need for imaging studies and decrease ''radiation'' exposure risk.' "
CT scan,"'CT scan (''computerized tomography'') of the chest is usually the imaging test of first choice to look for pulmonary embolus. Dye is injected into a vein in the upper arm. This allows the pulmonary arteries to be outlined looking for blood clots. Care needs to be taken with people who have dye ''allergies'', have kidney issues or who are in their ''first trimester'' of pregnancy.' "
Pulmonary angiogram,"'Historically, the gold standard for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus was a pulmonary ''angiogram'', in which a catheter was threaded into the pulmonary arteries, usually from veins in the groin or wrist. Dye was injected into the pulmonary arteries and could identify whether blood clots were present. This is an invasive test and requires a skilled radiologist to insert the catheter.''CT scan is more commonly used today, and pulmonary angiography is most often performed in unusual circumstances.' "
Ventilation-perfusion scans,"'Ventilation-perfusion scans (V/Q scans) are another less commonly used test in people who cannot undergo a chest CT scan to make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.''The scan uses inhaled ''gas'' (V) and injected dye (Q) to compare areas of lung where air can enter with those areas of lung that are getting blood supply. If there is a mismatch, then there is a possibility that a blood clot exists.''V/Q scans take hours to perform and are read by a radiologist as low, medium, and high probability that a blood clot is present. A low probability result means that there is still a 5%-15% change that a PE exists. For that reason, V/Q scans are not often performed.' "
Venous Doppler ultrasound,"'Instead of imaging the lung, ''ultrasound'' of the legs (or arms, if clinically appropriate) may be used to look for blood clots in a patient suspected of having a pulmonary embolus. If a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) exists, it can be inferred that someone complaining of chest pain and/or shortness of breath may be suffering from a pulmonary embolism. The initial treatment for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus may be similar, depending upon the clinical situation.'  "
Echocardiography,'Echocardiography'' or ''ultrasound of the heart'' may be helpful looking for right heart strain as a complication of a pulmonary embolus.' 
What is the treatment for pulmonary embolism?,"'When patients with a PE are admitted to the hospital, it is because they are unstable with abnormal vital signs, or there is concern that they will become unstable. The initial treatment of choice is ''unfractionated ''heparin'', an injectable blood thinner that is continuously given intravenously.''If vital signs are not stable, other alternative treatments may be considered based on the clinical situation. Complications can include ''shock'' with ''hypotension'' (''low blood pressure''), ''confusion'', ''coma'', or ''heart failure''.''Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or ''alteplase'' is an injectable clot-busting drug.''Thrombolytic therapy''Thrombectomy, embolectomy''Once vital signs are stable, anticoagulation with oral medication will follow the intravenous heparin or tPA, and these will be maintained after discharge to home.'   The best treatment for a pulmonary embolus is prevention. Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis is key in preventing a potentially fatal illness. The treatment for PE is anticoagulation. Once the diagnosis of PE is made, it is important to know the severity of the illness and whether the patient needs to be hospitalized or whether treatment can occur at home. The Pulmonary Embolus Severity Index (PESI) can help risk stratify who is stable and who may potentially be unstable. It takes the following factors into account:AgeSexHistory of cancer, heart disease, lung diseaseVital signsMental status Age Sex History of cancer, heart disease, lung disease Vital signs Mental status All patients with abnormal vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) need to be admitted to the hospital. Those who have unstable social situations, have difficulty obtaining medication or have difficulty understanding their medication may require observation prior to being discharged to home. Peripheral thrombolysis (thrombo= clot + lysis= dissolve) is the use of a clot-busting drug injected into a vein, with the expectation that it will “dissolve” the blood clot in the pulmonary artery. Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy is the use of a catheter threaded into the pulmonary artery where the clot is lodged and the clot-busting drug is injected directly into it. A catheter is inserted into the pulmonary artery and the clot is sucked out."
Anticoagulation,"'Anticoagulation, or blood thinning, is the treatment of choice for both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.''Anticoagulation prevents further blood clot formation and prevents embolization of a clot to the lung from existing clots. Under normal conditions, the body will activate a system that will break down blood clots within 4 to 6 weeks.''The American College of Chest Physicians has published guidelines regarding the choice of medications to anticoagulate a patient with VTE. The recommendations were based on review of multiple ''clinical trials'' and meta-analyses (statistical evaluation) in the medical literature.''Apixaban and rivaroxiban are oral medications that have a relatively rapid onset of action and become effective within 3 to 4 days.''Edoxiban and dabigatran take long to become effective and, therefore, there is a two-step process in their use. Either intravenous heparin or subcutaneous enoxaparin need to be used until the oral medications become effective.''Coumadin'' (''warfarin'') has historically been the medication of choice for the treatment of VTE. It takes many days to reach its therapeutic range in the body and, therefore, it too requires the use of heparin or enoxaparin until the medicine is effective.''Certain clinical situations also affect the choice of anticoagulation. Pregnancy, those who are ''breastfeeding'', the presence of ''liver'' or ''kidney failure'', and the presence of anti-phospholipid syndrome may require specific anticoagulation medications. The health care professional needs to match the clinical situation with the appropriate medication.''The dosing of Coumadin is monitored by blood test. INR (international normalized ratio) is used to guide the amount of Coumadin that is taken each day to keep the blood appropriately thinned. Certain foods and medications can interact with Coumadin and affect the dosing.''DOACs do not need blood tests to monitor their effectiveness or dosing. There are ''drug interactions'' that need to be considered when they are prescribed.' In patients with VTE and no cancer, the drug of choice is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as:apixaban (Eliquis)rivaroxiban (Xarelto)edoxiban (Sayvessa)dabigatran (Pradaxa) apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxiban (Xarelto) edoxiban (Sayvessa) dabigatran (Pradaxa) In patients with VTE and active cancer, the drug of choice is enoxaparin (Lovenox).The National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggests that DOACs may be an acceptable alternative to enoxaparin. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggests that DOACs may be an acceptable alternative to enoxaparin."
Duration of treatment,"'People usually take anticoagulation medications for a minimum of 3 to 6 months. At that time, the decision will be made based upon their risk of developing recurrent clots as to whether they should continue with long-term therapy.''Risk stratification may include whether the blood clot was provoked or unprovoked. An example of a provoked blood clot would be a patient who broke his or her leg, was placed in a cast, and was sedentary. Those who have VTE often undergo hypercoagulable evaluations looking for genetic or familial causes of blood clots.''If the health care professional, in consultation with the patient (shared decision-making), decides that lifelong therapy is required, that decision should be reviewed every year to determine if the risk of clotting still exists and whether the risk of clotting is greater than the risk of bleeding.'  "
Can pulmonary embolism cause death?,"'Patient survival depends upon:''There are more than 900,000 cases of DVT and PE in the United States, and 60,000-100,000 people die each year from the condition. In addition, 25% of cases of PE cause sudden death, and 10%-30% of patients with PE will die within the first month of diagnosis.' the underlying health of the patient, the clot burden of the pulmonary embolus, the effect it has on the heart and its ability to pump blood to the organs of the body, vital sign stability, the cause of the pulmonary embolus, and the ability for the diagnosis to be made and early initiation of treatment."
Can pulmonary embolism be prevented?,"'Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The embolism cannot occur without the initial DVT.' In the hospital setting, the nursing staff works hard to minimize the potential for clot formation in immobilized patients.Compression stockings are routinely used.Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier.Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prevention. Compression stockings are routinely used. Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier. Low-dose heparin or enoxaparin is prescribed for deep vein thrombosis prevention. DVT in the legs may require the placement of vena cava filters to prevent clots in the legs from embolizing to the lung. The filter sits in the large vein that leads from the legs to the heart. Those who have had hip or knee replacements may be prescribed DOACs to prevent DVTs. For long travel, getting up and walking or stretching every couple hours may prevent clot formation. Compression stockings may be helpful in preventing recurrent DVT in people with a previous history of a clot. Those on hormone therapy, including birth control pills, should be counseled regarding the risk of DVT. Smoking cessation reduces risk of clot. In those who are overweight, weight loss may decrease the risk of clot formation."
Embryo vs. fetus week by week,"  The terms embryo and fetus both refer to the developing baby inside the mother’s womb (uterus). The distinction between embryo and fetus is made based on gestational age. An embryo is the early stage of human development in which organs are critical body structures are formed. An embryo is termed a fetus beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy, which is the 9th week of development after fertilization of the egg. A zygote is a single-celled organism resulting from a fertilized egg. The zygote divides to become a ball of cells that eventually implants in the wall of the uterus. This ball of cells, known as a blastocyst, develops into the embryo and placenta. Doctors date pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period."
What is an embryo?,"'Doctors define pregnancy according to the date of a woman’s last ''menstrual period''.' The first two weeks of pregnancy are counted as the time prior to ovulation, in which the body is preparing to release an egg. Week #3 begins with release of an egg, or ovulation. If the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell, it is known as a zygote. The zygote divides and becomes a collection of cells known as a blastocyst. In week #4 of pregnancy, the blastocyst implants in the wall of the uterus and develops into the placenta and embryo. The blastocyst is considered an embryo at the point when the amniotic sac develops (by about day 10 to 12 after fertilization, or at the start of week #5 of pregnancy). An embryo represents the early stage of human development, roughly corresponding to the 5th-10th weeks of pregnancy."
What is a fetus?,"'After the embryonic period has ended at the end of the 10th week of pregnancy, the embryo is now considered a fetus. A fetus is a developing baby beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy.' "
The developing embryo: Week #4 to Week #11,"'The embryonic period of development is the stage in which most organs are formed. Organs begin to form, and the embryo elongates and starts to assume a human-like shape. The ''heart'' and main blood vessels are formed, and the heart starts beating by the 6th week. The primitive brain and spinal cord (neural tube) also begin to form.''By 12 weeks of pregnancy almost all of the baby’s organs are formed, including the arms and legs. The brain and spinal cord, however, continue to develop throughout pregnancy. The baby is about 2 inches long at the end of the embryonic period.''Most ''birth defects'' occur during the embryonic period, the critical time when organs are forming. The embryonic period is the time of greatest susceptibility to the negative effects of ''drugs'', ''radiation'', and viral infections.' "
Fetal period: week #12 to week #40,"'The fetal period is a time of growth of the developing baby. The organs and structures formed in the embryonic period continue to grow and develop.''The ''second trimester'' begins in the 13th week. By about 14 weeks of pregnancy, the gender of the fetus can be identified. Women can begin to feel movement of the fetus somewhere between the 16th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. The baby grows to about 2 pounds during the ''second trimester''.''In the ''third trimester'', starting in the 27th week, the baby assumes the size and characteristics of a ''newborn'' and prepares for birth. The fetus will open its eyes and breathe in the ''amniotic fluid''.' "
Your first prenatal visit with your doctor or midwife,"'You should set up an appointment with your doctor or ''midwife'' as soon as you have a positive ''pregnancy test'' result. At the initial visit, your doctor or midwife will'  Discuss your medical history and any effect this may have on your pregnancy. Estimate your due date. Perform a physical examination. Order lab work to look for any infections and to determine your blood type, immunity against certain infections, and your red blood cell count Discuss any medications you are taking, and whether you will need to alter these during pregnancy and discuss the need for vitamins or supplements during pregnancy Discuss expected weight gain, activity level, and nutrition for a healthy pregnancy Provide contact information to call in case you have any questions, or are worried that something is wrong Answer any questions you may have Set up your next appointment and discuss how often you should visit your doctor or midwife."
Which stage has the most risk of miscarriage?,"'The greatest risks of ''miscarriage'' are in the very early ''stages of pregnancy''. An estimated 25% or more of ''pregnancies'' end in the very early stages, many before a woman even knows that she is ''pregnant'' or has missed a ''menstrual period''. Most other miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy when the embryo is developing.' "
What is an electromyogram?,"'An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.''EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs), ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (''ALS''), ''myasthenia gravis'', ''disc herniation'', and others.'  "
Why is an EMG test done?,"'An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle ''weakness''. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because of ''pain'' or lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.'  "
How is an intramuscular EMG done?,"'A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.''Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.''After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).''The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each muscle ''fiber'' that contracts produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.' "
Is an EMG painful?,"'Yes. There is some discomfort at the time the needle electrodes are inserted. They feel like shots (intramuscular injections), although nothing is injected during an EMG. Afterwards, the muscle may feel a little sore for up to a few days.'  "
How do you prepare for an intramuscular EMG?,"""For adults, no special preparation is needed. For infants and children, the physical and psychological preparation depends on the child's age, behavior, and prior experience. (For instance, has the child been traumatized by another medical or dental procedure?)"" "
What other test is done during an intramuscular EMG?,"""A nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is often done at the same time as an EMG. In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated while a second electrode detects the electrical impulse 'down-stream' from the first. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease.''The NCV test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as neuropathy) or conditions whereby muscles are affected by nerve injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome''). Normal body temperature must be maintained for the NCV test, because low body temperatures slow nerve conduction.''Previous contributing authors and editors: Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor: Barbara K. Hecht, Ph.D.' "
What is borderline personality disorder (BPD)?,"'Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a ''mental illness'"" that is part of the group of mental illnesses called personality disorders. Like other personality disorders, it is characterized by a consistent pattern of thinking, feeling, and interacting with others and with the world that tends to result in significant problems for the sufferer. Specifically, BPD is associated with a pattern of unstable ways of seeing oneself, feeling, behaving, and relating to other people that markedly interferes with the individual's ability to function. Also, as with other personality disorders, the person is usually an adolescent or adult before they can be assessed as meeting full symptom criteria for BPD.""'Historically, BPD has been thought to be a set of symptoms that includes both mood problems (neuroses) and distortions of reality (psychosis) and therefore was thought to be on the borderline between mood problems and ''schizophrenia''. However, it is now understood that while the symptoms of BPD may straddle those symptom complexes, this illness is more closely related to other personality disorders in terms of how it may develop and occur within families. BPD is now understood to occur equally in men and women in the general population, while mostly in women in groups of people who are receiving mental health treatment (clinical populations). The frequency with which this disorder occurs is also thought to be considerably higher than previously thought, affecting nearly 6% of adults over the course of a lifetime.'  "
What other disorders often occur with BPD?,"'Men with BPD are more likely to also have a substance-related disorder and women with this illness are more likely to suffer from an eating disorder. In adolescents, BPD tends to co-occur with more anxious and peculiar personality disorders like schizotypal and passive aggressive personality disorder, respectively. Adults who have ''antisocial personality disorder'', also colloquially called sociopaths, may be more likely to also have BPD. Interestingly, even people who have some symptoms (traits) of BPD but do not meet full diagnostic criteria for the illness can have traits of both BPD and ''narcissistic personality disorder''.''While there has been some controversy as to whether or not BPD is truly its own disorder or a variation of ''bipolar disorder'', research supports the theory that BPD, like virtually every medical or other mental health disorder, can present in nearly as many unique and complex ways as there are people who have it. In other words, some individuals with BPD will have that disorder alone, while others will have it in combination with bipolar or another mental disorder. Still others will appear to have BPD but really qualify for the diagnosis of ''bipolar disorder'' and vice versa.''Obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'') can also co-occur with BPD. It is thought to be particularly true of people who have ''OCD'' and bipolar disorder. BPD is not recognized worldwide. It is most closely diagnosed as emotionally unstable personality disorder in the International Classification of Disease, or ICD-10. Although countries like China and India recognize mental disorders that have some symptoms in common with BPD, its existence is not formally recognized.' "
What causes borderline personality disorder?,"'Although there is no specific cause for BPD, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological predispositions, ways of understanding the world, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Biologically, people with BPD are more likely to have abnormalities in the size of the hippocampus, in the size and functioning of the amygdala, and in the functioning of the frontal lobes, which are the areas of the brain that are understood to regulate emotions and integrate thoughts with emotions. Although some research indicates that people with BPD seem to have areas of the brain that are more and less active compared to individuals who do not have the disorder, other research contradicts that.''While BPD is not thought to be genetic, it can somewhat run in families. Psychologically, BPD seems to make a person more vulnerable to having unstable ''moods'', particularly impulsive aggression. Socially, this disorder predisposes sufferers to developing insecurity, to be more likely to excessively expect to be criticized or rejected and negatively personalize disinterest or ''inattention'' from other people. These tendencies result in BPD sufferers having significantly impaired social relationships. In addition to these problems, people with BPD are more likely to have suffered from ''trauma'' in the form of childhood abuse or neglectful ''parenting''.' "
What are the risk factors for borderline personality disorder?,"'Adults who come from families of origin where divorce, neglect, sexual abuse, substance abuse, or death occurred are at higher risk of developing BPD. In children, the risk for developing this disorder appears to increase when they have a learning problem or certain temperaments. Adolescents who develop ''alcohol abuse'' or ''addiction'' are also apparently at higher risk of developing BPD compared to those who do not.' "
What are borderline personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'As per the ''DSM'' (''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'') definition, in order to qualify for the diagnosis of BPD, an individual must have at least five of the following symptoms:'   Distorted, unstable self-image, in that they may drastically and rapidly change in the way they understand their own likes, dislikes, strengths, challenges, goals, and even their basic value as a person, even to the point of having feelings of worthlessness Repeatedly unstable relationships, in that individuals with this disorder repeatedly, rapidly, and drastically change from seeing another person as nearly perfect (idealizing) to seeing the same person as being bad or nearly worthless (devaluing) Unstable emotions (affects), in that the sufferer experiences marked, rapid mood swings (for example, severe depression/dysphoria, guilt, anger, irritability, joy, euphoria, anxiety, including panic attacks and sadness) that are stress related, even if the stresses may be seen as minor or negligible to others Frantic efforts to avoid loneliness or being abandoned, whether the abandonment is real or imagined Significant impulsivity (the person tends to act before thinking), in at least two aspects that can be self-damaging (for example, sexual behaviors, eating or spending habits, driving behaviors, or in the use of substances) Repeated self-mutilating behaviors, thoughts of suicide, suicidal behaviors, threats, or attempts Chronic, persistent feelings of emptiness Inappropriate, intense hostility or anger, a lack of restraint or other difficulty managing those or other potentially negative emotions when they occur Transient, stress-related paranoid thoughts or severe dissociation (lapses in memory)"
How do health care professionals diagnose borderline personality disorder?,"'There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has BPD. People who are concerned that they may suffer from BPD might further consider that possibility by taking a self-test, either an online or printable test. To determine the presence of this disorder, practitioners conduct a mental health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms, also called diagnostic criteria, described previously. As with any mental health assessment, the health care practitioner will usually work toward ruling out other mental disorders, including mood problems, ''depression'', ''anxiety'' disorders including ''anxiety'' attacks or generalized ''anxiety'', eating disorders such as ''binge eating disorder'', ''bulimia'' and ''anorexia'', and other personality disorders including ''narcissistic personality disorder'', dependent personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder, drug-abuse problems as well as problems being in touch with reality, like ''schizophrenia'' or delusional disorder. Besides determining if the person suffers from BPD, the mental health professional may assess that while some symptoms (traits) of the disorder are present, the person does not fully qualify for the condition.'""The professional will also likely try to ensure that the person is not suffering from a medical problem that may cause emotional symptoms. The mental health practitioner will therefore often inquire about when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood testing, and any other tests that a medical professional deems necessary to ensure that the individual is not suffering from a medical condition instead of or in addition to emotional symptoms. Due to the use of a mental health interview in establishing the diagnosis and the fact that this illness can be quite resistant to treatment, it is of great importance that the practitioner conduct a thorough evaluation and interview family members, when appropriate with the patient's permission. This is to assure that the person is not incorrectly assessed as having BPD when he or she does not."" "
What is the treatment for borderline personality disorder?,"'Clinical trials'' have determined that different forms of psychotherapy have been found to effectively treat BPD. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a method of psychotherapy in which the therapist specifically addresses four areas that tend to be particularly problematic for individuals with BPD: self-image, impulsive behaviors, mood instability, and problems in relating to others. To address those areas, treatment with DBT tries to build four major behavioral skill areas: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.'""Another psychotherapy approach that is specifically designed to treat BPD is mentalization-based treatment. Based on understanding of how, when, and the quality of attachments people form, its goal is to improve the person's ability to understand his or her own and others' mental states. This treatment approach uses weekly individual therapy and group sessions over 18 months.""'Talk therapy that focuses on helping the person understand how their thoughts and behaviors affect each other (cognitive behavioral therapy or CBT) has also been found to be effective treatment for BPD. Schema therapy, also called schema-focused cognitive therapy, is based on a theory that many maladaptive ways of thinking (cognitions) are the result of past experiences. This approach to psychotherapy has also been found to alleviate the symptoms of BPD.'""Other psychotherapy approaches that have been used to address BPD include interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and psychoanalytic therapy. IPT is a type of psychotherapy that addresses how the person's symptoms are related to the problems that person has in relating to others. Psychoanalytic therapy, which seeks to help the individual understand and better manage his or her ways of defending against negative emotions, has been found to be effective in addressing BPD, especially when the therapist is more active or vocal than in traditional psychoanalytic treatment and when this approach is used in the context of current rather than past relationships. Considered a form of psychodynamic psychotherapy, transference-focused psychotherapy involves the therapist clarifying, confronting, and interpreting the evolving reactions that the person with BPD has toward the therapist that are thought to be a repetition of the person's previous relationships (transference). Some BPD sufferers are found to benefit from this form of therapy, as well.""'The use of psychiatric medications, like antidepressants (for example, ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], ''paroxetine'' [''Paxil''], ''citalopram'' [''Celexa''], ''escitalopram'' [''Lexapro''], ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix) ''venlafaxine'' [''Effexor''], ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), ''duloxetine'' [''Cymbalta''], vilazodone (Viibryd) or ''trazodone'' [''Desyrel'']), mood stabilizers (for example, ''divalproex'' sodium [''Depakote''], ''carbamazepine'' [''Tegretol''], or ''lamotrigine'' [''Lamictal'']), or antipsychotics (for example, ''olanzapine'' [''Zyprexa''], ''risperidone'' [''Risperdal''], ''aripiprazole'' [''Abilify''], paliperidone [Invega], iloperidone [Fanapt], asenapine [Saphris]), lurasidone (''Latuda''), or brexpiprazole (Rexulti) may be useful in addressing some of the symptoms of BPD but do not manage the illness in its entirety. On a positive note, some women who suffer from both BPD and bipolar disorder may experience a decrease in how irritable and angry they feel, as well as a decrease in how often and severely they become aggressive when treated with a mood-stabilizer medication like Depakote. On the other hand, the use of medications in the treatment of individuals with BPD may sometimes cause more harm than good. For example, while people with BPD may experience suicidal behaviors no more often than other individuals with a severe mental illness, they often receive more medications and therefore suffer from more side effects. Also, given how frequently many sufferers of BPD experience suicidal feelings, great care is taken to avoid the medications that can be dangerous if taken in overdose.''Partial hospitalization is an intervention that involves the individual with mental illness being in a hospital-like treatment center during the day but returning home each evening. In addition to providing a safe environment, support and frequent monitoring by mental health professionals, partial hospitalization programs allow for more frequent mental health interventions like professional assessments, psychotherapy, medication treatment, as well as development of a treatment plan for after discharge from the facility. While funding a long-term stay in a partial hospitalization facility may be difficult, studies show that when it is provided using a psychoanalytic or psychodynamic approach, it may help the person with BPD enjoy a decrease in the severity of general discontent, anxiety, ''depression'', and inability to feel pleasure, as well as decreasing the frequency of suicide attempts and full hospitalizations. This treatment may also help the individual develop improved relationships with others such that the BPD sufferer may be less likely to engage in social isolation. Contrary to earlier beliefs, BPD has been found to significantly improve in response to treatment with appropriate inpatient hospitalization. Family members of individuals with BPD might benefit from participation in a support group.'  "

What are borderline personality disorder complications?,"'The presence of BPD often worsens the course of another mental condition with which it occurs. For example, it tends to change the symptoms of ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' and to worsen ''depression''.''Individuals with BPD are at risk for self-destructive behaviors like self-mutilation, as well as for attempting or completing suicide. While cutting and other forms of self-harm, as well as suicidal behaviors seem to be associated with alleviating negative feelings, it is thought that self-mutilating behaviors are more an expression of anger, punishing oneself, distracting oneself, and maladaptively eliciting more normal feelings. In contrast, suicide attempts are thought to be more often associated with feeling survivors will be better off for their death. People who engage in self-mutilation are more likely to commit suicide compared to those who do not self-mutilate.''Although most individuals with a mental disorder do not engage in violent behavior, those who suffer from BPD have a somewhat increased risk for such behaviors. That risk is also increased for individuals who suffer from narcissism, antisocial personality disorder, have a history of previously engaging in violent behavior, frequent use of sedative medications, or experience several changes in their psychiatric medications in general.''Complications of BPD also often involve families of the person with the disorder. For example, a parent with BPD is vulnerable to having depressive symptoms in their children.' "
What is the prognosis of people with borderline personality disorder?,"""Improvement in any personality disorder is not the same as being cured, in that while the symptoms of BPD do tend to diminish (remit) with time, some often remain. Therefore, full recovery can be difficult to achieve. But how well or poorly people with BPD progress over time seems to be influenced by how severe the disorder is at the time that treatment starts, the state of the individual's current personal relationships, whether or not the sufferer has a history of being abused as a child, as well as whether or not the person receives appropriate treatment and how long it takes for that to occur. Simultaneously suffering from depression, other emotional problems, or a low level of conscientiousness have been found to be associated with a greater likelihood of the symptoms of BPD returning (relapsing). Conversely, having steady employment or school status once symptoms of BPD subside (remit) tends to protect BPD sufferers from experiencing a future relapse.""'People with BPD are at higher risk for having long-term substance abuse. Other complications that are associated with this personality disorder include unemployment, social isolation, reckless driving, legal problems, as well as suicide attempts and completion.' "
Is it possible to prevent borderline personality disorder?,"'Societal interventions like ''prevention'' of child abuse, ''domestic violence'', and substance abuse in families can help decrease the occurrence of a number of very different mental health problems. In contrast, specific prevention of BPD tends to focus on recognizing traits of the disorder as early as possible, followed by intensive treatment.' "

Facts you should know about emotional eating," Emotional eating is responding to feelings such as stress by eating high-carbohydrate, high-calorie foods with low nutritional value. The quantity of food that is consumed is the primary difference between emotional eating and binge eating. Like most emotional symptoms, emotional eating is thought to result from a number of factors rather than a single cause. There are a number of potential warning signs for emotional eating, or stress-eating. Health professionals assess emotional eating by screening for physical and mental health issues. Overcoming emotional eating involves teaching the individual healthier ways to view food and develop better eating habits (such as mindful eating), recognize their triggers for engaging in this behavior, and develop other more appropriate ways to prevent and alleviate stress. When untreated, emotional overeating can cause obesity, problems with weight loss, and even lead to food addiction. Reducing stress, using food as sustenance rather than as a way to solve problems, and using constructive ways to handle emotions can help to prevent emotional eating."
What is emotional eating?,"'Emotional eating is the tendency of its sufferers to respond to stressful, difficult feelings by eating, even when not experiencing physical hunger. Emotional eating or emotional hunger is often a craving for high-calorie or high-carbohydrate foods that have minimal nutritional value. The foods that emotional eaters crave are often referred to as comfort foods, like ice cream, cookies, ''chocolate'', chips, French fries, and pizza. About 40% of people tend to eat more when stressed, while about 40% eat less and 20% experience no change in the amount of food they eat when exposed to stress. Consequently, stress can be associated with both ''weight gain'' and ''weight loss''.''While emotional eating can be a symptom of what mental health professionals call atypical ''depression'', many people who do not have ''clinical depression'' or any other mental health issue engage in this behavior in response to momentary feelings or chronic stress. This behavior is highly common and is significant since it can interfere with maintaining a healthy ''diet'' and contribute to obesity.'  "
What is the difference between emotional eating and binge eating?,"'The primary difference between emotional eating and binge eating involves the amount of food that is consumed. While both may involve a sense of trouble controlling a craving for food, emotional eating may involve consuming from moderate to great amounts of food and may be the only symptom that a person has or be part of an emotional illness like ''depression'', ''bulimia'', or ''binge eating disorder''. ''Binge eating disorder'' is a distinctive ''mental illness'' that is characterized by recurrent episodes of ''compulsive overeating'', in that affected people uncontrollably eat an amount of food that is significantly larger than that which most people eat in a distinct period of time (for example, over two hours), even when they are not hungry. The person with ''binge eating disorder'' may eat each much faster than normal, conceal the amount they eat out of shame, and may feel disgusted by their eating after doing so. In order to qualify for this diagnosis, the binges must occur an average of once per week over three months.' "
"What are causes, triggers, or risk factors for emotional eating?","'Like most emotional symptoms, emotional eating is thought to be the result of a number of factors rather than one single cause. Some research is consistent with girls and women being at higher risk for ''eating disorders'', showing they are at higher risk for emotional eating. However, other research indicates that in some populations, men are more likely to eat in response to feeling ''depression'' or anger, and women were more likely to eat excessively in response to failing a ''diet''.'""It is thought that the increase in the hormone cortisol that is one of the body's responses to stress is similar to the medication ""'prednisone'"" in its effects. Specifically, both tend to trigger the body's stress (fight or flight) response, including increased ""'heart'' and ''breathing'' rate, blood flow to muscles, and visual acuity. Part of the stress response often includes ''increased appetite'' to supply the body with the fuel it needs to fight or flee, resulting in cravings for so-called comfort foods. People who have been subjected to chronic rather than momentary stress (like job, school, or family stress, exposure to crime or abuse) are at risk for having chronically high levels of cortisol in their bodies, contributing to developing chronic emotional-eating patterns.''Psychologically, people who tend to connect food with comfort, power, positive feelings, or for any other reasons than providing fuel to their body can be prone to emotional eating. They may eat to fill an emotional void, when physically full, and engage in mindless eating. Some people whose emotions cause them to eat may have been raised to connect food with feelings instead of sustenance, particularly if food was scarce or often used a reward or punishment, or as a substitute for emotional intimacy.' "
What are warning signs of emotional eating?,"'Warning signs for emotional eating include a tendency to feel hunger intensely and all of a sudden, rather than gradually as occurs with a true physical need to eat that is caused by an empty stomach. Emotional eaters tend to crave junk foods rather than seeking to eat balanced meals, and the urge to eat is usually preceded by stress or an uncomfortable emotion of some kind, like boredom, sadness, anger, guilt, or frustration. Other hallmarks of emotional eating are that the sufferer may feel a lack of control while eating and often feels guilty for what they have eaten.'  "
What kind of specialists treat emotional eating?,"'A number of different health care professionals evaluate and treat emotional eating and may also help with ''weight loss'' when this contributes to ''overweight'' or obesity. As this symptom can occur at nearly anytime across the life span, everyone from pediatricians, family practitioners, and other primary care physicians may address this problem. Nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants may be involved in caring for emotional-eating sufferers. Mental health professionals who are often involved in assessing and treating this issue include psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, and licensed counselors. While any one of these practitioners may care for people who engage in emotional eating, more than one may work together to help the person overcome this symptom.' "
How do health care providers diagnose emotional eating?,"'The diagnosis of emotional eating is made after first ensuring that the sufferer has had a physical examination and lab work to be certain that the symptom is not part of some genetic or other medical condition like ''Prader-Willi syndrome''. As part of the mental health aspect of the examination, the patient may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of emotional eating. Thorough exploration of any history of mental health symptoms will be conducted such that emotional eating can be distinguished from other eating disorders like ''bulimia'', binge eating, or pica. A mental health professional will also explore whether other forms of mental illness are present.' "
What is the treatment for emotional eating?,"'Overcoming emotional eating tends to involve teaching the sufferer healthier ways to view food and develop better eating habits, recognize their triggers for engaging in this behavior, and develop appropriate ways to prevent and alleviate stress.''An important step in managing stress is ''exercise'', since regular physical activity tends to dampen the production of stress chemicals, even leading to a decrease in ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and ''insomnia'' in addition to decreasing the tendency to engage in emotional eating.''Engaging in meditation and other relaxation techniques is also a powerful way to manage stress and therefore decrease emotional eating. Therefore, engaging in one or two meditation sessions a day can have lasting beneficial effects on health, even decreasing ''high blood pressure'' and heart rate.''Refraining from ''drug use'' and consuming no more than moderate amounts of ''alcohol'"" are other important ways to successfully manage stress since many of these substances heighten the body's response to stress. Also, indulging in use of those substances often prevents the person from facing their problems directly so they are not able to develop effective ways to cope with or eliminate the stress.""'Other lifestyle changes that can decrease stress include taking breaks at home and at work. Refrain from over-scheduling yourself. Learn to recognize and respond to your stress triggers. Take regular days off at intervals that are right for you. Structure your life to achieve a comfortable way to respond to the unexpected.''For those who may need help dealing with stress, stress-management counseling in the form of individual or group therapy can be very useful. Stress counseling and group therapy have proven to reduce ''stress symptoms'' and improve overall health.''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (''CBT'') has been found to be effective as part of treatment for combating emotional eating. This approach helps to alleviate stress by helping the individual change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals:''If stress produces a full-blown psychiatric problem, like ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), clinical depression, or ''anxiety'' disorders, then psychotropic medications, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can be extremely useful. Examples of SSRIs include ''sertraline'', (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), or ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'').'""Overeaters' Anonymous is a longstanding self-help group that can be an important resource for developing healthier ways to view food and recognizing and coping with triggers for engaging in emotional eating. Nutritionists, therapists, and other support groups can be other invaluable resources.""  Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote the person's cooperation with the treatment process. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence the individual's behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the sufferer to emotional eating. A variation of the cognitive component of therapy is teaching mindfulness, paying nonjudgmental attention to the present moment. Mindfulness involves thinking more reflectively, increasing one's emotional awareness, and tends to lead to an increased ability to separate one's emotions from hunger. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the person how to stop emotional eating and use more effective strategies for dealing with problems."
What is the prognosis of emotional eating?,"'Left untreated, emotional overeating can lead to complications, like difficulties achieving weight loss, obesity, and even to the development of food addiction. On the other hand, people who are prone to emotional eating are also often more responsive to stress reduction in correcting their tendency to emotionally eat compared to individuals who tend to eat less when exposed to stress.' "
Is it possible to prevent emotional eating?,"'The ''prevention'' of emotional eating primarily involves reducing stress, using constructive ways to understand and manage emotions, and by using food as sustenance rather than a way to solve problems (eating to live rather than living to eat). Research also shows that thinking about the future rather than staying focused on satisfying food cravings tends to prevent emotional eating. Other ways to prevent emotional eating behaviors include engaging in meditation, ''exercise'', and other constructive stress prevention and ''stress management techniques'', as well as avoiding ''caffeine'', alcohol, or ''drugs''.' "
What is emphysema?,"'Emphysema is a ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') that presents as an abnormal and permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal ''bronchioles''. It frequently occurs in association with obstructive pulmonary problems and ''chronic bronchitis''. It is unusual for someone to have pure emphysema unless it is a result of genetic abnormalities. Most people have some combination of emphysema and chronic ''bronchitis'' with varying degrees of ''airway'' bronchospasm. This condition is commonly referred to as ''COPD'' (and in the United Kingdom, as ''chronic obstructive lung disease'', ''COLD'').''There are three morphological types of emphysema; 1) ''centriacinar'', 2) ''panacinar'', and 3) ''paraseptal''.'   Centriacinar begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally mainly in the upper half of the lungs and is usually associated with long-standing cigarette smoking. Panacinar predominates in the lower half of the lungs and destroys the alveolar tissue and is associated with homozygous alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disease. Paraseptal emphysema preferentially localizes around the septae of the lungs or pleura, often associated with inflammatory processes, like prior lung infections."
What are the four stages of emphysema?,'Emphysema staging helps determine how much lung damage is present and how severe it is. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) uses FEV1 measurements to help with this determination:' 
What causes emphysema?,"'As stated previously in the risk factors section, there can be many causes for the development of emphysema. However, the majority of cases of emphysema (''COPD'') in the United States and other countries are caused by exposure to ''cigarette'"" smoke. Although genetics may play a role, the inflammation mediated by the body's cells (neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes) is usually triggered by exposure to inflammatory compounds, many of which are found in tobacco smoke. The response of the body's immune system leads to destruction of elastin and other structural elements in the lungs, ultimately producing areas in the lungs that cannot function normally.""'People with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency have an ''inherited'' autosomal condition that results in increased breakdown of elastin in the lungs, resulting in COPD (emphysema). When foreign irritants and substances enter the alveoli, usually by ''inhalation'', an inflammatory process is initiated. Chemical messages are sent out recruiting white cells to remove this foreign material. These cells release enzymes that destroy this substance. Normally, these enzymes, often trypsins (protein desolving enzymes) work to remove this material. The body has anti-trypsin enzymes that destroy the trypsin when the foreign substance is no more. In the case of the genetic alpha one antitrypsin deficiency, these enzymes continue to work unabated destroying normal adjacent lung tissue, resulting in emphysema. This is often referred to as the ""innocent bystander"" effect.'

What are the risk factors for emphysema?,"'The major factors that increase the risk for developing emphysema are:''Smoking'': ''Smoking'' is one of the major risk factors for developing emphysema; the risk increases as the number of years the person has been smoking increases, and is related to the amount of tobacco smoked (for example, three cigarettes a day versus a pack and a half per day); smoking is a major risk factor also for developing ''lung cancer''.''Exposure to ''secondhand smoke'': the risk factors or emphysema increase for people exposed to ''secondhand smoke'' according to the number of years exposed to secondhand smoke, and the amount of smoke the person is exposed to.''Exposure to fumes or dust in the environment:'' People that work in close association with chemical fumes or dusts generated in mining, chemical plants or other industries are higher risks for developing emphysema; these risks are further increased if the person smokes tobacco.''Pollution:'' Air pollution caused by fumes from vehicles, electrical generating plants that use coal and other fumes produce increases the risk of emphysema.''In the underdeveloped parts of the world'', ''indoor air pollution'' primarily from open wood flames used for cooking is the primary mechanism for acquiring emphysema.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of emphysema?,"'Emphysema is a progressive disease with the most common and characteristic symptoms of ''cough'' and shortness of breath caused by prolonged smoke exposure.''Affected individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency tend to develop symptoms of emphysema at earlier ages. Emphysema is a subtype of ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD in the US; COLD, chronic obstructive lung disease in the United Kingdom). Most patients, except in those in whose disease is the result of a genetic deficiency (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency), have variable manifestations of the different components of COPD which include:''Each of the subtypes has characteristic symptoms; those primarily associated with emphysema are shortness of breath and ''wheezing''. Initially the shortness of breath (dyspnea) occurs with activity; as time continues and the disease progresses, the episodes of dyspnea occur more frequently eventually occurring at rest making routine daily activities difficult to perform and thus alters the lifestyle.'

How is emphysema diagnosed?,"'As is the case with most illnesses, the health-care professional will take a careful history to learn about the lung and ''breathing'' symptoms.''Physical examination will concentrate on the lung findings, but may also include the ''heart'' and the circulatory system.''Oximetry''Oximetry is a non-invasive test, in which a sensor is taped or clipped onto a finger or earlobe to measure the percentage of ''red blood cells'' that have oxygen. This value is usually greater than 92%. Results less than 90% may signal the need for supplemental oxygen for home use.''A complete blood cell count (''CBC'') may be performed to check for an increase in the number of red blood cells. In response to lower blood oxygen concentrations, the body manufactures more red blood cells to try to deliver as much oxygen as possible to cells.''Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels may be measured to look for the genetic form of emphysema.''An arterial blood ''gas'' test will measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and combined with other measurements can help the healthcare provider decide whether the body has been able to adapt to the lower oxygen concentrations in the body. In some laboratories, the arterial blood gas result will include a carbon monoxide percentage, most often found in the body because of smoking. For each ''hemoglobin'' molecule that has carbon monoxide attached, there is one less available that can carry oxygen.''The arterial blood gas can also give parameters to establish the diagnosis of chronic respiratory failure. The diagnosis of chronic respiratory can be made when the measured oxygen level drops below 60 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) and the carbon dioxide level rises above 50 mm Hg, the diagnosis of chronic respiratory failure can be made.''A plain ''chest X-ray'' may show lungs that have become too inflated and have lost normal lung markings, consistent with destruction of alveoli and lung tissue.''A ''CT scan'' can reveal more detail regarding the amount of lung destruction but is not a normal part of the evaluation of patients with emphysema.''Pulmonary function tests or ''spirometry'' can measure the air flow into and out of the lungs and be used to predict the severity of emphysema. By blowing into a machine, the amount of air that is moved and how quickly it moves can be calculated and provides information about lung damage. Results are compared to a ""normal"" person of the same age, sex, and size.''Some measurements include:'   How long has the shortness of breath been present? What makes it better? What makes it worse? Has there been an infection recently? Have the symptoms been getting more severe? Does the patient smoke? Does the patient have exposure to secondhand smoke or other toxic fumes? Are there other exposures of diseases that may be contributing to the shortness of breath? Is there a family history of lung disease? Is there an increased respiratory rate? Is the patient short of breath just sitting in the examination room? In addition to the ribs and the diaphragm, is the patient using the intercostal muscles (those between the ribs) and neck muscles to breathe? When used, accessory muscles cause the appearance of indrawing, where there is observable sucking in of muscles during the breathing cycle. This is normally seen in people who have just exerted themselves as the body recovers from exercise or work. In patients with emphysema it may be observed at rest. Does the chest appear enlarged or barrel-shaped? Does the chest cavity sound hollower than it should? Does exhalation take longer than it should? Since the elasticity of the lung has been lost, it takes longer for air to be forced out in the breathing cycle. Is the movement of the diaphragm decreased? Is the patient cyanotic (having a blue tinge to the skin color signifying lack of oxygen in the blood)? When listening to the lungs, are there wheezes present, especially if the patient is asked to exhale quickly? Is clubbing present? This is a characteristic change in the fingernails and tips of the fingers associated with lung disease and chronic hypoxia. FVC (forced vital capacity): the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after the largest breath possible. FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second): the amount of air that is forcibly exhaled in 1 second. Even though total air exhalation may be less affected, as the lung loses its elasticity, it takes longer for the air to get out and FEV1 becomes a good marker for disease severity. FEV (forced expiratory volume): can be measured throughout the exhalation cycle often at 25%, 50%, and 75% to help measure function of different sized bronchi and bronchioles. PEF (peak expiratory flow): maximal speed of air during exhalation. DLCO (diffusion capacity): measures how much carbon monoxide can be inhaled and absorbed into the bloodstream within a period of time. A small amount of tracer carbon monoxide is inhaled and then quickly exhaled. The amount of carbon monoxide in the exhaled air is measured and determines how well the lungs work in absorbing the gas. This helps determine and measure lung function."
What is the treatment for emphysema?,"'The first treatment for patients with emphysema is ''smoking cessation'' if they are currently smoking tobacco. This is a difficult lifestyle change for many patients, and without support from their doctors, family members, and friends; this most important treatment will likely fail. The best way to accomplish this difficult task is outlined in the ""quitting smoking"" section. In addition, there is pharmacological and surgical therapy available for emphysema patients and these therapies will be discussed in the next sections.'

  "
Quitting smoking,"'Quitting smoking is the most effective therapy for people with emphysema. Consequently, successful cessation is a major goal for people with COPD/emphysema. This goal usually can be reached with cooperation between the doctor, patient, family members, and friends. Quitting smoking usually requires patient education about the risks of smoking, methods to help the patient ''quit smoking'' (including a target date to quit), and follow-up support. Many people will relapse, but they still should be encouraged to try to change their lifestyle and attempt to quit again.''Many people may benefit from both self-help and group smoking cessation programs. Patients need to understand that ''nicotine'' is responsible for their ''addiction'' to smoking and may benefit from a program that allows them to slowly withdraw from nicotine addiction. There are several types of pharmacological interventions such as nicotine chewing gum, transdermal nicotine patches, and other treatments such as ''varenicline'' (''Chantix'') and ''Zyban'' that may be used to help the patient overcome their nicotine addiction.'  "
Emphysema medications,"'Bronchodilators'' are used to relax the smooth muscles that surround the bronchioles, allowing the breathing tubes to dilate and air to flow more freely. These medications can be inhaled using an MDI (metered dose inhaler), powder inhaler devices, or a nebulizer machine These medications can either be short or long acting.''The short acting bronchodilators include the ''albuterol'' agents (''Ventolin HFA'', Proventil HFA, and Pro Air HFA) and the anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide (''Atrovent'').''As an aside, in the past patients have been instructed to count the number of puffs used from these devices or ""float"" the inhaler in water to determine the amount of remaining medicine available. The HFA devices cannot be floated, and counting of the number of puffs is the only available method of determining the continued presence of medication. One device, Ventolin HFA, has a built in counter. It is important to understand that the mere presence of propellant coming from the inhaler does not necessarily mean that medication is present. ''The long acting agents include ''salmeterol'' (''Serevent''), formoterol (''Foradil'') and tiotropium (Spiriva). Often the long acting ''bronchodilator'' is used for controlling the symptoms of emphysema as maintenance therapy, and the short acting one is used when symptoms flare up (rescue therapy).''It is important that the patient know which medication is prescribed, since long acting inhalers cannot be used for rescue, because of their delayed onset of action. Sometimes, patients will seek medical care in an extremely ill state because they have been using the long-acting controller drug as their rescue inhaler. There are 120 or 200 puffs in a short acting MDI, and one puffer should last a significant amount of time. If not, the emphysema is not under control and the patient and health care professional will work on long acting solutions. Many patients with emphysema also have home nebulizers that can deliver albuterol and ipratroprium as part of their control regimen.''Since most patients do not have pure emphysema and usually also have other components of COPD, combined therapy is often prescribed which includes a long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled ''corticosteroid''. The inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) helps suppress the inflammatory components of COPD. While the bronchodilators work to relax the smooth muscle surrounding the breathing tubes, steroids decrease the inflammation within the walls of the tubes themselves.''These agents like Advair, which is a mixture of salmeterol (Serevent) and fluticasone (Flovent), an ICS, simplify treatment by combining both therapies into a single inhaler device. Another combination inhaler is formoterol and ''budesonide'' (Symbicort).''Many patients with emphysema need only take steroid inhalers when their symptoms flare, but others require daily therapy. ''Corticosteroids'' have direct action on the lung tissue and absorption of inhaled corticosteroids into the blood stream is minimal. ''Prednisone'', an oral corticosteroid, can be taken in addition to the inhaled steroid should further anti-inflammatory effects be required. Moreover, these may be prescribed to be taken only during an acute flare of the emphysema, or may be required to be taken on a daily basis by those patients with more severe disease.''In emergency situations, corticosteroids may be injected intravenously.''Since patients with emphysema are at risk for infections like ''pneumonia'', antibiotics may be prescribed when the usually clear sputum changes color, or when the patient presents with systemic signs of an infection (''fever'', ''chills'', ''weakness'').''As the disease progresses, patients may require supplemental oxygen to be able to function. Often it begins with nighttime use, then with exercise, and as the disease worsens, the need to use oxygen during the day for routine activities increases.'""The decision to prescribe oxygen depends upon the patient's symptoms as well as results of other tests, including oximetry, pulmonary function tests, and arterial blood gas measurements."" "
Surgery for emphysema,"'Bullectomy, the removal of bullae (thin-walled air – filled areas that may compress normal lung tissue) is one method to reduce some of the symptoms of emphysema/COPD.''Lung volume reduction surgery is another surgical technique. It may be an option for patients with severe ''emphysema symptoms'' that do not respond to attempts at medical therapy. In this technique, about 20% to 30% of tissue from both lungs is removed; the area removed is usually the lung tissue sections that have minimal or no function.''Finally, lung transplantation is a possibility for certain selected patients. Patients with COPD/emphysema are the largest category of patients that undergo lung transplantation.' "
Pulmonary rehabilitation for emphysema,"""Pulmonary rehabilitation involves methods to improve the patient's quality of life by keeping airways open and preventing or reducing secondary complications such as infections and recurrent respiratory symptoms. Pulmonary rehabilitation involves input from doctors and nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, exercise physiologists, and many others. The goal of pulmonary rehabilitation is to educate the patient and family about the disease process, encourage routine exercise increasing in graded increments, smoking cessation, medications and medical management, respiratory and chest physiotherapy, and exercises to improve breathing. In addition, the program should offer psychological and social support for the patient. Pulmonary rehabilitation can teach patients how better to control their disease and live a more vibrant and enjoyable life."" "
What is the life expectancy and outlook for someone with emphysema?,"'Emphysema is a disease that affects the quality of life and not necessarily the quantity of life. The goal for the treatment of emphysema is to prevent further lung damage and to maximize the function of the remaining healthy lung tissue.''Symptoms of emphysema occur because the body is not being supplied with adequate oxygen and because it takes significant effort to take deeper breaths. These both contribute to the very miserable sensation of constantly feeling short of breath.''There are no studies that have been able to predict mortality from emphysema, but studies from the American Lung Association and the US Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' report that 133,000 people died from COPD in 2009. The most recent National Health Interview Survey performed in 2011 found that 4.7 million people had been diagnosed with emphysema and that 24.1 million people had evidence of impaired lung function.''The BODE score can help measure the quality of life and prognosis for future functions.''Neither the GOLD nor BODE scores can predict longevity or mortality but are guidelines to assess the severity of emphysema and how it may affect future lifestyle.'

What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)?,"'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a disorder that causes a deficiency or absence of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein in the blood. AAT is made in the liver and sent through the bloodstream to the lungs, to protect the lungs from damage. Having low levels of ATT (or no ATT) can allow the lungs to become damaged, making ''breathing'' hard. Age of onset and severity of AATD can vary based on how much ATT an affected person is missing. In adults, symptoms may include ''shortness of breath''; reduced ability to ''exercise''; ''wheezing''; respiratory infections; ''fatigue''; vision problems; and ''weight loss''. Some people have ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') or ''asthma''. Liver disease (''cirrhosis'') may occur in affected children or adults. Rarely, AATD can cause a skin condition called ''panniculitis'"".[1] AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene and is inherited in a codominant manner.[2] Treatment is based on each person's symptoms and may include bronchodilators; antibiotics for ""'upper respiratory tract infections''; intravenous therapy of AAT; and/or lung transplantation in severe cases.[1][3]' "
Chart of signs and symptoms of lung and liver disease caused by AATD,"'The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies.''Approximate number of patients (when available)'  "
How common is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,"'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by population. This disorder affects about 1 in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals with European ancestry. It is uncommon in people of Asian descent. Many individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are likely undiagnosed, particularly people with a lung condition called ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD). COPD can be caused by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; however, the alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is often never diagnosed. Some people with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are misdiagnosed with ''asthma''.' "
What gene mutations cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?,"'Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.''The SERPINA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin. This protein protects the body from being damaged by a powerful enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues (such as lung tissue) if not carefully controlled by alpha-1 antitrypsin. Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene can lead to a shortage (deficiency) of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein or an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase. Uncontrolled, neutrophil elastase destroys alveoli, which can lead to emphysema. The abnormal form of alpha-1 antitrypsin can also accumulate in the liver and may damage this organ.'  "
What tests diagnose AATD?,"'AATD may first be suspected in people with evidence of liver disease at any age, or lung disease (such as emphysema), especially when there is no obvious cause or it is diagnosed at a younger age.''Confirming the diagnosis involves a blood test showing a low serum concentration of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, and either:''Specialists involved in the diagnosis may include primary care doctors, pulmonologists (lung specialists), and/or hepatologists (liver specialists).[4]' detecting a functionally deficient AAT protein variant by isoelectric focusing (a method for detecting mutations); or detecting SERPINA1 gene mutations on both copies of the gene with molecular genetic testing. (This confirms the diagnosis when the above-mentioned tests are not performed or their results are not in agreement.)[3]"
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency treatment and management guidelines,"'Treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) depends on the symptoms and severity in each person. COPD and other related lung diseases are typically treated with standard therapy.[3][4] Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids can help open the airways and make breathing easier.[4]''Intravenous augmentation therapy (regular infusion of purified, human AAT to increase AAT concentrations) has been recommended for people with established fixed airflow obstruction (determined by a specific lung function test).[3] This therapy raises the level of the AAT protein in the blood and lungs.[4]''Lung transplantation may be an appropriate option for people with end-stage lung disease. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for advanced liver disease.[3]''When present, panniculitis may resolve on its own or after ''dapsone'' or ''doxycycline'' therapy. When this therapy does not help, it has responded to intravenous augmentation therapy in higher than usual doses.[3]''All people with severe AATD should have pulmonary function tests every 6 to 12 months. Those with ATT serum concentrations 10% to 20% of normal should have periodic evaluation of liver function to detect liver disease. People with established liver disease should have periodic ultrasounds of the liver to monitor for fibrotic changes and ''liver cancer'' (hepatocellular ''carcinoma'').[3]''Yearly vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcus are recommended to lessen the progression of lung disease. Vaccination against ''hepatitis A'' and B is recommended to lessen the risk of liver disease. People with AATD should avoid ''smoking'' and occupations with exposure to environmental pollutants.[3]''Parents, older and younger siblings, and children of a person with severe AATD should be evaluated to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and preventive measures.[3]' GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.

What's the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with AATD?,"'The prognosis of a genetic condition includes its likely course, duration, and outcome. When health professionals refer to the prognosis of a disease, they may also mean the chance of recovery; however, most genetic conditions are life-long and are managed rather than cured.''Disease prognosis has multiple aspects, including:'""The prognosis of a genetic condition depends on many factors, including the specific diagnosis and an individual's particular signs and symptoms. Sometimes the associated genetic change, if known, can also give clues to the prognosis. Additionally, the course and outcome of a condition depends on the availability and effectiveness of treatment and management approaches. The prognosis of very rare diseases can be difficult to predict because so few affected individuals have been identified. Prognosis may also be difficult or impossible to establish if a person's diagnosis is unknown.""'The prognoses of genetic disorders vary widely, often even among people with the same condition. Some genetic disorders cause physical and developmental problems that are so severe they are incompatible with life. These conditions may cause a ''miscarriage'' of an affected embryo or fetus, or an affected infant may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. People with less severe genetic conditions may live into childhood or adulthood but have a shortened lifespan due to health problems related to their disorder. Genetic conditions with a milder course may be associated with a normal lifespan and few related health issues.''The prognosis of a disease is based on probability, which means that it is likely but not certain that the disorder will follow a particular course.

What is COPD? What is emphysema?,"'The ''COPD'' acronym means ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''. ''COPD'' is a general term that now includes ''emphysema'', ''chronic bronchitis'', certain types of ''bronchiectasis'' and by some doctors and researchers, ''asthma''. Consequently, ''emphysema'' is a type of ''COPD''. Not all doctors agree with this evolving terminology.'  "
COPD vs. asthma symptoms and signs,"'The signs and symptoms are the same for ''COPD'' and ''emphysema'' because emphysema is a type of late-stage ''COPD''. These symptoms mainly affect the respiratory tract and include:''People often have other types of COPD, for example, ''asthma'', chronic ''bronchitis'', and ''bronchiectasis'', before they develop emphysema. Each of these types have their own characteristic symptoms and severity of symptoms, but because COPD generally progresses and worsens over time, these symptoms worsen as well.''There is quite a bit of overlap of symptoms between all of the types of COPD. Doctors consider emphysema the ""end-stage"" of COPD, where respiratory symptoms and ''shortness of breath'' can be so severe you require constant oxygen, and it becomes debilitating.'   Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Cough (usually in the AM) with some sputum Wheezing Increasing exercise intolerance"
COPD vs. asthma differences between symptoms,"'There are no differences between COPD and emphysema if you consider emphysema to be a type of end-stage of COPD. However, emphysema (or end-stage, type 3-4 COPD) has permanent destructive tissue changes seen on biopsy samples that are different from the earlier stages or types of COPD.' "
COPD vs. emphysema causes,"'If you consider COPD and emphysema as the same disease, there are no differences in the causes, for example, ''smoking'', ''secondhand smoke'', immune-mediated tissue changes, inhaling toxic substances, and/or alpha-1-''antitrypsin'' deficiency. However, by far, the number one cause of COPD (and emphysema) is ''cigarette smoking''.' "
What things worsen symptoms?,"'Things that make symptoms worse for all types of COPD, and especially emphysema are the same. COPD and emphysema are slowly progressive diseases that worsen over time (sometimes even with treatment).'   If you inhale irritants, for example, noxious chemicals or particle debris (lung tissue toxins), and/or allergens your breathing will worsen. If you continue smoking, it will cause a more rapid deterioration in your lung function and cause more severe COPD symptoms. Bacterial, fungal, or viral upper respiratory infections also will make COPD worse. If you have other health problems in addition to COPD and emphysema, for example, cardiomyopathy, obesity, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or lung cancer, your COPD and emphysema symptoms will worsen."
What are the stages of COPD?,"'There are two common staging systems for COPD, the GOLD system, and the BODE index.''The GOLD system measures your ''breathing'' air volume (FEV''1'') as compared to normal predicted breathing and designates your breathing into one of four COPD stages are:''The BODE index attempts to place your COPD into one of four survival stages based on body mass, airflow obstruction, shortness of breath, and ''exercise'' capacity by a point system.''Talk to your doctor to discuss these staging systems and how they may relate tour individual problem and treatment.' Stage 1 or Mild (80% of normal) Stage 2 or Moderate (50-80%) Stage 3 or Severe (30-50%) emphysema Stage 4 or Very severe, (less than 30%), end-stage, severe or end-stage emphysema"
What are the stages of emphysema?,"'Using the GOLD system (as used in COPD), doctors classify COPD and emphysema as stages 1-4 with 4 being the worst or most severe stage.' "
How do doctors diagnose COPD vs. emphysema?,"'Doctors use the same tests to diagnose COPD and/or emphysema. The tests may include:' Your history, family history, and physical exam Arterial blood gas Hematocrit Serum bicarbonate Alpha-1-antitrypsin level Sputum exam Chest x-ray Chest CT Pulmonary function tests (FEV1) and staging"
COPD vs. emphysema treatments,"'The treatments for both COPD and emphysema are the same:''Other medications or treatments may be helpful or needed in special circumstances, for example, alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement, or mechanical assisted breathing for a short time).''Your doctor may recommend surgery to reduce your symptoms and/or to help restore some of your lung function. Surgical procedures your doctor may discuss with you include removing the nonfunctional air sacs in your ''lungs'' (large bullae) to ''decompress'' lung tissue, lung volume reduction to decrease lung hyperinflation, endobronchial valve placement, and lung transplant.''You and your medical team (primary care, ''pulmonologist'', and surgeon) will discuss what treatments would be best for your health care.'   Stop smoking Bronchodilators (short and long acting) Long acting beta agonists Long acting muscarinic agonists Phosphodiesterase inhibitors Anti-inflammatory drugs Antibiotics (as needed) Mucolytic agents Oxygen therapy"
Will lifestyle changes slow the progression of COPD or emphysema?,"'It is possible to slow the progression of COPD/emphysema by quitting ''smoking'', medical and/or other surgical treatments, and physical therapy. However, even with aggressive and appropriate treatment often COPD will progress.' "
Is there a cure for COPD or emphysema?,"'Symptoms and complications can be treated and managed, however, here is no cure for COPD/emphysema.' "
What is the life expectancy for COPD vs. emphysema? Are they fatal?,"'The life expectancy can be estimated for COPD/emphysema by the BODE index previously mentioned. However, it is not possible to determine accurate life expectancy for these patients because of so many variables that may change. Nonetheless, types 3- 4 COPD/emphysema puts you at risk for many serious or fatal complications like ''pneumonia'' or ''heart failure''. For this reason, some doctors consider types 3-4 COPD/emphysema to be a life threatening disease.' "
Introduction,"'If you have ''emphysema'' or ''chronic bronchitis'', you know how miserable it feels when you catch a ''cold''. After all, ''breathing'' is difficult enough with achronic obstructive pulmonary disease (''COPD'""). Not only does catching a cold worsen your ability to breathe and be active, but the cold virus increases your chance of getting a more serious respiratory tract infection. Here's what you must know to stay well. "" "
What is emphysema and chronic bronchitis?,"'Emphysema'' and chronic ''bronchitis'' are chronic (long-term) lung diseases that make it hard to breathe. Both diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (''COPD''), meaning they are conditions that cause a limitation in airflow. Emphysema and chronic ''bronchitis'' can occur separately or together and are usually the result of ''cigarette smoking''. In addition, although it happens rarely, a genetic form of emphysema can occur early in adulthood, even if you never smoked. ''In the United States, ''COPD'' is vastly under diagnosed. While only 15 to 20 percent of ''smokers'' are diagnosed with COPD, experts believe the majority of smokers develop some degree of airflow obstruction. ''Emphysema comes on gradually after years of exposure to irritants such as ''cigarette'' smoke. With emphysema, the tiny air sacs in the ''lungs'' become damaged. Because the tiny sacs lose their ""stretch,"" less air gets in and out of the lungs. This causes you to feel short of breath. ''With chronic ''bronchitis'', the airways that carry air to the lungs are inflamed and produce a lot of ''mucus''. The mucus and inflammation cause the airways to narrow or become obstructed, making it difficult to breathe. Once the airways are irritated over a long period, the lining of the airways becomes thickened. This thickening of the airways results in an irritating ''cough'', hampered airflow, and lung scarring. The damaged airways then become a breeding place for ''bacterial infections'' such as ''pneumonia''. ' "
What happens with emphysema and chronic bronchitis and colds?,"'A cold is a viral respiratory illness that mainly affects your nose and throat but in some instances can affect your airways. When you have emphysema or chronic bronchitis, you already have some difficulty breathing because of the damaged airways and lungs. Catching a respiratory virus along with COPD can hinder breathing even more and can cause the following changes in your symptoms:' An increase in phlegm  An increase in the thickness or stickiness of the 
	phlegm  A change in phlegm color to yellow or green  A presence of blood in the phlegm  An increase in the severity of 
	shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing
 A general feeling of ill health  Difficulty sleeping  Increased fatigue "
Why should I take colds seriously with emphysema or chronic bronchitis?,"'Catching a cold with emphysema or chronic bronchitis may also lead to bacterial infections such as ''pneumonia''. This occurs because of the ''airway'' obstruction and the inability to cough out infected secretions of mucus. ''Sometimes, patients with COPD are hospitalized because of a respiratory infection and the worsening of their symptoms. Treatment may include inhaled medications, oxygen, and antibiotics to treat any bacterial infection. Antibiotics do not treat a cold. '""To avoid more serious problems with emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and colds, it's important to always alert your doctor if your cold symptoms get worse. Don't wait until you have more serious breathing problems to contact your doctor. "" "
Which cold treatment should I use with emphysema or chronic bronchitis?,"""First, it is important to stay on your prescribed medications for emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Then, to decide how to treat cold symptoms, it's best to talk with your doctor. You might treat the body aches and ""'fever'' associated with a cold with ''acetaminophen'' or ''ibuprofen''. In addition, you should avoid ''antihistamines'' that thicken mucus and make it even more difficult to cough up.''Most ''over-the-counter'' cold remedies are generally safe for people with emphysema and chronic bronchitis. However, decongestants raise ''blood pressure'' and some of the medications used to treat emphysema and chronic bronchitis also raise ''heart'' rate. So, use decongestants with caution.

What is a gastric emptying study?,"'The most common type of gastric emptying study is a procedure that is done by nuclear medicine physicians using radioactive chemicals that measures the speed with which food empties from the stomach and enters the small intestine. Gastric emptying studies are used for evaluating patients who are having symptoms that may be due to slow and, less commonly, rapid emptying of the stomach.  The symptoms of slow emptying are primarily ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', and abdominal fullness after eating.  The symptoms of rapid emptying are ''diarrhea'', ''weakness'', or light-headedness after eating.' "
How is a gastric emptying study done?,"""For a gastric emptying study, a patient eats a meal in which the solid component of the meal (for example, scrambled eggs or oatmeal for vegetarians), the liquid component of the meal (for example, water), or both, are mixed with a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner (acting like a Geiger counter) is placed over the patient's stomach to monitor the amount of radioactivity in the stomach for several hours after the test meal is eaten. As the radioactively-labeled food empties from the stomach, the amount of radioactivity in the stomach decreases. The rate at which the radioactivity leaves the stomach reflects the rate at which food is emptying from the stomach""'Some medications such as narcotic ''pain'' relievers and anticholinergic medications can cause a delay in emptying of the stomach, while other medications such as ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') and ''erythromycin'' can cause rapid emptying of the stomach. Medications that slow emptying of the stomach can give a falsely abnormal test result, while medications that speed up emptying of the stomach can give a falsely normal result. Therefore, medications that affect emptying of the stomach should be withheld for 72 hours before performing emptying studies.''Abnormally high blood glucose (''sugar'') levels also can slow emptying of the stomach. Therefore, it is important to control blood glucose levels to near normal levels before performing emptying studies in people with ''diabetes'' who are prone to develop high blood glucose levels.' "
When is a gastric emptying study used?,"'A gastric emptying study often is used when there is a suspicion that there is an abnormally delayed emptying of food from the stomach, medically called delayed gastric emptying. Delayed gastric emptying most commonly gives rise to abdominal discomfort after meals, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. The two most common causes of delayed gastric emptying are gastric outlet obstruction and ''gastroparesis''. ''Gastric outlet obstruction refers to a condition in which the narrow channel leading from the stomach into the small intestine through which food passes (called the pylorus) is physically blocked, and, as a result food enters the first part of the small intestine (called the duodenum) slowly or not at all. The most common causes of gastric outlet obstruction are scarring or inflammation of the pylorus from peptic ulcers, ''cancers'' of the stomach, or, occasionally, cancers near the pylorus, for example, of the pancreas or duodenum. A diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction is made by tests such as''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'' (''EGD''), abdominal ''computerized tomography'' (''CT scan''), and ''upper GI series''. ''Once gastric outlet obstruction has been excluded by appropriate testing as the cause of delayed gastric emptying, physicians then may perform a gastric emptying study to diagnose ''gastroparesis'"". Gastroparesis is a condition in which there is delayed gastric emptying, but the delay is not due to obstruction. Rather, it is due to abnormal function of the muscles of the stomach. Normal function of the stomach's muscles is necessary in order to propel food from the stomach and into the small intestine. If the muscles or the nerves that control the muscles are not working normally, food remains in the stomach. Gastroparesis is commonly caused by diseases and medications. The most common cause of gastroparesis is ""'diabetes mellitus'"", which affects the function of the stomach's nerves and muscles. Many cases of gastroparesis have no clear cause for the dysfunction. These cases are referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis.""'A gastric emptying study also may be used when there is a suspicion that there is abnormally rapid gastric emptying. Rapid gastric emptying can cause ''diarrhea'' and episodes of weakness or light-headedness following meals (referred to as the ""dumping"" syndrome). Common causes of rapid gastric emptying include surgery of the stomach and ''diabetes'' mellitus. ' "
How are the results of a gastric emptying study evaluated?,"'In patients with gastroparesis, the food and the attached radioactive material remain in the stomach longer than normal (usually hours) before emptying into the small intestine. As a result, the scanner continues to show radioactivity in the area of the stomach for hours after the test meal. If abnormally slow emptying is demonstrated, medications such as metoclopramide (Reglan) may be given to speed up the emptying and improve symptoms. If abnormally rapid emptying of the stomach is found, medications may be given to slow down emptying. ' "
Are there any side effects of a gastric emptying study?,"'There are no side effects from a gastric emptying study. The radioactive material is not absorbed into the body and is eliminated in the ''stool''. Nevertheless, gastric emptying studies as well as any other studies that utilize radioactive materials should not be performed in ''pregnant'' women because the fetus is exposed to some radioactivity. ' "
Are there other tests that can be performed instead of a gastric emptying study?,"'An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series X-ray demonstrates abnormal emptying of barium in patients with a severe emptying problem, however, it cannot diagnose abnormal emptying of a mild or moderate degree. An ''antro-duodenal motility study'' or an ''electrogastrogram'' can demonstrate abnormalities in the muscles and nerves of the stomach, but they do not directly evaluate the effects of these abnormalities on emptying of the stomach. Other experimental methods for evaluating emptying of the stomach have been described, for example, ''ultrasonography'', breath tests using fatty acids, and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) but these tests are available in very few centers.' "
What is encephalitis?,'Encephalitis is brain inflammation.'  
What causes encephalitis?,"'Exposure to viruses can occur through ''breathing'' in respiratory droplets from infected people, certain ''insect bites'', and direct skin contact.' Encephalitis is a rare condition that is most often caused by viruses (viral encephalitis). It can also be caused by noninfectious diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Behçet's disease (an autoimmune disorder). The leading cause of severe encephalitis is the herpes simplex virus. Other causes include enterovirus infections or mosquito-borne viruses.Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE),Western equine encephalitis (WEE),Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE),Japanese encephalitis, andZika virus. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), Japanese encephalitis, and Zika virus. The very young and the elderly are more likely to have more severe encephalitis."
What are the risk factors for encephalitis?,'Patients with suppressed immune systems (due to medications or diseases) have an increased risk for encephalitis.' 
Is encephalitis contagious?,"'Infectious forms of encephalitis are ''contagious''. Viral and many bacterial forms of encephalitis are ''contagious''. Several forms of bacterial encephalitis can be spread by respiratory and throat excretions. Encephalitis can also be caused by an infection in the body that spreads to the brain. Noninfectious encephalitis, such as from diseases ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"" and Behçet's disease, are not contagious."" "
What are encephalitis symptoms and signs?,"'The signs and symptoms of encephalitis can range from very mild ''flu-like symptoms'' to potentially life-threatening events. Signs and symptoms of encephalitis include''Anyone experiencing symptoms of encephalitis should see a doctor immediately.'   sudden fever, headache, vomiting, visual sensitivity to light, stiff neck and back, confusion, drowsiness, unsteady gait, irritability, loss of consciousness, poor responsiveness, seizures, muscle weakness, sudden severe dementia, and memory loss."
"What specialties of doctors treat 
encephalitis?",'People with encephalitis usually need treatment in the hospital. A family practice or general internal-medicine physician or an infectious-disease specialist will usually treat someone with encephalitis.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose encephalitis?,"'A health care professional diagnoses encephalitis after performing a thorough history and exam. The exam will incorporate special techniques to look for signs of inflammation of the membranes that surround the spinal cord and brain (meninges). The doctor will order specific tests to help determine the diagnosis.''Tests that evaluate individuals suspected of having encephalitis include cerebrospinal fluid analysis, brain scanning (such as ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' scan), and an evaluation of the blood for infection and the presence of bacteria.''The most common method of obtaining a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (or CSF) for examination is a ''spinal tap''. A spinal tap, or ''lumbar puncture'"" (LP), involves the insertion of a needle into the fluid within the spinal canal. The needle goes between the spine's bony parts until it reaches the CSF. A medical professional then collects a small amount of fluid to send to the laboratory for exam. Evaluating the CSF is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of encephalitis and to decide on the best treatment options.""'Abnormal spinal fluid results confirm the diagnosis and, in the event of an infection, by identifying the organism that caused the infection.' "
What is the treatment of encephalitis?,'People require urgent treatment with antibiotic and/or antiviral medications if a physician suspects that person has encephalitis. Patients may need to take ''sedatives'' for irritability or restlessness. Doctors may administer other medications to decrease the ''fever'' or treat ''headaches''.'  
Is it possible to prevent encephalitis? Is there an encephalitis vaccine?,"'Basic steps to avoid spread of infections (hand washing, covering mouth when ''coughing'', etc.) can help prevent encephalitis.''Some ''vaccinations'' for bacterial or viral diseases can help prevent encephalitis.' "
"What is the prognosis (outlook), and what are the complications for patients 
with encephalitis?","'The prognosis for encephalitis varies. Some cases are benign and patients recover fully. Other cases are severe. The type of infection present and how quickly treatment starts determine the prognosis. The acute phase of encephalitis may last for one to two weeks, with gradual or sudden resolution of ''fever'' and neurological symptoms. Neurological symptoms may require many months before full recovery occurs. Some patients will not fully recover.' "
What is encephalitis?,'Encephalitis'' is an inflammation of the brain tissue. Its symptoms include:' Fever Headache Muscle aches Fatigue Drowsiness Confusion Seizures Paralysis Personality changes (very common) Sudden severe dementia (memory loss) Ataxia (unable to balance oneself)
What is meningitis?,'Meningitis is an inflammation of the coverings (meninges) of the brain and the spinal cord. ''Symptoms of meningitis'' include:' Fever A sudden severe headache Neck stiffness Nausea Vomiting Decreased appetite Photosensitivity (sensitivity to light) Confusion Drowsiness
What are the causes of encephalitis and meningitis?,"'Both ''encephalitis'' and meningitis are most often caused by a virus. Meningitis can be caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites as well, but these are less common.''The ''viruses'' that cause meningitis include the ''influenza'' virus, ''mumps'', ''measles'' virus, and ''herpes'' virus..\xa0''Encephalitis can be autoimmune encephalitis as well. The inflammation in autoimmune encephalitis is caused by the attack of healthy cells of the body by the body’s immune system. Meningitis caused by an autoimmune component is not yet reported.''Encephalitis can also be caused by arboviruses—types of viruses that are transmitted through the bites of ''ticks'' and mosquitoes. Types of such encephalitis include ''West Nile virus'', Eastern equine, and rabid (caused by ''rabies'') encephalitis.' "
How are encephalitis and meningitis diagnosed?,"'Apart from the medical history, signs, and symptoms, diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis requires:''Encephalitis may require additional tests for its diagnosis. These include:' Neurological examination Blood tests Imaging tests such as computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (a fluid present in the brain and spinal cord) Electroencephalography (placing of electric, metal discs on your head to measure the electrical activity in your brain) Brain biopsy (surgical removal of brain tissue for examining it under a microscope)"
How do doctors treat encephalitis and meningitis?,'Encephalitis and meningitis are life-threatening conditions that require you to be hospitalized immediately.\xa0''The treatment of bacterial forms of meningitis and encephalitis involves a course of antibiotics.\xa0''The antivirals may be started by the doctor for viral encephalitis. The medication for control of fits and ''dexamethasone'' to control brain swelling may be given.''Viral meningitis can be treated with antiviral and antiinflammatory medications.' 
Can encephalitis and meningitis be prevented?,"'The ''vaccine'' against ''measles'', mumps, and ''rubella'' (MMR vaccine) has been seen working against encephalitis. But there is no vaccine against encephalitis caused by ticks. Though not available in the United States, it is available in Europe and Canada. The vaccine is advised for people who travel to those European regions, where tick-borne encephalitis is prevalent.''Several ''vaccines'' are available against meningitis. These include:''To avoid mosquito- or tick bites, people should' Pneumococcal vaccine Meningococcal vaccine Influenza vaccine  MMR vaccine  Restrict outdoor activities at night. Wear long-sleeved clothing when outdoors. Use insect repellents.  Get rid of stagnant water lying in the lawn areas."
What is the recovery rate for meningitis and encephalitis?,"'The time required to recover from encephalitis and meningitis depends on:\xa0''People with very mild encephalitis or meningitis can make a full recovery, although the process may be slow. Extremely severe cases may result in fatalities. Individuals with mild symptoms may recover in 15-30 days. The acute phase of encephalitis with severe symptoms may last for one to two weeks, with a gradual or sudden resolution of fever and neurological symptoms over the next few weeks. Individuals treated for bacterial meningitis typically show improvements in two to three days, though full recovery takes time. In serious cases, these diseases can cause permanent ''hearing loss'', speech loss, ''blindness'', ''memory loss'', a decline in mental abilities, and ''seizures''. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may be needed in many people to tackle residual damage to the body parts. The mortality rates differ from 20 to 75% depending on the offending organism and whether the encephalitis was treated on time or left untreated.' The type of microbe The severity of the disease How quickly treatment is given"
What is encephalopathy?,"'Encephalopathy is a term that means brain disease, damage, or malfunction. Encephalopathy can present a very broad spectrum of symptoms that range from mild, such as some ''memory loss'' or subtle personality changes, to severe, such as ''dementia'', ''seizures'', ''coma'', or death. In general, encephalopathy is manifested by an altered mental state that is sometimes accompanied by physical manifestations (for example, poor coordination of limb movements).''The term encephalopathy, in most cases, is preceded by various terms that describe the reason, cause, or special conditions of the patient that leads to brain malfunction. For example, anoxic encephalopathy means ''brain damage'' due to lack of oxygen, and ''hepatic encephalopathy'' means brain malfunction due to ''liver disease''. Additionally, some other terms either describe body conditions or syndromes that lead to a specific set of brain malfunctions. Examples of these are metabolic encephalopathy and Wernicke\'s encephalopathy (Wernicke\'s syndrome). There are over 150 different terms that modify or precede ""encephalopathy"" in the medical literature; the purpose of this article is to introduce the reader to the main categories of conditions that fall under the broad term of encephalopathy.' "
What causes encephalopathy?,"'The causes of encephalopathy are both numerous and varied.''Some examples of causes of encephalopathy include:''These examples do not cover all of the potential causes of encephalopathy but are listed to demonstrate the wide range of causes.''Although numerous causes of encephalopathy are known, the majority of cases arise from several major categories (some examples in parentheses):''Some drugs may cause encephalopathy; for example, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) may occur due to the use of drugs like ''tacrolimus'' and ''cyclosporine''. This syndrome manifests with symptoms of ''headache'', ''confusion'', and ''seizures''.' infectious (bacteria, viruses, parasites, or prions), anoxic (lack of oxygen to the brain, including traumatic causes), alcoholic (alcohol toxicity), hepatic (for example, liver failure or liver cancer), uremic (renal or kidney failure), metabolic diseases (hyper- or hypocalcemia, hypo- or hypernatremia, or hypo- or hyperglycemic), brain tumors, many types of toxic chemicals (mercury, lead, or ammonia), alterations in pressure within the brain (often from bleeding, tumors, or abscesses), and poor nutrition (inadequate vitamin B1 intake or alcohol withdrawal). infection (HIV, Neisseria meningitides, herpes, and hepatitis B and hepatitis C), liver damage (alcohol and toxins), brain anoxia or brain cell destruction (including trauma), and kidney failure (uremic)."
What are the symptoms of encephalopathy?,"'Despite the numerous and varied causes of encephalopathy, at least one symptom present in all cases is an ''altered mental state.'' The altered mental state may be subtle and develop slowly over years (for example, in ''hepatitis'' the decreased ability to draw simple designs, termed apraxia) or be profoundly obvious and develop rapidly (for example, brain anoxia leading to ''coma'' or death in a few minutes). Often, symptoms of ''altered mental status'' can present as inattentiveness, poor judgment, or poor coordination of movements.''Other serious symptoms that may occur include:''Often the severity and type of symptoms are related to the severity and cause of the brain disease or damage. For example, alcohol-induced liver damage (alcoholic ''cirrhosis'') can result in involuntary ''hand tremors'' (asterixis), while severe anoxia (lack of oxygen) may result in a coma with no movement. Other symptoms may not be as severe and maybe more localized such as cranial nerve palsies (damage to one of the 12 cranial nerves that exit the brain). Some symptoms may be very subtle and result from repeated injury to the brain tissue. For example, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), due to injuries like ''concussions'' repeatedly sustained by football players and others who play contact sports, may cause slow changes over time that are not easily diagnosed. Such injury may lead to chronic ''depression'' or other personality changes that can result in life-changing consequences.'""Even infants and children can suffer encephalopathy. Similar symptoms can occur in the perinatal period if the neonate had any compromise to brain blood flow during its development. Rasmussen's ""'encephalitis'' is a rare disease that is seen in children that progresses to intractable seizures if untreated. It may be due to autoantibody development. Another rare form of encephalopathy that usually develops in younger people (about ages 4 to 20 years) is the ''MELAS syndrome'' (""Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, ''Stroke-like episodes''"") due to faulty DNA in the patient\'s mitochondria (a tiny part within the cell that is responsible for energy conversion).'   lethargy, dementia, seizures, tremors, muscle twitching and myalgia, Cheyne-Stokes respiration (an altered breathing pattern seen with brain damage and coma), and coma."
How is encephalopathy diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of encephalopathy is usually made with clinical tests done during the physical examination (mental status tests, memory tests, and coordination tests) that document an altered mental state. In most cases, findings on clinical tests either diagnose or presumptively diagnose encephalopathy. Usually, the diagnosis occurs when the altered mental state accompanies another primary diagnosis such as chronic ''liver disease'', kidney failure, anoxia, or many other diagnoses.''Consequently, physicians may utilize several different tests at the same time to diagnose both the primary condition (the cause of encephalopathy) and the encephalopathy itself. This approach to diagnosis is done by most physicians, because encephalopathy is a complication that occurs because of a primary underlying health problem. The most frequently utilized tests are listed below with some of the major primary causes the tests may help diagnose:''This list is not exhaustive, and not all of the above tests need to be done on every patient. Specific testing is usually ordered by the treating physician according to the symptoms and history of the patient.'   Complete blood count or CBC (infections or loss of blood) Blood pressure (high or low blood pressure) Metabolic tests (blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, lactate, ammonia, oxygen, and liver enzymes) Drugs or toxin levels (alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, and many others) Blood and body fluid cultures and analyses (infections of many types) Creatinine (kidney function) CT and MRI scans (brain swelling, anatomical abnormalities, or infections) Doppler ultrasound (abnormal blood flow to tissues or abscesses) Encephalogram or EEG (brain damage or abnormal brain wave patterns) Autoantibody analysis (dementia caused by antibodies that destroy neurons) Review of the person's medications as some medications (for example, cyclosporine) may be responsible for symptoms"
What is the treatment for encephalopathy?,"'Treatment of encephalopathy varies with the primary cause of the symptoms. Consequently, not all cases of encephalopathy are treated the same.''Some examples of different ""encephalopathy treatments"" for different causes:''The key to treatment of any encephalopathy is to understand the basic cause and thus design a treatment plan to reduce or eliminate the cause(s). There is one type of encephalopathy that is difficult or impossible to treat; it is static encephalopathy (an altered mental state or brain damage that is permanent). The best that can be done with static encephalopathy is, if possible, to prevent further damage and implement rehabilitation to allow the individual to perform at his or her highest possible functional level.' Short-term anoxia (usually less than two minutes): oxygen therapy Long-term anoxia: rehabilitation Short-term alcohol toxicity: IV fluids or no therapy Long-term alcohol abuse (cirrhosis or chronic liver failure): oral lactulose, low-protein diet, antibiotics Uremic encephalopathy (due to kidney failure): correct the underlying physiologic cause, dialysis, kidney transplant Diabetic encephalopathy: administer glucose to treat hypoglycemia, insulin to treat hyperglycemia Hypo- or hypertensive encephalopathy: medications to raise (for hypotensive) or reduce (for hypertensive) blood pressure"
What are the complications of encephalopathy?,"'Complications of encephalopathy vary from none to profound mental impairments that lead to death. The complications can be similar in some cases. Also, many investigators consider encephalopathy itself to be a complication that arises from a primary health problem or primary diagnosis.''Complications depend on the primary cause of encephalopathy and can be illustrated by citing a few examples from the wide variety of causes:''The best way to understand potential complications is to discuss these with the diagnosing doctor who can discuss the possible problems associated with the specific cause(s) of the type of encephalopathy.' Hepatic (liver) encephalopathy (brain swelling with herniation, coma, death) Metabolic encephalopathy (irritability, lethargy, depression, tremors; occasionally, coma or death) Anoxic encephalopathy (wide range of complications, from none in short-term anoxia to personality changes, severe brain damage to death in long-term anoxic events) Uremic encephalopathy (lethargy, hallucinations, stupor, muscle twitching, seizures, death) Hashimoto's encephalopathy (confusion, heat intolerance, dementia) Wernicke's encephalopathy (mental confusion, memory loss, decreased ability to move eyes) Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or ""mad cow disease"" (ataxia, dementia, and myoclonus or muscle twitching without any rhythm or pattern) Shigella encephalopathy (headache, stiff neck, delirium, seizures, coma) Infectious causes of pediatric encephalopathy (irritability, poor feeding, hypotonia or floppy baby syndrome, seizures, death)"
What is the prognosis (outlook) for encephalopathy?,"'The prognosis for a patient with encephalopathy depends on the initial causes and, in general, the length of time it takes to reverse, stop, or inhibit those causes. Consequently, the prognosis varies from patient to patient and ranges from complete recovery to a poor prognosis that often leads to permanent brain damage or death. This highly variable prognosis is exemplified by patients that get encephalopathy from hypoglycemia. If patients with hypoglycemia are given glucose at the first signs of encephalopathy (for example, irritability, mild confusion), most patients recover completely. Delays in correcting hypoglycemia (hours to days) may lead to seizures or coma, which may be halted by treatment with complete or partial recovery (minimal permanent brain damage). A long delay or multiple delays in treatment can lead to a poor prognosis with extensive brain damage, coma, or death.''Although the symptoms and time frame vary widely from patient to patient and according to the initial causes of encephalopathy (see above sections for examples of causes), the prognosis of each case usually follows the pattern described in the ''hypoglycemic'"" example above and depends upon the extent and rapidity with which the underlying cause is treated. The doctor or team of doctors treating the underlying cause of encephalopathy can offer the best information on the individual's prognosis.""  "
Can encephalopathy be prevented?,"'Many cases of encephalopathy can be prevented. The key to ''prevention'' is to stop or limit the chance of developing any of the multitudes of causes of encephalopathy. If encephalopathy develops, the quicker the underlying cause is treated, the more likely that severe encephalopathy can be prevented.''Examples of prevention (and situations to avoid) are listed below:''Methods for prevention of encephalopathy are about as numerous as the underlying causes; however, some cases of encephalopathy may not be preventable (for example, congenital and accidental traumatic encephalopathy).' Diabetic encephalopathy: Follow your prescribed diabetes management plan, including taking glucose measurements when appropriate. Take all medications as directed. Hepatic encephalopathy: Avoid alcohol intoxication, drug overdoses, and IV injections of illegal drugs. Anoxic encephalopathy: Prevent choking on food. Avoid risky behavior that could lead to head and neck trauma. Avoid exposure to carbon monoxide. Hypertensive encephalopathy: Monitor blood pressure; take antihypertensive medication as directed and do not stop medications or change medication without consulting a doctor. Infectious encephalopathy: Avoid physical contact with individuals known to be infected with organisms that may cause encephalopathy such as N. meningitidis or Shigella. Uremic encephalopathy: Do not skip or avoid scheduled dialysis. Take all medications as directed and have frequent assessments of mental status."

What are elimination disorders in children?,"'There are two types of disorders of elimination that may affect children. One category reflects problems with stooling, relatively common ''constipation'' and less frequently occurring encopresis (also known a ''fecal incontinence'' or soiling). The other category of elimination disorders in children reflects problems with urination and is known as enuresis. The article will review only problems associated in children dealing with stooling. Problems with urination in children are reviewed elsewhere.' "
"What are the risk factors and 
causes of constipation and encopresis?","'Most children with encopresis have underlying constipation. Why some children develop encopresis does not seem to reflect differences in either physiology or psychology. Pediatric GI specialists have noted three areas of intestinal maturation that may set the stage (in some children) for the onset of constipation and (in some, ultimately) encopresis. These areas include the following:'""Regardless of the cause, many children with constipation will ultimately pass either an overly large and/or hard stool, resulting in a painful experience. The rational step (from the child's perspective) is to avoid stooling and thus avoid further ""'pain''. Consequently, stool accumulates in the rectum and becomes desiccated and thus more difficult and more painful to pass. This recurrent cycle reinforces the child\'s behavior to avoid stooling at all costs. Children who develop encopresis may develop abnormal stretching and enlargement of the rectal area that reduces the reflex urge to stool. As a consequence, the impacted stool mass may allow ""upstream"" semisolid stool to leak around the ""downstream"" stool obstruction, causing soiling in clothes as well as occasional chunks of stool to also be passed without the child\'s knowledge or desire. ' Changing from a pure breast milk/formula diet to one that includes and 
ultimately relies on the majority of calories from solid foods: The increase in 
solid foods promotes an increase in stool volume and consistency that may 
require greater effort for stool expulsion. The process of toilet training: 
The emotional turmoil for some families in what is generally a natural 
evolutionary process may engender a myriad of emotional responses in the child 
who is toilet training. The often conflicting desire to please 
	parents but 
establish autonomy may ""raise the stakes"" too high for the toddler to succeed. 
The fact that many preschools require successfully toilet trained students may 
engender parental stress since many parents utilize preschool as a safe locale 
for their child during the adult's workday. One study demonstrated that 35% of 
children who refused to toilet train developed chronic constipation and were at 
a substantially higher likelihood of developing encopresis. School 
attendance: Pediatricians daily hear stories about children who refuse to use 
the school toilet for either urinating or bowel movements. The lack of privacy, 
taunting, and often noisy chaos is just too intimidating when compared with the 
home environment."
What are the symptoms and signs of constipation?,"'Pediatric gastroenterologists (GI doctors) indicate that symptoms of constipation generally involve six characteristics of abnormal stooling present in infants and toddlers for at least one month and children 4 to 18 years of age for two months. A minimum of two criteria must be present to fulfill the definition of constipation. These stooling patterns/problems include the following:' Two or 
fewer bowel movements per week One episode of stool incontinence after 
mastering toilet-training skills A history of excessive stool retention which 
may be accompanied by characteristic retentive posturing (""the poop dance"") in 
older children A history of passage of painful or hard bowel movements A 
history of large stools which may obstruct the toilet Palpation of a large mass of stool in the rectum during digital rectal exam"
What are the symptoms and signs of encopresis?,"'Specialists who deal with encopretic children note that the above criteria for constipation are also characteristic of encopresis. In one recent study focusing on constipation, many of the children in the study first presented to their physician with a history consistent with encopresis. There are, however, several historical elements that are unique to encopresis. These include the following:' Some children with encopresis may successfully stool every day, however, evacuation 
of their bowel is incomplete. Encopretic children commonly ""defecate in places 
inappropriate to the social context at least once a month"" (for example, the classroom). Children with encopresis seem oblivious or nonchalant to either obvious stool 
staining of their clothes or the heavy stool odor they produce. There is no 
underlying organic medical condition that explains the child's encopretic 
pattern."
How are elimination disorders diagnosed?,"""A complete evaluation of a child with constipation or encopresis involves a thorough history, a detailed physical examination, and may include laboratory testing. The child's pediatrician may generally handle the analysis of these elements. A pediatric GI specialist consultation may be indicated should a more ominous cause for the elimination disorder be discovered or if the evaluation produces conflicting data and thus obscures the establishment of the exact cause and thus management for the child's problem. """"The history to be explored during an evaluation of elimination disorders includes: (1) age and abruptness of onset, (2) frequency and character of the current stool pattern in comparison to that noted prior to the onset of symptoms, (3) relationship to ingestion of meals as well as types of food in the child's ""'diet'', (4) unusual ''weight loss'' or gain, (5) associated abdominal complaints (for example, ''abdominal pain''), (6) urological issues (many children with elimination disorders may also have enuresis -- involuntary loss of bladder control), (7) psychosocial family dynamics (for example, parental/sibling/peer response to the problem), and (8) gentle exploration for any possibility of sexual abuse -- regression, ''depression'', sexually acting out, etc. ''The goal of a complete physical exam is to eliminate the possibility of anatomical or functional causes for the elimination disorder. Children affected by ''cerebral palsy'', global hyponia (low muscle tone), mental retardation, and anatomical malformations (for example, spinal cord abnormalities or displacement of the anus) must be considered and ruled out as a cause for the child\'s symptoms. Physical examination of the abdomen will often demonstrate a large stool mass. A rectal exam will commonly demonstrate an enlarged rectal volume that is packed with stool. Absence of anal muscular tone should be a ""red flag"" for a potential neurological disorder. As noted above, appropriate anal location should be documented. Likewise, the physician should perform an evaluation for hidden spinal cord malformations (for example, tuft of hair over the lower spine). ''Most children with either constipation or encopresis do not need laboratory or radiographic evaluation unless the history and/or physical examination warrant further analysis (for example, an ''MRI'"" for spinal cord malformations). Blood studies to evaluate thyroid function may be a consideration on an individualized basis. An abdominal X-ray may be helpful to measure the child's stool burden. For those children with urologic problems, a culture and ""'urinalysis'' are reasonable studies. A pediatric ''gastroenterologist'' may perform a study of anal and rectal muscle tone (anal/rectal manometry) to assess the anal/rectal response to inflation with air in children who do not respond to routine therapy. ' "
What is the treatment for elimination disorders in children?,"'Successful treatment of elimination disorders includes reestablishing an appropriate bowel evacuation regimen and development of a program to ensure maintenance of such a stool elimination pattern. A program that may include the use of laxatives, changes in diet, toileting behavior adjustments, and close follow-up has been shown to provide the highest rate of success. The therapeutic approach is often defined by the age of the child. ''Breastfed'' infants are less likely to have stooling problems when compared with their ''formula-fed'' peers. Diluted prune juice (50:50 with water) will promote a softer and increased volume stool. Rectal stimulation with either a rectal thermometer or ''glycerin'"" suppository may be an appropriate technique to address a stool-impacted infant. Mineral oil is not recommended for infants due to the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and possible lung pathology if aspirated. Careful attention to the child's stooling pattern is worthwhile when solid foods are introduced into the young infant's diet. ""'Preschoolers, grammar-school-age, and older children with elimination disorders are generally approached in a similar fashion. If the child is chronically impacted, the use of an orally administered cathartic (for example, magnesium citrate) will ""clean out"" the colon. Colonic enemas have fallen out of favor due to the emotional ''stress'' that may be associated with their use. Follow-up daily use of water retaining laxatives (for example, ''polyethylene glycol'' without ''electrolytes'' marketed as ''PEG''-3350 or ''Miralax'') is common. This approach allows the chronically distended colon to gradually return to a normal volume -- thus allowing redevelopment of stretch receptors to respond to the local rectal/anal enlargement associated with stool arrival to the area. These water-retaining laxatives may be needed for several months before considering a gradual tapering. A thorough review of the child\'s diet is important. Avoidance of large amounts of constipating items is paramount. Such foods would include excessive milk/dairy products, starches (bread, pasta, etc.), and ""fast foods,"" which are often high in saturated ''fats''. Grandmother\'s suggestion to ""eat your fruits and vegetables"" has solid medical credence. An adequate intake of water as well as daily vigorous physical activity will also promote colonic health. Establishment of a daily routine of ""toilet time"" has been shown to be very helpful. Spending between five to 10 minutes on the toilet is a generally accepted goal. For young children, a reward system is often helpful. The reward should be a response for sitting on the toilet for the allotted time -- not the production of stool. Passage of a daily normal character stool without discomfort is the intended goal of bowel reeducation. ''The use of ''probiotics'' has received scientific study in the last few years. Pediatric studies are less convincing than those utilizing adult patients and many studies present conflicting results. There has been no documentation of a deleterious effect of ''probiotic'' usage in children or adults. ' "
Can elimination disorders in children be prevented?,"'While there are no guarantees in this world (except death and taxes, as Benjamin Franklin reportedly said), there are several measures that can be taken to lessen the likelihood of constipation and/or encopresis. Breastfed infants have fewer stooling issues than their formula-fed counterparts. Careful monitoring of intestinal changes associated with the introduction of solid foods (between 4 to 6 months of age) is helpful. The process of toilet training should be viewed as the socially coordinated behavior of a purely biologic function. Forceful threats, intimidation, shaming, and extreme pressure should not be part of the toilet-training process. Many a toddler discovers that they, and not their parents, have ultimate control of when and where they will have a bowel movement. Forcing the issue will often only complicate matters. Frustrated parents should remember that very few high school seniors wear Depends to the senior prom. As noted above, a healthy diet emphasizing proper hydration, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and an active lifestyle will promote normal stool production and elimination. ' "
What is the prognosis for children with elimination disorders?,"'With parental education regarding risk factors and awareness of techniques maximizing their avoidance, the prognosis for children with elimination disorders is positive. Likewise, effective therapy has been demonstrated to be successful in both the short and long term, allowing reestablishment and maintenance of normal bowel function. ' "
What is COPD?,'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') is a group of diseases causing an inflammatory reaction and irreversible damage to the ''lungs''. They cause obstruction of airflow and difficulty ''breathing''. ''Emphysema'' and ''chronic bronchitis'' are the most common diseases that ''makeup'' ''COPD''. It’s a lifelong disease with periods of flare-ups. It negatively impacts the quality of life and longevity.' 
What is the prognosis of end-stage COPD?, 
What happens in COPD?,"'During ''inhalation'', air travels through the nose and/or mouth into the trachea (windpipe). The trachea further divides into two tubes called bronchi, which opens into the lungs. Within the lungs, the bronchi branch out into smaller tubes called ''bronchioles''. The end of the bronchioles opens into little air sacs called alveoli, which aid in gaseous exchange. The alveoli are surrounded by blood vessels, through which the exchange of gases, oxygen, and carbon dioxide takes place.''Exposure to ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (COPD) triggers leads to the collection of different types of white blood cells and inflammation-causing chemicals in the lungs. This leads to tissue swelling, damage, and increased ''mucus'' secretion in the ''airway'' and air sacs.''Emphysema'' ''is a disease of the alveoli (air sacs). There is irreversible damage to the alveoli, making them less elastic. There is decreased exchange of gases, leading to decreased oxygenation in the body (''hypoxia''). Eventually, patients have severe breathing difficulties.''Chronic ''bronchitis'' is a disease of the bronchus (tubes that enter the lungs). The trachea can also be involved. Inflammation due to irritants causes inflammation, leading to an increase in the number and size of mucus-secreting glands. There is also damage to the cilia (small hair-like structures located in various parts of the body) to help clear mucus. There is decreased clearing of mucus that accumulates and thickens, causing airway obstruction. Long-term inflammation also leads to airway narrowing.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of end-stage COPD?,"'The signs and symptoms and severity depend on the stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and they worsen during flare-ups. There are four stages of COPD:''Signs and symptoms of stage I:''Symptoms are mild and often missed, but damage to the lungs begins.''Patients may only present with constant ''shortness of breath'' on exertion.''Signs and symptoms of stage II:''Symptoms are more severe than stage I, and there a mild impact on the quality of life. Patients present with''Signs and symptoms of stage III:''Stage III has a bigger impact on the quality of life.''Symptoms in stage III worsen considerably. In addition to that, patients present with''Signs and symptoms of stage IV (end-stage COPD):''This is the final stage of COPD. This occurs after years of continuous damage to the lungs. Patients have worsened symptoms of stage III and frequent flare-ups that could be fatal. Patients have very poor quality of life.''Patients also present with' Stage I: Mild COPD Stage II: Moderate COPD Stage III: Severe COPD Stage IV: Very severe COPD (End stage) Persistent cough with mucus, which may be worse in the morning. Shortness of breath even with mild routine activity. Wheezing on exertion. Disturbed sleep. Fatigue. Frequent respiratory tract infections. Swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs. Tightness in the chest. Trouble taking a deep breath. Wheezing and other breathing issues when doing basic tasks. Barrel-shaped chest. Constant wheezing. Being out of breath. Delirium. Increased heart rate or heartbeat. Loss of appetite and weight. Increased blood pressure."
How is COPD caused?,"'Tobacco smoking'': This accounts for 90% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk.''Environmental factors'':' Passive smoking Indoor cooking with poor ventilation Air pollution Exposure to chemicals Exposure to industrial dust and fumes Intravenous drug abuse Infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Genetic disorders such as Marfans syndrome, Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, etc."
How is COPD treated?,"'It is important to talk to your doctor about your treatment options and to get answers to all of your questions.' Short-term and long-term bronchodilators (inhalers) Oral steroids or steroid inhalers Medication to clear thin mucus and clear the airway Antibiotics Quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to other irritants Pulmonary rehabilitation  Oxygen therapy Surgery in severe cases, for example, lung transplant may be required"
What is endocarditis?,'Endocarditis is a serious inflammation of one of the four heart valves. ' 
What causes endocarditis?,"'Endocarditis is caused by a growth of bacteria on one of the heart valves, leading to an infected mass called a ""vegetation"". The infection may be introduced during brief periods of having bacteria in the bloodstream, such as after dental work, ''colonoscopy'', and other similar procedures.' "
What are the symptoms of endocarditis?,"'Patients with endocarditis can develop:''In endocarditis, blood cultures can often detect the bacteria causing the endocarditis. Patients can also develop ''anemia'', ''blood in urine'', elevated white blood cell count, and a new ''heart murmur''. '   fever, fatigue, chills, weakness aching joints and muscles, night sweats, edema (fluid collection) in the leg(s), foot (feet), and abdomen, malaise, shortness of breath, and occasionally, scattered small skin 
lesions."
Who is at risk for endocarditis?,"'People with existing diseases of the heart valves (''aortic stenosis'', mitral stenosis, ''mitral regurgitation'', etc.) and people who have undergone heart valve replacements are at an increased risk of developing endocarditis. These people are usually given antibiotics prior to any procedure which may introduce bacteria into the bloodstream.  This includes routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that may traumatize body tissues such as colonoscopy and gynecologic or urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral  ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'') and ''erythromycin'' (Emycin, ''Eryc'',''PCE''), as well as intramuscular or intravenous ''ampicillin'', gentamicin, and ''vancomycin''.' "
How is endocarditis diagnosed?,"'The infection on the valve can cause build up of nodules on the valves called ""vegetations"". These valve vegetations can be detected by echocardiography (an ''ultrasound'' examination of the heart). The most accurate method of detecting valve vegetations is with a procedure called transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). In this procedure an echo-transducer is placed on the tip of a flexible endoscope. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth into the ''esophagus''. The transducer at the tip of the endoscope is then able to take sound wave ""pictures"" of the heart valves located adjacent to the lower esophagus. It is important to realize that endocarditis may exist without visible vegetations on the heart valve; the exact diagnosis is made by the identification of bacteria in a blood culture, in the appropriate clinical setting.' "
How is endocarditis treated?,"'The mainstay of treatment is aggressive antibiotics, generally given intravenously, usually for 4-6 weeks. The duration and intensity of treatment depends on the severity of the infection and the type of bacterial organism responsible. In cases where the valve has been severely damaged by the infection, resulting in severe valve dysfunction, surgical replacement of the valve may be necessary. Response to treatment is indicated by a reduction in fever, negative blood bacterial cultures, and findings on echocardiography.'  "
What is endometrial ablation?,"'Endometrial ablation is the surgical destruction of the lining tissues of the uterus, known as the ''endometrium''. Endometrial ablation is one type of treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding.'  "
Why is endometrial ablation done?,"'Endometrial ablation is a treatment for abnormal bleeding of the uterus that is due to a benign (non-cancerous) condition. Endometrial ablation is not sufficient treatment when the cause of bleeding is ''cancer of the uterus'', since ''cancer'' cells may have grown into the deeper tissues of the uterus and cannot often be removed by the procedure.''Endometrial ablation is only performed on females who are not ''pregnant'' and do not plan to become pregnant in the future. It should not be performed if the woman has an active infection of the genital tract. This treatment is not a first-line therapy for heavy bleeding. It should only be considered when medical and hormonal therapies have not been sufficient to control the bleeding.' "
How is endometrial ablation performed?,"'Prior to the procedure, a woman needs to have an endometrial sampling (biopsy) performed to exclude the presence of ''cancer''. Imaging studies and/or direct visualization with a hysteroscope (a lighted viewing instrument that is inserted to visualize the inside of the uterus) are necessary to exclude the presence of uterine polyps or benign tumors (fibroids) beneath the lining tissues of the uterus. Polyps and fibroids are possible causes of heavy bleeding that can be simply removed without ablation of the entire ''endometrium''. Obviously, the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded, and intrauterine ''contraceptive'' devices (IUDs) must be removed prior to endometrial ablation.''Hormonal therapy may be given in the weeks prior to the procedure (particularly in younger women), in order to shrink the endometrium to an extent where ablation therapy has the greatest likelihood for success. The belief is the thinner the endometrium, the greater the chances for successful ablation.''To begin the procedure, the cervical opening is dilated to allow passage of the instruments into the uterine ''cavity''. Different procedures have been used and are all similarly effective for destroying the uterine lining tissue. These include laser beam, electricity, freezing, and heating.''The choice of procedure depends upon a number of factors, including''The type of anesthesia required depends upon the method used, and some endometrial ablation procedures can be performed with minimal anesthesia during an office visit. Others may be performed in an outpatient surgery center.' the surgeon's preference and experience, the presence of fibroids, the size and shape of the uterus, whether or not pretreatment medication is given, and type of anesthesia desired by the patient."
What are the risks and complications of endometrial ablation?,"'Complications of the procedure are not common but may include:''In very rare cases, fluid used to expand the uterus during the procedure can be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to ''fluid in the lungs'' (''pulmonary edema'').''Some women may experience regrowth of the endometrium and need further surgery (see below).''Minor side effects from the procedure can occur for a few days, include cramping (like ''menstrual cramps''), ''nausea'', and ''frequent urination'' that may last for 24 hours. A watery discharge mixed with blood may be present for a few weeks after the procedure and can be heavy for the first few days.'   accidental perforation of the uterus, tears or damage to the cervical opening (the opening to the uterus), and infection, bleeding, and burn injuries to the uterus or intestines."
What is the outlook after endometrial ablation?,"'The majority of women who undergo endometrial ablation report a successful reduction in abnormal bleeding. Up to half of women will stop having periods after the procedure. Yet, studies indicate the rate of failure (defined as bleeding or ''pain'' after endometrial ablation that required ''hysterectomy'' or reablation) was 16% to 30% at five 5 or years. Failure was most likely to occur in women younger than 45 years and in women with 5 or more children, prior ''tubal ligation'', and a history of painful ''menstrual cramps''. After endometrial ablation, 11% to 36% of women had a repeat ablation or other uterine-sparing procedure.''Although the procedure removes the uterine lining and typically results in ''infertility'', it should not be considered as a ''birth control'' measure, because pregnancy can still occur in a small portion of the endometrium that remains or has regrown. In this case there may be severe problems with the pregnancy, and the procedure should never be performed if the woman may desire pregnancy in the future.' "
What is endometrial biopsy procedure?,"'The uterus (womb) is lined by a special type of tissue known as the ''endometrium''. Endometrial biopsy, or endometrial sampling, is a technique of removing a piece of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The sample of tissue is analyzed under a microscope in the laboratory by a pathologist, a doctor with special training in diagnosis of diseases based upon tissue examination.'  "
Is endometrial biopsy painful?,"'Usually, endometrial biopsy procedures painful, and women who are having the procedure should be notified. There are ''drugs'' to stop the ''pain'' caused by the biopsy. ''Endometriosis'' can have an impact psychologicaly on women with the condition due to severe ''pain''. Moreover, the severe pain caused by ''endometriosis'' is compounded negatively by the inability to conceive.\xa0\xa0' "
Why is endometrial biopsy done?,"'An endometrial biopsy is most often performed to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help evaluate the cause of ''infertility'', test for uterine infections, and even monitor the response to certain medications.''Endometrial biopsy has many advantages over the more complicated procedure known as ''dilation and curettage'"" (D&C), which is a more extensive removal of the uterine lining that requires dilation (stretching) of the cervical opening with special instruments. Unlike D&C, endometrial biopsy may be performed in the doctor's office and typically does not require anesthesia or hospitalization.""'Endometrial biopsy cannot be performed during ''pregnancy'', and sometimes may not be recommended when certain other conditions are present, including ''cancer of the cervix'' or abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening.' "
How is endometrial biopsy done?,"""Endometrial biopsy is most often done in the physician's office, but it can be performed on women in the hospital. The patient lies on the examining table in a position similar to that used for obtaining Pap smears. The doctor uses a speculum to open the vaginal canal and visualize the cervix, the opening to the uterus. During endometrial biopsy the doctor inserts a thin ""'plastic'' or metal tubular device through the cervix into the uterus to remove a tiny piece of the inner lining tissue.''Usually no anesthesia is required, but taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (''NSAID'') 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure can help reduce cramping and pain. In some cases, a small amount of ''lidocaine'' anesthetic is inserted into the uterine ''cavity'' to minimize discomfort.' "
What are the risks of endometrial biopsy?,"'There are very few risks with endometrial biopsy. The leading risk is pain or cramping, but this typically subsides rapidly following the procedure. Other less common risks are:' Feeling faint or light-headed Infection Bleeding Rarely, perforation of the uterus"
What is cancer prevention?,"'Cancer prevention'' is action taken to lower the chance of getting ''cancer''. By preventing ''cancer'', the number of new cases of ''cancer'' in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower the number of deaths caused by cancer.''To prevent new ''cancers'' from starting, scientists look at risk factors and protective factors. Anything that increases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is called a cancer protective factor.''Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. For example, both ''smoking'' and inheriting certain genes are risk factors for some types of cancer, but only ''smoking'' can be avoided. Regular ''exercise'' and a healthy ''diet'' may be protective factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does not mean that you will not get cancer.''Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:' Changing lifestyle or eating habits. Avoiding things known to cause cancer. Taking medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting."
"Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in 
the tissues of the endometrium.","'The ''endometrium'' is the lining of the uterus. The uterus is part of the female reproductive system. It is a hollow, pear-shaped, muscular organ in the pelvis, where a fetus grows.\xa0 ''Cancer of the endometrium'' is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called sarcoma of the uterus. ''Endometrial cancer'' is the most common invasive cancer of the female reproductive system.'' ''Endometrial cancer usually occurs in women after ''menopause'', and affects more white women than black women. Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are more likely to have more advanced disease at diagnosis, and are more likely to die from endometrial cancer than white women. ' "
"Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent 
cancer.","'Avoiding ''cancer risk factors'' such as ''smoking'', being ''overweight'', and lack of ''exercise'' may help prevent certain cancers. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy ''diet'', and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer. ''The following risk factors may increase the risk of endometrial cancer:''''Estrogen'' '""Estrogen is a hormone made by the body. It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Estrogen can affect the growth of some cancers, including endometrial cancer. A woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer is increased by being exposed to estrogen in the following ways: ""'Tamoxifen'' ''Tamoxifen is one of a group of ''drugs'' called selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. Tamoxifen acts like estrogen on some tissues in the body, such as the uterus, but blocks the effects of estrogen on other tissues, such as the breast. When tamoxifen is used to prevent ''breast cancer'' in women who are at high risk for the disease, it increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women. ''Raloxifene'' is a SERM that is used to prevent bone ''weakness'' in postmenopausal women. It does not have estrogen-like effects on the uterus and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Other SERMs are being studied in ''clinical trials''. ''Inherited'' risk'' ''Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer'' (''HNPCC'') syndrome is an inherited disorder caused by changes in certain genes. Women who have HNPCC syndrome have a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have HNPCC syndrome. ''Polycystic ovary syndrome'' ''Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder of the hormones made by the ovaries) have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. ''Body fat'' ''Obesity'' increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This may be because obesity is related to other risk factors such as estrogen levels, polycystic ovary syndrome, lack of physical activity, and a diet that is high in saturated ''fats''.''It is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.''The following protective factors may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer:'' ''Combination ''oral contraceptives'' ''Taking contraceptives that combine estrogen and progestin (combination oral contraceptives) decreases the risk of endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combination oral contraceptives increases with the length of time they are used, and can last for many years after oral ''contraceptive'' use has been stopped.''Physical activity'' ''Physical activity may lower the risk of endometrial cancer. ''Pregnancy and breast-feeding'' ''Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. Being pregnant and/or breast-feeding may lower the risk of endometrial cancer. ''Diet'' ''A diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of endometrial cancer. The risk may also be lowered when ''soy'' -based foods are a regular part of the diet. ''Cancer ''prevention'' clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.'' ''Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer. ''The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, ''vitamins'', ''minerals'', or food ''supplements''.' Estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy: Estrogen may be given to 
	replace the estrogen no longer produced by the ovaries in postmenopausal 
	women or women whose ovaries have been removed. This is called hormone 
	replacement therapy (HRT), or hormone therapy (HT). The use of hormone 
	replacement therapy that contains only estrogen increases the risk of 
	endometrial cancer. For this reason, estrogen therapy alone is usually 
	prescribed only for women who do not have a uterus.

	When estrogen is combined with progestin (another hormone), it is called 
	combination estrogen-progestin replacement therapy. For postmenopausal 
	women, taking estrogen in combination with progestin does not increase the 
	risk of endometrial cancer.
  Early menstruation: Beginning to have menstrual periods at an early age 
	increases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases 
	a woman's risk of endometrial cancer.
  Late menopause: Women who reach menopause at an older age are exposed to 
	estrogen for a longer time and have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.
  Never being pregnant: Because estrogen levels are lower during 
	pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a 
	longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of 
	endometrial cancer. "
What is endometriosis?,"'Endometriosis is the abnormal growth of endometrial tissue similar to that which lines the interior of the uterus, but in a location outside of the uterus. Endometrial tissue is shed each month during menstruation. Areas of endometrial tissue found in ectopic locations are called endometrial implants. These lesions are most commonly found on the ovaries, the Fallopian tubes, the surface of the uterus, the bowel, and on the membrane lining of the pelvic ''cavity'' (i.e. the peritoneum). They are less commonly found to involve the vagina, cervix, and bladder. Rarely, endometriosis can occur outside the pelvis. Endometriosis has been reported in the ''liver'', brain, lung, and old surgical ''scars''. Endometrial implants, while they may become problematic, are usually benign (i.e. non-cancerous).' "
What are the stages of endometriosis?,"'Endometriosis is classified into one of four stages (I-minimal, II-mild, III-moderate, and IV-severe) based upon the exact location, extent, and depth of the endometriosis implants as well as the presence and severity of ''scar tissue'' and the presence and size of endometrial implants in the ovaries. Most cases of endometriosis are classified as minimal or mild, which means there are superficial implants and mild scarring. Moderate and severe endometriosis typically result in ''cysts'' and more severe scarring. The stage of endometriosis is not related to the degree of symptoms a woman experiences, but infertility is common with stage IV endometriosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of endometriosis?,"'Most women who have endometriosis, in fact, do not have symptoms. Of those whom do, the most common symptoms include:''The intensity of the pain can vary from month to month, and can vary greatly among affected individuals. Some women experience progressive worsening of symptoms, while others can have resolution of pain without treatment.''Pelvic pain'' in women with endometriosis depends partly on where endometrial implants of endometriosis are located.''Endometriosis can be one of the reasons for infertility for otherwise healthy couples. When laparoscopic examinations are performed during evaluations for infertility, implants are often found in individuals who are totally asymptomatic. The reasons diminished ''fertility'' in many patients with endometriosis are not understood. Endometriosis may incite ''scar'' tissue formation within the pelvis. If the ovaries and Fallopian tubes are involved, the mechanical processes involved in the transfer of fertilized eggs into the tubes may be altered. Alternatively, the endometriotic lesions may produce inflammatory substances, which adversely affect ovulation, ''fertilization'', and implantation.''Other symptoms that can be related to endometriosis include''Rare symptoms of endometriosis include ''chest pain'' or ''coughing'' blood due to endometriosis in the ''lungs'' and ''headache'' and/or ''seizures'' due to endometriosis in the brain.'   Pain (usually pelvic) that usually occurs just before menstruation and lessens after menstruation Painful sexual intercourse Cramping during intercourse Cramping or pain during bowel movements or urination Infertility Pain with pelvic examinations Deeper implants and implants in areas of high nerve density are more apt to produce pain. The implants may also release substances into the bloodstream, which are capable of eliciting pain. Pain can result when endometriotic implants incite scarring of surrounding tissues. There appears to be no relationship between severity of pain and the amount of anatomical disease which is present. lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, low back pain, chronic fatigue irregular or heavy menstruation, painful urination, or bloody urine (particularly during menstruation)."
Does endometriosis increase a woman's risk of getting cancer?,"'Some studies have postulated that women with endometriosis have an increased risk for development of certain types of ''ovarian cancer'', known as epithelial ''ovarian cancer'' (EOC). This risk is highest in women with both endometriosis and primary infertility (those who have never conceived a pregnancy). The use of combination oral ''contraceptive'' pills (OCPs), which are sometimes used in the treatment of endometriosis, appears to significantly reduce this risk.''The reasons for the association between endometriosis and ovarian epithelial ''cancer'' are not clearly understood. One theory is that the endometriosis implants themselves undergo ''malignant'' transformation to ''cancer'"". Another possibility is that the presence of endometriosis may be related to other genetic or environmental factors that serve to increase a women's risk of developing ""'ovarian cancer''.' "
What causes endometriosis?,"'The cause of endometriosis is unknown. One theory is that the endometrial tissue is deposited in unusual locations by the retrograde flow of menstrual debris through the Fallopian tubes into the pelvic and abdominal ''cavities''. The cause of this retrograde menstruation is not clearly understood. It is clear that retrograde menstruation is not the only cause of endometriosis, as many women who have retrograde menstruation do not develop the condition.''Another possibility is that areas lining the pelvic organs possess primitive cells that are able to develop into other forms of tissue, such as ''endometrium''. (This process is termed coelomic metaplasia.)''It is also likely the direct transfer of endometrial tissues at the time of surgery may be responsible for the endometriosis implants occasionally found in surgical scars (for example, ''episiotomy'' or Cesarean section scars). Transfer of endometrial cells via the bloodstream or lymphatic system is the most plausible explanation for the rare cases of endometriosis that are found in the brain and other organs remote from the pelvis.'""Finally, there is evidence that some women with endometriosis have an altered immune response in women with endometriosis, which may affect the body's natural ability to recognize ectopic endometrial tissue."" "
Does endometriosis cause infertility?,"'Endometriosis is more common in ''infertile'' women, as opposed to those who have conceived a pregnancy. However, many women with confirmed endometriosis are able to conceive without difficulty, particularly if the disease is mild or moderate. It is estimated that up to 70% of women with mild or moderate endometriosis will conceive within three years without any specific treatment.''The reasons for a decrease in fertility when endometriosis is present are not completely understood. It is likely that both anatomical and hormonal factors are contributory to diminished fertility. The presence of endometriosis may incite significant scar (adhesion) formation within the pelvis, which can distort normal anatomical structures. Alternatively, endometriosis may affect fertility through the production of inflammatory substances that have a negative effect on ovulation, fertilization of the egg, and/or implantation of the embryo. Infertility associated with endometriosis is more common in women with anatomically severe forms of the disease.''Treatment options for infertility associated with endometriosis are varied, but most doctors believe that surgery is superior to medical treatment for endometriosis. When appropriate, assisted reproductive technology may also be used as an adjunct or an alternative to surgical therapy.'  "
Does diet affect endometriosis?,"'There is no data that is well-established that show that dietary modifications can either prevent or reduce the symptoms of endometriosis. One study showed that a high consumption of green vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower risk of developing endometriosis, while a higher intake of red meats was associated with a higher risk. No association was seen with ''alcohol'', milk, or coffee consumption. Further studies are needed to determine whether ''diet'' plays a role in the development of endometriosis.'  "
Is there a test to diagnose endometriosis?,"'Obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) are the type of doctors that commonly treat endometriosis .''Endometriosis can be suspected based on symptoms of pelvic pain and findings during physical examinations. Occasionally, during a rectovaginal exam (one finger in the vagina and one finger in the rectum), the doctor can feel nodules (endometrial implants) behind the uterus and along the ligaments that attach to the pelvic wall. At other times, no nodules are felt, but the examination itself causes unusual pain or discomfort.''Unfortunately, neither the symptoms nor the physical examinations can be relied upon to conclusively establish the diagnosis of endometriosis. Imaging studies, such as ''ultrasound'', can be helpful in ruling out other pelvic diseases and may suggest the presence of endometriosis in the vaginal and bladder areas, but they cannot reliably diagnose endometriosis. For an accurate diagnosis, a direct visual inspection inside of the pelvis and abdomen, as well as tissue biopsy of the implants are necessary.''As a result, the only definitive method for diagnosing endometriosis is surgical. This requires either laparoscopy or laparotomy (opening the abdomen using a large incision).''Laparoscopy is the most common surgical procedure most commonly employees used for the diagnosis of endometriosis. This is a minor surgical procedure performed under general anesthesia, or in some cases under local anesthesia. It is usually performed as an outpatient procedure (the patient does not stay in the facility overnight). Laparoscopy is performed by first inflating the abdominal ''cavity'' with carbon dioxide through a small incision in the navel. A thin, tubular viewing instrument (laparoscope) is then inserted into the inflated abdominal cavity to inspect the abdomen and pelvis. Endometrial implants can then be directly seen.''During laparoscopy, biopsies (removal of tiny tissue samples for examination under a microscope) can also be performed in order to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Sometimes random biopsies obtained during laparoscopy will show microscopic endometriosis, even though no implants are visualized.''Pelvic ultrasound and laparoscopy are also important in excluding malignancies (such as ovarian ''cancer'') which can cause many of the same symptoms that mimic endometriosis symptoms.'  "
What is the treatment for endometriosis?,'Endometriosis can be treated with medications and/or surgery. The goals of endometriosis treatment may include symptom relief and/or enhancement of fertility.'  
NSAIDs and GnRH analogs,"'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' or ''NSAIDs'' (such as ''ibuprofen'' or ''naproxen'' sodium) are commonly prescribed to help relieve pelvic pain and menstrual cramping. These pain-relieving medications have no effect on the endometrial implants or the progression of endometriosis. However, they do decrease prostaglandin production, and prostaglandins are well known to have a role in the causation of pain. As the diagnosis of endometriosis can only be definitively confirmed with a biopsy, many women with complaints suspected to arise from endometriosis are treated for pain first without a firm diagnosis being established. Under such circumstances, NSAIDs are commonly used as a first line empirical treatment. If they are effective in controlling the pain, no other procedures or medical treatments are needed. If they are ineffective, additional evaluation and treatment will be necessary.''Since endometriosis occurs during the reproductive years, many of the available medical treatments for endometriosis rely on interruption of the normal cyclical hormone production by the ovaries. These medications include GnRH analogs, oral contraceptive pills, and progestins.''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH analogs) have been effectively used to relieve pain and reduce the size of endometriosis implants. These drugs suppress estrogen production by the ovaries by inhibiting the secretion of regulatory hormones from the ''pituitary gland''. As a result, menstrual periods stop, mimicking ''menopause''. Nasal and injection forms of GnRH agonists are available.''The side effects are a result of the lack of estrogen, and include:''Fortunately, by adding back small amounts of ''progesterone'' in pill form (similar to treatments sometimes used for symptom relief in ''menopause''), many of the annoying side effects due to estrogen deficiency can be avoided. ""Add back therapy"" is a term that refers to this modern way of administering GnRH agonists along with progesterone in a way to ensure compliance by eliminating most of the unwanted side effects of GnRH therapy.' hot flashes, vaginal dryness, irregular vaginal bleeding, mood alterations, fatigue, and loss of bone density (osteoporosis)."
Progestins,"'Progestins, for example, ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate (''Provera'', Cycrin, Amen), ''norethindrone'' acetate, and norgestrel acetate (''Ovrette''), are more potent than ''birth control pills'' and are recommended for women who do not obtain pain relief from or cannot take a ''birth control pill''. They may be helpful in women who do not respond, or cannot take (for medical reasons) ''oral contraceptives''.' Breast tenderness Bloating Weight gain Irregular uterine bleeding Depression"
Birth control pills (oral contraceptives),"'Oral contraceptive pills (estrogen and progesterone in combination) are also sometimes used to treat endometriosis. The most common combination used is in the form of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP). Sometimes women who have severe menstrual pain are asked to take the OCP continuously, meaning skipping the placebo (hormonally inert) portion of the cycle. Continuous use in this manner will generally stop menstruation altogether. Occasionally, weight gain, breast tenderness, ''nausea'', and irregular bleeding may occur. Oral contraceptive pills are usually well tolerated in women with endometriosis.' "
Aromatase inhibitors and other drugs,"'A more current approach to the treatment of endometriosis has involved the administration of drugs known as aromatase inhibitors (for example, ''anastrozole'' [''Arimidex''] and ''letrozole'' [''Femara'']). These drugs act by interrupting local estrogen formation within the endometriosis implants themselves. They also inhibit estrogen production within the ovary and adipose tissue. Research is ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors in the management of endometriosis. Aromatase inhibitors can cause significant bone loss with prolonged usage. In premenopausal women, these drugs must be taken in combination with other drugs because of the drug’s effect on the ovaries.''Danazol'' (''Danocrine'') is a synthetic drug that creates a high ''androgen'' (male type hormone) and low estrogen hormonal environment by interfering with ovulation and ovarian production of estrogen. Eighty percent of women who take this drug will have pain relief and shrinkage of endometriosis implants, but up to 75% of women develop significant side effects from the drug. These include:' Weight gain Edema (swelling) Breast shrinkage Acne Oily skin Male pattern hair growth (Hirsutism) Deepening of the voice Headache Hot flashes Changes in libido Mood alterations"
Can surgery cure endometriosis?,"'Surgical treatment for endometriosis can be useful when the symptoms are severe or there has been an inadequate response to medical therapy. Surgery is the preferred treatment when there is anatomic distortion of the pelvic organs or obstruction of the bowel or urinary tract. It may be classified either as conservative, in which the uterus and ovarian tissue are preserved, or definitive, which involves ''hysterectomy'' (removal of the uterus), with or without removal of the ovaries.''Conservative surgery is typically performed laparoscopically. Endometrial implants may be excised or destroyed by different sources of energy (e.g. laser, electrical current). If the disease is extensive and anatomy is distorted, laparotomy may be required.''While surgical treatments can be very effective in the reduction of pain, the recurrence rate of endometriosis following conservative surgical treatment has been estimated to be as high as 40%. Many doctors recommend ongoing medical therapy following surgery in an attempt to prevent symptomatic disease recurrence.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat endometriosis?,'Endometriosis is most commonly treated by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs).' 
Who gets endometriosis?,"'Endometriosis affects women during their reproductive years. The exact prevalence of endometriosis is not known, since many women who are later identified as having the condition are asymptomatic. Endometriosis is estimated to affect over one million women (estimates range from 3% to 18% of women) in the United States. It is one of the leading causes of pelvic pain and it is responsible for many of the laparoscopic procedures and hysterectomies performed by gynecologists. Estimates suggest that 20% to 50% of women being treated for infertility have endometriosis, and up to 80% of women with chronic pelvic pain may be affected.''While most cases of endometriosis are diagnosed in women aged 25 to 35 years, endometriosis has been reported in girls as young as 11 years of age. Endometriosis is rare in ''postmenopausal'' women. Studies further suggest that endometriosis is most common in taller, thin women with a low body mass index (''BMI''). Delaying pregnancy until an older age, never giving birth, early onset of menses, and late ''menopause'' all have been shown to be risk factors for endometriosis. It also is likely that there are genetic factors which predispose a woman to developing endometriosis, since having a first-degree relative with the condition increases the chance that a woman will develop the condition.' "
What is the prognosis for a woman with endometriosis?,"""Endometriosis is most commonly a disease of the reproductive years, and symptoms usually go away after a woman reaches menopause. For women experiencing symptoms, a number of therapies are available to provide relief. For infertility associated with endometriosis, treatments are also available to help increase a woman's chances of ""'conception''.' "
Can endometriosis be prevented?,"'Because the cause of endometriosis is poorly understood, there are no known ways to prevent its development.' "
Facts you should know about ERCP," ERCP is a diagnostic procedure designed to examine diseases of the liver, bile ducts and pancreas. ERCP is usually best performed under general anesthesia. It may be done using IV sedation. There is a low incidence of complications. ERCP can provide important information that cannot be obtained by other diagnostic examinations, for example, abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Frequently, therapeutic measures can be performed at the time of ERCP to remove stones in the bile ducts or to relieve obstruction of the bile ducts."
What is ERCP?,"'Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a diagnostic test to examine:''The procedure is performed by using a long, flexible, viewing instrument (a duodenoscope) about the diameter of a pen. The duodenoscope can be directed and moved around the many bends of the stomach and duodenum. The modern duodenoscope uses a thin ''fiber''-optic bundle to transmit light to the tip of the endoscope, and a thin wire with a chip also at the tip of the endoscope to transmit digital video images to a TV screen. The duodenoscope is inserted through the mouth, through the back of the throat, down the food pipe (''esophagus''), through the stomach and into the duodenum. Once the papilla of Vater is identified, a small ''plastic'' catheter (cannula) is passed through an open channel of the endoscope into the opening of the papilla, and into the bile ducts and/or the pancreatic duct. Contrast material (dye) is then injected and ''X-rays'' are taken of the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. Another open channel in the endoscope also allows other instruments to be passed through it in order to perform biopsies, to insert plastic or metal ''stents'' or tubing to relieve obstruction of the bile ducts or pancreatic duct caused by ''cancer'' or scarring, and to perform incisions by using electrocautery (electric heat).''The liver is a large solid organ located beneath the right ''diaphragm''. The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder (a small sac located beneath the liver). After meals, the gallbladder contracts and empties the bile through the cystic duct, into the bile ducts, through the papilla of Vater, and into the intestine to help with ''digestion''. The pancreas is located behind the stomach. It produces a digestive juice that drains through the pancreatic duct, which usually joins the bile duct within the papilla, and then enters the intestine.''An important procedure related to ERCP is endoscopic ''ultrasonography'' which uses a similar endoscope that, in addition to the camera, has an ultrasound probe on its tip to examine the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreatic duct, and pancreas ultrasonographically. Ultrasonographically-directed needle biopsies of the pancreas can be taken through a channel in the endoscope.''A second, newer procedure related to ERCP is the use of miniature endoscopes (Spyglass) that are passed through the operating channel of a duodenoscope and can be inserted directly into the bile and pancreatic ducts. The inside of the ducts can be visualized, and directed biopsies (Spybite) can be taken. Other therapeutic interventions also are possible.'  the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine), the papilla of Vater (a small nipple-like structure with openings leading to the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct), the bile ducts, and the gallbladder and the pancreatic duct."
What kind of preparation is required for ERCP?,"'For the best possible examination, the stomach must be empty. The patient should not eat anything after midnight on the evening preceding the exam. In case the procedure is performed early in the morning, no liquids should be taken. In case the examination is performed at noon time, a cup of tea, juice, milk, or coffee can be taken eight hours earlier. ''Heart'' and ''blood pressure'' medications should always be taken with a small amount of water in the early morning. Since the procedure will require intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, the patient needs to have a companion drive them home after the procedure.' "
What can be expected during and after the ERCP procedure?,"'If done with IV sedation, the patient will be given medications through a vein to cause relaxation and sleepiness. The patient will be given some local anesthetic to decrease the gag reflex. Some physicians do not use local anesthetic and prefer to give the patients more intravenous medications for sedation. This also applies to those patients who have a history of ''allergy'' to ''Xylocaine'' or cannot tolerate the bitter taste of the local anesthetic and the numbness sensation in the throat. While the patient is lying on the left side on the X-ray table, the intravenous medication is given, and then the instrument is inserted gently through the mouth into the duodenum. The instrument advances through the food pipe and not the air pipe. It does not interfere with the ''breathing'' and gagging is usually prevented or decreased by the medication. If using general anesthesia, then the above procedure does not apply.''When the patient is in\xa0a semi-conscious state, they can still follow instructions such as changing the body position on the X-ray table. Once the instrument has been advanced into the stomach, there is minimal discomfort except for the foreign body sensation in the throat. The procedure can last anywhere from fifteen minutes to one hour, depending on the skill of the physician, what needs to be accomplished, and the anatomy or abnormalities in that area. ERCP also may be performed under light, general anesthesia.''After the procedure, patients should be observed in the recovery area until most of the effects from the medications have worn off. This usually takes one to two hours. The patient may feel ''bloated'' or slightly nauseated from the medications or the procedure. Very rarely a patient experiences ''vomiting'', and may belch or pass some ''gas'' through the rectum. Upon discharge, the patient should be driven home by a companion and is advised to stay home for the rest of the day. The patient can resume usual activity the next day. Even though the physician may explain he findings to the patient or companion after the procedure, it is still necessary to follow up with the physician after the procedure to ensure that the patient understands the results of the examination.' "
What are the reasons for ERCP?,"'The liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas and the papilla of Vater can be involved in numerous diseases, causing myriad of symptoms. ERCP is used in diagnosing and treating the following conditions:' Blockage of the bile duct by gallstones, cancer, strictures (scarring) or compression from adjacent organs or tumors Jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin) due to obstruction of the bile duct, also causing darkening of the urine and light colored stool. Persistent or recurrent upper abdominal pain which cannot be diagnosed by other tests such as MRCP/MRI, CT Confirming the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas or the bile duct, so that surgery or other treatment can be tailored to the disease When there is suspicion that the Sphincter of Oddi within the Papilla of Vater, that controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, is not working normally (Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction)"
What are the side effects and risks of the ERCP procedure?,"'ERCP is a highly specialized procedure which requires a lot of experience and skill. The procedure is quite safe and is associated with a very low risk when it is performed by experienced physicians. The success rate in performing this procedure varies from 70% to 95% depending on the experience of the physician. Complications can occur in approximately one to five percent depending on the skill of the physician and the underlying disorder. The most common complication is ''pancreatitis'' which is due to irritation of the pancreas from the dye used to take pictures and can occur even with very experienced physicians. This ""injection"" pancreatitis usually is treated in the hospital for one to two days. Another possible complication is infection. Other serious risks including perforation of the intestine, drug reactions, bleeding, ''depressed'' breathing. Irregular heart beat or ''heart attack'' are extremely rare and is mainly due to the sedation. In case of complications, patients usually need to be hospitalized, but surgery rarely is required.''In summary, ERCP is a straight-forward but skill-requiring outpatient examination that is performed with the patient sedated under IV sedation or general anesthesia. The procedure provides important information upon which specific treatment can be tailored. In certain cases, therapy can be performed at the same time through the duodenoscope, so that traditional open surgery can be avoided. ERCP, combined with endoscopic ultrasonography, is currently the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice in most patients for identifying and removing ''gallstones'' in the bile ducts.' "
What is Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)?,"'Endoscopic ''Ultrasound'' (EUS) combines ''endoscopy'' and ultrasound in order to obtain images and information about the digestive tract and the surrounding tissue and organs. Endoscopy refers to the procedure of inserting a long flexible tube via the mouth or the rectum to visualize the digestive tract (for further information, please visit the ''Colonoscopy'' and ''Flexible Sigmoidoscopy'' articles),  whereas ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the organs and structures inside the body such as ovaries, uterus, ''liver'', gallbladder, pancreas, or ''aorta''.''Traditional ultrasound sends sound waves to the organ(s) and back with a transducer placed on the skin overlying the organ(s) of interest. Images obtained by traditional ultrasound are not always of high quality.  In EUS a small ultrasound transducer is installed on the tip of the endoscope. By inserting the endoscope into the upper or the lower digestive tract one can obtain high quality ultrasound images of the organs inside the body.''Placing the transducer on the tip of an endoscope allows the transducer to get close to the organs inside the body.  Because of the proximity of the EUS transducer to the organ(s) of interest, the images obtained are frequently more accurate and more detailed than the ones obtained by traditional ultrasound.  The EUS also can obtain information about the layers of the intestinal wall as well as adjacent areas such as ''lymph nodes'' and the blood vessels.''Other uses of EUS include studying the flow of blood inside blood vessels using Doppler ultrasound, and to obtain tissue samples by passing a special needle, under ultrasound guidance, into ''enlarged lymph nodes'' or suspicious tumors.  The tissue or cells obtained by the needle can be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. The process of obtaining tissue with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).' "
When is EUS useful?,"'The uses for EUS are still being developed and, presently, it is being utilized in some of the following situations:''Staging of ''cancer'' is becoming an important use of EUS. The prognosis of a ''cancer'' victim is related to the stage of the ''cancer'' at the time of cancer detection. For example, early stage ''colon cancer'' refers to cancer confined to the inner surface of the colon before it is spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs. Therefore early stage colon cancer can be completely resected with good chances for cure. However, if cancer is detected at later stages, the cancer tissues have already penetrated the colon wall and invaded neighboring organs and lymph nodes, or have spread to distant organs such as liver and ''lungs''. Complete surgical excision becomes highly unlikely.  EUS can provide information regarding the depth of penetration of the cancer and spread of cancer to adjacent tissues and lymph nodes, information useful for staging.'  Staging of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas and rectum. 
 Staging of lung cancer. 
 Evaluating chronic pancreatitis and other masses or cysts of the pancreas. 
 Studying bile duct abnormalities including stones in the bile duct or gallbladder, or bile duct, gallbladder, or liver tumors. 
 Studying the muscles of the lower rectum and anal canal in evaluating reasons for fecal incontinence. 
 Studying 'submucosal lesions' such as nodules or 'bumps' that may be hiding in the intestinal wall covered by normal appearing lining of the intestinal tract."
What is the preparation for EUS?,"'Your doctor will want to know about your health status especially if you have any ''allergies'', other significant health problems such as ''heart disease'', lung disease, or ''diabetes mellitus''.You will also be asked about ''allergies'' to ''iodine'' or shellfish as, under certain circumstances, iodine containing contrast material may be used. If there is a possibility of fine needle aspiration (FNA), the doctor will want to check your blood for proper clotting. It is important to inform your doctor of any family history of bleeding problems or if you are taking medications that interfere with blood clotting (such as ''Coumadin'') or platelet function (such as ''aspirin'', ''Motrin'', ''ibuprofen'', ''Aleve'', and other ''NSAIDs''). The wisest approach is to inform your doctor of any prescription or non-prescription medication you might be taking. Antibiotics are usually not required except in patients with certain ''heart'' valve problems.''EUS is performed with sedation so you will not be able to return to work or to drive for 24 hours. It also means that you will need someone to take you home as this is usually an out-patient procedure.''You will need to have an empty stomach, which means no oral intake for 6 or more hours. In case of a rectal EUS, you will probably need to take some enemas or laxatives. In either case, full instructions will be given to you.' "
How is EUS performed?,"'Upon arrival at the endoscopy center, the nurse or the doctor will discuss the procedure and answer any questions. You will then be asked to sign a consent form indicating you were informed about the procedure, its alternatives, and its risks. You will undress and put on a hospital gown. An IV will be placed in a vein and kept open with a slow drip of IV fluid. This IV will be used to administer the ''sedatives'' or other required medication. Anesthesia is rarely used. You will then be taken into the procedure room and, after the administration of the sedation, the EUS will be carried out. Small electrode patches will be placed on your skin for the monitoring of your pulse and a\xa0''blood pressure''\xa0cuff will be placed as well as a monitor on your finger to follow your blood oxygen.''Once sleepy, the special endoscope will be inserted and the procedure started. Due to the sedation, you will only feel minimal discomfort, if any, during the entire procedure. The physician will observe the inside of your intestinal tract on a TV monitor and the ultrasound image on another monitor. The entire procedure generally takes 30 to 90 minutes depending on the complexity and whether fine needle aspiration (FNA) is performed.''After the procedure, you will be sleepy for up to one hour and be unable to drink or walk. Once you are fully awake, the doctor will discuss with you and, if desired the person with you, the findings of the procedure. Barring any rare complications, when you are fully awake, your companion will be able to take you home where you should rest for the remainder of the day. Light meals and fluids are allowed. You may feel ''bloated'' from the carbon dioxide that may have been used to distend your abdomen, but this feeling will only be temporary. Should your throat be mildly sore, for a day or two, salt-water gargles will provide relief. You should call your doctor if concerned about your progress or having severe ''pain'', ''vomiting'', passage or ''vomiting'' of blood, ''chills'' or ''fever''. If EUS was particularly difficult or complicated you may be kept in the hospital overnight. The endoscopist will discuss this with you, when you wake up.' "
What are the risks of EUS ?,"'Like other endoscopy procedures, EUS is safe and well tolerated.  No procedure is without risk, but complications with EUS are quite rare. Complication rate for EUS without the fine needle aspiration is about one in two thousand. This is similar to the complication rate of other endoscopy procedures. Sometimes, patients can develop reactions such as ''hives'', skin ''rash'' or ''nausea'' to the medications used during EUS.  A lump may appear in the area of the vein where the IV was placed. This usually resolves over time. Should it persist, you should contact your physician. The main complication of serious note is perforation (making a hole in the intestinal wall) that may require surgical repair. This is quite rare and all precautions are taken to avoid it.''When FNA is performed complications occur more often but are still uncommon  (0.5-1.0%). Passing a needle through the gut wall may cause minor bleeding. If unusual bleeding occurs, the patient may be hospitalized briefly for observation, but blood transfusions are rarely needed. Infection is another rare complication of FNA. Infection can occur during aspiration of fluid from cysts and antibiotics may be given before the procedure. If the FNA is performed on the pancreas, ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas) can rarely occur. Pancreatitis calls for hospitalization, observation, rest, IV fluid, and medication for ''abdominal pain''. It usually resolves spontaneously in a few days.' "
What is upper endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to examine the ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope with a camera on the tip through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.'  "
How do I prepare for endoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's ""'allergies''. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.'  "
Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.' "
Endoscopy vs. colonoscopy: What's the difference?,"'Both ''endoscopy'' and ''colonoscopy'' are nonsurgical procedures that involve use of a flexible tube with a light and camera to examine parts of the digestive tract. A colonoscopy is a type of endoscopy.''The term “endoscopy” often refers to an ''upper endoscopy'' (sometimes called a ''gastroscopy''), a procedure in which an endoscope (a long flexible tube with a camera attached on the end) is passed through the mouth and throat into the ''esophagus'', so a doctor can visualize the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine (duodenum).''In an ''ultrasound'' endoscopy, a small ultrasound device is installed on the tip of the endoscope, which allows doctors to get more accurate and detailed images than those obtained from external ultrasounds.''There is generally no specific preparation required for an upper endoscopy, but doctors generally prefer your stomach be empty.''When an endoscope is passed through the rectum into the ''large intestine'' (colon), the procedure is called a ''sigmoidoscopy'' or colonoscopy, depending on how much of the colon is examined.''An endoscopy or a colonoscopy usually can be done in 10-30 min, unless there are complications or further investigations with biopsies, or polyp removal is necessary.''A colonoscopy requires preparation to clear out the colon. Most colonoscopy preparations involve drinking large amounts of cleansing solutions (such as ''MiraLAX''), along with laxatives, enemas, and possibly several days of a clear ''liquid diet'' prior to the procedure' "
What is the preparation for endoscopy vs. colonoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems.

The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.''If the procedure is to be complete and accurate, the colon must be completely cleaned, and there are several different colonoscopy preparations. Patients are given detailed instructions about the cleansing preparation. In general, this consists of drinking a large volume of a special cleansing solution or several days of a clear liquid ''diet'' and laxatives or enemas prior to the examination. These instructions should be followed exactly as prescribed or the procedure may be unsatisfactory (visualization of the lining of the colon may be obscured by residual ''stool''), and it may have to be repeated, or a less accurate alternative test must be performed in its place.''Instructions may also be given to avoid certain foods for a couple of days prior to the procedure, such as stringy foods, foods with seeds, or red Jell-O.''Most medications should be continued as usual, but some may interfere with the examination. It is best if the colonoscopist is informed of all current prescription and ''over-the-counter'' medications. ''Aspirin'' products, blood thinners such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), ''arthritis'' medications, ''insulin'"", and iron preparations are examples of medications that may require special instructions. The colonoscopist will also want to be aware of a patient's ""'allergies'' and any other major illnesses. The colonoscopist should be alerted if, in the past, patients have required antibiotics prior to surgical or dental procedures to prevent infections.' "
What happens during the endoscopy and colonoscopy procedures?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called conscious sedation, and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""deep sedation,"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.''Afterwards, you’ll go to a rest area in the hospital or medical center to let the medication wear off. You must have someone drive you home as the sedation medication makes it unsafe to operate heavy machinery.''Prior to colonoscopy, intravenous fluids are started, and the patient is placed on a monitor for continuous monitoring of heart rhythm and blood pressure as well as oxygen in the blood. Medications (''sedatives'') usually are given through an intravenous line so the patient becomes sleepy and relaxed, and to reduce pain. If needed, the patient may receive additional doses of medication during the procedure. Colonoscopy often produces a feeling of pressure, cramping, and ''bloating'' in the abdomen; however, with the aid of medications, it is generally well-tolerated and infrequently causes severe pain.''Patients will lie on their left side or back as the ''colonoscope'' is slowly advanced. Once the tip of the colon (cecum) or the last portion of the small intestine (terminal ileum) is reached, the colonoscope is slowly withdrawn, and the lining of the colon is carefully examined. Colonoscopy usually takes 15 to 60 minutes. If the entire colon, for some reason, cannot be visualized, the physician may decide to try colonoscopy again at a later date with or without a different bowel preparation or may decide to order an X-ray or CT of the colon.''If an abnormal area needs to be better evaluated, a biopsy forceps can be passed through a channel in the colonoscope and a biopsy (a sample of the tissue) can be obtained. The biopsy is submitted to the pathology laboratory for examination under a microscope by a pathologist. If infection is suspected, a biopsy may be obtained for culturing of bacteria (and occasionally ''viruses'' or fungus) or examination under the microscope for parasites. If colonoscopy is performed because of bleeding, the site of bleeding can be identified, samples of tissue obtained (if necessary), and the bleeding controlled by several means. Should there be polyps, (benign growths that can become cancerous) they almost always can be removed through the colonoscope. Removal of these polyps is an important method of preventing colon and ''rectal cancer'', although the great majority of polyps are benign and do not become cancerous. None of these additional procedures typically produces pain. Biopsies are taken for many reasons and do not necessarily mean that ''cancer'' is suspected.' "
What are the risks of colonoscopy and endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or sedatives used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.''Complications of colonoscopy are rare and usually minor when performed by physicians who have been specially trained and are experienced in colonoscopy.''Bleeding may occur at the site of biopsy or removal of polyps, but the bleeding usually is minor and self-limited or can be controlled through the colonoscope. It is quite unusual to require transfusions or surgery for post-colonoscopic bleeding. An even less common complication is a perforation or a tear through the colonic wall, but even these perforations may not require surgery.''Other potential complications are reactions to the sedatives used, localized irritation to the vein where medications were injected (leaving a tender lump lasting a day or two), or complications from existing heart or lung disease. The incidence of all of these complications together is less than 1%.''While these complications are rare, it is important for patients to recognize early signs of a complication so that they may return to their physicians or an emergency room. The colonoscopist who performed the colonoscopy should be contacted if a patient notices severe ''abdominal pain'', ''rectal bleeding'' of more than half a cup, or ''fever'' and ''chills''.''Colonoscopy is the best method available to detect, diagnose, and treat abnormalities within the colon. The alternatives to colonoscopy are quite limited. ''Barium enema'' is a less accurate test performed with ''X-rays''. It misses abnormalities more often than colonoscopy, and, if an abnormality is found, a colonoscopy still may be required to biopsy or remove the abnormality. At times, an abnormality or lesion detected with a barium enema is actually ''stool'' or residual food in a poorly cleansed colon. Colonoscopy may then be necessary to clarify the nature of the lesion. ''Flexible sigmoidoscopy'' is a limited examination that uses a shorter colonoscope and examines only the last one-third of the colon.''Patients will be kept in an observation area for an hour or two post-colonoscopy until the effects of medications that have been given wear off. If patients have been given sedatives before or during colonoscopy, they may not drive, even if they feel alert. Should patients have some cramping or bloating, this can be relieved quickly with the passage of ''gas'', and they should be able to eat upon returning home.''After the removal of polyps or certain other manipulations, the ''diet'' or activities of patients may be restricted for a brief period of time.' "
When will I get the results for an endoscopy vs. colonoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'""Prior to the patient's departure from the coloscopic unit, the findings can be discussed with the patient. However, at times, a definitive diagnosis may have to wait for a microscopic analysis of biopsy specimens, which usually takes a few days."" "
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "
Facts you should know about a capsule endoscopy,"'Modern endoscopic techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract (''esophagus'', stomach, and duodenum) and the colon. The last remaining frontier has been the small intestine.''The small intestine has been a difficult organ in which to make diagnoses and treat without performing surgery. Radiological\xa0procedures, specifically the ''upper GI series'' with small bowel follow-through, which involves following swallowed barium as it passes through the intestine with X-ray films, have been available for diagnosis, but these radiological procedures are time-consuming and are not accurate in identifying small tumors and other subtle abnormalities of the small intestine. The demand for improved capabilities in the small intestine has been less because a minority of intestinal diseases involve the small intestine beyond the reach of the upper gastrointestinal endoscope and the ''colonoscope''. Nevertheless, improved diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in the small intestine would be very useful, particularly in uncovering the causes of ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''anemia'"" due to intestinal loss of blood and diagnosing diseases that may involve only the small intestine, for example, Crohn's disease. One of the newer technologies that expands the diagnostic capabilities in the small intestine is capsule ""'endoscopy'' also known as wireless capsule endoscopy.' "
What is capsule endoscopy?,"'Capsule endoscopy is a technology that uses a swallowed video capsule to take photographs of the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. For capsule endoscopy, the ''intestines'' are first cleared of residual food and bacterial debris with the use of laxatives and/or purges very similar to the laxatives and purges used before ''colonoscopy''. A large capsule -- larger than the largest pill -- is swallowed by the patient. The capsule contains one or two video chips (cameras), a light bulb, a battery, and a radio transmitter. As the capsule travels through the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, it takes photographs rapidly. The photographs are transmitted by the radio transmitter to a small receiver that is worn\xa0on the waist of\xa0the patient who is undergoing the capsule endoscopy. At the end of the procedure, approximately 8 hours later, the photographs are downloaded from the receiver into a computer, and the images are reviewed by a physician. The capsule is passed by the patient into the toilet and flushed away. There is no need to retrieve the capsule!' "
What are the limitations of capsule endoscopy?,"'While the capsule provides the best means of viewing the inside of the small intestine, there are many inherent limitations and problems with its use, the most important of which is that\xa0the capsule\xa0does not allow for therapy. Other problems include:' Abnormalities in some areas of the intestine are missed because of rapid transit of the capsule and blurred, uninterpretable photographs. The images can also be blurred by retained stool of food debris. Hence the importance of a good bowel preparation prior to the capsule endoscopy. At times, transit is so slow that the capsule examines only part of the small intestine before the battery fails. The battery life is about eight hours. If abnormalities are discovered that require surgical resection or further investigation, it may be difficult to determine where in the small intestine the abnormality is and thereby help direct therapy. If there are narrow areas due to scarring (strictures) or tumors in the small intestine, the capsule can get stuck in the narrow area and cause an obstruction of the intestine that requires surgical removal of the capsule. (For this reason, in patients who are suspected of having a stricture, a self-dissolving, dummy capsule is swallowed first. If the dummy capsule sticks, it can be seen on an X-ray of the abdomen and the location of the stricture determined. Because it dissolves with time, however, the obstruction from the capsule will resolve without surgery, and the real capsule will not be used.) Finally, reviewing the tens of thousands of photographs is very time consuming for the conscientious physician."
What type of diseases can be diagnosed with capsule endoscopy?,"'Capsule endoscopy continues to improve technically. It has revolutionized diagnosis by providing a sensitive (able to identify subtle abnormalities) and simple (non-invasive) means of examining the inside of the small intestine. Some common examples of small intestine diseases diagnosed by capsule endoscopy include: ' Angiodysplasias (collections of small blood vessels located just beneath the inner intestinal lining that can bleed intermittently and cause anemia) Small intestinal tumors such as lymphoma, carcinoid tumor, and small intestinal cancer Crohn's disease of the small intestine "

What is endotracheal intubation?,"'Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which a tube is inserted through the mouth down into the trachea (the large ''airway'' from the mouth to the ''lungs''). Before surgery, this is often done under deep sedation. In emergency situations, the patient is often unconscious at the time of this procedure.' "
What kind of tube is used?,'The tube that is used today is usually a flexible ''plastic'' tube. It is called an endotracheal tube because it is slipped within the trachea.' 
How do they put the tube down into the trachea?,"""The doctor often inserts the tube with the help of a laryngoscope, an instrument that permits the doctor to see the upper portion of the trachea, just below the vocal cords. During the procedure the laryngoscope is used to hold the tongue aside while inserting the tube into the trachea. It is important that the head be positioned in the appropriate manner to allow for proper visualization. Pressure is often applied to the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) to help with visualization and prevent possible aspiration of stomach contents."" "
What is the purpose of endotracheal intubation?,"'The endotracheal tube serves as an open passage through the upper airway. The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to permit air to pass freely to and from the lungs in order to ventilate the lungs. Endotracheal tubes can be connected to ventilator machines to provide artificial ''respiration''. This can help when a patient is unconscious and by maintaining a patent airway, especially during surgery. It is often used when patients are critically ill and cannot maintain adequate respiratory function to meet their needs. The endotracheal tube facilitates the use of a mechanical ventilator in these critical situations.'  "
Is endotracheal intubation used for COVID-19 coronavirus patients?,"'Endotracheal intubation is the approved way of providing ''breathing'' support to ''COVID-19'"" coronavirus disease patients as of this article's update in early April, 2020.\xa0""'Non-invasive mechanical ventilation\xa0like ''CPAP'' (continuous positive airway pressure) machines used for ''sleep apnea'' are not good for ''COVID-19'"" patients, according to clinical guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists. In some cases, CPAP\xa0masks or\xa0nasal pillows\xa0may provide adequate oxygen, but current devices aerosolize\xa0virus particles in the patient's breath and spread them around wherever\xa0the patient is housed, potentially infecting\xa0more people in the area.""'Endotracheal intubation and ventilation supports a ''COVID-19'"" patient's breathing so the body can survive as\xa0the immune system fights the virus. This means a better chance of\xa0fighting off the virus, but ventilators can't cure COVID-19."" "
What are the complications of endotracheal intubation?,"'If the tube is inadvertently placed in the ''esophagus'' (right behind the trachea), adequate respirations will not occur. ''Brain damage'', ''cardiac arrest'', and death can occur. Aspiration of stomach contents can result in ''pneumonia'' and ''ARDS''. Placement of the tube too deep can result in only one lung being ventilated and can result in a ''pneumothorax'' as well as inadequate ventilation. During endotracheal tube placement, damage can also occur to the ''teeth'', the soft tissues in the back of the throat, as well as the vocal cords.''This procedure should be performed by a physician with experience in intubation. In the vast majority of cases of intubation, no significant complications occur.'  "
What is a brain aneurysm?,"'An aneurysm is a weak area in the wall of an artery which leads to a balloon or pouch formation. The wall of the pouch is thinner than the rest of the artery wall and is at risk of breaking. This type of aneurysm is known as a berry aneurysm, or saccular aneurysm, based on the way it appears. If the aneurysm breaks, then there can be bleeding in the brain. Other types of aneurysms include lateral aneurysm, where a bulge appears along one wall of the artery, or fusiform aneurysm, when the entire artery is enlarged.''The specific cause why aneurysms form is unknown. Aneurysms can be hereditary (run in families)\xa0or occur due to an abnormality which occurred during gestation. Some diseases can lead to weakness in artery walls and formation of aneurysms; these include ''polycystic kidney disease'', some of the ''connective tissue disorders'', or ''vascular malformations''. ''Trauma'', ''high blood pressure'', or drug use may also increase the risk of developing aneurysm. In rare cases, infection within the wall of the artery can cause an aneurysm to form.' "
What is endovascular coiling?,"'Endovascular coiling is a way to treat ''aneurysms'' without opening the skull or performing brain surgery. The coil refers to a thin wire which is bunched up (coiled) within the aneurysm. The coil prevents further blood flow into the aneurysm by causing a clot to form, while the rest of the artery remains open to transport blood to the brain. The wire is inserted through a catheter which is fed through the large arteries of the body and into the arteries of the brain. This procedure is done as an alternative to aneurysm clipping (surgically isolating the aneurysm by placing a clip at the base of the aneurysm to keep blood from entering), which requires brain surgery. to isolate the area of the aneurysm.' "
Who needs endovascular coiling?, 
What happens during an endovascular coiling procedure?,"'Patients are admitted to a hospital on the day of their procedure. Patients are not allowed to eat or drink on the day of the procedure. An IV is started to supply fluids. At the time of the procedure, the patient is taken to a special room in the radiology department; some anesthesia or sedation is used to help the patient relax. A catheter, or long tube, is inserted into the femoral artery and carefully fed through the ''aorta'' (the main artery of the body) into one of the arteries which goes into the brain. Dye is used to identify the aneurysm; once the aneurysm is located, small wires (typically made of platinum) are inserted into the aneurysm and coil into place. Additional wires are implanted in this way until the aneurysm is full. After the wires are completely inserted and the associated artery is checked with dye to confirm there is no injury, the catheter is removed. The area where the catheter had been inserted in the femoral artery is held firmly for several minutes to prevent bleeding.''After the procedure is completed, patients are observed for several hours. Following the procedure, patients may be allowed to go home the same day. However, if the procedure had been performed to treat an aneurysm that had leaked or ruptured, patients may be hospitalized for several days or weeks.''There are typically some limitations of activity for several days following an endovascular coiling procedure, including no driving or working and some weight-lifting restrictions. Patients need to be seen for follow-up about a month after the procedure to confirm there are no complications.' "
Endovascular coiling vs. surgical clipping,"'Surgical clipping has been around for longer than endovascular coiling, and there is some data that suggests that the clipping procedure is less likely to require a repeat procedure over time. However, a study performed in 2002 looking at open surgical clipping vs. endovascular coiling as treatment for ruptured aneurysms (the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial, or ISAT) was stopped early as the rates of associated disability or death after 1 year were much less in the group which was selected to receive endovascular coiling.' "
What is the recovery time after endovascular coiling?,"""Recovery times vary per patient, location of the aneurysm, and whether the aneurysm ruptured. For patients with unruptured aneurysms who undergo endovascular coiling, recovery times may be as short as a month; other individuals find that they're back to baseline after about 3 to 6 months. If an aneurysm ruptures, recovery can take weeks to months; depending on the area of the brain where the aneurysm was located, permanent damage to the brain may occur."" "
What are the potential risks and complications of endovascular coiling?,"'There are some possible risks associated with endovascular coiling. These can include injury or damage to the artery or aneurysm being treated; in rare cases, the aneurysm can rupture. Vasospasm, or a sudden narrowing of the artery, can occur and lead to decreased blood flow to the brain which is fed by that artery. A ''blood clot'' can form on the catheter, the coils as they are injected, or in the artery where the catheter is fed. If this occurs, the clot can cause blockage of blood flow or a ''stroke''. The coils may not stay in place or may not completely occlude the aneurysm; if this occurs, the aneurysm might regrow or get larger. Patients may have an ''allergic reaction'' to the dye used during the procedure. With any procedure, there is a risk of infection.' "
How much does endovascular coiling cost?,"'The specific costs of endovascular coiling are not available. Many factors play a role in determining the cost of the procedure, including whether the aneurysm has already ruptured, the age of the patient, the presence of associated illnesses, whether hospitalization is needed following the procedure, and the number of aneurysms that need to be addressed.' "
What is a barium enema series?,"'A lower GI series, also known as a barium enema, barium enema procedure, barium enema X-ray or double-contrast barium enema, is an X-ray test in which a white liquid, called barium, is infused through a catheter (tube) inserted through the anus and into the rectum until it fills the large bowel (colon). X-ray films of the colon then are taken so that the outline of the colon can be seen.    The barium enema and double contrast barium enema are used to define normal and abnormal anatomy of the colon and rectum. Colon and rectal abnormalities that can be detected include ''diverticulosis'', polyps, dilation of the colon, ''Hirschsprung disease'' in infants, and colon ''cancers''.'  "
What are the risks of a lower barium enema?,"'Distention of the colon is uncomfortable, but only a few patients find it very painful. Any X-ray test procedure involves some risk of radiation exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques which have been developed and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils. All radiology technologists are certified by national certifying boards.  ''Women who are or may be pregnant should notify the doctor requesting the procedure and the radiology staff, as there is a potential risk of harm to the fetus with any radiation exposure.  Complications of barium enema examination are rare.  The tip of the enema catheter or distention of the colon can penetrate the wall of the colon and give rise to a localized infection (''abscess'') or ''peritonitis'' (generalized infection of the abdominal ''cavity'').  This usually occurs only when excessive pressure is used to infuse the barium or there is already a diseased colon that is weakened.'  "
"How does the patient prepare for a lower barium enema, and how is it performed?","'Any internal or external materials that make an X-ray image less clear can interfere with the accuracy of a barium enema. Therefore, before undergoing a barium enema (lower GI), it is important to eliminate as much fecal material from the colon and rectum as is possible. Prior to the examination, a clear ''liquid diet'' and cleansing enemas often are used to empty the colon. Further medications that help evacuate the bowel are usually used. This is called a bowel prep. External materials such as extra clothing, metallic devices, or jewelry are removed prior to the test. A radiologist (a doctor specializing in the use and interpretation of ''X-rays'') and a radiology technologist work perform the procedure on the patient.'   A barium enema involves filling the colon and rectum with a white liquid material (barium) through a catheter (tube) inserted into the rectum through the anus. It is normal during the procedure to feel some fullness or mild discomfort in the abdomen. Subsequently, an X-ray machine is placed in front of the patient with X-ray film behind. Images of the colon then are obtained by exposing the abdomen to the radiation. The contrast in density between the barium-filled colon and other structures of the abdomen are apparent on the X-ray film and give an excellent outline of the colon. The radiologist also will use a fluoroscope, an X-ray device on which the barium can be seen in motion flowing into the colon. Further static images of the colon then are obtained on plain X-ray film or digital computerized image. The barium then may be drained so that only a small amount of barium remains sticking to the lining of the colon, and air is infused into the colon to distend it. Further X-rays then are taken which give more detail of colon's lining than the X-rays of the barium-filled colon. This latter procedure is called a double contrast barium enema since both air and barium are used to provide the images. Polyps and small cancers are more readily found using this technique (called an air contrast barium enema). A barium enema can take anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour depending on the problem being studied and the particular anatomy of the patient's colon."
How does the patient obtain the results of a lower barium enema series?,"'After the X-ray films are developed by the radiology technologist, they are transmitted to the radiologist, who interprets the body structures visualized on the X-ray film. An interpretation and report of the barium enema is forwarded to the doctor who requested the test usually within one to two days. The doctor then can review the results of the report with the patient. The actual films of the examination also can be sent to the health care practitioner if necessary.' "

Injections for Lip Augmentation,"""Your surgeon will most likely use topical anesthesia (painkiller applied directly to the lips) for injections. These are performed on an outpatient basis in your doctor's office or an outpatient center and you will be sent home the same day.""' Here are the options: ' Artecoll is a synthetic material that plumps up the lips. Because it's synthetic, you are at higher risk of having an allergic reaction to it than if you got an injection of collagen or fat, but it lasts longer than either. Autologen is an injection of your own collagen, extracted from another place on your body. There's no risk of allergic reaction, however, the results are only temporary. This may be good for people who aren't ready to commit to a permanent result. Collagen can be extracted from cows and injected into the lips. There's a risk of allergic reaction, so it's best to have your surgeon give you a test dose before proceeding to the full dose. The results are temporary lasting 
	four weeks to three months. Dermalogen is collagen extracted from deceased human donors. This is also a temporary fix, but your body should not reject it. Fascia injections use a specific type of connective tissue harvested either from your own body or from a deceased human donor. It can be implanted surgically or injected. The main drawback is that within a year of injection, your body will reabsorb the fascia. Fat from your own thighs or abdomen can be injected into your lips. There's no risk of allergic reaction and you may achieve permanent results. This can also be implanted surgically (see below). If you gain weight, your lips may enlarge since the fat cells will get bigger.  Hylaform is a material created from a natural body substances known as hyaluronic acid. There's no risk of infection, but you will need repeated treatments to maintain the result as it's only a temporary fix. Restylane is a clear gel. It contains hyaluronic acid. It's biodegradable, so your body will absorb it within about six months of the injection. "

A procedure can take up to two hours at your doctor's office or outpatient center, depending on the complexity, and you will be sent home the same day.""'Here are the options:''Your surgeon may also be able to make an incision along the upper line of your lip.' Alloderm is a sheet of collagen created from deceased humans. Your surgeon inserts them through tiny incisions made on the inside part of the lip. This material offers only a temporary fix, lasting up to 12 months. Fat grafting is the surgical method of inserting your own fat into your lips to achieve the desired fullness. You may achieve permanent results, but this method varies from person to person. Because it's your own fat, there is a chance that your body can reabsorb it. Goretex, SoftForm, and soft ePTFE are synthetic materials that can achieve a permanent result. Unlike some of the other options we've listed above, your body will not absorb these. However, because they are synthetic, there is a risk of allergic reaction. Local flap grafts is a 
  surgical procedure that takes tissue and skin from the inside flap of your 
  mouth. It's far more invasive than any other technique, and is often the last resort among plastic surgeons."

What causes an enlarged spleen?,"'The spleen will enlarge when it performs more of its duties to filter blood or to manufacture blood cells. Therefore, any disease or condition that damages red blood cells, and requires them to be filtered and removed from the blood stream, will cause the spleen to become larger.''Conditions such as hemolytic ''anemia'', where red blood cells are damaged and broken down (hemolyzed) can cause the spleen to enlarge. Misshapen red blood cells, like those found in ''sickle cell disease'', ''thalassemia'', and spherocytosis, may be damaged when they try to squeeze through small capillary blood vessels. These damaged red blood cells need to be culled from the bloodstream and are filtered out by the spleen.''The spleen will enlarge if there is a decrease in blood flow through the splenic vein. This may cause spleen ''congestion'' and enlargement. This situation may be associated with ''liver disease'' and ''portal hypertension''. Damage to ''liver'' cells makes it difficult for blood to flow normally, and as blood backs up in the portal vein system, it may affect pressure in the splenic vein. The decreased ability of blood to drain from the spleen causes it to become congested and grow larger. People with ''congestive heart failure'' may have an ''enlarged liver'' and spleen because of poor blood flow to and from the ''heart''.''Leukemia'' and lymphoma may be associated with abnormal white cells that can invade the spleen and increase its size.''Other cancers can spread or ''metastasize'' to the spleen and cause it to enlarge.''Certain metabolic diseases may cause the spleen to enlarge, including Hurler Syndrome, ''Gaucher'' disease and ''Niemann-Pick Disease''.''In ''sarcoidosis'' and ''amyloidosis'' the spleen can be involved and become enlarged with the abnormal protein deposits.''Some infections may cause splenomegaly including:''Trauma, for example, from a car accident, can damage the spleen.'

What tests diagnose an enlarged spleen?,"'An enlarged spleen is most often found on physical examination. Either the health care practitioner is looking for an enlarged spleen because of a diagnosis that has already been made, or it is found incidentally when initially examining a patient (and it then serves as a clue to an underlying diagnosis).''With its location protected beneath the left lower ribs, a normal spleen is usually not felt on physical exam, except in some unusually thin individuals. As it enlarges, the spleen grows from the left upper quadrant of the abdomen towards the umbilicus (the ''belly button''). Sometimes the doctor will ask the patient to roll on their right side to better attempt to feel the spleen. An enlarged spleen may not be felt in ''obese'' patients.''On occasion, an enlarged spleen may be diagnosed by plain X-ray, ''ultrasound'', abdominal ''CT scan'', or ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'').' "
What is the treatment for an enlarged spleen? Are there natural treatments?,"'Because splenomegaly is due to an underlying illness, treatment will depend upon the primary cause. In some situations, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be part of the treatment. For example, in hereditary spherocytosis, a condition in which red blood cells are abnormal and shaped like a sphere instead of the concave disk shape. These abnormal red blood cells are filtered from the blood stream, which causes ''anemia'' and an enlarged spleen. Splenectomy limits the number of red blood cells destroyed and helps treat the disease.''There are no natural treatments for an enlarged spleen.'  "
What complications are associated with an enlarged spleen?,"'Perhaps the most important worry with an enlarged spleen is the risk of injury as it grows beyond the protection of the rib cage. A minor injury may cause it to rupture and bleed. Spleen injuries are often treated by observation, but on occasion, the spleen can rupture causing life threatening ''internal bleeding'' requiring surgery for to remove the spleen. This is the reason that teenagers and young adults diagnosed with ''infectious mononucleosis'' need to wait until the spleen returns to its normal size, and is protected by the rib cage, before participating in activities where the enlarged spleen could be damaged.''All types of blood cells may become trapped in a large spleen. Anemia (''low red blood cell count'') may cause''Low platelet count'' (''thrombocytopenia'') may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.''Leukopenia'' (low white blood cell count) may be associated with an increased risk of infection.''Should the spleen need to be removed surgically (''splenectomy''), the risk of certain infections increases, and the patient will need to make certain that their immunizations are up to date, especially against ''pneumococcus'', ''meningococcus'' and ''haemophilus influenzae''.'   weakness, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain."
What is the prognosis for an enlarged spleen? Can you live without it?,"'Often, the prognosis for an enlarged spleen depends entirely upon the underlying illness. For example, in patients with ''infectious mononucleosis'', the spleen will return to its normal size once the infection resolves.''In some instances, the spleen may need to be removed and the risk of infection may increase. In other cases, the spleen will remain enlarged and leave the patient at an increased risk for bleeding, spleen rupture, and infection.' "
Can an enlarged spleen be prevented?,"'An enlarged spleen is the consequence of an underlying illnesses, many of which may not be anticipated or prevented.''Finally, certain infectious diseases such as ''HIV'', ''malaria'', ''tuberculosis'', and anaplasmosis can be prevented if the appropriate measures are taken to minimize the risks of acquiring the disease.' Liver disease due to alcohol abuse, which causes cirrhosis and portal hypertension, can be prevented. With alcohol use, moderation is the key, and excessive drinking has very dangerous consequences both in the short and long term. Certain causes of viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), which can lead to cirrhosis also can be prevented by avoiding contact with body fluids from infected individuals. Hepatitis B can also be prevented through vaccination."
What is typhoid fever? What is the history of typhoid fever?,"'Typhoid fever is an acute infectious illness associated with fever that is most often caused by the ''Salmonella typhi'' bacteria. ''Salmonella paratyphi'', a related bacterium that usually leads to a less severe illness, can also cause typhoid fever. The feces of human carriers of the bacteria may contaminate water or food, and the illness then spreads to other people in the area. Typhoid fever is rare in industrial countries but continues to be a significant public health issue in developing countries.''The incidence of typhoid fever in the United States has decreased since the early 1900s. In 2014, medical professionals reported approximately 300 cases to the CDC, mostly in people who recently traveled to endemic areas. This is in comparison to the 1920s, when there were over 35,000 reported cases in the U.S., with a 20% fatality rate.''In the early 1900s, a healthy carrier called Typhoid Mary (her real name was Mary Mallon) caused several outbreaks in the New York City area; she was infected, worked as a cook, and consequently spread the disease to others.''A recent outbreak affected refugees in Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.''The decrease in cases in the United States is the result of improved environmental sanitation, vaccination, and treatment with antibiotics. Mexico and South America are the most common areas for U.S. citizens to contract typhoid fever. India, Pakistan, and Egypt are also known high-risk areas for developing this disease. Worldwide, typhoid fever affects more than 21 million people annually, with over 200,000 patients dying of the disease.''If traveling to endemic areas, you should consult with your health care professional and discuss if you should receive vaccination for typhoid fever.'  "
How do patients get typhoid fever?,"'People contract typhoid fever when they ingestion the bacteria in contaminated food or water. Patients with acute illness can contaminate the surrounding water supply through ''stool'', which contains a high concentration of the bacteria. Contamination of the water supply can taint the food supply. About 3%-5% of patients become carriers of the bacteria after the acute illness. Some patients suffer a very mild illness that goes unrecognized. These patients can become long-term carriers of the bacteria. The bacteria multiply in the gallbladder, bile ducts, or ''liver'' and passes into the bowel. The bacteria can survive for weeks in water or dried sewage. These chronic carriers may have no symptoms and can be the source of new outbreaks of typhoid fever for many years.' "
What causes typhoid fever? How do health care professionals diagnose typhoid fever?,"'After the ingestion of contaminated food or water, the ''Salmonella'' bacteria invade the small intestine and enter the bloodstream temporarily. White blood cells carry the bacteria to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The bacteria then multiply in the cells of these organs and reenter the bloodstream. Patients develop symptoms, including fever, when the organism reenters the bloodstream. Bacteria invade the gallbladder, biliary system, and the lymphatic tissue of the bowel. Here, they multiply in high numbers. The bacteria pass into the intestinal tract and can be identified for diagnosis in cultures from the stool tested in the laboratory. Stool cultures are sensitive in the early and late stages of the disease, but it may be necessary to perform blood cultures to make a definitive diagnosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of typhoid fever?,"'The incubation period is usually 1-2 weeks, and the duration of the illness is about 4-6 weeks. The patient experiences''People with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103 F-104 F (39 C-40 C).''Chest congestion'' develops in many patients, and ''abdominal pain'' and discomfort are common. The fever becomes constant. Improvement occurs in the third and fourth week in those without complications. About 10% of patients have recurrent symptoms (relapse) after feeling better for 1-2 weeks. Relapses are actually more common in individuals treated with antibiotics.'   poor appetite; abdominal pain and peritonitis; headaches; generalized aches and pains and weakness; high fever, often up to 104 F; lethargy (usually only if untreated); intestinal bleeding or perforation (after 2-3 weeks of the disease); cough; diarrhea; or constipation."
"What is the treatment for typhoid fever, and what is the prognosis?","'Antibiotics that kill the ''Salmonella'' bacteria treat typhoid fever. Prior to the use of antibiotics and intravenous fluids, the fatality rate was 20%. Death occurred from overwhelming infection, ''pneumonia'', intestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation. Antibiotics and supportive care have reduced the mortality rate to 1%-2%. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is usually improvement within one to two days and recovery within 7 to 10 days.''Several antibiotics are effective for the treatment of typhoid fever. ''Chloramphenicol'' was the original drug of choice for many years. Because of rare serious side effects, other effective antibiotics have replaced chloramphenicol. The choice of antibiotics needs to be guided by identifying the geographic region where the organism was acquired and the results of cultures once available. (Certain ''strains'' from South America show a significant resistance to some antibiotics.) ''Ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'') is the most frequently used drug in the U.S. for nonpregnant patients. Ceftriaxone (Rocephin), an intramuscular injection medication, is an alternative for ''pregnant'' patients. ''Ampicillin'' (Omnipen, Polycillin, Principen) and ''trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim'', ''Septra'') are frequently prescribed antibiotics although resistance has been reported in recent years.''Medical professionals have reported multi-''drug resistance'' and use cultures to guide treatment. If relapses occur, patients are retreated with antibiotics.''Prolonged antibiotics can treat the carrier state, which occurs in 3%-5% of those infected. Often, removal of the gallbladder, the site of chronic infection, will cure the carrier state.' "
What specialists treats typhoid fever?,"'Your primary care doctor can diagnose and treat typhoid fever. Because the disease is very rare in the United States, an infectious disease specialist often assists in the care of the patient with typhoid fever, as well.' "
Is typhoid fever contagious?,"'Typhoid fever is very ''contagious'' and contracted by the ingestion of the bacteria in contaminated food or water. Patients with acute illness can contaminate the surrounding water supply through infected stool, which contains a high concentration of the bacteria. It does not spread through the air (by ''cough'') or by touching (assuming there is no fecal exchange or first bacterial ingestion).' "
Is it possible to prevent typhoid fever?,"'For those traveling to high-risk areas, typhoid ''vaccines'' are now available. The routine administration of the vaccine is usually not recommended in the U.S. There are two forms of the vaccine available, an oral and an injectable form. People need to complete the vaccination at least 1-2 weeks (depending on the type of vaccine) prior to travel and, depending on the type of vaccine. The vaccine only protects from 2 to 5 years. The oral vaccine is contraindicated in patients with ''depressed'' immune systems. Details of the vaccination and the choice of vaccine should be discussed with a health care professional.' "
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "
What are enterovirulent E. coli (EEC)?,"'Enterovirulent ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') are composed of a number of serotypes (''strains'' of related bacteria identified by their slightly different antigenic structures) of bacteria that have a strong propensity to cause infections, initially in the gastrointestinal tract (""entero"" in Greek means intestine; virulent means deadly or disease-causing). Enterovirulent ''Escherichia coli'' (EEC) are members of the bacterial genus ''Escherichia'', named after T. Escherich, who first isolated the bacteria in 1885. The majority of the genus ''Escherichia'' is composed of one species termed ""coli"" (Latin for colon); however there are over 700 serotypes of this bacterial species. Many ''E. coli'' serotypes may cause infections other than in the intestine, but the focus of this article is on the enterovirulent groups (EEC groups), with symptoms of the disease primarily limited to the gastrointestinal tract.''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') are gram-negative bacteria that are rod-shaped, have the ability to survive in ''aerobic'' and ''anaerobic'' environments (termed a facultative anaerobe), and may or may not produce flagella and pili (thin hair-like projections) depending on environmental needs.''E. coli'' ''strains'' are found worldwide and live in significant numbers in humans and other animals as part of the normal bacterial population found in their large ''intestines''. The organisms have likely co-existed with humans for eons in the normal flora (bacterial populations usually found in healthy individuals) of human and other animal colons. However, among the 700 ''strains'' of ''E. coli'', there are a few strains that cause disease. These ''E. coli'' strains are some of the most frequent causes of many common ''bacterial infections'', including diarrhea, ''cholecystitis'', ''bacteremia'', cholangitis, ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), '""traveler's diarrhea""', and other clinical infections such as ''neonatal'' ''meningitis'', ''pneumonia'', abdominal abscesses, and ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'' (''HUS'').''A classic example of such an ''E. coli'' strain is ''E. coli'' ''0157:H7''. The name ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 seems complex; however scientists use the numbers and letters to specifically designate small differences in ''E. coli'' strains. The 0157 is the ""O"" serotype antigen that identifies one of the over 700 strains and the ""H"" of H7 represents the antigen type on the bacterium\'s flagella. Some ''E. coli'' also possess K antigens (protein/polysaccharide surface components) that have been used to identify certain strains. These designations (O, H, and K) may be used to identify strains causing specific diseases and have been utilized to identify outbreaks of disease.' "
What are the symptoms caused by enterovirulent E. coli (EEC)?,"'The major symptom that all enterovirulent ''E. coli'' (EEC) produce in common is diarrhea; these organisms are the leading cause of bacterial ''gastroenteritis''. However, the type of diarrhea (for example, bloody, chronic, or self-limiting) and the complications that may accompany the infections differ somewhat from each other. These symptoms have caused researchers and clinicians to arrange ''E. coli'' serotypes into groups according to their different symptoms and disease causing (pathogenic) mechanisms. Depending on which research or clinical physicians publications are read, there are 4 to 6 groups of ''E. coli'' that comprise all of the enterovirulent ''E. coli'' (EEC). Unfortunately, some investigators have more than one term for some members of the groups. The following is a summary of the groups that are currently in the literature and the symptoms ''E. coli'' group members cause: ''As one can surmise, there are unfortunate overlaps in disease syndromes and that is one reason that authors disagree on the actual number of groups (EPEC, EAEC, and EAggEC or EACE and EAggEC are often lumped together). It seems unlikely that the group names will remain stable in the future (see next section). '   EHEC (enterohemorrhagic E. coli): bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP); additional terms for EHEC are VTEC and STEC which stand for Vero toxin-producing E. coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, respectively. One serotype, E. coli 0157:H7, is responsible for the majority of the bloody diarrhea that occurs due to the production of Shiga toxins.  ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli):traveler's diarrhea, a watery diarrhea with nausea, abdominal cramping, and fever, caused by several serotypes of E. coli (0169:H47, 0148:H28 and several others) that produce two toxins that cause the gastrointestinal tract to secrete fluid (secretory exotoxins)  EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli): childhood diarrhea, caused by E. coli bacteria (many different serotypes) that can attach to gastrointestinal tissues, especially in infants, and produces a watery or bloody diarrhea in infants by producing a toxin similar to that produced by the bacterium named Shigella dysenteriae.  EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli): Shigella-like dysentery with blood and mucus, due to E. coli that invade epithelial cells of people of all ages, also producing vomiting, fever and chills. These serotypes are closely related to Shigella spp. (a few children develop HUS) EAEC (enteroadherent E. coli): childhood watery diarrhea, some cases of traveler's diarrhea in adults, and some urinary tract infections. This group is composed of E. coli strains (for example, 0119 or 055) that are able to adhere to human cells (gastrointestinal and other cell types). About one-half of this group is able to cause mild diarrhea, usually in children, while other E. coli serotypes that can adhere, do not cause any disease. Like EAggEC, these enteroadherent E. coli do not produce any Shiga toxins or secretory-causing exotoxins. EAggEC (enteroaggregative E. coli): persistent diarrhea in developing countries especially in children that usually lasts more than 14 days. The diarrhea is watery, mucus-containing, and in about one-third of individuals, bloody. Those with EAggEC usually have only a low fever (less than 101 F or 38.3 C) and almost no vomiting. These E. coli serotypes (for example, 042 and 044) do not produce any Shiga toxins or secretory exotoxins that cause secretions but cause intestinal inflammation that is linked to abnormally high intestinal secretion that leads to watery diarrhea. These strains are unique because they ""aggregate"" (form small masses comprised of cultured tissue cells and bacteria) human gastrointestinal cells by attaching via fimbriae (pili)."
A new EEC group? (E. coli 0104:H4),"'As an update to this article, the addition of the newest EEC E. strain will be presented. It recently arose in Germany in early 2011 and has now been documented in 11 European countries; at least four people who traveled to Germany and returned to the US have been infected with this strain. In most people, the exposure to the infection source occurred while people were visiting Germany, most likely through contaminated food (salads).''The strain has been identified as ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 (also termed ''STEC'' 0104:H4). It is presented in this section because as stated in the previous paragraph, there are unfortunate overlaps in ECC caused disease and this new strain seems to exhibit some of the worst overlap features of the ECC group members. For example, ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 is reported to contain about 93% of the genome of EHEC and produces the Shiga (Vero) toxin; however, it also seems to have the ability like EAEC strains to attach well to gastrointestinal cells.''The outbreak in Germany was the third largest ever reported for ''E. coli'' (about 4320 infected people) and the most lethal (at least 82 dead). In addition, most strains isolated are resistant to multiple antibiotics (aminoglycosides, macrolides and Beta-lactams). The source of the infection may be contaminated bean sprouts grown organically and then shipped to many German ''restaurants''. One major difference in ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 from other ''E. coli'' that cause ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'' or HUS (mainly ''E. coli'' 0157:H7) is that the organism is causing HUS in young adult females and other adults. Often, HUS caused by ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is seen in children and the elderly, not relatively healthy adults. This outbreak had 850 people develop HUS. This new strain had three disease causing (pathogenic) mechanisms; 1) Shiga toxin, 2) adherent fimbriae (pili), and 3) EXPEC (extra-intestinal pathogenic ''E. coli''). ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 may constitute a new group as yet unnamed.''The CDC suggested the following guidelines for ''E. coli'' 0104:H4. It is not recommended to give antibiotics to individuals with suspected STEC infections until complete diagnostic testing can be performed and STEC infection is ruled out. Some studies have shown that administering antibiotics to people with STEC infections might increase their risk of developing HUS. However, clinical decision making must be tailored to each affected individual. There may be indications for antibiotics in those with severe intestinal inflammation if perforation is of concern. Of note, isolates of STEC O104:H4 from patients in Germany have demonstrated resistance to multiple antibiotics.''CDC guidelines to ensure as complete as possible detection and characterization of STEC infections include the following:''The benefits of adhering to the recommended testing strategy include early diagnosis, improved patient outcome, and detection of all STEC serotypes.''All patients with Shiga toxin-positive diarrheal illness or HUS should be reported to health departments, regardless of a travel history to Germany.' All stools submitted for testing from patients with acute community-acquired diarrhea should be cultured for STEC O157:H7. These stools should be simultaneously assayed for non-O157 STEC with a test that detects the Shiga toxins or the genes encoding these toxins. Clinical laboratories should report and send E. coli O157:H7 isolates and Shiga toxin-positive samples to state or local public health laboratories as soon as possible for additional characterization. Specimens or enrichment broths in which Shiga toxin or STEC are detected, but from which O157:H7 STEC isolates are not recovered, should be forwarded as soon as possible to a state or local public health laboratory so that non-O157:H7 STEC can be isolated. It is often difficult to isolate STEC in stool by the time a patient presents with HUS. Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) has been shown to increase recovery of STEC from HUS patients. For any patient with HUS without a culture-confirmed STEC infection, stool can be sent to a public health laboratory that performs IMS or to the CDC (through a state public health laboratory). In addition, serum can be sent to CDC (through a state public health laboratory) for serologic testing of common STEC serogroups."
How do enterovirulent E. coli groups cause disease?,"'In general, all EEC groups cause disease by disruption of the normal secretory mechanisms of the intestines which leads to diarrhea. As outlined previously, different groups use different methods that ultimately results in diarrhea; the type of diarrhea and the intensity of the disease are related to the mechanisms used by the bacteria. ' EHEC secrete Shiga toxins that can not only destroy intestinal cells, but can be spread to other organ systems to cause additional disease. E. coli 0157:H7 is the major EHEC pathogen responsible and is considered to be one of the most virulent organisms in all of the EEC groups because of Shiga toxin production.  EPEC group organisms also can produce a toxin closely related to Shigella toxin that has many of the same properties of Shiga toxin although the serotypes cause the disease (sometimes milder) mainly in children.  The ETEC group does not produce Shiga toxins or their closely related 
toxins, but ETEC do produce two other exotoxins that stimulate the intestines to 
secrete fluid and mucus.  EIEC organisms, these bacteria have the ability to penetrate the epithelial cells that line areas of the human intestines. EIEC organisms then cause many of the cells to lyse thus disrupting the fluid adsorption and secretion capacity of the intestines.  Both EAEC and EAggEC groups of bacteria, by attaching to intestinal cells, cause irritation or inflammation of the intestinal cells. This physiologic and immunologic response also disrupts adsorption and secretion in the intestines."
When should one seek medical care for enterovirulent E. coli infection?,"'Many people (the large majority) do not need to seek medical care as most of the infections are self-limiting, unless the affected individual is immunocompromised or is an undernourished child in a developing country. Because a number of patients are children; their progress in self-limiting the disease needs to be carefully watched as they can, in some instances, rapidly deteriorate. This is the situation for all the EEC groups. Most infected individuals, unless diagnosed, will not even know they are infected with EEC since many bacterial and viral diseases have similar symptoms of ''nausea'', low-grade fever, and diarrhea.''Many health care professionals suggest that affected individuals should seek medical care if:' there are signs of dehydration (for example, decreased urination, dry mucous membranes), especially in children under 5 years of age and the elderly; sustained fever over 101 F (37.7 C); presence of blood in the stool; known ingestion of E. coli 0157:H7 or contaminated food or fluid or close personal contact with individuals known to have any E. coli infection caused by a EEC group bacteria; and/or any complication of an E. coli EEC group infection (see complication section below)."
How are enterovirulent E. coli infections diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis is usually made by an accurate history, physical exam, and analysis of a fecal sample from the patient. A presumptive diagnosis is often made if the patient's history indicates an association with persons, foods, or fluids known to contain ""'E. coli'' 0157:H7 or other EEC group bacteria; such a presumptive diagnosis is often made during outbreaks of the disease. However, in patients who require hospitalization, a definitive diagnosis is usually sought.''A definitive diagnosis is often made by culture of ''E. coli'' strains from a fecal specimens on selective media (''sorbitol''-MacConkey agar) when colonies react with antiserum directed against specific ""O"" antigen strains. The selective medium and antiserum help distinguish ''E. coli'' serovars from other similar pathogens such as ''Listeria'', ''Salmonella'' and ''Shigella.'' Other tests include ''PCR'' (''polymerase chain reaction'') and immunofluorescence tests to help identify the ''E. coli'' serovar. ''The CDC has recommended (2009) that all patients being evaluated for community-acquired diarrhea have their stool samples analyzed by immunologic test systems that detect all types of Shiga toxins as this test will likely detect almost all bacteria that produce Shiga toxins, especially ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 strains. The CDC suggests that this test is even better than bacterial culture techniques, but recommends that both culture and immunologic tests should be done at the same time. This is suggested since ''E. coli'' that produces Shiga or Shiga-like toxins usually have the potential to be very damaging to the infected person(s).''In 2013, the FDA approved a new test that can detect and differentiate between eleven pathogens (bacterial and viral) that include ''Escherichia coli'' O157, enterotoxigenic ''E coli'' LT/ST, ''Salmonella'',''Shigella'', and Shiga-like toxin producing ''E coli'' stx 1/stx 2) by detecting their nucleic acids. These types of tests will help health care professionals identify and differentiate the many causes of ''gastroenteritis''.' "
How are enterovirulent E. coli infections treated?,"'Initial treatment methods are similar for all of the EEC groups; hydration is the main treatment, both oral and IV (intravenous) hydration. However, additional treatment measures may be needed. If the patient is infected with EHEC, antibiotics are not used unless the patient is septic. Studies have shown that antibiotics in the EHEC group (especially with ''E. coli'' 0157:H7) induce bacteria that produce Shiga toxin to increase toxin release and make the disease and complications worse. In addition, investigators suggest that other toxin producing ''E. coli'' serovars in other groups (EPEC, ETEC and EIEC) may not be helped by antibiotics since on some rare occasions; they can develop complications similar to those of EHEC.'""Although some cases of traveler's diarrhea have been treated with antibiotics (for example, ""'sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim'' [''Septra'']), in general, antibiotics may reduce symptoms by only about 24/48 hours. EAEC and EAggEC frequently are self-limiting and many of the serovars are resistant to one or more antibiotics. If the decision to use antibiotics in any EEC infection is made, investigators suggest the ''E. coli'' serovar causing the infection be tested to determine antibiotic susceptibilities.' "
How is self-care at home done for enterovirulent E. coli?,"'The majority of enterovirulent ''E. coli'' (EEC) infections are self-limited; they require no treatment except to keep the person well hydrated (oral hydration). This is especially the case for children and the elderly, who may quickly dehydrate during home care. If the person is unable to stay well hydrated at home, medical care should be sought. Most health care professionals warn people not to treat patients at home with any ""left-over"" antibiotics or ''over-the-counter'' ''drugs'' such as ''diphenoxylate and atropine'' (''Lomotil''), because such treatment may make the symptoms worse and cause complications (see complications section).' "
What are the complications associated with enterovirulent E. coli (EEC)?,"'All of the EEC groups may have complications associated with infection. However, some groups have far fewer and potentially less serious complications than other groups. All of the groups, however, have one potentially serious complication; dehydration. If left untreated, dehydration can lead to multiple organ damage and death. Severe dehydration happens infrequently in developed countries, but in developing countries, the death rate can reach 50% in children (ETEC). In general, in developed countries, ETEC, EAEC and EAggEC group infections have few complications develop.''A relatively frequent complication of EHEC, EPEC and EIEC is ''blood in the stool''. Some individuals will have only a small amount of blood but others may have large amounts and may require a ''blood transfusion'' (severe ''hemorrhagic diarrhea'').''However, about 10% of all persons infected with EHEC (usually ''E. coli'' 0157:H7) develop some complication. Occasionally, the complication(s) may lead to disability or death. EHEC strains (and sometimes, EIEC group organisms) may produce the serious problems listed below;' Hemorrhagic (bloody) diarrhea: This complication can prolong the disease by about a week, and cause severe abdominal pain. The individual may also develop dehydration, anemia and may need a blood transfusion. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS): This condition also prolongs the disease as it usually becomes apparent about 7 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Children under 10 years of age are the most likely to get this complication; HUS is the most common cause of kidney failure in children. The toxin produced by EHEC bacteria (mainly E. coli 0157:H7) enters the blood, causing blood cells to be damaged and small clots to form. The toxin can also lodge in the kidneys and eventually destroy kidney tissue; sometimes the damage is severe enough to cause kidney failure. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): This complication is a variation of HUS that usually occurs in the elderly. The same mechanisms as those for HUS are responsible for TTP. However, the elderly develop more clotting problems and use up more platelets resulting in easy or ""spontaneous"" bruising over the body. The elderly experience more fever and neurologic changes, in addition to kidney damage. Until the 1980's, TTP was considered a fatal disease. However, treatment with plasma exchange and infusion techniques has reduced the mortality rate (deaths) of TTP to about 10%."
How are enterovirulent E. coli (EEC) infections prevented?,"'Almost every person who gets infected with EEC has touched and eventually ingested either foods or fluids contaminated with EEC bacteria. Numerous outbreaks occur worldwide each year due to a food or fluid source contamination with these organisms; some of the most serious problems are often related to contaminated meat products by the EHEC group. However, the potential sources of EEC group infections are vast. Fortunately, there are guidelines that can help reduce the chance of getting EEC infections.''The following guidelines on preventing EHEC, especially ''E. coli'' 0157:H7, are recommended by the CDC, but they are applicable to all EEC groups:''One of the major sources of numerous outbreaks is hamburger meat contaminated with ''E. coli'' 0157:H7; such infections have been termed ""hamburger disease"". Many authors recommend that hamburgers ordered in a restaurant should be ""medium or well done,"" with no pink hamburger meat visible in the middle of the burger. Any ""pink"" hamburger meat should be cooked until brown to reduce the chance that viable ''E. coli'' are still present. ''In addition, any food or liquid involved in a recall due to possible ''E. coli'' contamination should be disposed of immediately. On August 8, 2010 about I million pounds of beef in California was recalled due to possible ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 contamination. In 2010, the FDA has recalled several productions of beef, including material put into dry pet foods due to this organism. Other FDA recalls due to EEC in 2010 included spinach and romaine lettuce.''Some researchers suggest that ''babies'' who are ''breastfed'"", especially in third world countries, may reduce the infant's exposure to EEC bacteria.""'There is controversy about the use of antibiotics to prevent EEC, some physicians suggest the use of ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan''); other physicians do not. Data to support such use of the antibiotic is not available. There are no commercially available anti-EEC ''vaccines'' available in the US, although ''vaccine'' research is ongoing.' Wash hands thoroughly after using the bathroom or changing diapers and before preparing or eating food. Wash hands after contact with animals or their environments (at farms, petting zoos, fairs, even your own pets in your own yard). Cook meats thoroughly. Ground beef and meat that has been needle-tenderized should be cooked to a temperature of at least 160 F (70 C). It's best to use a thermometer, as meat color is not a very reliable indicator of ""doneness."" Avoid raw milk, unpasteurized dairy products, and unpasteurized juices (like fresh apple cider). Avoid swallowing water when swimming or playing in lakes, ponds, streams, swimming pools, and backyard ""kiddie"" pools. Prevent cross contamination in food preparation areas by thoroughly washing hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils after they touch raw meat. (This recommendation is especially important for anyone who prepares and serves food to others.)"
What are the prognoses (outcomes) of enterovirulentE. coli infections?,"'Although individuals are frequently uncomfortable with EEC infections, most individuals that live in industrialized countries that get these infections have few if any serious complications. However, people that are immunocompromised and children in developing countries often have complications. Some countries report a death rate in children as high as 50%, with dehydration playing a central role in these deaths due to EEC bacteria. People infected with strains that are highly virulent like ''E. coli'' 0104:H4 are at risk for complications and a less favorable prognosis.''People with EHEC group infections (''E. coli'' 0157:H7 is the major serotype) usually (about 90%) have a self-limited disease and the outcome is excellent. However, the prognosis declines, depending on the development of complication(s). Good hydration decreases the chances of complications and improves the outcome. Individuals who develop ''hemorrhagic diarrhea'' and are treated promptly have better outcomes with reduced hospitalization. Complications such as HUS and TTP have a wide range of prognosis from good to poor, depending on the overall health of the individual and how quickly the complications are diagnosed and treated. For example, some individuals can recover completely, but others may require IV fluids, plasma exchange, plasma infusion, or ''dialysis'' and may have end-organ failure (usually ''kidney failure'') and neurologic problems. A few (about 10%) of TTP patients will die.''Although infrequent, even relatively healthy children and adults have died from EEC infections due to dehydration.' "
What is an enterovirus?,"'Human enteroviruses are a genus in the family ''Picornaviridae'' (small positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses) that were originally classified or named as polioviruses, Coxsackie A viruses, Coxsackie B viruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Rhinoviruses are included as enteroviruses by many researchers but not all. There are well over 100 types of known enteroviruses (genus ''Enterovirus''). The virus that causes ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' belongs to the group of so-called ''non-polio enteroviruses''.''These enteroviruses usually spread from person to person by direct contact with the viruses that shed from the gastrointestinal tract or upper respiratory tract. In general, health care providers categorize these viruses as either polio or non-polioviruses. Polioviruses (only three types, P1-3) and non-polioviruses may have similar initial symptoms. In the majority of infections caused by both polio and non-polioviruses, an infected person may be asymptomatic (not show any symptoms) or only have mild symptoms, including ''fever'', ''headache'', ''sore throat'', ''loss of appetite'', and abdominal discomfort that resolves with no sequelae (complications). However, in some patients, especially children, these infections may cause serious disease that may produce lifelong problems and, infrequently, may cause death.''Recently, non-enterovirus species names were revised to remove host names (human, bovine, simian, and porcine) and replaced with the group designation (A through J) and serotype number. The group is based on the similarity within the RNA region that codes for the outer protein of the virus, and serotype number corresponds to a specific neutralizing serum (antibody). Consequently, human enterovirus 68, for example (also called HEV-68 and ED68) is now termed EV-D68. There will be ''confusion'' and overlap of enterovirus names for the next few years as researchers and clinicians adjust to this extensive name change. In this article, both new and currently accepted names of these viruses and the disease(s) they may cause will be used. For example, Coxsackie viruses could be labeled CV-A4 or CV-B5, depending on their group and/or serotype; similarly, echovirus=E-14 or rhinovirus=RV-A25, RV-B79, or RV-C41.' "
What types of illnesses do enteroviruses cause?,"'As stated previously, enteroviruses cause two main types of human disease, polio, and non-polio disease. In this article, the focus will be on the non-polio disease-causing enteroviruses. Non-polio enteroviruses may cause a wide range of infections that overlap; for example...' enterovirus: aseptic meningitis with rash, conjunctivitis, hand, foot, and mouth disease (EV-71), paralysis (EV-71), myopericarditis group A Coxsackie virus: flaccid paralysis, hand, foot, and mouth disease, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, herpangina, aseptic meningitis (with or without rash) group B Coxsackie virus: spastic paralysis, herpangina, pleurodynia, myocarditis, pericarditis, and meningoencephalitis echovirus: common cold, rash, aseptic meningitis, myopericarditis, paralysis, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis rhinovirus: the common cold (over 100 different serotypes), mild respiratory illness"
What are causes and risk factors for an enterovirus infection?,"'The causes for enterovirus infections are simply the passage of one of the many enteroviruses from one person directly to another, usually by contact with respiratory secretions and/or ''stool'' from infected individuals. Occasionally, enteroviruses may contaminate environmental sources such as water. The most common risk factor for getting an enterovirus infection is direct contact with any bodily secretions (especially respiratory and/or fecal) from an infected individual. Individuals with immature (neonates and infants) or compromised immune systems (for example, children with ''type 1 diabetes'') also are at higher risk for enterovirus infections than normal children or adults. ''Pregnant'' females and individuals with respiratory problems like ''asthma'' are at higher risk. Individuals are at highest risk during the fall and summer months.' "
Are enteroviruses contagious?,"'Yes, enteroviruses are contagious often by direct contact from person to person with respiratory secretions or by contact with fecal material. Some enteroviruses spread indirectly when uninfected people come in contact with food or fluids contaminated by secretions (feces, oral secretions, or droplets) from infected individuals. The viruses are capable of surviving on surfaces like tables and door handles for several days.' "
What is the incubation period for an enterovirus infection?,"'The average incubation period (time from exposure to first symptoms) ranges from about three to 10 days. Symptoms, when present in uncomplicated infections, last about a week.' "
What is the contagious period for an enterovirus infection?,"'In general, individuals are contagious about three days after exposure to the virus and remain contagious until about 10 days after they develop symptoms. Individuals can shed infectious viruses even if they have no symptoms or during the incubation period and/or after symptoms stop.' "
What are symptoms and signs of an enterovirus infection in children and adults?,"'Stated previously, many individuals who become infected with enteroviruses have no or only mild symptoms (fever, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', loss of appetite, and abdominal discomfort, often without ''diarrhea'') of infection that may last about a week and resolve with no further problems. However, those people at higher risk may develop one or more of the following symptoms:''As noted above, some strains of enteroviruses produce different symptoms, some of which are much more severe than others. In addition, some strains occasionally appear to be more transmissible and cause more intense or severe symptoms. Two recent examples are enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and EV-D68.'   Common cold: nasal discharge, cough, mild fever, mild malaise Hypoxia (low oxygen in the blood): shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, rapid breathing, skin coloration change (bluish to cherry red), rapid heart rate Aseptic meningitis: most common among infants and children; may also occur with a rash (on face, neck, and extremities), fever, painful headache, stiff neck, body aches, sensitivity to light, nausea and vomiting, irritability Conjunctivitis (hemorrhagic): eye pain, bleeding seen in the whites of the eyes, photophobia (avoidance of light due to discomfort) Myopericarditis: shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, weakness Herpangina: small flat sores on the oral mucosa (tonsils and soft palate) that may produce blisters and ulcerate Pleurodynia: intermittent chest pain usually over the lower part of the rib cage; some individuals may have a plural friction rub that can be heard when the doctor examines the chest with a stethoscope Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD): small nodules and blisters that are tender and appear gray that occur on the hands, feet, and in the oral cavity Encephalitis: Symptoms range from lethargy and drowsiness to personality changes, seizures, and coma. Paralysis (infrequent in both polio and non-polio intro viral infections): flaccid paralysis that is often asymmetric with proximal extremity muscles affected; lower extremities affected more commonly than upper extremities (poliovirus, enterovirus 71, and coxsackievirus A7); other non-polio enteroviruses usually have less severe symptoms (for example, muscle weakness and oculomotor palsy) if paralysis develops"
"How 
do physicians diagnose an enterovirus infection?","'In general, physicians diagnose enterovirus infections by clinical symptoms. Health care professionals infrequently perform blood tests. The best test is ''polymerase chain reaction'' (PCR) that is available from specialized laboratories and used most often during outbreaks of viral infections. In addition, it is useful to distinguish between enterovirus infections and other viral infections like ''rotavirus'' and ''influenza'' viruses. Infrequently, health care professionals isolate the infecting enterovirus by cell cultures taken from the blood, feces, or cerebrospinal fluid and then identified by further immunologic tests. Other tests such as chest ''X-rays'', ''echocardiography'', ''lumbar puncture'', and ECGs may help determine the extent of infection.' "
What is the treatment for an enterovirus infection?,"'Briefly, the best treatment for an enterovirus infection is prevention. For poliovirus, an effective vaccine is available. Unfortunately, for non-polio enteroviruses, the treatment is supportive and designed to reduce the symptoms because there are no antiviral medications currently approved for the treatment of these types of enterovirus infections. Many doctors recommend using ''over-the-counter'' medications to reduce symptoms.''Doctors may use immunoglobulins in infected neonates and immunocompromised hosts to both treat and prevent non-polio enterovirus central nervous system infections, but these immunoglobulin treatments are not always very effective. Consequently, supportive measures such as fever control, assisted-breathing methods (ranging from inhaled steroids to ''intubation''), ''pain''-control medications, and topical skin and oral mucosal medications to reduce symptoms are given.''Since March 2018, Pleconaril, a 3C ''protease inhibitor'' drug, has been awaiting FDA approval as an intranasal spray to treat rhinoviral infections. In the past, doctors have used the drug for compassionate treatment only in life-threatening enteroviral infections.'  "
What types of doctors treat enterovirus infections?,"'Many individuals are treated with supportive measures only; primary physicians (usually a pediatrician but possibly a specialist in family practice or internal medicine) treat some. In other instances, especially with individuals with complications, infectious-disease specialists, critical care specialists, cardiologists, and/or lung specialists may treat patients. Rarely, a neurology specialist may be consulted.' "
"Non-polio enterovirus outbreaks, including enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and 71","'The recent outbreaks of various non-polio enteroviruses are listed below; (the data is modified from reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).'  Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in the United States. However, in 2011 and 2012, coxsackievirus A6 was a common cause of HFMD in this country; some of the infected people became severely ill. Coxsackievirus A24 and enterovirus 70 have been associated with outbreaks of conjunctivitis. Echoviruses 13, 18, and 30 have caused outbreaks of viral meningitis in the United States. Enterovirus 71 has caused large outbreaks of HFMD worldwide, especially in children in Asia, especially China. Some infections from this virus have been associated with severe neurologic disease, such as brainstem encephalitis. Enterovirus D 68 had a nationwide outbreak in the U.S. from August 2014 to January 2015. A total of 1,153 people in 49 states and the District of Columbia had confirmed D68 infection. Almost all the individuals infected were children who also had a history of asthma or wheezing. Health officials detected D68 enteroviruses in 14 patients who died. However, the CDC indicated that there were likely millions of enterovirus D68-infected individuals (infants, toddlers, and children) with mild illness who did not seek medical treatment or get tested for the infection in the United States. Thailand, in 2017, reported an outbreak of enterovirus A71 with 163 infected patients."
What are complications of an enterovirus infection?,"'The majority of enterovirus infections last about a week to 10 days and have no complications. However, complications can occur in some patients and range from mild (rash, mild conjunctivitis, skin lesions) to more severe (shortness of breath, encephalitis, myopericarditis, chest pains, weakness with paralysis, coma and rarely, death).' "
What is the prognosis of an enterovirus infection?,"""The prognosis of most enterovirus infections is good; most individuals will spontaneously resolve their infection in about seven to 10 days and have no complications. Some patients, especially those who are immunocompromised in any way, may develop more severe infections. The more severe infections can have a prognosis that can range from good to poor, depending upon the severity of the viral strain causing the infection and the strength (or weakness) of the individual's immune response. Consultation with an appropriate specialist (cardiologist, pulmonologist or others, depending on the particular complications) is recommended."" "
Is it possible to prevent an enterovirus infection? Is there a vaccine for enteroviruses?,"'Individuals can reduce the chance of getting an enterovirus infection simply by avoiding direct contact with people who are infected with enteroviruses and by using such techniques as good hand washing and cleaning or disinfecting items that come in contact with infected individuals. Health care professionals routinely vaccinate people against certain enteroviruses (polioviruses); as a result, polio is rarely seen in developing countries. Unfortunately, no ''vaccines'' are available for non-polio enteroviruses, although Chinese investigators have indicated they have two ''vaccines'' against enterovirus 71 in successful phase 3 trials. Part of the reason there are no vaccines for these viruses is that there is a very large number of subtypes of non-polio enteroviruses and a vaccine developed against one subtype is usually not effective against another subtype.'

What is eosinophilic esophagitis?, 
What causes eosinophilic esophagitis?,"'The esophagus is a muscular tube that propels swallowed food from the mouth into the stomach. Esophagitis refers to inflammation of the esophagus that has several causes.''Doctors believe that eosinophilic esophagitis is a type of esophagitis that is caused by an allergen for two reasons.''Nevertheless, the exact substance that causes the ''allergic reaction'' in eosinophilic esophagitis is not known. The hallmark of eosinophilic esophagitis is the presence of large numbers of eosinophils in the tissue just beneath the inner lining of the esophagus.''Eosinophils are white blood cells (leukocytes) manufactured in the bone marrow and are one of the many types of cells that actively promote inflammation. They are particularly active in the type of inflammation caused by allergic reactions. Thus, large number of eosinophils can accumulate in tissues such as the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, and sometimes in the blood when individuals are exposed to an allergen. As previously mentioned, the allergen(s) that causes eosinophilic esophagitis is not known. It is not even known whether the allergen is inhaled or ingested.''Eosinophilic esophagitis affects both children and adults. For unknown reasons, men are more commonly affected than women, and it is most commonly found among young boys and men.''This article primarily deals with the diagnosis and management of ''swallowing problems'' (dysphagia), the most common complication in adults with eosinophilic esophagitis.' The most common cause of esophagitis is acid reflux, which most frequently results in heartburn. Acid reflux can also cause ulcers in the inner lining of the esophagus. Other less common causes of esophagitis include viruses (such as herpes simplex), fungi (such as Candida), medications that become stuck in the esophagus (such as the antibiotic, tetracycline), and radiation therapy (such as during treatment of lung cancer). First, eosinophils are prominent in other diseases associated with allergies such as asthma, hay fever, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Second, people with eosinophilic esophagitis are more likely to suffer from these other allergic diseases."
What are the symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis?,"'The major symptom in adults with eosinophilic esophagitis is difficulty in swallowing solid food (dysphagia). Specifically, the food becomes stuck in the esophagus after it is swallowed.''Less common symptoms include heartburn and ''chest pain''.''In children, the most common symptoms are'   abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, coughing, and failure to thrive."
How does eosinophilic esophagitis cause dysphagia?,"'Eosinophilic esophagitis decreases the ability of the esophagus to stretch and accommodate mouthfuls of swallowed food probably as a result of the presence of so many eosinophils but also, perhaps as a result of some scaring that occurs in the wall of the esophagus. As a result, solid foods (particularly solid meats) have difficulty passing through the esophagus. When solid food sticks in the esophagus, it causes an uncomfortable sensation in the chest. The sticking of food in the esophagus is referred to as dysphagia. If the solid food then passes into the stomach, the discomfort subsides, and the individual can resume eating. If the solid food does not pass into the stomach, individuals often must regurgitate the food by inducing ''vomiting'' before they can resume eating. Rarely, the solid food becomes impacted, that is, it can neither pass into the stomach nor be regurgitated. The impacted solid food causes ''chest pain'' that can mimic a ''heart attack'', and also causes repeated spitting up of saliva that cannot be swallowed because of the obstruction in the esophagus. Individuals with impacted food are unable to eat or drink. To relieve the obstruction, a doctor usually will have to insert a flexible endoscope through the mouth and into the esophagus to remove the impacted food.''How eosinophilic esophagitis causes symptoms of ''abdominal pain'', vomiting, and failure to thrive in children is not clear.' "
What are the other causes of dysphagia for solid food?,"'The most common causes of dysphagia for solid food are esophageal strictures and Schatzki (lower esophageal) rings. Esophageal strictures are narrowings of the esophagus that result from inflammation and scarring, most commonly from chronic acid reflux. Strictures usually are located in the lower esophagus near the entrance of the esophagus into the stomach where the acid reflux is most severe. Schatzki rings are thin webs of tissue of unclear cause that can narrow the lumen (center) of the esophagus through which food passes. They also are located in the lower esophagus. ''A less common cause of dysphagia for solid food is ''esophageal cancer''  that narrows the esophageal lumen. A still less common cause of dysphagia is disorders of the muscles of the esophagus. For example, ''achalasia'', a disease of the nerves and the muscles of the esophagus that prevents the muscle at the lower end of the esophagus (the lower esophageal sphincter) from relaxing and allowing swallowed food to pass into the stomach. Unlike the other causes of motility disorders, achalasia usually results in problems with swallowing both solid and liquid food.' "
How is eosinophilic esophagitis diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis is suspected whenever dysphagia for solid food occurs, even though it is not one of the most common causes of dysphagia. Dysphagia almost always is evaluated by endoscopy (''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'' or EGD) in order to determine its cause. During the EGD, a flexible viewing tube or endoscope is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus. This allows the doctor to see the inner lining of the esophagus (as well as the stomach and duodenum). ''Cancers'', esophageal strictures, Schatzki rings, and usually achalasia, all can be diagnosed visually at the time of EGD.''The doctor performing the EGD also may see abnormalities that suggest eosinophilic esophagitis. For example, some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis have narrowing of most of the esophagus. Others have a series of rings along the entire length of the esophagus. Still others have furrows ''running'' up and down the esophagus and a few have small white spots on the esophageal lining which represent pus made up of dying mounds of eosinophils. The diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis is established with a biopsy of the inner lining of the esophagus. The biopsy is performed by inserting a long thin biopsy forceps through a channel in the endoscope that pinches off a small sample of tissue from the inner lining of the esophagus. A pathologist then can examine the biopsied tissue under the microscope to look for eosinophils.''In many patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, however, the esophagus looks normal or will show only minor abnormalities. Unless biopsies are taken of a normal-appearing esophagus, the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis can be missed. In fact, not taking biopsies has resulted in some patients having dysphagia for years before the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis is made, and doctors are now more likely to perform biopsies of the esophagus in individuals with dysphagia, even those with a normal-appearing esophagus, who have no clear cause for their dysphagia.''The incidence of eosinophilic esophagitis is on the rise in the U. S. This rise in incidence may reflect either increased awareness of the disease among the doctors treating patients with dysphagia or an actual increase in the prevalence of this disease.'  "
How is eosinophilic esophagitis treated?,"'The treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis is with ''gentle'' esophageal dilatation, and medications. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms of dysphagia.''For decades, gastroenterologists have been treating patients with dysphagia from eosinophilic esophagitis in the same manner as patients with dysphagia due to esophageal strictures and Schatzki rings. Esophageal dilatation involves physically stretching the strictures or fracturing of the strictures or fracturing the rings, thus allowing freer passage of solid food. Stretching or fracturing of the strictures or rings can be performed with endoscopes, long and flexible dilators of different diameters inserted through the mouth, or with balloons inserted into the esophagus through a channel in the endoscope. The balloons are positioned at the level of the stricture or ring and then inflated to break the stricture or ring.''While esophageal dilatation has been an effective and usually safe treatment, doctors have observed that some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis develop tears in the esophageal lining that can lead to severe chest ''pain'' after dilation. Rare cases of esophageal perforations (tears through the entire esophageal wall) also have been reported. Esophageal perforations are a serious complication that can lead to infections in the chest. Thus, although doctors may still use dilatation to treat dysphagia from eosinophilic esophagitis, they now are more likely to use smaller dilators and less force than they would when treating esophageal strictures and rings. Moreover, doctors also are more commonly using medications to treat dysphagia from eosinophilic esophagitis and using dilation only when medications fail.''The medications primarily used in treating eosinophilic esophagitis are fluticasone propionate (Flovent), budesonide suspension, and proton pump inhibitors (''Protonix'', ''Nexium'', ''Aciphex'', ''Prevacid'', ''Prilosec'', Dexilant, and Zegarid).''Although oral steroids are effective in treating eosinophilic esophagitis, the side effects of orally-administered steroids limit their use. One new oral steroid that is being tested is budesonide, an orally-administered steroid that is absorbed into the body but is rapidly destroyed, resulting in fewer serious side effects. The current treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis is with swallowed (not inhaled) fluticasone propionate. Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic (man-made) steroid that is related to the naturally occurring steroid hormone, cortisol or hydrocortisone, produced by the adrenal glands. These steroids have potent anti-inflammatory actions. When used as an inhaler, fluticasone propionate reduces inflammation in the airways of patients with ''asthma'', thus relieving ''wheezing'' and ''breathing'' difficulties. When fluticasone propionate is swallowed, it has been shown to reduce the eosinophils in the esophagus and relieve dysphagia in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.''In treating eosinophilic esophagitis, fluticasone propionate is administered with the same inhaler as for ''asthma'' but without the usual spacer in the inhaler. The removal of the spacer causes the fluticasone propionate to deposit in the mouth rather than enter the ''lungs''. The fluticasone propionate that deposits in the mouth is then swallowed with a small amount of water, usually twice daily for several weeks. Patients are instructed not to eat or drink for two hours after each treatment. Improvement in dysphagia usually is prompt, within days or weeks. Most patients develop recurrent symptoms after stopping treatment require treatment and/or continuous retreatment.''When used in low doses, little of the fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the body and therefore side effects are minimal. One possible side effect is ''thrush'' (infection of the mouth and throat by a fungus, ''candida''), which is relatively easy to treat. When higher doses are used for a prolonged period, enough fluticasone propionate may be absorbed to cause side effects throughout the body. Side effects of high doses of fluticasone propionate are similar to the side effects of oral steroids such as ''prednisone'' and cortisone.''Proton pump inhibitors, ''pantoprazole'' (Protonix), ''esomeprazole'' (Nexium), ''rabeprazole'' (Aciphex), ''lansoprazole'' (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), and ''omeprazole'' (for example, Prilosec, Zegarid) reduce production of acid by the stomach. They are very safe and effective treatment for the ''symptoms of acid reflux'' and esophagitis. Since acid reflux may aggravate esophagitis in some patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, doctors frequently use proton pump inhibitors for treating eosinophilic esophagitis. Proton pump inhibitors do not treat the underlying eosinophilic esophagitis; however, and treatment with fluticasone or another steroid usually is required as well.'  "
What about elimination diets for treating eosinophilic esophagitis?,"'The leading theory about the cause of eosinophilic esophagitis is that it represents ''allergy'' to some protein found in food. Evidence has accumulated in children that diets that eliminate the ''allergy''-inducing food can result in reversal of the esophagitis and disappearance of the eosinophils. Similar evidence now is accumulating in adult patients. Doctors have used elimination diets to define what the allergy-inciting foods might be.''There are several ways in which elimination diets can be attempted.''None of these elimination diets are easy for physicians to perform or for patients to follow, especially children, and each has its pros and cons. Nevertheless, if one or two foods can be found that are responsible for the allergy, a near-normal diet can be resumed, and the need for medications can be eliminated.'   The first is to do skin and blood tests looking for specific foods that might be causing the allergy and then eliminating these foods from the diet. The second is to eliminate the major groups of food to which allergy is common, specifically milk protein, soy, peanut/tree nuts, eggs, wheat, and seafood. This is called the SFED (Six Food Elimination Diet). Finally, individuals may be placed on an elemental liquid diet (a diet of digested food that no longer contains proteins that can provoke allergy), and then different foods can be added to the diet until the allergy-inducing food is found."
What is the future of eosinophilic esophagitis?,"' Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults is a newly-recognized disease. Therefore, understanding of the cause(s), natural history, diagnosis and management is limited and will evolve over the coming years. Currently, the recommended treatments (for example, with oral fluticasone propionate) are based on a limited number of small studies. More studies involving larger numbers of patients followed for longer periods of time are necessary to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of treatment.''''Montelukast''   (''Singulair'') is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist that is used for treating asthma and seasonal allergic ''rhinitis'' (hay ''fever''). Leukotrienes are a group of naturally occurring chemicals in the body that promote inflammation in asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and other diseases involving allergy. They are formed by cells, released, and then bound to other cells that participate in inflammation. It is the binding to these other cells that stimulates the cells and promotes inflammation. Montelukast blocks the binding of some of these leukotrienes and has been used with success in treating a small number of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. It improves symptoms but does not reduce the numbers of eosinophils. More studies are needed.''''Cromolyn'' is a synthetic compound that is used to prevent allergic reactions. Many of the symptoms and signs of allergic reactions are caused by chemicals, for example, histamine, that are released from mast cells, a type of cell that is found throughout the body as well as in the lungs, nose, and eyelids. Cromolyn works by preventing the release of these chemicals from the mast cells. Cromolyn is inhaled to prevent episodes of asthma due to allergy. It also is used as a nasal inhaler to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis (due to inflammation of the lining of the nose) and as an ophthalmic (eye) solution to treat ''allergic conjunctivitis'' (due to inflammation of the lining of the eyelids). More studies are needed to determine whether cromolyn is effective in treating eosinophilic esophagitis.' "
What are eosinophils?,"'Eosinophils are a particular type of white blood cells, usually representing a small percentage (less than 8% of the total white blood cell population) that are easily stained by eosin and other dyes; they have a characteristic double-lobed nucleus. The number of these cells (eosinophil count) increases in certain illnesses, including ''allergies'', ''asthma'"", Addison's disease, ""'sarcoidosis'', parasite infections, drug reactions, and connective tissue diseases (such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''scleroderma'""). Eosinophilic fasciitis is sometimes referred to as Shulman's syndrome."" "
What is fascia?,"'The fascia is a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue under the skin that covers a surface of underlying tissues. Fascia surrounds each of the muscles that move the skeleton. When the fascia is inflamed, the condition is referred to as ""fasciitis.""' "
What is eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare disease that leads to inflammation and thickening of the skin and fascia underneath. In patients with eosinophilic fasciitis, the involved fascia is inflamed with the eosinophil type of white blood cells. This leads to symptoms of progressive thickening and often redness, warmth, and hardness of the skin surface.''Occasionally, the onset of eosinophilic fasciitis follows a period of exertional physical activity. Eosinophilic fasciitis is sometimes confused with eosinophilia-''myalgia'' syndrome and ''scleroderma''. Eosinophilic fasciitis sometimes occurs associated with ''cancers'' such as ''leukemia'' and ''lymphoma''.' "
What causes eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Although the cause seems related to an inflammatory response, the agent(s) that trigger the response are not yet identified.

"
What are eosinophilic fasciitis symptoms and signs?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis causes inflammation of the tissues beneath the skin as well as sometimes in the skin. This leads to symptoms of swelling, ''stiffness'', warmth, and ''pain'' of the involved area. Occasionally, there is discoloration of the skin over the tissues affected and the skin can appear thicker than normal. Joint contractures occur in 50%-75% of patients.''The muscle of the involved area can become weakened. Muscle enzyme blood levels can be found to be elevated in the blood, particularly the enzymes aldolase and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).'  "
How do health-care professionals diagnose eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'The diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis is made with a ''skin biopsy'' of a full thickness of involved deep skin tissue. The biopsy site is usually small, and the doctor numbs the area before the tissue is removed for study by a pathologist, dermatologist, or trained technician. In addition, the thickened fascia can be detected by ''MRI''.' "
What is the treatment for eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Treatment of eosinophilic fasciitis is directed at eliminating the tissue inflammation and includes ''aspirin'', other anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), and cortisone. Many patients will improve spontaneously. Others can be afflicted with persistent tissue and ''joint pain'', in addition to thickening of the involved tissues.''For aggressive eosinophilic fasciitis, cortisone medications (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'') are sometimes initially administered intravenously. Also considered are immune-suppression medications (such as ''methotrexate'' [''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''], ''cyclophosphamide'' [''Cytoxan''], and ''penicillamine'' [''Depen'', ''Cuprimine'']). More recently, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') and ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') are being studied as potential therapies.''Medical research has shown that immune-suppression drugs, such as methotrexate, can reduce both the immune inflammation and the need for continued cortisone medications.' "
What specialists treat eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis is treated by pediatricians, internists, dermatologists, and ''rheumatologists''; occasionally, surgeons are consulted for deep biopsies and joint contractures.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'The outlook for eosinophilic fasciitis is generally good, particularly if treated aggressively and early. Along with medications, physical therapy can be required for optimal rehabilitation. Poor function, however, is not uncommon, especially in children. Those with ''arthritis'', atrophy of muscle, scarring limiting joint range of motion (contracture), and shortening of limb length tend to do worse.' "

What are eosinophilic fasciitis symptoms and signs?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis causes inflammation of the tissues beneath the skin as well as sometimes in the skin. This leads to symptoms of swelling, ''stiffness'', warmth, and ''pain'' of the involved area. Occasionally, there is discoloration of the skin over the tissues affected and the skin can appear thicker than normal. Joint contractures occur in 50%-75% of patients.''The muscle of the involved area can become weakened. Muscle enzyme blood levels can be found to be elevated in the blood, particularly the enzymes aldolase and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).'  "
How do health-care professionals diagnose eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'The diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis is made with a ''skin biopsy'' of a full thickness of involved deep skin tissue. The biopsy site is usually small, and the doctor numbs the area before the tissue is removed for study by a pathologist, dermatologist, or trained technician. In addition, the thickened fascia can be detected by ''MRI''.' "
What is the treatment for eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Treatment of eosinophilic fasciitis is directed at eliminating the tissue inflammation and includes ''aspirin'', other anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), and cortisone. Many patients will improve spontaneously. Others can be afflicted with persistent tissue and ''joint pain'', in addition to thickening of the involved tissues.''For aggressive eosinophilic fasciitis, cortisone medications (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'') are sometimes initially administered intravenously. Also considered are immune-suppression medications (such as ''methotrexate'' [''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''], ''cyclophosphamide'' [''Cytoxan''], and ''penicillamine'' [''Depen'', ''Cuprimine'']). More recently, ''mycophenolate mofetil'' (''Cellcept'') and ''rituximab'' (''Rituxan'') are being studied as potential therapies.''Medical research has shown that immune-suppression drugs, such as methotrexate, can reduce both the immune inflammation and the need for continued cortisone medications.' "
What specialists treat eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Eosinophilic fasciitis is treated by pediatricians, internists, dermatologists, and ''rheumatologists''; occasionally, surgeons are consulted for deep biopsies and joint contractures.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'The outlook for eosinophilic fasciitis is generally good, particularly if treated aggressively and early. Along with medications, physical therapy can be required for optimal rehabilitation. Poor function, however, is not uncommon, especially in children. Those with ''arthritis'', atrophy of muscle, scarring limiting joint range of motion (contracture), and shortening of limb length tend to do worse.' "
Is it possible to prevent eosinophilic fasciitis?,"'Because we do not yet know the cause of eosinophilic fasciitis, it cannot be prevented.' "
What is epidermolysis bullosa?,"'Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of ''inherited'' conditions that affect the supporting tissue of the skin and mucosa. Epidermolysis bullosa is often appears at birth or during infancy and characterized by severe skin fragility, erosions, and ''blisters''. Epidermolysis bullosa is due to one or multiple defective genes that normally synthesize structural proteins that are involved in the adherence of the ''epidermis'' (the superficial layer of skin) to the dermis (the deeper layer of the skin). Another term for this group of conditions is ""mechanobullous disease,"" which distinguishes it from conditions that may appear superficially similar but are produced by autoimmune destruction of some of the same proteins that are defective in epidermolysis bullosa.''Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (another condition) is an inappropriately named example of an autoimmune problem that really does not belong in discussion of the mechanobullous diseases.' "
What are the types of epidermolysis bullosa (EB)?,"'There are four distinctive clinical forms of this condition, and each is associated with different defective proteins:' Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EB simplex)EBS localized (Weber-Cockayne), generalized other EBS, Dowling Meara EBS, EBS with muscular dystrophy, EBS with mottled pigmentation, EBS Ogna, EBS with pyloic atreseia, EBS circinate migratory, lethal acantolythic EB, EBS superficialis (EBSS), and plakophilin deficiency EBS localized (Weber-Cockayne), generalized other EBS, Dowling Meara EBS, EBS with muscular dystrophy, EBS with mottled pigmentation, EBS Ogna, EBS with pyloic atreseia, EBS circinate migratory, lethal acantolythic EB, EBS superficialis (EBSS), and plakophilin deficiency Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (junctional EB),Herlitz JEB and JEB-other (including JEB with pyloric atresia, non-Herlitz JEB, and many other subtypes) Herlitz JEB and JEB-other (including JEB with pyloric atresia, non-Herlitz JEB, and many other subtypes) Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (dystrophic EB)Recessive DEB (RDEB)Hallopeau-SiemensDominant DEB (DDEB) Recessive DEB (RDEB)Hallopeau-Siemens Hallopeau-Siemens Dominant DEB (DDEB) Kindler syndrome."
What are causes and risk factors for epidermolysis bullosa?,"'Since mechanobullous diseases are hereditary, the presence of a family history of this condition is the major risk factor. Mechanobullous diseases are rare. Their prevalence in the U.S. population is estimated to be about eight cases per million. Mechano-bullous diseases have been attributed to at least 1,000 different mutations in 20 separate genes that code for various structural proteins near the junction of the ''epidermis'' and the dermis (the top layers of skin). Some of the proteins involved are keratin, laminin, type VII collagen, type VII collagen, integrins, lectin, desmoplakin, plakophilin, and plakoglobin.' "
Is epidermolysis bullosa contagious?,'Epidermolysis bullosa is not ''contagious''.' 
What are epidermolysis bullosa symptoms and signs?,"'The commonality in presentation of all the mechanobullous diseases is''Health care professionals most frequently note these findings in areas of friction where shear forces are greatest. Elbows, knees, hands, and ''feet'' are generally involved, although EB affects any anatomical area. EB may affect the lining tissues of within the mouth. Although often evident at birth, the condition may occasionally appear in young adults depending on the gene involved. There can be a spectrum of severity so that some affected individuals may have localized disease and reach adulthood with few problems, while others with a more severe form are likely to die during infancy. There are associated conditions in some patients, including muscular dystrophy, pyloric atresia, and reno-urinary defects. In dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, there is a predisposition to scarring, milia formation, and occasionally squamous cell ''ca''rcinoma.' fragile skin, erosions of skin, and blister formation."
"What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose 
and assess epidermolysis bullosa?","'In an infant in whom this diagnosis is considered, it is vital to exclude other treatable diseases first. In addition, it is often impossible to come to an accurate diagnosis based on the clinical appearance of the patient. It is often necessary to involve a dermatologist with special expertise in ''pediatrics'' to evaluate the affected infant. Special tests on the ''skin biopsy'' specimens are required to determine which component of the skin is defective. Immunofluorescence mapping and electron microscopic evaluation may be necessary to pinpoint the precise structural defects. Newly available genetic tools can detect the presence of defective genes in the patient and family members. In families with a history of mechanobullous disease, ''prenatal'' testing is available. Such tests are likely to be available only at university medical centers.' "
What is the treatment for epidermolysis bullosa?,"'Since the problem in all mechanobullous diseases is an absent or defective structural protein, there is no cure. At this time, there is also no specific treatment other than supportive care. The care would be similar to that given in a ''burn'' center environment except that the condition never resolves. ''Pain'', metabolic abnormalities, and infection are major problems in these patients. Preventing erosions is a constant challenge. Occasionally, ''skin cancer'' can develop at the site of erosions.''Attempts to produce the normal proteins by bone marrow transplantation, local fibroblast transplantation, or the addition of ''stem cells'' to affected patients have met with limited success. Such interventions are available only through participation in investigational studies.' "
Are there home remedies for epidermolysis bullosa?,"'In mild localized cases, it is possible to care for the erosions as one would care for any superficial ''wound''. Additionally, it is important to consider techniques for minimizing friction in areas predisposed to ''blisters'' and erosions.' "
What is the prognosis of epidermolysis bullosa?,'The prognosis of epidermolysis bullosa is almost entirely dependent on the specific structural of the genetically altered protein. That is why it is of the utmost importance to make an accurate diagnosis. Mild localized forms of epidermolysis bullosa simplex exist. Most of these patients can expect to live into adulthood.'  
Is it possible to prevent epidermolysis bullosa?,'The only conceivable way to prevent this or any other ''genetic disease'' is by identifying genetic carriers and insuring that any offspring they produce are free from the mutations. Families with a history of mechanobullous disease should seek ''genetic counseling'' to insure that they understand the risks involved in procreation.' 
What is an epidural steroid injection?,"'An epidural steroid injection is a common procedure to treat ''spinal nerve'' irritation that is most often caused by tissues next to the nerve pressing against it. The beginning of the nerve (nerve root) may be irritated by a bulging intervertebral disc, disc contents (""''ruptured disc''"") or bone spur, directly touching the spinal nerve.''An epidural steroid injection involves bathing an inflamed nerve root in steroids (potent anti-inflammation medicine) in order to decrease the irritation of the nerve root that is causing ''pain''.' "
What specialties of doctors administer epidural steroid injections?,'Specialists who administer epidural steroid injections include anesthesiologists and ''pain''-management specialists.' 
How is an epidural steroid injection performed?,"'The epidural steroid injection procedure is quick and simple. While it is common for people to be concerned prior to the procedure, it is actually frequent to hear from patients afterwards: ""Is that all?""''The spinal cord rests in the spinal canal. The nerve roots branch out from the spinal cord at each level of a spinal vertebra (the bony building blocks of the spine). The cord is protected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which serves as a ''shock'' absorber for the cord. The CSF is held in place by a membrane with several layers, one of which is called the dura, from the Greek for tough (think of ""durable""). The Greek word ""epi"" means ""outside of."" So, the epidural space is outside of this tough membrane. During an epidural steroid injection, a needle and syringe are used to enter the epidural space and deposit small amounts of long-lasting steroids around the inflamed spinal nerve. A fluoroscope (a viewing instrument using ''X-rays'') is used to visualize the local anatomy during the injection. The epidural steroid injection specifically targets the locally inflamed area and treats it with a maximal amount of steroids, thereby minimizing exposure of the rest of the body to the steroids.' "
When are epidural steroid injections used?,"'Epidural steroid injections are most commonly used in situations of radicular pain, which is a radiating pain that is transmitted away from the spine by an irritated spinal nerve. Irritation of a spinal nerve in the low back (''lumbar radiculopathy''), such as from ''lumbar spinal stenosis'', cervical spinal stenosis, ''herniated disc'', and foraminal encroachment, causes ''back pain'' that goes down the leg. Epidural injection is also used as a minimally invasive procedure to treat ''nerve compression'' in the neck (cervical spine), referred to as cervical ''radiculopathy'', which causes pain.'  "
What complications or side effects may be associated with epidural steroid injections?,"'Complications of epidural steroid injections include elevation of blood ''sugar'' (glucose), ''insomnia'', bleeding into the spinal canal, and rarely, bacterial or fungal infection in the spinal canal.' "
What is the recovery time for an epidural steroid injection?,"'Recovery from an epidural steroid injection is typically within hours of the injection. If anesthetic is administered with the steroid, there can be hours of residual numbness of the nerves that were anesthetized.' "
Introduction,"'Few experiences match the drama of a convulsive seizure. A person having a severe seizure may cry out, fall to the floor unconscious, twitch or move uncontrollably, drool, or even lose bladder control. Within minutes, the attack is over, and the person regains consciousness but is exhausted and dazed. This is the image most people have when they hear the word epilepsy. However, this type of seizure - a generalized tonic-clonic seizure -- is only one kind of epilepsy. There are many other kinds, each with a different set of symptoms.''Epilepsy was one of the first brain disorders to be described. It was mentioned in ancient Babylon more than 3,000 years ago. The strange behavior caused by some seizures has contributed through the ages to many superstitions and prejudices. The word epilepsy is derived from the Greek word for ""attack."" People once thought that those with epilepsy were being visited by demons or gods. However, in 400 B.C., the early physician Hippocrates suggested that epilepsy was a disorder of the brain, and we now know that he was right.' "
What Is Epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. Neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons, glands, and muscles to produce human thoughts, feelings, and actions. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior, or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. During a seizure, neurons may fire as many as 500 times a second, much faster than normal. In some people, this happens only occasionally; for others, it may happen up to hundreds of times a day.''More than 2 million people in the United States have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. For about 80 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. However, about 25 to 30 percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. Doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. Having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy.''Epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. Some people with mental retardation may experience seizures, but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. Many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. Famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the Russian writer Dostoyevsky, the philosopher Socrates, the military general Napoleon, and the inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, who established the Nobel Prize. Several Olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. Seizures sometimes do cause brain damage, particularly if they are severe. However, most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. Any changes that do occur are usually subtle, and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures.''While epilepsy cannot currently be cured, for some people it does eventually go away. One study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy, or epilepsy with an unknown cause, had a 68 to 92 percent chance of becoming seizure-free by 20 years after their diagnosis. The odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes, but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. This is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had ''epilepsy surgery''.'  "
What Causes Epilepsy?,"'Epilepsy is a disorder with many possible causes. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity -- from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development -- can lead to seizures.''Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, or some combination of these factors. Researchers believe that some people with epilepsy have an abnormally high level of excitatory neurotransmitters that increase neuronal activity, while others have an abnormally low level of inhibitory neurotransmitters that decrease neuronal activity in the brain. Either situation can result in too much neuronal activity and cause epilepsy. One of the most-studied neurotransmitters that plays a role in epilepsy is GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Research on GABA has led to ''drugs'' that alter the amount of this neurotransmitter in the brain or change how the brain responds to it. Researchers also are studying excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate.'""In some cases, the brain's attempts to repair itself after a head injury, ""'stroke'', or other problem may inadvertently generate abnormal nerve connections that lead to epilepsy. Abnormalities in brain wiring that occur during brain development also may disturb neuronal activity and lead to epilepsy.''Research has shown that the cell membrane that surrounds each neuron plays an important role in epilepsy. Cell membranes are crucial for a neuron to generate electrical impulses. For this reason, researchers are studying details of the membrane structure, how molecules move in and out of membranes, and how the cell nourishes and repairs the membrane. A disruption in any of these processes may lead to epilepsy. Studies in animals have shown that, because the brain continually adapts to changes in stimuli, a small change in neuronal activity, if repeated, may eventually lead to full-blown epilepsy. Researchers are investigating whether this phenomenon, called kindling, may also occur in humans.''In some cases, epilepsy may result from changes in non-neuronal brain cells called glia. These cells regulate concentrations of chemicals in the brain that can affect neuronal signaling.''About half of all seizures have no known cause. However, in other cases, the seizures are clearly linked to infection, ''trauma'', or other identifiable problems.'""Research suggests that genetic abnormalities may be some of the most important factors contributing to epilepsy. Some types of epilepsy have been traced to an abnormality in a specific gene. Many other types of epilepsy tend to run in families, which suggests that genes influence epilepsy. Some researchers estimate that more than 500 genes could play a role in this disorder. However, it is increasingly clear that, for many forms of epilepsy, genetic abnormalities play only a partial role, perhaps by increasing a person's susceptibility to seizures that are triggered by an environmental factor.""'Several types of epilepsy have now been linked to defective genes for ion channels, the ""gates"" that control the flow of ions in and out of cells and regulate neuron signaling. Another gene, which is missing in people with progressive myoclonus epilepsy, codes for a protein called cystatin B. This protein regulates enzymes that break down other proteins. Another gene, which is altered in a severe form of epilepsy called LaFora\'s disease, has been linked to a gene that helps to break down carbohydrates.'""While abnormal genes sometimes cause epilepsy, they also may influence the disorder in subtler ways. For example, one study showed that many people with epilepsy have an abnormally active version of a gene that increases resistance to drugs. This may help explain why anticonvulsant drugs do not work for some people. Genes also may control other aspects of the body's response to medications and each person's susceptibility to seizures, or seizure threshold. Abnormalities in the genes that control neuronal migration, a critical step in brain development, can lead to areas of misplaced or abnormally formed neurons, or dysplasia, in the brain that can cause epilepsy. In some cases, genes may contribute to development of epilepsy even in people with no family history of the disorder. These people may have a newly developed abnormality, or mutation, in an epilepsy-related gene.""'In many cases, epilepsy develops as a result of brain damage from other disorders. For example, ''brain tumors'', alcoholism, and '""Alzheimer's""' disease frequently lead to epilepsy because they alter the normal workings of the brain. Strokes, ''heart attacks'', and other conditions that deprive the brain of oxygen also can cause epilepsy in some cases. About 32 percent of all cases of newly developed epilepsy in elderly people appears to be due to cerebrovascular disease, which reduces the supply of oxygen to brain cells. Meningitis, ''AIDS'', viral ''encephalitis'', and other infectious diseases can lead to epilepsy, as can ''hydrocephalus'' -- a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the brain. Epilepsy also can result from intolerance to wheat ''gluten'' (also known as ''celiac disease''), or from a parasitic infection of the brain called neurocysticercosis. Seizures may stop once these disorders are treated successfully. However, the odds of becoming seizure-free after the primary disorder is treated are uncertain and vary depending on the type of disorder, the brain region that is affected, and how much brain damage occurred prior to treatment.''Epilepsy is associated with a variety of developmental and metabolic disorders, including ''cerebral palsy'', ''neurofibromatosis'', pyruvate dependency, tuberous sclerosis, ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'', and ''autism''. Epilepsy is just one of a set of symptoms commonly found in people with these disorders.''In some cases, head injury can lead to seizures or epilepsy. Safety measures such as wearing seat belts in cars and using helmets when riding a motorcycle or playing competitive sports can protect people from epilepsy and other problems that result from head injury.''Prenatal Injury and Developmental Problems''The developing brain is susceptible to many kinds of injury. Maternal infections, poor ''nutrition'', and oxygen deficiencies are just some of the conditions that may take a toll on the brain of a developing baby. These conditions may lead to ''cerebral palsy'', which often is associated with epilepsy, or they may cause epilepsy that is unrelated to any other disorders. About 20 percent of ''seizures in children'' are due to cerebral palsy or other neurological abnormalities. Abnormalities in genes that control development also may contribute to epilepsy. Advanced brain imaging has revealed that some cases of epilepsy that occur with no obvious cause may be associated with areas of dysplasia in the brain that probably develop before birth.''Seizures can result from exposure to lead, carbon monoxide, and many other poisons. They also can result from exposure to street drugs and from overdoses of ''antidepressants'' and other medications.''Seizures are often triggered by factors such as lack of ''sleep'', alcohol consumption, ''stress'', or hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle. These seizure triggers do not cause epilepsy but can provoke first seizures or cause breakthrough seizures in people who otherwise experience good seizure control with their medication. Sleep deprivation in particular is a universal and powerful trigger of seizures. For this reason, people with epilepsy should make sure to get enough sleep and should try to stay on a regular sleep schedule as much as possible. For some people, light flashing at a certain speed or the flicker of a computer monitor can trigger a seizure; this problem is called photosensitive epilepsy. ''Smoking'' cigarettes also can trigger seizures. The ''nicotine'' in cigarettes acts on receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, which increases neuronal firing. Seizures are not triggered by sexual activity except in very rare instances.' "
What Are the Different Kinds of Seizures?,"'Doctors have described more than 30 different types of seizures. Seizures are divided into two major categories -- focal seizures and generalized seizures. However, there are many different types of seizures in each of these categories.' "
Focal Seizures,"'Focal seizures, also called partial seizures, occur in just one part of the brain. About 60 percent of people with epilepsy have focal seizures. These seizures are frequently described by the area of the brain in which they originate. For example, someone might be diagnosed with focal frontal lobe seizures.''In a simple focal seizure, the person will remain conscious but experience unusual feelings or sensations that can take many forms. The person may experience sudden and unexplainable feelings of joy, anger, sadness, or ''nausea''. He or she also may hear, smell, taste, see, or feel things that are not real. ''In a complex focal seizure, the person has a change in or loss of consciousness. His or her consciousness may be altered, producing a dreamlike experience. People having a complex focal seizure may display strange, repetitious behaviors such as blinks, twitches, mouth movements, or even ''walking'' in a circle. These repetitious movements are called automatisms. More complicated actions, which may seem purposeful, can also occur involuntarily. Patients may also continue activities they started before the seizure began, such as washing dishes in a repetitive, unproductive fashion. These seizures usually last just a few seconds. ''Some people with focal seizures, especially complex focal seizures, may experience auras -- unusual sensations that warn of an impending seizure. These auras are actually simple focal seizures in which the person maintains consciousness. The symptoms an individual person has, and the progression of those symptoms, tend to be stereotyped, or similar every time. ''The symptoms of focal seizures can easily be confused with other disorders. For instance, the dreamlike perceptions associated with a complex focal seizure may be misdiagnosed as ''migraine'' ''headaches'', which also may cause a dreamlike state. The strange behavior and sensations caused by focal seizures also can be mistaken for symptoms of ''narcolepsy'', ''fainting'', or even mental illness. It may take many tests and careful monitoring by an experienced physician to tell the difference between epilepsy and other disorders.' "
Generalized Seizures,"'Generalized seizures are a result of abnormal neuronal activity on both sides of the brain. These seizures may cause loss of consciousness, falls, or massive muscle spasms. ''There are many kinds of generalized seizures. In absence seizures, the person may appear to be staring into space and/or have jerking or twitching muscles. These seizures are sometimes referred to as petit mal seizures, which is an older term. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms. Clonic seizures cause repeated jerking movements of muscles on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs. Atonic seizures cause a loss of normal muscle tone. The affected person will fall down or may drop his or her head involuntarily. Tonic-clonic seizures cause a mixture of symptoms, including stiffening of the body and repeated jerks of the arms and/or legs as well as loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures are sometimes referred to by an older term: ''grand mal'' seizures.''Not all seizures can be easily defined as either focal or generalized. Some people have seizures that begin as focal seizures but then spread to the entire brain. Other people may have both types of seizures but with no clear pattern. '""Society's lack of understanding about the many different types of seizures is one of the biggest problems for people with epilepsy. People who witness a non-convulsive seizure often find it difficult to understand that behavior which looks deliberate is not under the person's control. In some cases, this has led to the affected person being arrested or admitted to a psychiatric hospital. To combat these problems, people everywhere need to understand the many different types of seizures and how they may appear."" "
What Are the Different Kinds of Epilepsy?,"'Just as there are many different kinds of seizures, there are many different kinds of epilepsy. Doctors have identified hundreds of different epilepsy syndromes -- disorders characterized by a specific set of symptoms that include epilepsy. Some of these syndromes appear to be hereditary. For other syndromes, the cause is unknown. Epilepsy syndromes are frequently described by their symptoms or by where in the brain they originate. People should discuss the implications of their type of epilepsy with their doctors to understand the full range of symptoms, the possible treatments, and the prognosis. ''People with absence epilepsy have repeated absence seizures that cause momentary lapses of consciousness. These seizures almost always begin in childhood or adolescence, and they tend to run in families, suggesting that they may be at least partially due to a defective gene or genes. Some people with absence seizures have purposeless movements during their seizures, such as a jerking arm or rapidly blinking eyes. Others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief times when they are ""out of it."" Immediately after a seizure, the person can resume whatever he or she was doing. However, these seizures may occur so frequently that the person cannot concentrate in school or other situations. Childhood absence epilepsy usually stops when the child reaches ''puberty''. Absence seizures usually have no lasting effect on intelligence or other brain functions. ''Temporal lobe epilepsy, or TLE, is the most common epilepsy syndrome with focal seizures. These seizures are often associated with auras. TLE often begins in childhood. Research has shown that repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause a brain structure called the hippocampus to shrink over time. The hippocampus is important for memory and learning. While it may take years of temporal lobe seizures for measurable hippocampal damage to occur, this finding underlines the need to treat TLE early and as effectively as possible. '""Neocortical epilepsy is characterized by seizures that originate from the brain's cortex, or outer layer. The seizures can be either focal or generalized. They may include strange sensations, visual hallucinations, emotional changes, muscle spasms, convulsions, and a variety of other symptoms, depending on where in the brain the seizures originate. """"There are many other types of epilepsy, each with its own characteristic set of symptoms. Many of these, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Rasmussen's ""'encephalitis'"", begin in childhood. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have severe epilepsy with several different types of seizures, including atonic seizures, which cause sudden falls and are also called drop attacks. This severe form of epilepsy can be very difficult to treat effectively. Rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive type of epilepsy in which half of the brain shows continual inflammation. It sometimes is treated with a radical surgical procedure called hemispherectomy. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy, tend to go into remission or stop entirely during adolescence, whereas other syndromes such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are usually present for life once they develop. Seizure syndromes do not always appear in childhood, however. ""'Epilepsy syndromes that are easily treated, do not seem to impair cognitive functions or development, and usually stop spontaneously are often described as benign. Benign epilepsy syndromes include benign infantile ''encephalopathy'' and benign ''neonatal'"" convulsions. Other syndromes, such as early myoclonic encephalopathy, include neurological and developmental problems. However, these problems may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative processes rather than by the seizures. Epilepsy syndromes in which the seizures and/or the person's cognitive abilities get worse over time are called progressive epilepsy. ""'Several types of epilepsy begin in infancy. The most common type of infantile epilepsy is infantile spasms, clusters of seizures that usually begin before the age of 6 months. During these seizures the infant may bend and cry out. Anticonvulsant drugs often do not work for infantile spasms, but the seizures can be treated with ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or ''prednisone''.' "
When Are Seizures Not Epilepsy?,"'While any seizure is cause for concern, having a seizure does not by itself mean a person has epilepsy. First seizures, ''febrile seizures'', nonepileptic events, and ''eclampsia'' are examples of seizures that may not be associated with epilepsy.' "
First Seizures,"'Many people have a single seizure at some point in their lives. Often these seizures occur in reaction to anesthesia or a strong drug, but they also may be unprovoked, meaning that they occur without any obvious triggering factor. Unless the person has suffered brain damage or there is a family history of epilepsy or other neurological abnormalities, these single seizures usually are not followed by additional seizures. One recent study that followed patients for an average of 8 years found that only 33 percent of people have a second seizure within 4 years after an initial seizure. People who did not have a second seizure within that time remained seizure-free for the rest of the study. For people who did have a second seizure, the risk of a third seizure was about 73 percent on average by the end of 4 years. ''When someone has experienced a first seizure, the doctor will usually order an ''electroencephalogram'', or ''EEG'"", to determine what type of seizure the person may have had and if there are any detectable abnormalities in the person's brain waves. Thedoctor also may order brain scans to identify abnormalities that may be visible in the brain. These tests may help the doctor decide whether or not to treat the person with antiepileptic drugs. In some cases, drug treatment after the first seizure may help prevent future seizures and epilepsy. However, the drugs also can cause detrimental side effects, so doctors prescribe them only when they feel the benefits outweigh the risks. Evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to begin anticonvulsant medication once a person has had a second seizure, as the chance of future seizures increases significantly after this occurs."" "
Febrile Seizures,"'Sometimes a child will have a seizure during the course of an illness with a high ''fever''. These seizures are called febrile seizures (febrile is derived from the Latin word for ""''fever''"") and can be very alarming to the parents and other caregivers. In the past, doctors usually prescribed a course of anticonvulsant drugs following a febrile seizure in the hope of preventing epilepsy. However, most children who have a febrile seizure do not develop epilepsy, and long-term use of anticonvulsant drugs in children may damage the developing brain or cause other detrimental side effects. Experts at a 1980 consensus conference coordinated by the National Institutes of Health concluded that preventive treatment after a febrile seizure is generally not warranted unless certain other conditions are present: a family history of epilepsy, signs of nervous system impairment prior to the seizure, or a relatively prolonged or complicated seizure. The risk of subsequent non-febrile seizures is only 2 to 3 percent unless one of these factors is present. ''Researchers have now identified several different genes that influence the risk of febrile seizures in certain families. Studying these genes may lead to new understanding of how febrile seizures occur and perhaps point to ways of preventing them.' "
Nonepileptic Events,"""Sometimes people appear to have seizures, even though their brains show no seizure activity. This type of phenomenon has various names, including nonepileptic events and pseudoseizures. Both of these terms essentially mean something that looks like a seizure but isn't one. Nonepileptic events that are psychological in origin may be referred to as psychogenic seizures. Psychogenic seizures may indicate dependence, a need for attention, avoidance of stressful situations, or specific psychiatric conditions. Some people with epilepsy have psychogenic seizures in addition to their epileptic seizures. Other people who have psychogenic seizures do not have epilepsy at all. Psychogenic seizures cannot be treated in the same way as epileptic seizures. Instead, they are often treated by ""'mental health'' specialists. ''Other nonepileptic events may be caused by ''narcolepsy'', ''Tourette syndrome'', cardiac arrythmia, and other medical conditions with symptoms that resemble seizures. Because symptoms of these disorders can look very much like epileptic seizures, they are often mistaken for epilepsy. Distinguishing between true epileptic seizures and nonepileptic events can be very difficult and requires a thorough medical assessment, careful monitoring, and knowledgeable health professionals. Improvements in brain scanning and monitoring technology may improve diagnosis of nonepileptic events in the future.' "
Eclampsia,'Eclampsia'' is a life-threatening condition that can develop in ''pregnant'' women. Its symptoms include sudden elevations of ''blood pressure'' and seizures. Pregnant women who develop unexpected seizures should be rushed to a hospital immediately. Eclampsia can be treated in a hospital setting and usually does not result in additional seizures or epilepsy once the ''pregnancy'' is over.' 
How is Epilepsy Diagnosed?,"'Doctors have developed a number of different tests to determine whether a person has epilepsy and, if so, what kind of seizures the person has. In some cases, people may have symptoms that look very much like a seizure but in fact are nonepileptic events caused by other disorders. Even doctors may not be able to tell the difference between these disorders and epilepsy without close observation and intensive testing. ''An EEG records brain waves detected by electrodes placed on the ''scalp'"". This is the most common diagnostic test for epilepsy and can detect abnormalities in the brain's electrical activity. People with epilepsy frequently have changes in their normal pattern of brain waves, even when they are not experiencing a seizure. While this type of test can be very useful in diagnosing epilepsy, it is not foolproof. Some people continue to show normal brain wave patterns even after they have experienced a seizure. In other cases, the unusual brain waves are generated deep in the brain where the EEG is unable to detect them. Many people who do not have epilepsy also show some unusual brain activity on an EEG. Whenever possible, an EEG should be performed within 24 hours of a patient's first seizure. Ideally, EEGs should be performed while the patient is sleeping as well as when he or she is awake, because brain activity during sleep is often quite different than at other times. """"Video monitoring is often used in conjunction with EEG to determine the nature of a person's seizures. It also can be used in some cases to rule out other disorders such as cardiac arrythmia or narcolepsy that may look like epilepsy. ""'One of the most important ways of diagnosing epilepsy is through the use of brain scans. The most commonly used brain scans include CT (computed tomography), PET (positron emission tomography) and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging''). CT and MRI scans reveal the structure of the brain, which can be useful for identifying brain tumors, ''cysts'"", and other structural abnormalities. PET and an adapted kind of MRI called functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to monitor the brain's activity and detect abnormalities in how it works. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is a relatively new kind of brain scan that is sometimes used to locate seizure foci in the brain. """"In some cases, doctors may use an experimental type of brain scan called a magnetoencephalogram, or MEG. MEG detects the magnetic signals generated by neurons to allow doctors to monitor brain activity at different points in the brain over time, revealing different brain functions. While MEG is similar in concept to EEG, it does not require electrodes and it can detect signals from deeper in the brain than an EEG. Doctors also are experimenting with brain scans called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that can detect abnormalities in the brain's biochemical processes, and with near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that can detect oxygen levels in brain tissue. """"Taking a detailed medical history, including symptoms and duration of the seizures, is still one of the best methods available to determine if a person has epilepsy and what kind of seizures he or she has. The doctor will ask questions about the seizures and any past illnesses or other symptoms a person may have had. Since people who have suffered a seizure often do not remember what happened, caregivers' accounts of the seizure are vital to this evaluation. ""'Doctors often take blood samples for testing, particularly when they are examining a child. These blood samples are often screened for metabolic or genetic disorders that may be associated with the seizures. They also may be used to check for underlying problems such as infections, ''lead poisoning'', ''anemia'', and ''diabetes'' that may be causing or triggering the seizures. ''Doctors often use tests devised to measure motor abilities, behavior, and intellectual capacity as a way to determine how the epilepsy is affecting that person. These tests also can provide clues about what kind of epilepsy the person has.' "
Can Epilepsy Be Prevented?,"'Many cases of epilepsy can be prevented by wearing seatbelts and bicycle helmets, putting children in car seats, and other measures that prevent head injury and other trauma. Prescribing medication after first or second seizures or febrile seizures also may help prevent epilepsy in some cases. Good ''prenatal care'', including treatment of ''high blood pressure'' and infections during pregnancy, can prevent brain damage in the developing baby that may lead to epilepsy and other neurological problems later. Treating ''cardiovascular disease'', ''high blood pressure'', infections, and other disorders that can affect the brain during adulthood and ''aging'' also may prevent many cases of epilepsy. Finally, identifying the genes for many neurological disorders can provide opportunities for genetic screening and ''prenatal diagnosis'' that may ultimately prevent many cases of epilepsy.' "
How Can Epilepsy Be Treated?,"'Accurate diagnosis of the type of epilepsy a person has is crucial for finding an effective treatment. There are many different ways to treat epilepsy. Currently available treatments can control seizures at least some of the time in about 80 percent of people with epilepsy. However, another 20 percent, about 600,000 people with epilepsy in the United States, have intractable seizures, and another 400,000 feel they get inadequate relief from available treatments. These statistics make it clear that improved treatments are desperately needed. ''Doctors who treat epilepsy come from many different fields of medicine. They include neurologists, pediatricians, pediatric neurologists, internists, and family physicians, as well as neurosurgeons and doctors called epileptologists who specialize in treating epilepsy. People who need specialized or intensive care for epilepsy may be treated at large medical centers and neurology clinics at hospitals or by neurologists in private practice. Many ''epilepsy treatment'' centers are associated with university hospitals that perform research in addition to providing medical care. ''Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. Research suggests that medication and other treatments may be less successful in treating epilepsy once seizures and their consequences become established. '""By far the most common approach to treating epilepsy is to prescribe antiepileptic drugs.  The first effective antiepileptic drugs were bromides, introduced by an English physician named Sir Charles Locock in 1857.  He noticed that bromides had a sedative effect and seemed to reduce seizures in some patients.  More than 20 different antiepileptic drugs are now on the market, all with different benefits and side effects.  The choice of which drug to prescribe, and at what dosage, depends on many different factors, including the type of seizures a person has, the person's lifestyle and age, how frequently the seizures occur, and, for a woman, the likelihood that she will become pregnant.  People with epilepsy should follow their doctor's advice and share any concerns they may have regarding their medication. ""'Doctors seeing a patient with newly developed epilepsy often prescribe ''carbamazepine'', valproate, ''lamotrigine'', ''oxcarbazepine'', or ''phenytoin'' first, unless the epilepsy is a type that is known to require a different kind of treatment.  For absence seizures, ''ethosuximide'' is often the primary treatment.  Other commonly prescribed drugs include ''clonazepam'', phenobarbital, and ''primidone''.   Some relatively new epilepsy drugs include ''tiagabine'', ''gabapentin'', ''topiramate'', ''levetiracetam'', and ''felbamate'"".   Other drugs are used in combination with one of the standard drugs or for intractable seizures that do not respond to other medications.  A few drugs, such as fosphenytoin, are approved for use only in hospital settings to treat specific problems such as status epilepticus (see section, “Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?”).  For people with stereotyped recurrent severe seizures that can be easily recognized by the person's family, the drug ""'diazepam'' is now available as a gel that can be administered rectally by a family member.  This method of drug delivery may be able to stop prolonged or repeated seizures before they develop into status epilepticus.  ''For most people with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with just one drug at the optimal dosage.  Combining medications usually amplifies side effects such as ''fatigue'' and ''decreased appetite'"", so doctors usually prescribe monotherapy, or the use of just one drug, whenever possible.  Combinations of drugs are sometimes prescribed if monotherapy fails to effectively control a patient's seizures. """"The number of times a person needs to take medication each day is usually determined by the drug's half-life, or the time it takes for half the drug dose to be metabolized or broken down into other substances in the body.  Some drugs, such as phenytoin and phenobarbital, only need to be taken once a day, while others such as valproate must be taken two or three times a day. ""'Most side effects of antiepileptic drugs are relatively minor, such as ''fatigue'', ''dizziness'', or ''weight gain''.  However, severe and life-threatening side effects such as ''allergic'' reactions can occur.  Epilepsy medication also may predispose people to developing ''depression'' or psychoses.  People with epilepsy should consult a doctor immediately if they develop any kind of ''rash'' while on medication, or if they find themselves ''depressed'' or otherwise unable to think in a rational manner.  Other danger signs that should be discussed with a doctor immediately are extreme ''fatigue'', staggering or other movement problems, and slurring of words.  People with epilepsy should be aware that their epilepsy medication can interact with many other drugs in potentially harmful ways.  For this reason, people with epilepsy should always tell doctors who treat them which medications they are taking.  Women also should know that some antiepileptic drugs can interfere with the effectiveness of ''oral contraceptives'', and they should discuss this possibility with their doctors. ''Since people can become more sensitive to medications as they age, they may need to have their blood levels of medication checked occasionally to see if the dose needs to be adjusted.  The effects of a particular medication also sometimes wear off over time, leading to an increase in seizures if the dose is not adjusted.  People should know that some citrus fruit, in particular grapefruit juice, may interfere with breakdown of many drugs.  This can cause too much of the drug to build up in their bodies, often worsening the side effects. ''People taking epilepsy medication should be sure to check with their doctor and/or seek a second medical opinion if their medication does not appear to be working or if it causes unexpected side effects. '""When a person starts a new epilepsy drug, it is important to tailor the dosage to achieve the best results. People's bodies react to medications in very different and sometimes unpredictable ways, so it may take some time to find the right drug at the right dose to provide optimal control of seizures while minimizing side effects. A drug that has no effect or very bad side effects at one dose may work very well at another dose. Doctors will usually prescribe a low dose of the new drug initially and monitor blood levels of the drug to determine when the best possible dose has been reached. ""'Generic versions are available for many antiepileptic drugs. The chemicals in generic drugs are exactly the same as in the brand-name drugs, but they may be absorbed or processed differently in the body because of the way they are prepared. Therefore, patients should always check with their doctors before switching to a generic version of their medication. '""Some doctors will advise people with epilepsy to discontinue their antiepileptic drugs after 2 years have passed without a seizure. Others feel it is better to wait for 4 to 5 years. Discontinuing medication should always be done with a doctor's advice and supervision. It is very important to continue taking epilepsy medication for as long as the doctor prescribes it. People also should ask the doctor or pharmacist ahead of time what they should do if they miss a dose. Discontinuing medication without a doctor's advice is one of the major reasons people who have been seizure-free begin having new seizures. Seizures that result from suddenly stopping medication can be very serious and can lead to status epilepticus. Furthermore, there is some evidence that uncontrolled seizures trigger changes in neurons that can make it more difficult to treat the seizures in the future. """"The chance that a person will eventually be able to discontinue medication varies depending on the person's age and his or her type of epilepsy. More than half of children who go into remission with medication can eventually stop their medication without having new seizures. One study showed that 68 percent of adults who had been seizure-free for 2 years before stopping medication were able to do so without having more seizures and 75 percent could successfully discontinue medication if they had been seizure-free for 3 years. However, the odds of successfully stopping medication are not as good for people with a family history of epilepsy, those who need multiple medications, those with focal seizures, and those who continue to have abnormal EEG results while on medication. ""'When seizures cannot be adequately controlled by medications, doctors may recommend that the person be evaluated for surgery. Surgery for epilepsy is performed by teams of doctors at medical centers. To decide if a person may benefit from surgery, doctors consider the type or types of seizures he or she has. They also take into account the brain region involved and how important that region is for everyday behavior. Surgeons usually avoid operating in areas of the brain that are necessary for speech, language, ''hearing'', or other important abilities. Doctors may perform tests such as a Wada test (administration of the drug amobarbitol into the carotid artery) to find areas of the brain that control speech and memory. They often monitor the patient intensively prior to surgery in order to pinpoint the exact location in the brain where seizures begin. They also may use implanted electrodes to record brain activity from the surface of the brain. This yields better information than an external EEG. '""A 1990 National Institutes of Health consensus conference on surgery for epilepsy concluded that there are three broad categories of epilepsy that can be treated successfully with surgery. These include focal seizures, seizures that begin as focal seizures before spreading to the rest of the brain, and unilateral multifocal epilepsy with infantile hemiplegia (such as Rasmussen's encephalitis). Doctors generally recommend surgery only after patients have tried two or three different medications without success, or if there is an identifiable brain lesion--a damaged or dysfunctional area--believed to cause the seizures. ""'A study published in 2000 compared surgery to an additional year of treatment with antiepileptic drugs in people with longstanding temporal lobe epilepsy. The results showed that 64 percent of patients receiving surgery became seizure-free, compared to 8 percent of those who continued with medication only. Because of this study and other evidence, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) now recommends surgery for TLE when antiepileptic drugs are not effective. However, the study and the AAN guidelines do not provide guidance on how long seizures should occur, how severe they should be, or how many drugs should be tried before surgery is considered. A nationwide study is now underway to determine how soon surgery for TLE should be performed. ''If a person is considered a good candidate for surgery and has seizures that cannot be controlled with available medication, experts generally agree that surgery should be performed as early as possible. It can be difficult for a person who has had years of seizures to fully re-adapt to a seizure-free life if the surgery is successful. The person may never have had an opportunity to develop independence, and he or she may have had difficulties with school and work that could have been avoided with earlier treatment. Surgery should always be performed with support from rehabilitation specialists and counselors who can help the person deal with the many psychological, social, and employment issues he or she may face. ''While surgery can significantly reduce or even halt seizures for some people, it is important to remember that any kind of surgery carries some amount of risk (usually small). Surgery for epilepsy does not always successfully reduce seizures and it can result in cognitive or personality changes, even in people who are excellent candidates for surgery. Patients should ask their surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure they are considering. '""Even when surgery completely ends a person's seizures, it is important to continue taking seizure medication for some time to give the brain time to re-adapt. Doctors generally recommend medication for 2 years after a successful operation to avoid new seizures. ""'In cases where seizures are caused by a ''brain tumor'', ''hydrocephalus'"", or other conditions that can be treated with surgery, doctors may operate to treat these underlying conditions. In many cases, once the underlying condition is successfully treated, a person's seizures will disappear as well. ""'The most common type of surgery for epilepsy is removal of a seizure focus, or small area of the brain where seizures originate. This type of surgery, which doctors may refer to as a lobectomy or ''lesionectomy'', is appropriate only for focal seizures that originate in just one area of the brain. In general, people have a better chance of becoming seizure-free after surgery if they have a small, well-defined seizure focus. Lobectomies have a 55-70 percent success rate when the type of epilepsy and the seizure focus is well-defined. The most common type of lobectomy is a ''temporal lobe resection'', which is performed for people with temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal ''lobe resection'' leads to a significant reduction or complete cessation of seizures about 70 - 90 percent of the time. ''When seizures originate in part of the brain that cannot be removed, surgeons may perform a procedure called a ''multiple subpial transection''. In this type of operation, which has been commonly performed since 1989, surgeons make a series of ''cuts'"" that are designed to prevent seizures from spreading into other parts of the brain while leaving the person's normal abilities intact. About 70 percent of patients who undergo a multiple subpial transection have satisfactory improvement in seizure control. ""'Corpus callosotomy, or severing the network of neural connections between the right and left halves, or hemispheres, of the brain, is done primarily in children with severe seizures that start in one half of the brain and spread to the other side. Corpus callosotomy can end drop attacks and other generalized seizures. However, the procedure does not stop seizures in the side of the brain where they originate, and these focal seizures may even increase after surgery. '""These procedures remove half of the brain's cortex, or outer layer. They are used predominantly in children who have seizures that do not respond to medication because of damage that involves only half the brain, as occurs with conditions such as Rasmussen's encephalitis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and hemimegencephaly. While this type of surgery is very radical and is performed only as a last resort, children often recover very well from the procedure, and their seizures usually cease altogether. With intense rehabilitation, they often recover nearly normal abilities. Since the chance of a full recovery is best in young children, hemispherectomy should be performed as early in a child's life as possible. It is rarely performed in children older than 13. ""'The vagus nerve stimulator was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in people with seizures that are not well-controlled by medication. The vagus nerve stimulator is a battery-powered device that is surgically implanted under the skin of the chest, much like a ''pacemaker'', and is attached to the vagus nerve in the lower neck. This device delivers short bursts of electrical energy to the brain via the vagus nerve. On average, this stimulation reduces seizures by about 20 - 40 percent. Patients usually cannot stop taking epilepsy medication because of the stimulator, but they often experience fewer seizures and they may be able to reduce the dose of their medication. Side effects of the vagus nerve stimulator are generally mild but may include ''hoarseness'', ear ''pain'', a ''sore throat'', or nausea. Adjusting the amount of stimulation can usually eliminate most side effects, although the ''hoarseness'' typically persists. The batteries in the vagus nerve stimulator need to be replaced about once every 5 years; this requires a minor operation that can usually be performed as an outpatient procedure. ''Several new devices may become available for epilepsy in the future. Researchers are studying whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a procedure which uses a strong magnet held outside the head to influence brain activity, may reduce seizures. They also hope to develop implantable devices that can deliver drugs to specific parts of the brain. ''Studies have shown that, in some cases, children may experience fewer seizures if they maintain a strict ''diet'' rich in ''fats'' and low in carbohydrates. This unusual diet, called the ''ketogenic diet'', causes the body to break down fats instead of carbohydrates to survive. This condition is called ketosis. One study of 150 children whose seizures were poorly controlled by medication found that about one-fourth of the children had a 90 percent or better decrease in seizures with the ketogenic diet, and another half of the group had a 50 percent or better decrease in their seizures. Moreover, some children can discontinue the ketogenic diet after several years and remain seizure-free. The ketogenic diet is not easy to maintain, as it requires strict adherence to an unusual and limited range of foods. Possible side effects include retarded growth due to nutritional deficiency and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to ''kidney stones''. People who try the ketogenic diet should seek the guidance of a dietician to ensure that it does not lead to serious nutritional deficiency. ''Researchers are not sure how ketosis inhibits seizures. One study showed that a byproduct of ketosis called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) inhibits seizures in animals. If BHB also works in humans, researchers may eventually be able to develop drugs that mimic the seizure-inhibiting effects of the ketogenic diet. ''Researchers are studying whether biofeedback -- a strategy in which individuals learn to control their own brain waves -- may be useful in controlling seizures. However, this type of therapy is controversial and most studies have shown discouraging results. Taking large doses of ''vitamins'"" generally does not help a person's seizures and may even be harmful in some cases. But a good diet and some vitamin ""'supplements'', particularly ''folic acid'', may help reduce some ''birth defects'' and medication-related nutritional deficiencies. Use of non-vitamin ''supplements'' such as ''melatonin'' is controversial and can be risky. One study showed that melatonin may reduce seizures in some children, while another found that the risk of seizures increased measurably with melatonin. Most non-vitamin supplements such as those found in health food stores are not regulated by the FDA, so their true effects and their interactions with other drugs are largely unknown'  "
How Does Epilepsy Affect Daily Life?,"'Most people with epilepsy lead outwardly normal lives. Approximately 80 percent can be significantly helped by modern therapies, and some may go months or years between seizures. However, the condition can and does affect daily life for people with epilepsy, their family, and their friends. People with severe seizures that resist treatment have, on average, a shorter life expectancy and an increased risk of cognitive impairment, particularly if the seizures developed in early childhood. These impairments may be related to the underlying conditions tha cause epilepsy or to epilepsy treatment rather than the epilepsy itself. ''It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems. Sometimes these problems are caused by embarrassment or frustration associated with epilepsy. Other problems may result from ''bullying'"", teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. In children, these problems can be minimized if parents encourage a positive outlook and independence, do not reward negative behavior with unusual amounts of attention, and try to stay attuned to their child's needs and feelings. Families must learn to accept and live with the seizures without blaming or resenting the affected person. Counseling services can help families cope with epilepsy in a positive manner. Epilepsy support groups also can help by providing a way for people with epilepsy and their family members to share their experiences, frustrations, and tips for coping with the disorder. ""'People with epilepsy have an increased risk of poor self-esteem, ''depression'', and ''suicide''. These problems may be a reaction to a lack of understanding or discomfort about epilepsy that may result in cruelty or avoidance by other people. Many people with epilepsy also live with an ever-present fear that they will have another seizure. '""For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence, in particular the ability to drive. Most states and the District of Columbia will not issue a driver's license to someone with epilepsy unless the person can document that they have gone a specific amount of time without a seizure (the waiting period varies from a few months to several years). Some states make exceptions for this policy when seizures don't impair consciousness, occur only during sleep, or have long auras or other warning signs that allow the person to avoid driving when a seizure is likely to occur. Studies show that the risk of having a seizure-related accident decreases as the length of time since the last seizure increases. One study found that the risk of having a seizure-related motor vehicle accident is 93 percent less in people who wait at least 1 year after their last seizure before driving, compared to people who wait for shorter intervals. """"The risk of seizures also restricts people's recreational choices. For instance, people with epilepsy should not participate in sports such as skydiving or motor racing where a moment's ""'inattention'' could lead to injury. Other activities, such as ''swimming'' and sailing, should be done only with precautions and/or supervision. However, jogging, football, and many other sports are reasonably safe for a person with epilepsy. Studies to date have not shown any increase in seizures due to sports, although these studies have not focused on any activity in particular. There is some evidence that regular ''exercise'' may even improve seizure control in some people. Sports are often such a positive factor in life that it is best for the person to participate, although the person with epilepsy and the coach or other leader should take appropriate safety precautions. It is important to take steps to avoid potential sports-related problems such as ''dehydration'', overexertion, and ''hypoglycemia'', as these problems can increase the risk of seizures. ''By law, people with epilepsy or other handicaps in the United States cannot be denied employment or access to any educational, recreational, or other activity because of their seizures. However, one survey showed that only about 56 percent of people with epilepsy finish high school and about 15 percent finish college -- rates much lower than those for the general population. The same survey found that about 25 percent of working-age people with epilepsy are unemployed. These numbers indicate that significant barriers still exist for people with epilepsy in school and work. Restrictions on driving limit the employment opportunities for many people with epilepsy, and many find it difficult to face the misunderstandings and social pressures they encounter in public situations. Antiepileptic drugs also may cause side effects that interfere with concentration and memory. Children with epilepsy may need extra time to complete schoolwork, and they sometimes may need to have instructions or other information repeated for them. Teachers should be told what to do if a child in their classroom has a seizure, and parents should work with the school system to find reasonable ways to accommodate any special needs their child may have. '""Women with epilepsy are often concerned about whether they can become pregnant and have a healthy child. This is usually possible. While some seizure medications and some types of epilepsy may reduce a person's interest in sexual activity, most people with epilepsy can become pregnant. Moreover, women with epilepsy have a 90 percent or better chance of having a normal, healthy baby, and the risk of birth defects is only about 4 to 6 percent. The risk that children of parents with epilepsy will develop epilepsy themselves is only about 5 percent unless the parent has a clearly hereditary form of the disorder. Parents who are worried that their epilepsy may be hereditary may wish to consult a genetic counselor to determine what the risk might be. ""'Amniocentesis'' and high-level ''ultrasound'' can be performed during pregnancy to ensure that the baby is developing normally, and a procedure called a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein test can be used for prenatal diagnosis of many conditions if a problem is suspected. ''There are several precautions women can take before and during pregnancy to reduce the risks associated with pregnancy and delivery. Women who are thinking about ''becoming pregnant'' should talk with their doctors to learn any special risks associated with their epilepsy and the medications they may be taking. Some seizure medications, particularly valproate, trimethidone, and phenytoin, are known to increase the risk of having a child with birth defects such as ''cleft palate'', ''heart'"" problems, or finger and toe defects. For this reason, a woman's doctor may advise switching to other medications during pregnancy. Whenever possible, a woman should allow her doctor enough time to properly change medications, including phasing in the new medications and checking to determine when blood levels are stabilized, before she tries to become pregnant. Women should also begin prenatal vitamin supplements -- especially with folic acid, which may reduce the risk of some birth defects -- well before pregnancy. Women who discover that they are pregnant but have not already spoken with their doctor about ways to reduce the risks should do so as soon as possible. However, they should continue taking seizure medication as prescribed until that time to avoid preventable seizures. Seizures during pregnancy can harm the developing baby or lead to ""'miscarriage'', particularly if the seizures are severe. Nevertheless, many women who have seizures during pregnancy have normal, healthy ''babies''. '""Women with epilepsy sometimes experience a change in their seizure frequency during pregnancy, even if they do not change medications. About 25 to 40 percent of women have an increase in their seizure frequency while they are pregnant, while other women may have fewer seizures during pregnancy. The frequency of seizures during pregnancy may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the woman's increased blood volume during pregnancy, which can dilute the effect of medication. Women should have their blood levels of seizure medications monitored closely during and after pregnancy, and the medication dosage should be adjusted accordingly. ""'Pregnant women with epilepsy should take ''prenatal vitamins'' and get plenty of sleep to avoid seizures caused by sleep deprivation. They also should take ''vitamin K'' supplements after 34 weeks of pregnancy to reduce the risk of a blood-clotting disorder in infants called neonatal coagulopathy that can result from fetal exposure to epilepsy medications. Finally, they should get good prenatal care, avoid tobacco, ''caffeine'', alcohol, and illegal drugs, and try to avoid stress. ''Labor and delivery'' usually proceed normally for women with epilepsy, although there is a slightly increased risk of hemorrhage, eclampsia, premature ''labor'', and cesarean section. Doctors can administer antiepileptic drugs intravenously and monitor blood levels of anticonvulsant medication during ''labor'' to reduce the risk that the ''labor'"" will trigger a seizure. Babies sometimes have symptoms of withdrawal from the mother's seizure medication after they are born, but these problems wear off in a few weeks or months and usually do not cause serious or long-term effects. A mother's blood levels of anticonvulsant medication should be checked frequently after delivery as medication often needs to be decreased. """"Epilepsy medications need not influence a woman's decision about breast-feeding her baby. Only minor amounts of epilepsy medications are secreted in ""'breast milk'', usually not enough to harm the baby and much less than the baby was exposed to in the womb. On rare occasions, the baby may become excessively drowsy or feed poorly, and these problems should be closely monitored. However, experts believe the benefits of breast-feeding outweigh the risks except in rare circumstances. '""To increase doctors' understanding of how different epilepsy medications affect pregnancy and the chances of having a healthy baby, Massachusetts General Hospital has begun a nationwide registry for women who take antiepileptic drugs while pregnant. Women who enroll in this program are given educational materials on pre-""'conception'' planning and perinatal care and are asked to provide information about the health of their children (this information is kept confidential). Women and physicians can contact this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or 617-726-1742 (fax: 617-724-8307). ''Women with epilepsy should be aware that some epilepsy medications can interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Women who wish to use oral contraceptives to prevent pregnancy should discuss this with their doctors, who may be able to prescribe a different kind of antiepileptic medication or suggest other ways of avoiding an unplanned pregnancy.'  "
Are There Special Risks Associated With Epilepsy?,"'Although most people with epilepsy lead full, active lives, they are at special risk for two life-threatening conditions: status epilepticus and sudden unexplained death. ''Status epilepticus is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a person either has an abnormally prolonged seizure or does not fully regain consciousness between seizures. Although there is no strict definition for the time at which a seizure turns into status epilepticus, most people agree that any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes should, for practical purposes, be treated as though it was status epilepticus. ''While people with epilepsy are at an increased risk for status epilepticus, about 60 percent of people who develop this condition have no previous seizure history. These cases often result from tumors, trauma, or other problems that affect the brain and may themselves be life-threatening. ''While most seizures do not require emergency medical treatment, someone with a prolonged seizure lasting more than 5 minutes may be in status epilepticus and should be taken to an emergency room immediately. It is important to treat a person with status epilepticus as soon as possible. One study showed that 80 percent of people in status epilepticus who received medication within 30 minutes of seizure onset eventually stopped having seizures, whereas only 40 percent recovered if 2 hours had passed before they received medication. Doctors in a hospital setting can treat status epilepticus with several different drugs and can undertake emergency life-saving measures, such as administering oxygen, if necessary. ''People in status epilepticus do not always have severe convulsive seizures. Instead, they may have repeated or prolonged nonconvulsive seizures. This type of status epilepticus may appear as a sustained episode of ''confusion'' or agitation in someone who does not ordinarily have that kind of mental impairment. While this type of episode may not seem as severe as convulsive status epilepticus, it should still be treated as an emergency. ''For reasons that are poorly understood, people with epilepsy have an increased risk of dying suddenly for no discernible reason. This condition, called sudden unexplained death, can occur in people without epilepsy, but epilepsy increases the risk about two-fold. Researchers are still unsure why sudden unexplained death occurs. One study suggested that use of more than two anticonvulsant drugs may be a risk factor. However, it is not clear whether the use of multiple drugs causes the sudden death, or whether people' "
What Research Is Being Done on Epilepsy?,"'While research has led to many advances in understanding and treating epilepsy, there are many unanswered questions about how and why seizures develop, how they can best be treated or prevented, and how they influence other brain activity and brain development. Researchers, many of whom are supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), are studying all of these questions. They also are working to identify and test new drugs and other treatments for epilepsy and to learn how those treatments affect brain activity and development. '""The NINDS's Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) studies potential new therapies with the goal of enhancing treatment for patients with epilepsy. Since it began in 1975, more than 390 public-private partnerships have been created. These partnerships have resulted in state-of-the-art evaluations of more than 25,000 compounds for their potential as antiepileptic drugs. This government-sponsored effort has contributed to the development of five drugs that are now approved for use in the United States. It has also aided in the discovery and profiling of six new compounds currently in various stages of clinical development. Besides testing for safer, more efficacious therapies, the Program is developing and validating new models that may one day find therapies that intervene in the disease process itself as well as models of resistant or refractory epilepsy. ""'Scientists continue to study how excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters interact with brain cells to control nerve firing. They can apply different chemicals to cultures of neurons in laboratory dishes to study how those chemicals influence neuronal activity. They also are studying how glia and other non-neuronal cells in the brain contribute to seizures. This research may lead to new drugs and other new ways of treating seizures. ''Researchers also are working to identify genes that may influence epilepsy in some way. Identifying these genes can reveal the underlying chemical processes that influence epilepsy and point to new ways of preventing or treating this disorder. Researchers also can study rats and mice that have missing or abnormal copies of certain genes to determine how these genes affect normal brain development and resistance to damage from disease and other environmental factors. In the future, researchers may be able to use panels of gene fragments, called ""gene chips,"" to determine each person\'s genetic ''makeup''. This information may allow doctors to prevent epilepsy or to predict which treatments will be most beneficial. ''Doctors are now experimenting with several new types of therapies for epilepsy. In one preliminary clinical trial, doctors have begun transplanting fetal pig neurons that produce GABA into the brains of patients to learn whether the cell transplants can help control seizures. Preliminary research suggests that stem cell transplants also may prove beneficial for treating epilepsy. Research showing that the brain undergoes subtle changes prior to a seizure has led to a prototype device that may be able to predict seizures up to 3 minutes before they begin. If this device works, it could greatly reduce the risk of injury from seizures by allowing people to move to a safe area before their seizures start. This type of device also may be hooked up to a treatment pump or other device that will automatically deliver an antiepileptic drug or an electric impulse to forestall the seizures. ''Researchers are continually improving MRI and other brain scans. Pre-surgical brain imaging can guide doctors to abnormal brain tissue and away from essential parts of the brain. Researchers also are using brain scans such as magnetoencephalograms (MEG) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to identify and study subtle problems in the brain that cannot otherwise be detected. Their findings may lead to a better understanding of epilepsy and how it can be treated.' "
How Can I Help Research on Epilepsy?,"'There are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. Pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry, which is maintained by the Genetics and Teratology Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital (see section on Pregnancy and Motherhood). People with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the Epilepsy Gene Discovery Project, which is supported by the Epilepsy Foundation. This project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. People who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. Researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary, and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. In many cases, identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. It also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. ''People with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications, surgical techniques, and other treatments by enrolling in ''clinical trials''. Information on clinical trials can be obtained from the NINDS as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies, universities, and other organizations. A person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. While experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials, patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. Therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work, and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. Patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. ''Patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. Brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders. Below are some brain banks that accept tissue from patients with epilepsy: ''Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders''University of Maryland''655 West Baltimore Street, Room 10-035 BRB''Baltimore, MD 21201-1559''800-847-1539''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''http://medschool.umaryland.edu/BTBank/''(tissue from children only)''Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders''University of Miami''Department of Pathology, R-5''Papanicolaou Building, Room 410''Miami, FL 33136''800-59BRAIN (592-7246)''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''(tissue from adults only)''Brain Endowment Bank''University of Miami''1501 NW Ninth Avenue, Suite #4013''Miami, FL 33136''305-243-6219''800-UM-BRAIN (862-7246) ''National Disease Research Interchange''8 Penn Center, 8th Floor''Philadelphia, PA 19103''215-557-7361''800-222-NDRI (6374)''E-mail: ''[email\xa0protected]''www.ndri.com''Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center''Neurology Research (127A)''W.

What to Do if You See Someone Having a Seizure,"""If you see someone having a seizure with convulsions and/or loss of consciousness, here's how you can help:"" Roll the person on his or her side to prevent choking on any fluids or vomit. Cushion the person's head.  Loosen any tight clothing around the neck.  Keep the person's airway open. If necessary, grip the person's jaw gently and tilt his or her head back.  Do NOT restrict the person from moving unless he or she is in danger.  Do NOT put anything into the person's mouth, not even medicine or liquid. These can cause choking or damage to the person's jaw, tongue, or teeth. Contrary to widespread belief, people cannot swallow their tongues during a seizure or any other time.  Remove any sharp or solid objects that the person might hit during the seizure.  Note how long the seizure lasts and what symptoms occurred so you can tell a doctor or emergency personnel if necessary.  Stay with the person until the seizure ends.  The person is pregnant or has diabetes. The seizure happened in water. The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes. The person does not begin breathing again or does not return to consciousness after the seizure stops. Another seizure starts before the person regains consciousness. The person injures himself or herself during the seizure. This is a first seizure or you think it might be. If in doubt, check to see if the person has a medical identification card or jewelry stating that they have epilepsy or a seizure disorder.  After the seizure ends, the person will probably be groggy and tired. He or she also may have a headache and be confused or embarrassed. Be patient with the person and try to help him or her find a place to rest if he or she is tired or doesn't feel well. If necessary, offer to call a taxi, a friend, or a relative to help the person get home safely.  If you see someone having a non-convulsive seizure, remember that the person's behavior is not intentional. The person may wander aimlessly or make alarming or unusual gestures. You can help by following these guidelines:  Remove any dangerous objects from the area around the person or in his or her path. Don't try to stop the person from wandering unless he or she is in danger. Don't shake the person or shout. Stay with the person until he or she is completely alert."
Conclusion,"'Many people with epilepsy lead productive and outwardly normal lives. Medical and research advances in the past two decades have led to a better understanding of epilepsy and seizures than ever before. Advanced brain scans and other techniques allow greater accuracy in diagnosing epilepsy and determining when a patient may be helped by surgery. More than 20 different medications and a variety of surgical techniques are now available and provide good control of seizures for most people with epilepsy. Other treatment options include the ketogenic diet and the first implantable device, the vagus nerve stimulator. Research on the underlying causes of epilepsy, including identification of genes for some forms of epilepsy and febrile seizures, has led to a greatly improved understanding of epilepsy that may lead to more effective treatments or even new ways of preventing epilepsy in the future.'

What are seizures and epilepsy?,"'A ''seizure'' is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It can cause jerking movements, changes in behavior, changes in feelings and may affect levels of consciousness. A ''seizure'' is usually a single episode. When there are two or more ''seizures'' or recurrent ''seizures'', the condition is called ''epilepsy''. Most seizures may not have a clear cause, while others can occur due to high ''fever'', ''stroke'', ''head injury'', infection or inflammation of the brain, and major illnesses. Childhood ''seizure disorders'' like ''Dravet syndrome'' or ''Lennox-Gastaut'' are often a result of harmful genetic mutations, but not always.''Epilepsy'' is a neurological disorder where brain activities are abnormal, causing more than one or recurrent episodes of seizures.' "
What is the treatment for seizures and epilepsy?,"'Most cases of seizures can be managed conservatively with medication and supportive treatments. Surgery may be required to treat some cases of ''epilepsy''. The treatment plan depends on the type and severity of seizure, age of the patient and the frequency of episodes. Many require lifelong treatment while others experience complete resolution. Children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition as they get older. Treatment of underlying medical conditions causing seizures is required.' Medication: Antiseizure medications like valproic acid, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, etc. may be prescribed by the physician. Dosage would depend on the severity. Vagus nerve stimulation: A device is implanted beneath the skin of the chest that stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck. Stimulating the vagus nerve sends signals to the brain to inhibit seizures. Responsive neurostimulation: A device is implanted on the surface of the brain or within the brain tissue to detect abnormal brain activity and electrically stimulate the detected area to stop the seizure. Deep brain stimulation: Electrodes are implanted within certain areas of the brain and they produce electrical impulses that regulate abnormal brain activity. Diet: A diet rich in fat and low in carbohydrates, also called a ketogenic/keto diet, can improve seizure disorders. Surgery: The goal of surgery is to stop seizures from happening. Surgeons locate and remove the area of your brain where seizures begin. Surgery works best for people who have seizures that always originate from the same place in their brains."
Pregnancy and seizures,"'Women with seizures/epilepsy can have healthy ''pregnancies''. There is a risk of ''birth defects'' associated with certain antiseizure medications, especially valproic acid. The physician would prescribe appropriate medication and adjust the dosage during ''pregnancy''.''Contraception'' and antiseizure medications''Certain antiseizure medications can decrease the efficacy of ''birth control pills''. Hence, the doctor may recommend alternate methods of ''birth control''.' "
What Causes Seizures in Young Children?,"'Childhood seizure disorders mostly have an underlying genetic cause, but some are not easily classifiable. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes are' Doose syndrome (myoclonic-atonic epilepsy), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy) Benign neonatal myoclonic epilepsy Familial myoclonic epilepsy Autosomal dominant cortical myoclonus and epilepsies Unverricht-Lundborg disease Lafora body disease Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, sialidosis, and dentate-rubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)."
Lifestyle modifications,"'It is important to take medications as prescribed by the doctor alongside lifestyle modifications.' Get adequate sleep: Inadequate rest/sleep can trigger seizures. Wear a medical alert bracelet. Get regular physical activity to help reduce stress and improve overall physical and mental health. Maintain adequate hydration. Manage physical and mental stress. Limit alcohol consumption. Avoid cigarette smoking. Avoid recreational drugs. Avoid places with bright and blinking lights, like nightclubs."
Personal safety measures,"'The following measures can help reduce the risk of injury during a seizure.' Avoid swimming, being in a boat, etc. alone. Take showers instead of using a bathtub. Wear a helmet while riding or playing high-risk sports. Modify furniture by padding sharp edges; avoid low furniture like footstools to prevent tripping and carpet the floor to reduce the impact during falls. Carry or display seizure first-aid tips at home or work. Avoid wearing clothes that are tight around the neck."
Seizure first aid,"'The following steps can help a person during a seizure.' Shout for help or contact the doctor immediately The person should be rolled onto their side. Something soft should be placed under their head. Any tight neckwear, scarves, etc. should be loosened. No objects or fingers should be placed in the mouth of a person having a seizure. Avoid holding or restraining a person having a seizure because it can cause injuries. Remove dangerous objects from around the person. Someone should closely observe the person during the seizure and stay with them until medical help arrives. The duration of the seizure should be recorded."
What are the symptoms of a seizure?,"'Most episodes of seizures last around 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. If they last longer than 5 minutes, it’s a medical emergency. The signs and symptoms are involuntary and the severity varies depending on the type of seizure.''Seizures are broadly classified into focal and generalized.' Focal seizures: This is when there is abnormal brain activity in one particular part of the brain.Focal seizures with loss of awareness/consciousness: This presents with blank staring and repetitive movements like chewing with loss of awareness/consciousness.Focal seizures without loss of consciousness: This presents with a change in taste, smell, or emotions, jerking of the hands or legs, giddiness, and flashes of light. Focal seizures with loss of awareness/consciousness: This presents with blank staring and repetitive movements like chewing with loss of awareness/consciousness. Focal seizures without loss of consciousness: This presents with a change in taste, smell, or emotions, jerking of the hands or legs, giddiness, and flashes of light. Generalized seizures: These seizures involve all areas of the brain. The following are different types of generalized seizures and their symptomsAbsence seizures (petit mal seizures): Staring blankly into space or body movements like smacking lips and loss of awareness.Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures): This is the most dramatic type of seizures, with body stiffness, jerking, tongue biting, loss of bladder control, vomiting, and even loss of consciousness.Myoclonic seizures: Sudden jerking or twitching of the arms and legs.Dravet syndrome (formerly called Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI): is a rare, genetic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy characterized by prolonged and frequent seizures. Infants may also have behavioral and developmental delays, problems with movement and balance, speech problems and delayed language development, and growth issues. Mutations in SCN1A gene are seen in about 80% of infants with Dravet.Atonic seizures (drop seizures): Loss of muscle tone, causing a fall. Absence seizures (petit mal seizures): Staring blankly into space or body movements like smacking lips and loss of awareness. Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures): This is the most dramatic type of seizures, with body stiffness, jerking, tongue biting, loss of bladder control, vomiting, and even loss of consciousness. Myoclonic seizures: Sudden jerking or twitching of the arms and legs.Dravet syndrome (formerly called Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI): is a rare, genetic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy characterized by prolonged and frequent seizures.

What Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'"" with medication. But they aren't effective for about 30% of patients. In some cases, brain surgery may be an option.""'Epilepsy'' surgery is an operation on the brain to control ''seizures'"" and improve the person's quality of life. There are two main types of ""'epilepsy'' surgery:''Surgery is considered only if the area of the brain where the seizures start, called the ''seizure'' focus, can be clearly identified, and if the area to be removed is not responsible for any critical functions, such as language, sensation and movement. Extensive evaluation and testing are necessary to determine if surgery is appropriate.' Surgery to remove the area of the brain producing seizures. Surgery to interrupt the nerve pathways through which seizure impulses spread within the brain."
Who Is a Candidate for Epilepsy Surgery?,"""Surgery may be an option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are disabling and/or are not controlled by medication, or when the side effects of medication are severe and greatly affect the person's quality of life. Patients with other serious medical problems, such as ""'cancer'' or ''heart disease'', usually are not considered for epilepsy surgery.' "
What Surgical Options Are Available?,"'Different surgical procedures are available to treat epilepsy. The type of surgery used depends on the type of seizures and the area of the brain where the seizures start. The surgical options include:' Lobe resection: The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is located within the temporal lobe, is the most common type of epilepsy in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away, to remove the seizure focus. The anterior (front) and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are the areas most often involved. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy: This is surgery to remove isolated brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect such as a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that are responsible for seizure activity. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. 
 Corpus callosotomy: The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain. A corpus callosotomy is an operation in which all or part of this structure is cut, disabling communication between the hemispheres and preventing the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. This procedure, sometimes called split-brain surgery, is for patients with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and potentially serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy: This is a variation of a hemispherectomy, a radical procedure in which one entire hemisphere, or one half of the brain, is removed. With a functional hemispherectomy, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only a limited area of brain tissue is removed. This surgery generally is limited to children younger than 13 years old who have one hemisphere that is not functioning normally. Multiple subpial transection (MST): This procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact."
How Effective Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The effectiveness varies, depending on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. For others, the frequency of seizures is significantly reduced. In some cases, surgery may not be successful and a second surgery (re-operation) may be recommended. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more after surgery. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
What Are the Risks of Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The risks of epilepsy surgery include:' Risks associated with surgery: These include infection and bleeding, as well as the risk of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. Risk of neurological deficits: Surgery can worsen existing problems or create new problems with the way the brain functions. Neurological deficits include loss of functions such as vision, speech, memory or movement. Risk of surgery failure: Even with careful pre-surgical evaluation, surgery may not eliminate or reduce seizures. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure."
Re-operations,"'In some cases, isolated seizures may occur immediately following surgery. This does not necessarily mean the operation was not successful. Occasionally, a second operation, or re-operation, is needed to remove brain tissue that is later found to be a source of seizure activity.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is epilepsy?,"'An epileptic ''seizure'' is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of an abnormal activity of the brain. Epileptic ''seizures'' are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute ''trauma'' to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In other words, epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures. '  "
What are the different types of clinical seizures?,"'There are different ''types of seizures'', which traditionally have been categorized as either generalized seizures or partial seizures. Generalized seizures are those in which the clinical manifestations indicate that the whole brain is involved from the beginning of the seizure. Partial seizures (local, focal) are those in which the epileptic event is limited to one part of the body or to a particular function of the brain, indicating that the epileptic seizure started in one limited area of the brain. Partial seizures may remain focal or may expand to the rest of the brain. When seizures expand to the rest of the brain these are referred to as secondary generalized seizures. Consciousness is always impaired in generalized seizures; however, in the case of partial seizures consciousness may be preserved , as in the so-called simple partial seizures, or it may be impaired, as is the case with the complex partial seizures.''Among the generalized seizures, the ''generalized tonic clonic seizure'' (traditionally recognized as a ''grand mal'' seizure) is the most common type. In this seizure there is a succession of muscle contractions (tonic component), more obvious in the extremities but affecting almost every muscle of the body, followed by sudden relaxation (clonic component) and further followed by another tonic component. This succession of events is repeated several times.''Simultaneously, there are other signs and symptoms including dilatation of the pupils, increased ''heart'' rate, and increased ''blood pressure''. ''Cyanosis'' (skin and lips ''turning blue''-purple) is also seen due to persistent contraction of the ''diaphragm'' muscle and holding of the breath. These convulsions are usually followed by a period of ''confusion''. In most instances these seizures, as well as most of the epileptic seizures, last for a few seconds or at the most for 2-3 minutes. Occasionally the seizure event may be prolonged, lasting several minutes. By definition, when the event lasts more than 30 minutes, it is described as status epilepticus.''Another type of generalized seizure is the '' ''absence seizure'', also called petit mal seizure, because the clinical symptoms are not as dramatic as with the generalized tonic clonic seizures. In the absence seizures, as the name implies, the patient looks absent, like ""not being here."" With this type of seizure there is a sudden interruption of activities, and the patient becomes unresponsive. Usually these seizures, particularly when they last longer than a few seconds, are associated with other subtle clinical signs such as eye blinking or twitching in the face or upper body. There is almost no confusion after these seizures, and the patient returns to his/her activities without even acknowledging that a seizure has occurred.''In the ''atonic seizures'' (drop attacks) there is a sudden loss of muscle activity, like a sudden ''paralysis''. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. If these seizures happen when the individual is ''walking'', a fall will result, or if the patient is seated, he/she will experience a sudden drop of the head, usually without the motor reflexes that help people to prevent injuries. These seizures are very brief and might result in serious injuries, most often to the forehead, mouth, and/or face.''The ''myoclonic seizures'' consist of rapid, jerky contractions of isolated muscles or group of muscles which may or may not result in body movements.''The ''tonic seizures'' consist of a brief stiffening of the muscle groups, resulting most often in extension of the arms or legs or arching of the trunk. Some of these seizures might be associated with a forced ''exhalation'' of air, due to a sudden contraction of the expiratory muscle through partially contracted vocal cords, resulting in a loud sound.''With partial (focal, local) seizures, the clinical events originate in a limited area of the brain. The clinical manifestations depend upon the area of the brain that is abnormal. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure.''For example, with simple partial seizures (consciousness is not impaired) if the focal area of the brain involved is the motor area, the patient might have rhythmic contractions in one arm or leg. If the areas compromised are more involved with the visual system then the patient might complain of visual illusions.''Other abnormal sensations might be the result of lesions in the auditory, olfactory, or gustatory areas. Some other symptoms might include:''These patients are conscious when the symptoms occur, and their description of the symptoms can be very useful in determining which area of the brain is involved in the seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery.''The complex partial seizures (sometimes called ""temporal lobe seizures"" or ""psychomotor seizures""), in which consciousness is impaired, have a greater range of symptoms. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language.' epigastric pain, sweating, pallor (paleness), flushing, pupillary dilatation, a sense of ""déjá vu,"" fear or anger."
What causes epilepsy in children?,"'Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy.''For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of ''brain damage'' that occurred after birth.''The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. Alternatively, congenital epilepsy may be the result of factors that interfere with the development of the brain during gestation, resulting in brain malformations.''In acquired epileptic disorders, the damage might occur at the time of birth, for example the case of newborns that have oxygen deprivation during ''labor and delivery''; or intracranial bleeding, as seen in some children born prematurely. Also, the brain damage may occur any time after birth. For example, epilepsy could be a complication of infections in the brain (meningitis, ''encephalitis''), head injuries with brain damage, ''brain tumors'', or intracranial bleeding.' "
Are seizures bad for children?,"'Presently there is no indication that short-lasting seizures will result in any brain damage. However, prolonged seizures, especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in some cases could result in brain damage, but this is very unusual. ''Although brain damage is not likely, children can be injured at the time of the seizures. For example, in the atonic seizures there is a sudden loss of muscle power and, if this happens when the patient is standing, it is followed by a fall that might result in injuries to the face and/or mouth. Similar types of physical injuries can happen with other seizures.' "
How is epilepsy treated?,"'The main line of treatment is with antiepileptic ''drugs'', which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. There are several antiepileptic medications. Since certain medications are much better for some seizures, the choice of the medication should be made by a physician who is familiar with these medications. If possible, the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. If this is not feasible, usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral.''When antiepileptic drugs fail to control the seizures, the patients may improve with surgical procedures.' "
Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'Surgery is indicated in a small group of children.''It usually takes the failure of two or three antiepileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. In general, this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. The failure might be due:'""Since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with antiepileptic medications, surgery should be considered. Young age is not a contraindication for surgery, and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery, the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. There is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. This plasticity is higher in younger than in older children."" to a resistance to the antiepileptic medications that are available, to the presence of intolerable side effects to the antiepileptic medication, or a combination of both."
What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'As previously mentioned, surgery is only preferred once it is clear that the child is resistant to or does not respond well to antiepileptic medications. Many tests are used to make this determination.''Electroencephalograms (''EEG'') are very important in determining the type of epileptic seizures as well as the area of the brain that is responsible for the seizure disorder. When the routine EEG (usually one hour long) does not give enough information, the child might need to be hospitalized (usually in special EEG wards) for a prolonged EEG with video monitoring. During the hospital admission (which may last several days) the EEG is recorded continuously throughout the entire day. The goal is to record epileptic events for further analysis. In some children it is necessary to stop the antiepileptic medications while the child is in the hospital to facilitate the emergence of an epileptic event. ''Neuroimaging studies are very important to help determine the presence of ''brain lesions''. A ''CT scan'' and an ''MRI'', in some cases, might be helpful to point to the specific area of the brain that is abnormal. These tests are very effective to identify developmental abnormalities, ''brain tumors'', ''scars'' due to prior bleeding events, or the presence of ''vascular malformations'' that might be responsible for the epileptic seizures. ''In some children, functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or ictal SPECT (an SPECT obtained at the time of the epileptic event) might also be indicated in order to determine the area of the brain to be excised.''In some cases the localization of the epileptogenic area requires invasive monitoring. In these children, electrodes that record the brain activity are placed either inside the brain (intracerebral electrodes) or directly on top of the brain (subdural electrodes). This procedure may be done at the time of the surgery or days before, in which case it requires a small operation and admission to the hospital for several days for continuous EEG recording. ''Resective surgery (removing specific areas of brain tissue) may result in functional deficits. The functional deficits relate to the area of the brain involved in the surgery. For example, operations near the motor area might result in motor paralysis; surgery in the posterior area of the brain (the occipital lobe) might result in visual deficiencies. Of particular importance is the surgery that is performed in or near the temporal lobe which, among other functions, is responsible for language comprehension and memory. In such cases a special test, called the WADA test, is performed to ensure that removal of the local lesion does not result in severe memory or language functional deficits.''Once the evaluation is completed the team will decide if the patient is a viable candidate for surgery and in that case, what type of surgery is indicated. ''It is worthwhile to mention that not all of the above-mentioned tests are necessary in all patients. ' "
Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery?,"'The actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. However, prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. Most of these teams are in large academic medical centers with affiliations to medical schools. The team will tailor the surgery for each child on an individual basis.' "
What are the types of epilepsy surgery?,"'The following are the surgical interventions that are performed to control epileptic disorders. These procedures can be done directly on the brain, (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), or by implanting a stimulator of the vagus nerve in the neck (vagal nerve stimulation). ' In resective surgery the part of the brain that causes the seizures is removed.  In corpus callosotomy   the major connection between the two sides of the brain is severed (cut). Vagus nerve stimulation is a procedure in which a small wire is attached to the vagus nerve in the neck. This wire is used to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve. "
Resective epilepsy surgery,"""Resective surgery is the best indication for those children with epilepsy that is resistant to the antiepileptic medications and in whom a focal area of the brain was identified as the cause of the seizures. Most of these children have focal seizures rather than generalized seizures. In this procedure, the portion of the child's cerebral cortex that is causing seizures is removed. In some children the epileptic area is restricted to one discrete area of the brain, for example the temporal lobe; in other children several areas of the brain might be involved. The type and the extent of the surgery depends upon the size and location of the epileptogenic area. When the lesion is very discrete, a small area of the brain might be removed, a procedure known as partial lobectomy. If the lesion is more extensive, the child might need a bigger resection, known as multilobar resection. In some extreme cases a full half of the brain might need to be removed, known as a hemispherectomy.""'Since resective surgery will result in the elimination of an area of the brain that might still be functioning before the operation is performed, it must be determined that the area in question can be removed without unacceptable problems, such as a loss of language capacity or a severe motor (movement) insufficiency.''In some children resective surgery could be the most effective form of treatment. For example, in children with mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition in which there is a well-localized lesion in the temporal lobe, the resection of the lesion can result in up to 80% of patients being seizure-free. Fifty percent of children with extensive malformations involving one hemisphere may be seizure-free after hemispherectomy. ''In general, for the selective group of children with well-localized lesions, resective surgery will be beneficial in most of them. ' "
Corpus callosotomy,"'The corpus callosum is a structure composed of nerve fibers that allows for communication between both sides of the brain. Corpus callosotomy consist of cutting the corpus callosum. In partial callosotomy, one section of the corpus callosum is cut, whereas in total callosotomy the whole length of the corpus callosum is cut. Since the fibers that go from one half of the brain to the other half are cut, the communication between the two halves of the brain is impaired. This is precisely the goal of the callosotomy. By limiting the communication between the two sides of the brain the callosotomy prevents the rapid spreading of the epileptic event from one half of the brain to the other.''The indication for this operation is rather limited, mostly to children who have frequent drop attacks, and at the present time is not frequently performed.' "
Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS),"'The vagus nerve is a nerve that connects the brain with several internal organs such as the ''lungs'', heart, stomach, and other organs. Stimulation of the vagus nerve sends information to the brain. Studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve results in an inhibition of seizure activity. However, the reasons for this improvement are not clear.''The vagus nerve stimulator (''VNS'') is a device that consists of a wire attached to an electrical stimulator. The wire is wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck, and the electrical stimulator is implanted in a pouch under the skin in the upper chest. The stimulator is programmed to send electrical signals continuously. The strength and the frequency of the electrical stimulation is adjusted as needed by professionals with special training in this technique. Additionally, the system has a magnetic hand-held device that can be used by the patient. Patients who can recognize the beginning of their seizures, for example those who have auras, can use this device to activate the system and abort the seizure. Also, since the stimulator can be activated at any time, if needed, it could be useful to shorten long-lasting seizures and also in the ''prevention'' of status epilepticus.''VNS seems to be effective in a variety of ''seizure disorders'' and epileptic syndromes. It has also proven to be effective in epileptic disorders that are resistant to antiepileptic treatment. Studies show that in many individuals with refractory seizures, VNS significantly reduced seizure activity, and some people have been rendered seizure-free.''VNS is indicated in children with epileptic disorders resistant to medication that are not candidates for surgery.''In the USA, VNS is approved for children older than 12 years of age; however, there is no age limit in the European Union. ''Potential side effects of VNS implantation are those from general anesthesia, the failure of the implant to work and infection at the implant site. Additionally, stimulation of the vagus nerve may cause ''hoarseness'', ''coughing'', and may even change the heart rate. Because the VNS is implanted outside the skull, there is little possibility of additional neurological damage.' "
What are the risks of epilepsy surgery?,"'Some of the risks associated with epilepsy surgery are related to the presurgical evaluation. Some of the tests performed require the use of contrast material that might result in severe ''allergic'' reactions. Implanting electrodes in the brain or placing electrodes on the surface of the brain for continuous monitoring requires surgical procedures that are not very complicated but may be associated with bleeding or infections.''Many tests, as well as the different surgical procedures, require the use of heavy sedation or general anesthesia. General anesthesia has a very small risk of death. ''There are several risks inherent to the surgery, for example, bleeding inside the brain. Bleeding inside the brain might result in additional brain damage, besides; the accumulation of blood might increase the pressure inside the cranium resulting in severe complications, including death. Also the operation may be complicated by infections that can result in meningitis. A later complication of these events could be the development of ''hydrocephalus'', which may require another surgical procedure.''As described before, resective surgery implies the removal of a piece of the brain that in some instances could be as much as the whole hemisphere. This resective surgery may aggravate prior functional deficits or may result in new ones. These complications may occur even after very careful evaluation. ''The range of complications varies with the extent of the surgery and the area removed. For example:''In the particular case of the callosotomy, since there is some degree of disconnection between the right and the left side of the brain, besides the complications already mentioned, some annoying subtle deficiencies may be experienced. For example, some patients may be able to identify, by visual recognition, objects presented to one side of the brain, but might not be able to name them because the memory of the name is in the other side of the brain. In general there are fewer complications with callosotomies than with resective surgery.''Yet, as in the case with all surgeries, there is always the risk of failure. In the case of epilepsy surgery this means recurrence of the epileptic seizures after the operation. Depending upon the type of pre-existing lesion, the failure rate may be as high as 50%. However, even in these cases, the seizures may be easily controlled with medications after the surgery.''In general there are very few complications observed after surgery. A small percentage of children who have had epilepsy surgery experience complications, and even fewer have neurological complications. Mortality (death) is very rare.''As previously mentioned, there is plasticity in the brain of young children, mostly up to the age of 7 to 9 years. The plasticity helps in the recovery of deficits that can be the result of surgery. For example, for children in whom the language areas were affected by the surgery there is remarkable recovery of language functions. Therefore, young children with intractable seizures who are candidates for surgery are much better off when the surgery is done sooner than later. ''Previous contributing medical author: Harley I. Kornblum, MD, PhD'  operations near the motor areas might result in paralysis or weakness in the arms or legs, or loss of fine motor coordination in the hands;  operations near the language areas might result in language disorders;  operations near the cortical visual areas might result in visual deficits."
What Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Sometimes brain ''seizures'' begin in a vital area of the brain -- for example, in areas that control movement, feeling, language, or memory. When this is the case, a relatively new ''epilepsy treatment'' called multiple subpial transection (MST) may be an option. MST stops the ''seizure'' impulses by cutting nerve fibers in the outer layers of the brain (''gray matter''), sparing the vital functions concentrated in the deeper layers of brain tissue (white matter).' "
Who Is a Candidate for Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'' with medication. However, about 20% of people with ''epilepsy'' do not improve with ''drugs''. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be recommended.''MST may be an option for people who do not respond to medication and whose seizures begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. In addition, there must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery. MST may be done alone or with the removal of a section of brain tissue (resection). MST also may be used as a treatment for children with ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'' (LKS), a rare childhood brain disorder which causes seizures and affects the parts of the brain that control speech and comprehension.' "
What Happens Before Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Candidates for MST undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including ''seizure'' monitoring, electroencephalography (''EEG''), ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the area in the brain where the seizures occur and determine if surgery is feasible.'""Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures as they occur, while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures."" "
What Happens During Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (""Crani"" refers to the skull and ""otomy"" means ""to cut into."") After the patient is put to ''sleep'' with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts his or her surgical instruments. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during pre-surgical brain imaging to help identify the area of abnormal brain tissue and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions.''Using a surgical microscope to produce a magnified view of the brain, the surgeon makes a series of parallel, shallow ''cuts'' (transections) in gray matter, just below the pia mater (subpial), the delicate membrane that surrounds the brain (it lies beneath the dura). The cuts are made over the entire area identified as the source of the seizures. After the transactions are made, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using ''stitches'' or staples.' "
What Happens After Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'After MST, the patient generally stays in an intensive care unit for 24 to 48 hours and in a regular hospital room for three to four days. Most people who have MST will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. Most patients will continue to take anti-seizure medication. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST results in satisfactory improvement in seizure control in about 70% of patients, although the procedure is still relatively new, and no long-term outcome data are available. Children with LKS or other forms of ''epilepsy'' not controlled by medication may have improved intellectual and psychosocial functioning following MST.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The following side effects may occur after MST, although they generally go away on their own over several weeks:' Scalp numbness. Nausea. Feeling tired or depressed. Headaches. Difficulty speaking, remembering, or finding words."
What Risks Are Associated With Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The risks associated with MST include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia. Failure to relieve seizures. Swelling in the brain. Damage to healthy brain tissue."
EEG Introduction,"'An EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a test that can help diagnose ''epilepsy'"". During an EEG, the electrical signals of the brain are recorded. This electrical activity is detected by electrodes, or sensors, placed on the patient's ""'scalp'' and transmitted to a polygraph that records the activity.''Electrical signals produced by the brain neurons are picked up by the electrodes and transmitted to a polygraph, where they produce separate graphs on moving paper using an ink writing pen or on a computer screen.' "
How Do I Prepare For an EEG?,"'To prepare for your EEG you should:''Discuss any medications you are taking with your doctor prior to your procedure.''Wash your hair the night before the test. Do not use hair cream, oils, or spray afterward.' "
What Happens During the EEG?,"'During an EEG, you lie down on the examining table or bed while about 20 electrodes are attached to your scalp. You are asked to relax and lie first with your eyes open, then later with them closed. You may be asked to breathe deeply and rapidly or to stare at a flashing light -- both of these activities produce changes in the brain-wave patterns. If you are prone to ''seizures'', it is rare that you may experience one during the test. If you are being evaluated for a ''sleep'' disorder, EEG may be performed continuously during the night while you are asleep. Such a recording, which may involve an evaluation of other body functions during ''sleep'', such as ''respiration'' and pulse, is referred to as polysomnography.' "
What Happens After an EEG?,"'When the EEG is done, the electrodes are removed and the glue that held them in place is washed away with acetone. You may have to use additional acetone at home to completely remove the glue. Unless you are actively having ''seizures'' or are restricted by your doctor, you may drive home. If the EEG was performed overnight, you should arrange to have someone drive you home. If you stopped taking anticonvulsant ''drugs'' for the EEG, you can usually start taking them again.''A ''neurologist'' examines the EEG recording for abnormalities in the brain-wave pattern, which may reflect diseases of the nervous system.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What Are the Treatments for Epilepsy?,"'The majority of epileptic ''seizures'' are controlled through drug therapy, particularly anticonvulsant ''drugs''. The type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors including the frequency and severity of the ''seizures'"" as well as the person's age, overall health, and medical history. An accurate diagnosis of the type of ""'epilepsy'' is also critical to choosing the best treatment.' "
Drug Therapy,"'Many drugs are available to treat ''epilepsy'', several of which have only recently been released.''Older medications used to treat ''epilepsy'' include:''Newer drugs to treat epilepsy include:''In general, for a given type of epilepsy there are only minor differences among appropriate drugs. The choice is most often based on other factors specific to each patient, such as which side effects can be tolerated by the patient, other illnesses they may have, and which delivery method is acceptable.''Although the different types of epilepsy vary greatly, in general, medications can control seizures in about 70% of patients.' Dilantin or Phenytek Phenobarbital Tegretol or Carbatrol Mysoline Zarontin Depakene Depakote, Depakote ER Valium and similar tranquilizers such as Tranxene and Klonopin Felbatol Gabitril Keppra Lamictal Lyrica Neurontin Topamax Trileptal Zonegran"
Side Effects of Epilepsy Drugs,"'Before any epilepsy drug is prescribed, your health care provider will discuss with you the potential benefits, side effects, and risks.''As is true of all drugs, the drugs used to treat epilepsy have side effects. The occurrence of side effects depends on the dose, type of medication, and length of treatment. The side effects are usually more common with higher doses but tend to be less severe with time as the body adjusts to the medication. Anti-epileptic drugs are usually started at lower doses and increased gradually to make this adjustment easier.''There are three types of side effects:''Common or predictable side effects.'' These are generic, nonspecific, and dose-related side effects which occur with any epilepsy drug because it affects the central nervous system. These side effects include blurry or ''double vision'', ''fatigue'', sleepiness, unsteadiness, as well as stomach upset.''Idiosyncratic side effects.'' These are rare and unpredictable reactions which are not dose-related. Most often, these side effects are skin ''rashes'', low blood cell counts, and ''liver'' problems.''Unique side effects.'' These are those that are not shared by other drugs in the same class. For example, Dilantin or Phenytek can cause the gums to swell and Depakene can cause ''hair loss''. Your doctor will discuss any unique side effects before prescribing the medication.' "
How Long Epilepsy Treatment Lasts,"'In some types of epilepsy, patients can be taken off treatment after a few years, while other types of epilepsy require life-long treatment. With few exceptions, patients who are ''seizure''-free for a certain period should be reevaluated to determine whether the drug can be discontinued. How long the ''seizure''-free period should be varies among the types of epilepsy and is controversial even for a given type. The decision to discontinue a medication also depends on more than the length of the seizure-free period.''What is clear, however, is that epilepsy drugs should at least be considered for discontinuation in patients who are seizure-free for 10 years. If a medication is going to be discontinued, it should be weaned gradually to avoid triggering a seizure.' "
Surgery for Epilepsy,"'Most patients with epilepsy do not require surgery. However, if seizures are not controlled after a trial of two or three medications (usually accomplished within two years) then re-evaluation is suggested. This information is critical in deciding if ''epilepsy surgery'' is an option. Of the 30% of patients whose seizures cannot be controlled with drugs, approximately one third (more than 100,000 in the U.S.) may be candidates for epilepsy surgery. However, only about 3,000 epilepsy surgeries are performed annually.''Before surgery is considered, a comprehensive presurgical exam is performed. This evaluation is performed to ensure that the operation will likely improve the seizures and that it will not cause damage to essential functions such as speech and memory. The evaluation requires prolonged ''EEG''-video monitoring and other tests to pinpoint the exact location of the injured brain cells causing the seizures. The location of the damaged cells determines whether the surgery can be performed and what technique should be used.''The multidisciplinary evaluation is directed by a ''neurologist'"" specializing in epilepsy (an epileptologist). A patient's eligibility for surgery is determined jointly by the neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, neuropsychologist, social worker, and epileptologist. The decision to have the surgery is made jointly by the patient and the epileptologist after carefully reviewing the risks and benefits of the procedure.""'Surgery is most commonly performed to treat partial epilepsy, since only one area of the brain is involved. During surgery, the area of the brain that triggers the seizures (usually a portion of the anterior temporal lobe) is removed. After surgery, some patients will be completely free of seizures; in others, the seizures will be better controlled. A few patients may need additional surgery.''Other surgical approaches are reserved for specific types of epilepsy and are most often performed in young children. One approach is to remove a large part of one side of the brain (a hemispherectomy); another is to cut the nerve fibers connecting the two sides of the brain (a corpus callosotomy).' "
Other Epilepsy Treatment Options,"'The ''ketogenic diet'' has received much attention lately and is effective for treating certain types of epilepsy. Specifically, it is used most frequently in children with seizures that have not responded to medical therapy. However, the ''diet'' requires careful planning and may be difficult to follow, so it is usually not recommended in older children or adults. The ''diet'' is usually started in the hospital, and when successful, it is most often maintained for two to three years.''A relatively new treatment involves electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve. This treatment requires minor surgery to implant a stimulator, which is about the size of a silver dollar. The stimulator is placed under the skin in the upper chest, like a ''pacemaker''. The treatment appears to be effective for seizures that do not respond well to medications alone. The degree of effectiveness of the vagus nerve stimulator is approximately the same as medication. ''Vagus nerve stimulation'' decreases seizure numbers by half or more in 40% to 50% of patients, but rarely eliminates all seizures. Almost all patients need to continue taking medications after the stimulator has been placed, although many people can take fewer drugs.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is an episiotomy?,'An episiotomy is an incision made between the vagina and the rectum in order to increase the size of the opening of the vagina and facilitate the\xa0''delivery of a baby''.' 
How common is episiotomy?,"'\tAn episiotomy is performed in a large percentage of vaginal deliveries in the United States, but the prevalence of episiotomy has been decreasing in recent years.\xa0Some countries have significantly lower episiotomy rates than the U.S. In general, episiotomy is less common in Europe than in the U.S.' "
How is an episiotomy done?,'The usual cut (incision) for an episiotomy goes straight down and typically does not involve the muscles around the rectum or the rectum itself. Anesthesia in the form of ''nerve blocks'' or local injections of anesthetic  are given if the patient has not received regional anesthesia (such an epidural) for the delivery.' 
What are the advantages of an episiotomy?,"'An episiotomy can decrease the amount of pushing the mother must do during delivery. It can also decrease ''trauma'' to the vaginal tissues and expedite delivery of the baby when delivery must be accomplished expiditiously. Doctors who favor episiotomies argue that a surgical incision is easier to repair than a spontaneous irregular or extensive tear, and is likely to lead to a more favorable outcome with fewer complications.' "
How is an episiotomy repaired?,'The repair is straightforward and is fairly simple to perform. The incision is repaired by suturing (sewing) the ''wound'' together.' 
"What are the possible complications of an episiotomy, and should an episiotomy be part of a routine delivery?","'Episiotomy can be associated with extensions or tears into the muscle of the rectum or even the rectum itself. Other complications can include:''Studies have shown conflicting results regarding the question of whether performing an episiotomy results in greater postpartum ''pain'' than not performing the procedure.''However, it is important to note that if the baby needs to be delivered more urgently, then waiting for the mother to push it out without the assistance of an episiotomy may in certain cases cause harm to the fetus. Also, there are some tears that occur when no incision is made that are very difficult to repair and cause greater blood loss than might otherwise occur.''The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the position of restricted, instead of routine, use of episiotomy. Instead, episiotomy should be considered in certain situations when there is a high risk of severe lacerations or the need to facilitate rapid delivery of a fetus.'   bleeding, infection, swelling, defects in wound closure, localized pain, and sexual dysfunction (usually transient)."
What is the healing time for an episiotomy?,'The typical healing time for an episiotomy is around 4 to 6 weeks depending on the size of the incision and the type of suture material used to close the wound.' 
What is erythropoietin (EPO)?,"'Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced by the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow.''The kidney cells that make erythropoietin are sensitive to low oxygen levels in the blood that travels through the kidney. These cells make and release erythropoietin when the oxygen level is too low. A low oxygen level may indicate a diminished number of red blood cells (''anemia''), or ''hemoglobin'' molecules that carry oxygen through the body.'  "
What does erythropoietin do? Why do we need it?,"'Erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The resulting rise in ''red cells'' increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.'""As the prime regulator of red cell production, erythropoietin's major functions are to:""'Chemically, erythropoietin a protein with an attached ''sugar'' (a glycoprotein). It is one of a number of similar glycoproteins that serve as ''stimulants'' for the growth of specific types of blood cells in the bone marrow.' Promote the development of red blood cells. Initiate the synthesis of hemoglobin, the molecule within red blood cells that transports oxygen."
What organ produces erythropoietin?,'Erythropoietin is produced to a lesser extent by the ''liver''. Only about 10% of erythropoietin is produced in the liver. The erythropoietin gene has been found on human chromosome 7 (in band 7q21). Different DNA sequences flanking the erythropoietin gene act to control liver versus kidney production of erythropoietin.' 
Why is an erythropoietin test performed?,"'The erythropoietin hormone can be detected and measured in the blood. An abnormal level of erythropoietin in the blood can indicate bone marrow disorders, (such as ''polycythemia'', or increased red blood cell production) ''kidney disease'', or erythropoietin abuse. Testing erythropoietin blood levels is of value if:'   Too little erythropoietin might be responsible for too few red blood cells (anemia), especially anemia related to kidney disease. Too much erythropoietin might be causing too many red blood cells (polycythemia). Too much erythropoietin might be evidence for a kidney tumor. Too much erythropoietin in an athlete may suggest erythropoietin abuse."
Do I need to fast before an erythropoietin blood test?,"'The patient is usually asked to fast for 8-10 hours (overnight) and sometimes to lie quietly and relax for 20 or 30 minutes before the test. The test requires a routine sample of blood, which is sent to the laboratory for analysis.' "
What are normal erythropoietin levels?,'Normal levels of erythropoietin range from 4 up to 24 mU/ml (milliunits per milliliter).' 
What does an abnormal erythropoietin level mean?,"'Abnormal erythropoietin levels suggest possible disease of the bone marrow or kidneys. Another possibility is abuse by an athlete to increase the ''red cell count'' for better athletic performance. The correct interpretation of an abnormal erythropoietin level depends on the particular clinical situation. Sometimes, the erythropoetin level may be inappropriately normal when it should be elevated (such as when there is an anemia), indicating a problem with the kidneys.' "
Can a person without a medical disease or condition have a high erythropoietin (EPO) level?,"'Yes. For example, erythropoietin has been misused as a performance-enhancing drug in athletes such as cyclists (in the Tour de France), long-distance runners, speed skaters, and Nordic (cross-country) skiers. When misused in such situations, erythropoietin is thought to be especially dangerous (perhaps because ''dehydration'' due to vigorous ''exercise'' can further increase the thickness (viscosity) of the blood, raising the risk for ''blood clots'', ''heart attacks'', and ''strokes''. Erythropoietin has been banned by the Tour de France, the Olympics, and other sports organizations.' "
Is erythropoietin available as a prescribed medication?,"'Yes. Using recombinant DNA technology, erythropoietin has been synthetically produced for use as a treatment for persons with certain types of anemia. Erythropoietin can be used to correct anemia by stimulating red blood cell production in the bone marrow in these conditions. The medication is known as ''epoetin alfa'' (''Epogen'', ''Procrit'') or as darbepoietin alfa (Arnesp). It can be given as an injection intravenously (into a vein) or subcutaneously (under the skin).' "
What diseases or conditions does prescription erythropoietin treat or manage?,"'Erythropoietin is used in many clinical settings. The most common use is in people with anemia (low blood count) related to kidney dysfunction. When the kidneys are not properly functioning, they produce less than normal amounts of erythropoietin, which can lead to low red blood cell production, or anemia. Therefore, by replacing the erythropoietin with an injection of synthetic erythropoietin, anemia related to kidney disease may be treated. Currently, Epogen or Procrit is a standard part of therapy in patients with kidney disease who require ''dialysis'' to both treat and prevent anemia.''Other uses of erythropoietin may include treatment of anemia related to the medication AZT (used to treat ''AIDS''), anemia caused by ''chemotherapy'', anemia caused by dysfunctional bone marrow (where the blood cells are made), and anemia associated with ''cancer''.'  "
Facts you should know about Epstein-Barr virus infections," The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpes virus that is found worldwide and is a common cause of viral pharyngitis (infectious mononucleosis). The cause of an Epstein-Barr infection (mononucleosis) is EBV; risk factors include intimate contacts with body secretions (especially saliva) and objects that may be exposed to body secretions of infected people. The Epstein-Barr virus is contagious and is spread from person to person. EBV is contagious during the incubation period and while symptoms are present; some individuals may be contagious for as long as 18 months. EBV is transmitted from person to person mainly by saliva; however, other body fluids may transmit the disease. Items contaminated with bodily fluids like saliva (toys, utensils, cups, for example) may also transmit the disease. The incubation period for an Epstein-Barr virus infection is about four to seven weeks. The symptoms and signs of an EBV infection may include malaise, fever, muscle aches, headaches, sore throat, lymph node swelling, liver swelling, rash, and spleen swelling. Preliminary diagnosis of EBV infection is based on the patient's history and physical exam; physicians may also use immunological tests that vary in specificity. Treatment of EBV infection is mainly supportive (see home remedies section); some health care providers use cortisone treatment. Home remedies that may help reduce symptoms are rest, fluids, over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications, and avoiding trauma that can further injure organs like a swollen spleen. The possible complications of EBV infection may include an enlarged spleen, jaundice, liver inflammation, anemia, splenic rupture, swollen tonsils, breathing difficulties, rash, irregular heartbeats, and a possible increased risk for cancer. The majority of people with EBV have a good prognosis; a few have a more guarded prognosis. There is no vaccine for EBV, and prevention is difficult. Risk can be reduced by not contacting body fluids from infected individuals and practicing good hand-washing techniques."
What is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)?,"'The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the ''herpes'' virus family (human ''herpesvirus'' 4). EBV is found worldwide and is a common cause of viral ''pharyngitis'', especially in young adults. EBV is transmitted from person to person and then infects human B cells, which in turn spread the infection throughout the entire reticuloendothelial system (RES, or the liver, spleen, and peripheral ''lymph nodes''). About 50% of the population has antibodies to the virus by age 5; about 12% of susceptible adults (college-age) develop antibodies to the virus, and one half of those adults develop the disease termed ''mononucleosis'' (also termed ''infectious mononucleosis'', ''mono'', ''glandular fever'', and kissing disease), which produces symptoms of ''lymph node'', spleen, and liver swelling, ''fever'', inflamed throat, malaise, and ''rash''.' "
What are causes and risk factors for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'The cause of an Epstein-Barr virus infection or ''mono'"" is the infection of circulating B cells by EBV and the body's response to the presence of the virus. Risk factors include"" intimate contact with body secretions (primarily mouth secretions but including other body fluids like those found in the cervix and semen); young age (children, adolescents, and young adults are most often infected); sharing items such as eating utensils, toys, or toothbrushes; rarely, blood transfusions or organ transplants."
Is the Epstein-Barr virus contagious?,"'Yes, the Epstein-Barr virus is contagious and easily passed from person to person mainly by mouth secretions. EBV can be spread by sharing contaminated objects like cups, toothbrushes, or eating utensils.' "
How long is an Epstein-Barr virus infection contagious?,"'An Epstein-Barr virus is contagious during its long incubation period (four to seven weeks, see below) and then until symptoms are gone; however, there is evidence that some people may still spread the virus to others for many months even after symptoms are gone. Some studies indicate that some individuals can be contagious for as long as 18 months.' "
How do people transmit the Epstein-Barr virus?,"'EBV is transmitted mainly through the saliva secreted in the mouth during kissing or sharing items that can pass saliva to other individuals (for example, cups, spoons, straws, and other utensils). There is evidence that semen and the fluid from the cervix may also contain transmittable EBV. The disease is sometimes subclinical (meaning there are no symptoms in the infected individual), and the virus has been transmitted rarely by ''blood transfusion'' and/or organ transplants. In addition, EBV remains in the individual for life and occasionally may become reactivated (the person develops symptoms). If EBV is reactivated, the person becomes contagious. A person may be contagious even during the incubation period (see below).' "
What is the incubation period for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,'The incubation period (time period between initial infection and development of symptoms) for EBV is unusually long. It takes about four to seven weeks for symptoms to develop.' 
What are symptoms and signs of an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'The symptoms and signs of an Epstein-Barr virus infection are as follows:''Symptoms may last about two to four weeks; however, some individuals still feel tired for a few weeks more.'   Malaise or tiredness Fever Muscle aches Headaches Sore throat Rash Lymph node swelling Liver swelling Spleen swelling"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'Many EBV infections are diagnosed simply by the symptoms. However, there are tests for EBV, but they need to be interpreted appropriately. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends the following for EBV testing:''The CDC does not recommend the Monospot test for general use because of both false-positive and false-negative results and because the antibodies detected can be caused by other conditions. However, the test is still used to detect antibodies that are often present in EBV-infected patients about two to nine weeks after EBV infection. It is used as a screening test and is not specific for EBV infection.''The above tests can help differentiate EBV infection from other medical problems (for example, ''chronic fatigue syndrome'' or ''multiple sclerosis'').' Susceptibility to infection: People are considered susceptible to EBV infection if they do not have antibodies to the VCA (viral capsid antigen). Primary (new or recent) infection: People are considered to have a primary EBV infection if they have anti-VCA IgM but do not have antibody to EBNA (EBV nuclear antigen). Other results that strongly suggest a primary infection are a high or rising level of anti-VCA IgG and no antibody to EBNA after at least four weeks of illness. Resolution of the illness may occur before the diagnostic antibody levels appear. In rare cases, people with active EBV infections may not have detectable EBV-specific antibodies. Past infection: The presence of antibodies to both VCA and EBNA suggests past infection (from several months to years earlier). Since over 90% of adults have been infected with EBV, most adults will show antibodies to EBV from infection years earlier. High or elevated antibody levels may be present for years and are not diagnostic of recent infection."
What is the treatment for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for EBV. However, some physicians may use ''corticosteroids'' to reduce ''swelling of tissues'' (for example, swelling in the throat, ''enlarged spleen''). Most of the treatments are designed to reduce symptoms (see home remedies below).'  "
Are there any home remedies for an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'Although home remedies do not cure EBV infections, some provide relief from the symptoms of the disease. The most common home remedies are as follows:''Avoid any potential ''trauma'' (such as sports like football or boxing) because the spleen is especially vulnerable to rupture or laceration until its swelling abates.' Rest Fluids Over-the-counter pain medications (Do not give aspirin to children.)"
What are possible complications of an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,'Possible complications of EBV are as follows:' Enlarged spleen Red spots and/or rash Liver inflammation and/or swelling Jaundice Anemia Splenic rupture Severe swollen tonsils Breathing difficulties (usually due to swollen throat tissue) Irregular heartbeat Possible increased risk for cancer (lymphomas)
What is the prognosis of an Epstein-Barr virus infection?,"'The prognosis for most individuals who are infected with EBV is usually good as most people recover completely without any of the complications described above. If complications develop, the majority of patients usually recover, even if the recovery time is prolonged. Rarely, splenic rupture occurs, which requires surgery and can result in death.' "
Is it possible to prevent an Epstein-Barr virus infection? Is there an EBV vaccine?,"'There is no vaccine available to prevent EBV infections. Individuals can reduce their risk of infection by not using utensils, toys, or other objects used by infected individuals and by practicing good hand-washing techniques. Avoiding contact with any body fluids, especially saliva, may reduce the chance of infection. Prevention is difficult because EBV is widespread in populations and can be transmitted even when an infected person has no symptoms.' "
Facts you should know about ERCP," ERCP is a diagnostic procedure designed to examine diseases of the liver, bile ducts and pancreas. ERCP is usually best performed under general anesthesia. It may be done using IV sedation. There is a low incidence of complications. ERCP can provide important information that cannot be obtained by other diagnostic examinations, for example, abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. Frequently, therapeutic measures can be performed at the time of ERCP to remove stones in the bile ducts or to relieve obstruction of the bile ducts."
What is ERCP?,"'Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is a diagnostic test to examine:''The procedure is performed by using a long, flexible, viewing instrument (a duodenoscope) about the diameter of a pen. The duodenoscope can be directed and moved around the many bends of the stomach and duodenum. The modern duodenoscope uses a thin ''fiber''-optic bundle to transmit light to the tip of the endoscope, and a thin wire with a chip also at the tip of the endoscope to transmit digital video images to a TV screen. The duodenoscope is inserted through the mouth, through the back of the throat, down the food pipe (''esophagus''), through the stomach and into the duodenum. Once the papilla of Vater is identified, a small ''plastic'' catheter (cannula) is passed through an open channel of the endoscope into the opening of the papilla, and into the bile ducts and/or the pancreatic duct. Contrast material (dye) is then injected and ''X-rays'' are taken of the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. Another open channel in the endoscope also allows other instruments to be passed through it in order to perform biopsies, to insert plastic or metal ''stents'' or tubing to relieve obstruction of the bile ducts or pancreatic duct caused by ''cancer'' or scarring, and to perform incisions by using electrocautery (electric heat).''The liver is a large solid organ located beneath the right ''diaphragm''. The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder (a small sac located beneath the liver). After meals, the gallbladder contracts and empties the bile through the cystic duct, into the bile ducts, through the papilla of Vater, and into the intestine to help with ''digestion''. The pancreas is located behind the stomach. It produces a digestive juice that drains through the pancreatic duct, which usually joins the bile duct within the papilla, and then enters the intestine.''An important procedure related to ERCP is endoscopic ''ultrasonography'' which uses a similar endoscope that, in addition to the camera, has an ultrasound probe on its tip to examine the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreatic duct, and pancreas ultrasonographically. Ultrasonographically-directed needle biopsies of the pancreas can be taken through a channel in the endoscope.''A second, newer procedure related to ERCP is the use of miniature endoscopes (Spyglass) that are passed through the operating channel of a duodenoscope and can be inserted directly into the bile and pancreatic ducts. The inside of the ducts can be visualized, and directed biopsies (Spybite) can be taken. Other therapeutic interventions also are possible.'  the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine), the papilla of Vater (a small nipple-like structure with openings leading to the bile ducts and the pancreatic duct), the bile ducts, and the gallbladder and the pancreatic duct."
What kind of preparation is required for ERCP?,"'For the best possible examination, the stomach must be empty. The patient should not eat anything after midnight on the evening preceding the exam. In case the procedure is performed early in the morning, no liquids should be taken. In case the examination is performed at noon time, a cup of tea, juice, milk, or coffee can be taken eight hours earlier. ''Heart'' and ''blood pressure'' medications should always be taken with a small amount of water in the early morning. Since the procedure will require intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, the patient needs to have a companion drive them home after the procedure.' "
What can be expected during and after the ERCP procedure?,"'If done with IV sedation, the patient will be given medications through a vein to cause relaxation and sleepiness. The patient will be given some local anesthetic to decrease the gag reflex. Some physicians do not use local anesthetic and prefer to give the patients more intravenous medications for sedation. This also applies to those patients who have a history of ''allergy'' to ''Xylocaine'' or cannot tolerate the bitter taste of the local anesthetic and the numbness sensation in the throat. While the patient is lying on the left side on the X-ray table, the intravenous medication is given, and then the instrument is inserted gently through the mouth into the duodenum. The instrument advances through the food pipe and not the air pipe. It does not interfere with the ''breathing'' and gagging is usually prevented or decreased by the medication. If using general anesthesia, then the above procedure does not apply.''When the patient is in\xa0a semi-conscious state, they can still follow instructions such as changing the body position on the X-ray table. Once the instrument has been advanced into the stomach, there is minimal discomfort except for the foreign body sensation in the throat. The procedure can last anywhere from fifteen minutes to one hour, depending on the skill of the physician, what needs to be accomplished, and the anatomy or abnormalities in that area. ERCP also may be performed under light, general anesthesia.''After the procedure, patients should be observed in the recovery area until most of the effects from the medications have worn off. This usually takes one to two hours. The patient may feel ''bloated'' or slightly nauseated from the medications or the procedure. Very rarely a patient experiences ''vomiting'', and may belch or pass some ''gas'' through the rectum. Upon discharge, the patient should be driven home by a companion and is advised to stay home for the rest of the day. The patient can resume usual activity the next day. Even though the physician may explain he findings to the patient or companion after the procedure, it is still necessary to follow up with the physician after the procedure to ensure that the patient understands the results of the examination.' "
What are the reasons for ERCP?,"'The liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas and the papilla of Vater can be involved in numerous diseases, causing myriad of symptoms. ERCP is used in diagnosing and treating the following conditions:' Blockage of the bile duct by gallstones, cancer, strictures (scarring) or compression from adjacent organs or tumors Jaundice (yellow coloring of the skin) due to obstruction of the bile duct, also causing darkening of the urine and light colored stool. Persistent or recurrent upper abdominal pain which cannot be diagnosed by other tests such as MRCP/MRI, CT Confirming the diagnosis of cancer of the pancreas or the bile duct, so that surgery or other treatment can be tailored to the disease When there is suspicion that the Sphincter of Oddi within the Papilla of Vater, that controls the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, is not working normally (Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction)"
What are the side effects and risks of the ERCP procedure?,"'ERCP is a highly specialized procedure which requires a lot of experience and skill. The procedure is quite safe and is associated with a very low risk when it is performed by experienced physicians. The success rate in performing this procedure varies from 70% to 95% depending on the experience of the physician. Complications can occur in approximately one to five percent depending on the skill of the physician and the underlying disorder. The most common complication is ''pancreatitis'' which is due to irritation of the pancreas from the dye used to take pictures and can occur even with very experienced physicians. This ""injection"" pancreatitis usually is treated in the hospital for one to two days. Another possible complication is infection. Other serious risks including perforation of the intestine, drug reactions, bleeding, ''depressed'' breathing. Irregular heart beat or ''heart attack'' are extremely rare and is mainly due to the sedation. In case of complications, patients usually need to be hospitalized, but surgery rarely is required.''In summary, ERCP is a straight-forward but skill-requiring outpatient examination that is performed with the patient sedated under IV sedation or general anesthesia. The procedure provides important information upon which specific treatment can be tailored. In certain cases, therapy can be performed at the same time through the duodenoscope, so that traditional open surgery can be avoided. ERCP, combined with endoscopic ultrasonography, is currently the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of choice in most patients for identifying and removing ''gallstones'' in the bile ducts.' "
What is erectile dysfunction (ED)?,"'Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as ''impotence'"", is the inability to achieve or sustain a hard enough erection for satisfactory completion of sexual activity. Erectile dysfunction is different from other health conditions that interfere with male sexual function, such as lack of sexual desire (decreased libido) and problems with ejaculation release of the fluid from the penis (ejaculatory dysfunction) and orgasm/climax (orgasmic dysfunction), and penile curvature (Peyronie's disease), although these problems may also be present. ED affects about 50% of men age 40 and over. This article focuses on the evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction."" "
What is normal penis anatomy?,"'The penis contains three cylinders, the two ''corpora cavernosa'', which are on the top of the penis (see figure 1 below). These two cylinders are involved in erections. The third cylinder contains the urethra, the tube that the urine and ejaculate passes through, runs along the underside of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra. Spongy tissue that has muscles, fibrous tissues, veins, and arteries within it makes up the corpora cavernosa. The inside of the corpora cavernosa is like a sponge, with potential spaces that can fill with blood and distend (known as sinusoids). A layer of tissue that is like Saran Wrap, called the tunica albuginea, surrounds the corpora. Veins located just under the tunica albuginea drain blood out of the penis.' "
How common is erectile dysfunction?,"'Erectile dysfunction (ED, impotence) varies in severity; some cannot have an erection at all, whereas other men sometimes have troubles getting a hard erection, and others get a hard erection but it only lasts for a short period of time. Approximately 50% of men over the age of 40 have troubles with erectile dysfunction.''While erectile dysfunction can occur at any age, the risk of developing erectile dysfunction increases with age. According to the Massachusetts Male ''Aging'' Study, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 52% in men 40-70 years of age. The prevalence of complete erectile dysfunction increases from 5% at 40 years of age to 15% among men 70 years of age and older.'  "
How does erection occur?,"'Erections are neurovascular events, meaning that nerves and blood vessels (arteries and veins) are involved in the process of an erection and all must work properly to develop a hard erection that lasts long enough. Erection begins with sexual stimulation. Sexual stimulation can be tactile (for example, by a partner touching the penis or by ''masturbation'') or mental (for example, by having sexual fantasies, viewing porn). Sexual stimulation or sexual arousal causes the nerves going to the penis to release a chemical, nitric oxide. Nitric oxide increases the production of another chemical, cyclic GMP (cGMP), in the muscle of the corpora cavernosa. The cGMP causes the muscles of the corpora cavernosa to relax, and this allows more blood to flow into the penis. The incoming blood fills the corpora cavernosa, making the penis expand.' "
How does a man sustain an erection?,"'As blood flows into the penis, the corpora cavernosa swell, and this swelling compresses the veins (blood vessels that drain the blood out of the penis) against the tunica albuginea. Compression of the veins prevents blood from leaving the penis. This creates a hard erection. When the amount of cGMP decreases by the action of a chemical called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the muscles in the penis tighten, and the blood flow into the penis decreases. With less blood coming into the penis, the veins are not compressed, allowing blood to drain out of the penis, and the erection goes down.' "
What causes erectile dysfunction?,"'The ability to achieve and sustain erections requires the following:'""Erectile dysfunction can occur if a man doesn't meet one or more of these requirements. The following are 13 common causes of erectile dysfunction, and many men have more than one potential cause:"" 

Read Doctor's View
   A healthy nervous system that conducts nerve impulses in the brain, spinal column, and penis Healthy arteries in and near the corpora cavernosa that when stimulated can bring increased blood flow into the penis Healthy muscles and fibrous tissues within the corpora cavernosa, which can distend to allow the penis to fill with blood Adequate levels of nitric oxide in the penis Normal-functioning tunica albuginea that allows for compression of the veins Appropriate psychosocial interactions Aging: There are two reasons why older men are more likely to experience erectile dysfunction than younger men. First, older men are more likely to develop diseases (such as heart attacks, angina, cardiovascular disease, strokes, diabetes mellitus, and high blood pressure) that are associated with erectile dysfunction. Second, the aging process alone can cause erectile dysfunction in some men by causing changes in the muscle and tissue within the penis. Diabetes mellitus: Erectile dysfunction tends to develop 10 to 15 years earlier in diabetic men than among nondiabetic men. The increased risk of erectile dysfunction among men with diabetes mellitus may be due to the earlier onset and greater severity of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that narrows the arteries and thereby reduces the delivery of blood to the penis. Atherosclerosis can affect the arteries in the penis, as well as the arteries in the pelvis that supply the penile arteries. Diabetes mellitus also causes erectile dysfunction by damaging nerves that go to the penis, much like the effect of diabetes on nerves in other areas of the body (diabetic neuropathy). Diabetes can also affect the muscles in the penis, leading to troubles with erections. Smoking cigarettes, obesity, poor control of blood glucose levels, and having diabetes mellitus for a long time further increase the risk of erectile dysfunction in people with diabetes. Hypertension (high blood pressure): Men with high blood pressure have an increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction. Hypertension can cause trouble with erections related to atherosclerosis or from low levels of nitric oxide production from the arteries in the penis. Medications to treat hypertension may cause erectile dysfunction. Cardiovascular diseases: The most common cause of cardiovascular diseases in the United States is atherosclerosis, the narrowing, and hardening of arteries that reduces blood flow. Atherosclerosis (a type of vascular disease) typically affects arteries throughout the body; hypertension, high blood cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus aggravate atherosclerosis. Hardening of the arteries to the penis and pelvic organs, atherosclerosis, causes insufficient blood flow into the penis. There is a close correlation between the severity of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries and erectile dysfunction. For example, men with more severe coronary artery atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries in the heart) also tend to have more erectile dysfunction than men with mild or no coronary artery atherosclerosis. Some doctors suggest that men with new onset erectile dysfunction undergo evaluation for silent coronary artery diseases (advanced coronary artery atherosclerosis that has not yet caused angina or heart attacks). Metabolic syndrome is associated with multiple risk factors for erectile dysfunction including diabetes, abnormal lipid profile, hypertension, and obesity. Cigarette smoking: Cigarette smoking aggravates atherosclerosis and can cause vasospasm (spasms of the arteries) and thereby increases the risk for erectile dysfunction. Nerve or spinal cord damage: Damage to the spinal cord and nerves in the pelvis can cause erectile dysfunction. Nerve damage can be due to disease, trauma, or surgical procedures. Examples include injury to the spinal cord from automobile accidents, injury to the pelvic nerves from prostate surgery for cancer (prostatectomy), and some surgeries for colorectal cancer, radiation to the prostate, surgery for benign prostatic enlargement, multiple sclerosis (a neurological disease with the potential to cause widespread damage to nerves), and long-term diabetes mellitus. BPH: Benign enlargement of the prostate is associated with erectile dysfunction. Trauma: Trauma to the pelvis, including pelvic fracture, may cause erectile dysfunction, and an untreated penile fracture may result in erectile dysfunction. Substance abuse: Marijuana, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines, crystal meth, and narcotic and alcohol abuse contribute to erectile dysfunction. Alcoholism, in addition to causing nerve damage, can lead to atrophy (shrinking) of the testicles and lower testosterone levels. Low testosterone levels: Testosterone (the primary sex hormone in men) is not only necessary for sex drive (libido) but also is necessary to maintain nitric oxide levels in the penis. Therefore, men with hypogonadism (low testosterone with symptoms) can have a low sex drive and erectile dysfunction. Medications: Many common medicines produce erectile dysfunction as a side effect. Medicines that can cause erectile dysfunction include many used to treat high blood pressure, antihistamines, antidepressants, tranquilizers, and appetite suppressants. Examples of common medicines that can cause erectile dysfunction include propranolol (Inderal) or other beta-blockers, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin (Lanoxin), amitriptyline (Elavil), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), metoclopramide (Reglan), naproxen, indomethacin (Indocin), lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), verapamil (Calan, Verelan, Isoptin), phenytoin (Dilantin), gemfibrozil (Lopid), amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall), and phentermine. Prostate cancer medications that lower testosterone levels such as leuprolide (Lupron) may affect erectile function. Some chemotherapies such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) may affect erectile function. Recreational drugs: Recreational drugs, including alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana, nicotine, heroin, and cocaine, are associated with erectile dysfunction. Depression and anxiety: Psychological factors may be responsible for erectile dysfunction. These factors include stress, anxiety, guilt, depression, widower syndrome, low self-esteem, posttraumatic stress disorder, and fear of sexual failure (performance anxiety). It is also worth noting that many medications used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders may cause erectile dysfunction or ejaculatory problems."
What are erectile dysfunction risk factors?,"'The common risk factors for ED include the following:'   Advanced age Cardiovascular disease Hypertension Diabetes mellitus High cholesterol Cigarette smoking Recreational drug use Depression or other psychiatric disorders Pelvic surgery, including radical prostatectomy and colorectal surgery Pelvic radiation, such as for prostate cancer and some colorectal cancers Trauma to the pelvis (pelvic fracture), penis (penile fracture), and perineum"
What are erectile dysfunction symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of erectile dysfunction may include the following:' Penile erection occurs, but the penis does not remain hard enough for completion of sex. Penile erections are not hard enough for penetration. There is an inability to obtain a penile erection. One can still achieve an orgasm and ejaculate with erectile dysfunction."
How do health care professionals diagnose erectile dysfunction?,"'Physicians make a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction in men who complain of troubles having a hard enough erection or a hard erection that does not last long enough. It is important as you talk with your doctor that you be candid in terms of when your troubles started, how bothersome your erectile dysfunction is, how severe it is, and discuss all your medical conditions along with all prescribed and nonprescribed medications that you are taking. Your doctor will ask several questions to determine if your symptoms are suggestive of erectile dysfunction and to assess its severity and possible causes. Your doctor will try to get information to answer the following questions:''The physical examination can reveal clues for physical causes of erectile dysfunction. A doctor will perform an assessment of ''BMI'' and waist circumference to evaluate for abdominal obesity. A genital examination is part of the evaluation of erectile dysfunction. The examination will focus on the penis and testes. The doctor will ask you about penile curvature and will examine the penis to see if there are any plaques (hard areas) palpable. The doctor will examine the testes to make sure they are in the proper location in the scrotum and are normal in size. Small testicles, lack of facial hair, and enlarged breasts (''gynecomastia'') can point to hormonal problems such as hypogonadism with low testosterone levels. A health care provider may check pulses in your groin and ''feet'' to determine if there is a suggestion of hardening of the arteries that could also affect the arteries to the penis.'""The lab testing obtained for the evaluation of erectile dysfunction may vary with the information obtained on the health history, physical examination, and recent lab testing. A testosterone level is not necessary in all men; however, a physician will order labs to determine a patient's testosterone level if other signs and symptoms of hypogonadism (low testosterone) such as decreased libido, loss of body hair, muscle loss, breast enlargement, ""'osteoporosis'', ''infertility'', and decreased penile/testicular size are present.''A doctor may ask for the following laboratory tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction:''Health care professionals do not routinely obtain imaging tests in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction.''Ultrasound'' with Doppler imaging (ultrasound plus evaluation of blood flow in the arteries and veins) can provide additional information about blood flow of the penis and may help in the evaluation of patients prior to surgical intervention. This study is typically performed after the injection of a chemical that causes the arteries to open up, a vasodilator (prostaglandin E1), into the corpora cavernosa in order to cause dilation of blood vessels and promote blood flow into the penis. The rate of blood flow into the penis can be measured along with an evaluation of problems with compression of the veins.''Rarely, a doctor may perform an ''angiogram'' (injecting a dye into the arteries that supply the penis and taking ''X-rays'' to look for areas of narrowing of the arteries) in cases in which possible vascular surgery could be beneficial.''Monitoring erections that occur during sleep (''nocturnal'' penile tumescence) can help you and your doctor to understand if the erectile dysfunction is due to psychological or physical causes. The nocturnal penile tumescence test is a study to evaluate erections at night. Normally men have three to five erections per eight hours of sleep. The test can be performed at home or in a sleep lab. The most accurate way to perform the test involves a special device that is connected to two rings. The rings are placed around the penis, one at the tip of the penis and the other at the bottom (base) of the penis. The device records how many erections occur, how long they last, and how rigid they are. The test is limited in that it does not assess the ability to penetrate.''If there seems to be a psychological cause contributing to your erectile dysfunction, the doctor may ask the patient questions to help determine stressor, events, and relationship issues that may be causing your erectile troubles. It may be helpful to have your sexual partner involved in this assessment.' Is the patient suffering from erectile dysfunction or from some other form of sexual dysfunction such as loss of libido or a disorder of ejaculation (for example, premature ejaculation) or orgasm, or problems with penile curvature/pain (Peyronie's disease)? Is your erectile dysfunction due to psychological (stress, relationship problems, etc.) or physical factors? Your doctor may ask if you note erections at night or in the early morning. Men have involuntary erections in the early morning and during REM sleep (a stage in the sleep cycle with rapid eye movements). Men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction (erectile dysfunction due to psychological factors such as stress and anxiety rather than physical factors) usually maintain these involuntary erections. Men with physical causes of erectile dysfunction (for example, atherosclerosis, smoking, and diabetes) usually do not have these involuntary erections. Men with psychogenic erectile dysfunction may relate the onset of problems to a ""stressor,"" such as failed relationship. Your doctor may suggest a test to determine if you have erections during sleep, which may suggest that there may be a psychological cause of the erectile dysfunction. 3. Are there physical causes of erectile dysfunction? Erectile dysfunction may be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, which if not detected may cause further medical problems. A prior history of cigarette smoking, heart attacks, strokes, and poor circulation in the extremities (for example, intermittent claudication or cramping in your leg[s] when you walk) suggest atherosclerosis as the cause of the erectile dysfunction. Loss of sexual desire and drive, lack of sexual fantasies, gynecomastia (enlargement of breasts), and diminished facial hair suggest low testosterone levels. A prior history of pelvic surgery or radiation and trauma to the penis/pelvis/perineum can cause problems with the nerves and blood vessels. Symptoms of intermittent claudication of the lower extremities with exercise may suggest a vascular problem as a cause of the erectile dysfunction. Is the patient taking medications that can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see causes above), including prescribed, over-the-counter, or recreational drugs? It is important to discuss your prescribed medications, as well as over-the-counter medications and drugs of abuse such as opiates, alcohol, etc. Complete blood counts Urinalysis: A high level of sugar (glucose) in the urine may be a sign of diabetes mellitus, and high protein in the urine may suggest kidney damage, which can cause erectile troubles. Lipid profile: High levels of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood can cause atherosclerosis. Blood glucose levels: Abnormally high blood glucose (sugar) levels may be a sign of diabetes mellitus. Blood hemoglobin A1C: Abnormally high levels of blood hemoglobin A1C in patients with diabetes mellitus indicate that there is poor control of blood glucose levels. Serum creatinine: An abnormal serum creatinine, a chemical that reflects kidney function, may be the result of kidney damage. Liver enzymes and liver function tests: Liver disease (cirrhosis) can cause low testosterone. Thus, a physician may need to test some men for liver disease. Total testosterone levels: Health care professionals should obtain a patient's blood samples for total testosterone levels in the early morning (before 8 a.m.) because the testosterone levels go up and down throughout the day. If you have a low testosterone level, a health care professional should check it again to confirm that it is truly low. In some men, a specialized test measuring the active form of testosterone (free or bioavailable testosterone) may be recommended. Other hormone levels: Measurement of other hormones beside testosterone (luteinizing hormone [LH], prolactin level, and cortisol level) may provide clues to other underlying causes of testosterone deficiency and erectile problems, such as pituitary disease or adrenal gland abnormalities. Doctors may check thyroid levels in some individuals as both hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid function) can contribute to erectile dysfunction. PSA levels: PSA (prostate specific antigen) blood levels and prostate examination to exclude prostate cancer is important before starting testosterone treatment since testosterone can aggravate prostate cancer. Other blood tests: Evaluation for hemochromatosis, lupus, scleroderma, zinc deficiency, sickle cell anemia, and cancers (leukemia, colon cancer) are some of the other potential tests that a physician may perform based on each individual's health history and symptoms."
What drugs treat erectile dysfunction?,"'A number of medical treatment options exist for erectile dysfunction include the following:''A doctor can help decide what medication(s) may be the best for the patient. This is an important step to do so the doctor can help choose the best and safest drug(s) and other treatments so that men with other medical problems can get individualized care appropriate for their medical conditions.' Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors (sildenafil [Viagra], vardenafil [Levitra and the generic formulation Staxyn], tadalafil [Cialis]), and avanafil [Stendra]) Intracavernosal injections (papaverine, phentolamine, and PGE1 [Trimix], Bimix, and alprostadil injection [Caverject, Edex]) Intraurethral suppositories (MUSE) Testosterone in individuals with ED and other signs/symptoms of hypogonadism and an unequivocally low serum testosterone"
What is the treatment for erectile dysfunction?,"'The following are treatment options for erectile dysfunction:''Many common medications for treating hypertension, depression, and high blood ''lipids'' (''high cholesterol'') can contribute to erectile dysfunction (see above). Treatment of hypertension is an example. There are many different types (classes) of ''medications for high blood pressure''; these include beta-blockers, ''calcium channel blockers'', diuretics (medications that increase urine volume), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (''ACE inhibitors''), and angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs''). Patients may use these medications alone or in combination to control blood pressure. Some of these medications can cause troubles with erections. For example, Inderal (a ''beta-blocker'') and hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) cause erectile dysfunction, while calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors do not seem to affect erectile function. On the other hand, other medications (such as angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB] including ''losartan'' [''Cozaar''] and ''valsartan'' [''Diovan'']) may actually help with erections. Therefore, if possible, you may benefit from changing your medications, but this requires approval by your prescribing health care provider.''Quitting smoking, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, curtailing excessive alcohol consumption, controlling hypertension, and optimizing blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes are not only important for maintaining good health but also may improve or even prevent progression of erectile dysfunction. It is unclear if such lifestyle changes can reverse erectile dysfunction. However, lifestyle improvements may prevent progression of the erectile dysfunction. Some studies suggest that men who have made lifestyle improvements experience increased rates of success with oral medications.'

What are erectile dysfunction treatments for men with cardiovascular disease?,"'ED is often the result of atherosclerosis, and as a result, men with ED frequently have cardiovascular disease. Sexual activity is associated with increased physical exertion, which in some men may increase the risk of having a ''heart attack'' (''myocardial infarction'' or MI). The major risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease are age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, abnormal lipid/cholesterol levels in the blood, and lack of ''exercise''. Individuals with three or more of these risk factors are at increased risk for a heart attack during sexual activity. The Princeton Consensus Panel developed guidelines for treating ED in men with cardiovascular disease. Thus, if you have ED and cardiovascular disease (for example, angina or prior heart attack), you should discuss whether or not treatment of ED and sexual activity are appropriate for you.' "
Oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors,"'The common PDE5 inhibitor drugs approved in the United States are sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra and Staxyn, the generic form), tadalafil (Cialis), or avanafil (Stendra). All of the currently approved PDE5 inhibitors work in the same way. They differ in the number of available doses, how quickly they work and last in your system, the dosing, and to some extent in the side effects. However, they generally share the same indications and contraindications. Currently, tadalafil is the only medication that patients can take on a daily basis and is approved for the treatment of both ED and ''BPH'' (benign enlargement of the prostate).''When sexually stimulated there is a release of a chemical, nitric oxide (NO) in the blood vessels of the corpus cavernosum. The NO stimulates the production of a compound called cGMP, which causes relaxation of the smooth muscle in the blood vessels supplying the corpus cavernosum. PDE 5 is an enzyme that breaks down cGMP. By inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP by PDE5, these medications allow cGMP to build up in the penis. cGMP causes muscles in the corpora cavernosa of the penis to relax. When the muscle is relaxed, more blood can flow into the penis and fill the spaces in the penis. As the penis fills with blood, the veins in the penis are compressed, and this results a hard erection. When the effect on PDE5 decreases, the cGMP levels go down and the muscle in the penis contracts, causing less blood to flow into the penis and allowing the veins to open up and drain blood out of the penis.''Some men should not take PDE5 inhibitors. They can cause ''hypotension'' (abnormally ''low blood pressure'' that can lead to ''fainting'' and even ''shock'') when given to patients who are taking ''nitrates'' (medications taken for ''heart disease''). Therefore, patients taking nitrates daily should not take any of the PDE5 inhibitors. Nitrates relieve angina (''chest pain'' due to insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle because of narrowing of the coronary arteries); these include nitroglycerine tablets, patches, ointments, sprays, and pastes, as well as ''isosorbide dinitrate'' and ''isosorbide mononitrate''. Other nitrates such as amyl nitrate and butyl nitrate also are in some recreational drugs called ""poppers.""''If you are taking medications (alpha-blockers) for problems with an ''enlarged prostate'', you should discuss your prostate medications with your doctor. Alpha-blockers also can cause lowering of the blood pressure. Thus your doctor will need to carefully watch your blood pressure when you start the PDE5 inhibitor. Common alpha-blockers include doxazosin (''Cardura''), ''terazosin'' (''Hytrin''), and ''tamsulosin'' (''Flomax'').''PDE 5 inhibitors are broken down primarily by enzyme, cytochrome P450enzyme CYP3A4. Medications that decrease or increase the activity of CYP3A4 may affect levels and effectiveness of PDE 5 inhibitors. Such drugs include medications for the treatment of ''HIV'' (''protease inhibitors'') and the antifungal medications ''ketoconazole'' and ''itraconazole''. Thus caution is recommended.''The various PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of ED share several common side effects, including ''headache'', flushing, ''nasal congestion'', ''nausea'', ''dyspepsia'' (stomach discomfort), and ''diarrhea''. Differences exist in side effects of the different PDE5 inhibitors, and thus it is important to be familiar with the prescribing information of the PDE5 inhibitor you are prescribed.''There have been rare reports of ''priapism'' (prolonged and painful erections lasting more than six hours) with the use of PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Patients with blood cell diseases such as ''sickle cell anemia'', ''leukemia'', and ''multiple myeloma'' have higher than normal risks of developing ''priapism''. Untreated priapism can cause injury to the penis and lead to permanent impotence. Therefore, if your erection lasts four hours, you should seek emergency medical care.''Rare side effects of all PDE5 inhibitors include a sudden ''loss of vision'' in one or both eyes (nonarteritic anterior ischemic ''optic neuropathy'' [NAION]) and sudden loss of ''hearing''. Patients have reported these rare side effects with all of the PDE5 inhibitors. Seek immediate medical care if you develop loss of vision or hearing.''Doctors have not tested the PDE5 inhibitors in patients with ''retinitis pigmentosa'', an eye condition that affects the retina and can cause ''blindness'', and so caution is recommended if you have this health condition.' "
Sildenafil (Viagra),"'Sildenafil (Viagra) was the first oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor approved by the FDA in the United States for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (it is not approved for women). Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, which is an enzyme that destroys cGMP. By inhibiting the destruction of cGMP by PDE5, sildenafil allows cGMP to accumulate. The cGMP in turn prolongs relaxation of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa. Relaxation of the corpora cavernosa smooth muscle allows blood to flow into the penis resulting in increased engorgement of the penis. In short, sildenafil increases blood flow into the penis and decreases blood flow out of the penis.''Sildenafil treats erectile dysfunction of either physical or psychological cause. It is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men with ''coronary artery disease'', diabetes mellitus, hypertension, depression, ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting (''CABG''), and men who are taking antidepressants and several classes of antihypertensives.''In randomized placebo-controlled trials, an estimated 60% of men with diabetes, and 80% of men without diabetes experienced improved erections with sildenafil.'""Sildenafil is available as oral tablets at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. Patients should take sildenafil approximately one hour before sexual activity. In some men, the onset of action of the drug may be as early as 11-20 minutes. It's best for men to take sildenafil on an empty stomach for best results since absorption and effectiveness of sildenafil can be diminished if it is taken shortly after a meal, particularly a meal that is high in fat. Sildenafil and the other PDE5 inhibitors don't cause an immediate erection. Sexual stimulation is necessary for these medications to work.""'In prescribing sildenafil, a doctor considers the age, general health status, and other medication(s) the patient is taking. The usual starting dose for most men is 50 mg, however, the doctor may increase or decrease the dose depending on side effects and effectiveness. The maximum recommended dose is 100 mg every 24 hours. However, many men will need 100 mg of sildenafil for optimal effectiveness, and some doctors are recommending 100 mg as the starting dose.''Aging, ''liver'' and kidney problems, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as ''erythromycin'' [an antibiotic] and protease inhibitors for ''HIV'') slows the metabolism (breakdown) of sildenafil. Slowed breakdown allows sildenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially may increase the risk of side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age, in men with significant kidney and liver disease, and in men who also are taking medications called protease inhibitors, the doctor will initiate sildenafil at a lower dose (25 mg) to avoid accumulation of sildenafil in the body. A ''protease inhibitor'' ''ritonavir'' (''Norvir'') is especially potent in increasing the accumulation of sildenafil, thus men who are taking Norvir should not take sildenafil doses higher than 25 mg and at a frequency of no greater than once in 48 hours. Other medications that may affect the level of sildenafil include erythromycin and ketoconazole.''Sildenafil (Viagra) may affect another phosphodiesterase enzyme in the eye causing transient abnormal vision (seeing a bluish hue or brightness).' "
Vardenafil (Levitra and the generic formulation Staxyn),"'Vardenafil (Levitra) was the second oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra) inhibits PDE5, which destroys cGMP (as discussed earlier). It is the only PDE 5 inhibitor that has a generic form available.''Vardenafil is effective in men of all ages, different nationalities, and in men with such medical conditions as diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate surgery.''The recommended starting dose of vardenafil is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher or lower depending on efficacy and side effects. The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg, and the maximum recommended dosing frequency is no more than once per day. Patients can take vardenafil with or without food. As with sildenafil, for vardenafil to be effective, sexual stimulation must occur.''Vardenafil shares the same side effects as sildenafil but is not associated with the abnormal vision that may occur with sildenafil.''The same concerns regarding the use of sildenafil with nitrates and alpha-blockers apply to vardenafil.''Men with a rare heart condition known as long QT syndrome should not take vardenafil since this may lead to ''abnormal heart rhythms'"". The QT interval is the time it takes for the heart's muscle to recover after it has contracted. An ""'electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') measures the QT interval. Some people have longer than normal QT intervals, and they may develop potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, especially when given certain medications. Men with a family history of long QT syndrome should not take vardenafil, as it is possible to inherit long QT syndrome. Furthermore, vardenafil is not recommended for men who are taking medications that can affect the QT interval such as ''quinidine'' (Quinaglute, Quinidex), ''procainamide'' (Pronestyl, Procan-SR, Procanbid), ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), and ''sotalol'' (''Betapace'').''There is insufficient information on the safety of vardenafil in men with the following health disorders:''Therefore, men with these health conditions should not use vardenafil without having these conditions evaluated and stabilized first. For example, men with uncontrolled high blood pressure should have their blood pressure controlled; and men with potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms should have these rhythms controlled.''When there is angina or heart failure, the doctor may need to determine whether the heart has enough reserve to carry out the work necessary for sexual activity by performing cardiac treadmill stress testing.''Metabolism (breakdown) of vardenafil can be slowed by aging, liver disease, and concurrent use of certain medications (such as erythromycin [an antibiotic], ketoconazole [''Nizoral'', a medication for fungal/yeast infections], and protease inhibitors [medications used to treat ''AIDS'']). Slowed breakdown allows vardenafil to accumulate in the body and potentially increase the risk for side effects. Therefore, in men over 65 years of age with liver disease, or who are also taking medication(s) that can slow the breakdown of vardenafil, the doctor will initiate vardenafil at low doses to avoid its accumulation. For example,' Unstable angina (chest pain due to coronary artery disease that occurs at rest or with minimal physical exertion) Low blood pressure (a resting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (greater than 170/110 mm Hg) Recent stroke or heart attack (within six months) Uncontrolled, potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms Severe liver disease Severe kidney failure requiring dialysis Severe heart failure or disease of the heart's valves, for example, aortic stenosis (hardening of the main artery in the body) Retinitis pigmentosa (a condition that affects the retina of the eye and can cause blindness) men taking erythromycin or ketoconazole should not take more than 5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men taking high doses of ketoconazole (Nizoral) should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men with moderately severe liver disease also should not take more than a 5 mg dose of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; men taking the protease inhibitor (for the treatment of HIV/AIDS) indinavir (Crixivan) should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil in a 24-hour period; and men taking another protease inhibitor ritonavir (Norvir), erythromycin, or ketoconazole, should not take more than 2.5 mg of vardenafil every 72 hours."
Tadalafil (Cialis),"'Tadalafil (Cialis) is the third oral medicine approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Like sildenafil (Viagra) and vardenafil (Levitra), tadalafil inhibits PDE5 (as described earlier). Unlike the other PDE 5 inhibitors, patients should take tadalafil once daily and is approved for the treatment of BPH (benign enlargement of the prostate).''Tadalafil is effective in treating erectile dysfunction in men of all ages and has been shown to be effective in men with diabetes mellitus and erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer surgery. Studies demonstrated that tadalafil improved the ability to get a hard erection and to have the hard erection last long enough.''Patients may take tadalafil as needed as with sildenafil, vardenafil, and avanafil or once a day. It is the only ED oral medication that patients can take on a daily basis.''The recommended starting dose of tadalafil for use as needed for most patients is 10 mg taken orally approximately one hour before sexual activity. A doctor may adjust the dose higher to 20 mg or lower to 5 mg depending on efficacy and side effects. Doctors recommended that patients take tadalafil no more frequently than once per day. Some patients can take tadalafil less frequently since the improvement in erectile function may last 36 hours. Patients may take tadalafil with or without food. Tadalafil is currently the only PDE5 inhibitor that is FDA-approved for daily use for erectile dysfunction and is available in 2.5 mg or 5 mg dosages for daily use.''Tadalafil shares the common side effects of the PDE5 inhibitors, however, due to its effect on PDE11, another phosphodiesterase located in muscle, tadalafil has been associated with muscle aches. ''Back pain'' and muscle aches occur in less than 7% of men taking tadalafil and in most patients will go away without treatment within 48 hours. When treatment was necessary, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') or naproxen (''Aleve'') were effective. Rarely do the muscle aches and ''back pain'' cause men to stop using tadalafil.''Men taking nitrates should not use tadalafil as with the other PDE5 inhibitors.''Tadalafil should not be used with alpha-blockers (except ''Flomax''), medicines used to treat high blood pressure, and benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) because the combination of tadalafil and an alpha-blocker may lower the blood pressure greatly and lead to ''dizziness'' and ''fainting''. Examples of alpha-blockers include ''tamsulosin'' (Flomax), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), ''alfuzosin'' (''Uroxatral''), and ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''). Tamsulosin (Flomax) is the only alpha-blocker that patients can use safely with tadalafil. When tadalafil (20 mg) was given to healthy men taking 0.4 mg of Flomax daily, there was no significant decrease in blood pressure and so patients on this dose of tamsulosin (Flomax) can be prescribed tadalafil. The only alpha-blocker not tested with tadalafil is alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and no recommendations can be made regarding the interaction between the two.''As with vardenafil, doctors do not recommend tadalafil for men with the following conditions:''Therefore, men with these health conditions should not use tadalafil without having these conditions evaluated and stabilized first. For example, men with uncontrolled high blood pressure should have their blood pressure controlled; and men with potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms should have these rhythms controlled.''When there is angina or heart failure, the doctor may need to determine whether the heart has enough reserve to carry out the work necessary for sexual activity by performing cardiac treadmill stress testing.''In most healthy men, some of the drug will remain in the body for more than two days after a single dose of tadalafil. Metabolism (clearing of the drug from the body) of tadalafil can be slowed by liver disease, ''kidney disease'', and concurrent use of certain medications (such as erythromycin, ketoconazole, and protease inhibitors). Slowed breakdown allows tadalafil to stay in the body longer and potentially increase the risk for side effects. Therefore, doctors have to lower the dose and frequency of tadalafil in the following examples:' Unstable angina (chest pain due to coronary artery disease that occurs at rest or with minimal physical exertion) Low blood pressure (a resting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) Uncontrolled high blood pressure (greater than 170/110 mm Hg) Recent stroke or heart attack (within six months) Uncontrolled, potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms Severe liver disease Severe heart failure or disease of the heart valves (for example, aortic stenosis) Retinitis pigmentosa Medications such as erythromycin, ketoconazole (Nizoral), itraconazole (Sporanox), ritonavir (Norvir), and indinavir (Crixivan) can slow the breakdown of tadalafil. Therefore, men taking these medications should not take more than 10 mg of tadalafil and should not take tadalafil more frequently than every 72 hours. If you have kidney troubles, your doctor may recommend that you try a lower dose of tadalafil or change how often you use the tadalafil depending on your kidney function. Men with severe liver disease should not take tadalafil. Men with mild to moderate liver disease should not exceed tadalafil dose of 10 mg once daily."
Avanafil (Stendra),"'Avanafil is the most recently FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitor to treat erectile dysfunction.''Avanafil has been demonstrated to be effective in treating ED in men of various ages and has been shown to be effective in men with ED related to diabetes mellitus.''The recommended starting dose is 100 mg taken as early as 15 minutes prior to sexual activity, no more than once a day. The maximum dose is 200 mg. Avanafil may be taken with or without food. As with the other PDE5 inhibitors, sexual stimulation is necessary for avanafil to work.''If an individual is taking ketoconazole, erythromycin, or ritonavir, it is recommended that the maximum dose of avanafil not exceed 50 mg in 24 hours.''Similarly, if you are taking an alpha-blocker for prostate symptoms, the recommended starting dose of avanafil is 50 mg.''Avanafil shares the common PDE5 inhibitor side effects, contraindications, and cautions. No changes in dose are need for men with mild or moderate kidney disease. Individuals with severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, or those on ''kidney dialysis'' should not use avanafil.' "
What are intracavernosal injections?,"'Patient can inject medications directly into the corpora cavernosa to help attain and maintain erections. Medications such as papaverine hydrochloride, phentolamine, and prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) can be used alone or in combinations to attain erections. All of these medications are ''vasodilators'' and work by increasing blood flow into the penis. Prostaglandin E1 (Caverject, Edex) is easier to obtain; however, it is associated with ''penile pain'' in some individuals. The use of combinations of two or three of these medications can decrease the risk of having penile pain.''Risks associated with injection therapy including bleeding, pain with injection, penile pain, priapism, and corporal fibrosis (scarring inside of the corpora cavernosa). There is also concern that repetitive injections in the same area could cause ''scar tissue'' to build up in the tunica albuginea that could create penile curvature. Thus, doctors recommended that one alternate sides with injection and perform injections no more frequent than every other day.''If you are on a blood thinner, you must be careful. After injection, patients should pressure to the site to minimize bleeding.''Patients should start with a low dose and increase in small doses until the dose that results in a rigid enough erection for completion of sexual activity is achieved. If one injects and there is an inadequate response, one should not reinject another dose of the medication at that time, due to the risk of priapism.' "
What are intraurethral suppositories?,"'Prostaglandin E1 (intraurethral alprostadil or MUSE) can be inserted in a pellet (suppository) form into the urethra to attain erections. It is available in four dosage strengths: 125 mcg, 250 mcg, 500 mcg, and 1,000 mcg. Most individuals need 500 mcg to 1,000 mcg for a satisfactory response.''The prostaglandin E1 is contained in a small suppository located at the tip of an applicator. You should urinate first as this lubricates the urethra and makes it easier to insert the applicator into the tip of the urethra (urethral meatus, the opening at the tip of the penis that urine passes through). A patient can release the suppository into urethra by gently wiggling the applicator and pressing the button at the end. Rubbing the penis allows the suppository to dissolve, and the prostaglandin is absorbed through the tissue of the urethra into the penis. It takes 15 to 30 minutes for this occur. Once into the penis, the prostaglandin causes increased blood flow into the penis. The prostaglandin can be present in the ejaculate, and thus doctors recommend that men use a ''condom'' when having intercourse with a ''pregnant'' partner. Men may need to use a condom if vaginal irritation occurs in female partner.'""It is recommend that the first trial of intraurethral prostaglandin be performed in the doctor's office due to the risk of ""'hypotension'' with this medication.''Men with a known hypersensitivity to alprostadil should not use intraurethral prostaglandin E1.''Alprostadil should not be used in men with ''urethral stricture'' (scarring and narrowing of the tube that urine and the ejaculate pass through), ''balanitis'' (inflammation/infection of the glans [tip] of the penis, severe hypospadias (a condition where the opening of the urethra is not at the tip of the penis, rather on the underside of the penis), penile curvature (abnormal bend to the penis), and ''urethritis'' (inflammation/infection of the urethra).''Alprostadil should not be used in men at higher risk for priapism (erection lasting longer than six hours) including men with sickle cell ''anemia'', ''thrombocytopenia'' (''low platelet count''), ''polycythemia'' (increased red blood cell count), multiple ''myeloma'' (a cancer of the white blood cells), and is contraindicated in men prone to venous thrombosis (''blood clots'' in the veins) or hyperviscosity syndrome who are at increased risk for priapism.''Patients report success rates up to 65% with intraurethral alprostadil.''Side effects of intraurethral alprostadil include pain in the penis and sometimes in the testicles, mild urethral bleeding, ''dizziness'', and ''vaginal itching'"" in the sex partner. Patients rarely report syncopal (fainting) episodes with initial use, and thus the first trial of this medication should be performed in the physician's office."" "
What is the role of testosterone therapy in the treatment of erectile dysfunction?,"'In patients with low testosterone, testosterone treatment can improve libido and erectile dysfunction, but many men still may need additional oral medications such as sildenafil, vardenafil, or tadalafil. Some studies suggest that men with ED and low testosterone may respond better to PDE5 inhibitors when given testosterone therapy; however, this is controversial.''Men with ED without hypogonadism (a low testosterone level and symptoms related to this) should not use testosterone therapy.''Prior to starting testosterone therapy, it is important for a doctor to perform a thorough evaluation on the patient.''Evaluation should include a breast examination, rectal examination of the prostate, and a PSA level (prostate specific antigen) blood test. Patients who have breast and ''prostate cancers'' should not use testosterone.''Patients should continue testosterone therapy only if there is improvement in the symptoms of hypogonadism and should be monitored regularly. You will need periodic blood tests for testosterone levels and blood tests to monitor your blood count and PSA. Testosterone therapy has health risks, and thus doctors should closely monitor its use. Testosterone therapy can worsen ''sleep apnea'' and ''congestive heart failure''.''A variety of testosterone therapies are available, including oral, topical (gel, spray, patch), intramuscular, and pellets. Patient should review the advantages and disadvantages of each of these with a physician, as well as the health risks and benefits of testosterone therapy.''Certain medications can alter testicular function, including some diuretics (water pills), some ''seizure'' medications, long-acting oral opiate pain medications, antipsychotic medications, and oral steroids.' "
Can a penis pump (vacuum device) help erectile dysfunction?,"'Mechanical vacuum devices cause an erection by creating a vacuum around the penis that draws blood into the penis, engorging it, and expanding it. The devices have three components:''The vacuum device creates a vacuum to pull blood into the penis. Unlike a normal erection, the inflow of blood does not continue once the individual removes the vacuum device. The rubber band placed at the base of the penis constricts the penis to prevent the blood from leaving the penis. As there is no inflow or outflow of blood when the rubber band is in place, it is uncommon for the tip of the penis (the glans) to appear a little blue and the penis to be cooler. Once intercourse is completed, the individual removes the rubber band and the blood drains out of the penis.''Yes, the vacuum device is effective. In fact, with use of the vacuum device, 88% of men will have an erection that is satisfactory for completion of sexual activity. The vacuum device may be the only therapy that is effective after the removal of a penile prosthesis. Patients also use vacuum devices as part of penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy to help preserve the tissue of the penis and prevent scarring within the penis and loss of penile length. Its use, however, is limited by the mechanical nature of it and the time taken to pump the device and apply the band. Sex partners may complain of the penis being cool to touch.''Individuals must remove the rubber band immediately after completing intercourse. Leaving the band on too long can harm the penis. Rarely, ''bruising'' of the penis or blood in the ejaculate/urine may occur.' A plastic cylinder, in which the individual places his penis A pump, which draws air out of the cylinder An elastic band, which is placed around the base of the penis, to maintain the erection after the cylinder is removed and during intercourse by preventing blood from flowing back into the body (see figure 2). The vacuum device may be operated by hand or be battery operated."
What about psychological therapy for erectile dysfunction?,"""Experts often treat psychologically based impotence using techniques that decrease anxiety associated with intercourse. The patient's partner can help apply the techniques, which include gradual development of intimacy and stimulation. Such techniques also can help relieve anxiety during treatment of physical impotence. If these simple behavioral methods at home are ineffective, a doctor may refer an individual to a sex counselor."" "
Surgery for erectile dysfunction,"'Surgery for erectile dysfunction may have the following as its goal:''Currently, there are several different types of penile prostheses. The simplest is the malleable penile prosthesis and the most complex, the three-piece inflatable penile prosthesis.''Malleable implants usually consist of paired rods, inserted surgically into each of the corpora cavernosa. The rods are stiff, and to have an erection, one bends them up and then when finished with intercourse one bends them down. They do not change in length or width. The malleable implants are the least mechanical and thus have the lowest risk of malfunction. However, also have the least ""normal appearance.""''The most common inflatable prosthesis is the three-piece penile prosthesis. It is composed of paired cylinders, which doctors surgically insert inside the penis. Patients can expand the cylinders using pressurized fluid (see figure 3). Tubes connect the cylinders to a fluid reservoir and pump, which doctors also surgically implant. The reservoir is usually in the pelvis. A doctor places the pump in the scrotum. By pressing on the pump, sterile fluid transfers from the reservoir into the cylinders in the penis. An erection is produced primarily by expansion of the width of the penis, however, one model can increase in length a small amount also. Lock-out valves in the tubing prevent the fluid from leaving the cylinder until a release valve is pressed. By pressing the relief valve and gently squeezing the penis, the fluid within the cylinders transfers back into the reservoir.''The surgery for placement of a penile prosthesis is typically an outpatient surgery. Doctors often perform a penile prosthesis through a single incision, and all of the components are hidden under the skin. Health care professionals often give patients antibiotics at the time of surgery and often after the surgery to decrease the risk of developing an infection. Depending on your health history, a health care provider may leave a catheter in your penis to drain your bladder overnight.''Penile prostheses are very effective, and most patients who have a prosthesis placed are satisfied with the prosthesis. However, placement of a prosthesis causes scarring of the tissue within the corpora cavernosa, and if the prosthesis requires removal, other forms of therapy, except for the vacuum device, are often not effective. Thus, most physicians reserve placement of a prosthesis for men who have tried and failed or have contraindications to other therapies.'""Infection is a concern after placement of a prosthesis and is a reported complication in 8%-20% of men undergoing placement of a penile prosthesis. If a prosthesis becomes infected (redness, pain, and swelling of the penis and sometimes purulent drainage are signs of infection), the prosthesis must be removed. Depending on the timing and severity of the infection and your surgeon's preference, the area can be irrigated extensively with antibiotic solutions and a new prosthesis placed at the same time or removal of the infected prosthesis and an attempt to place a new prosthesis made at a later time when the infection is totally cleared.""'Mechanical malfunction is another risk of the prosthesis. However, advancements including lock-out valves and special covering over areas of the tubing have decreased the risk of mechanical malfunction.''Erosion of the prosthesis, whereby it presses through the corporal tissue into the urethra, may occur. Symptoms and signs may include pain, ''blood in the urine'', discharge, abnormal urine stream, and malfunction. If the prosthesis erodes into the urethra, a physician must remove it. If the other cylinder remains intact, it can be left in place. A physician leaves a catheter in place to allow the urethra to heal.''Other risks of penile prosthesis include over- or undersizing of the prosthesis, which can cause an abnormal appearance to the erect penis or reservoir or pump migration into abnormal locations.''Surgery to repair arteries (penile arterial reconstructive surgery) can reduce impotence caused by obstructions that block the flow of blood to the penis. The best candidates for such surgery are young men with discrete blockage of an artery because of a physical injury to the pubic area or a fracture of the pelvis. The procedure is less successful in older men with widespread blockage of arteries.''Physicians do not recommend surgery on the penile veins.'   to reconstruct arteries in order to increase the flow of blood to the penis; and to block veins that drain blood from the penis (currently not recommended). Currently, placement of a penile prosthesis is the most common surgical procedure performed for erectile dysfunction. Penile prosthesis placement is typically reserved for men who have tried and failed (either from efficacy or tolerability) or have contraindications to other forms of therapy including PDE5 inhibitors, intraurethral alprostadil, and injection therapy."
Can over-the-counter (OTC) and/or natural or home remedies treat erectile dysfunction?,"'The U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has a list of 29 OTC products that claim to treat erectile dysfunction. Patients should avoid these because many contain harmful ingredients. Other natural or herbal remedies such as DHEA, L-arginine, ''ginseng'', and ''yohimbe'' are ''supplements'' that have been used but have not been proven safe and effective according to some researchers. Before using such compounds, individuals should consult their doctor. According to some experts, ''acupuncture'' does not effectively treat erectile dysfunction. Other home remedies for reducing ED symptoms include ''diet'' changes such as eating blueberries and citrus fruits and drinking red wine.' "
Is it possible to prevent erectile dysfunction?,"'Prevention'' of some of the causes that contribute to the development of erectile dysfunction can decrease the chances of developing the problem. For example, if a person decreases their chances of developing diabetes, ''heart disease'', and hypertension, they will decrease their chances of developing erectile dysfunction. Other things like stopping smoking, eating a healthy ''diet'"" (heart healthy with adequate vitamin intake), and exercising daily may reduce a person's risk."" "
What is the prognosis for erectile dysfunction?,"'Currently, there are no therapies that cure erectile dysfunction. However, a number of effective therapies are available that allow an individual to have an erection when desired. Depending on the cause of the erectile dysfunction, certain therapies may be more effective than others. Although there is limited data on lifestyle modification, intuitively, decreasing risk factors for erectile dysfunction may help prevent progression of disease.' "
What erectile dysfunction studies are under way? What are future treatment options?,"'Combination therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction has been under investigation. Most of these studies have been small trials, and long-term data regarding their effectiveness and safety are lacking. However, with thorough evaluation and counseling, there may be a use for combination therapy for certain individuals with ED.''An alprostadil cream that patients apply into the tip of the penis (the urethral meatus, the opening that urine passes through) is currently available in the UK and Europe. It is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After application of the cream, an erection occurs within five to 30 minutes, and the erection lasts one to two hours in men who respond to the cream. Doctors recommend that one use the cream for a maximum frequency of two to three times per week and no more frequent than once every 24 hours. It has essentially the same contraindications and side effects as the other formulations of alprostadil. The cream may cause vaginal burning in roughly 4% of partners. Men should not use alprostadil cream for sexual intercourse with women of childbearing potential unless a condom is used. Researchers have performed controlled trial studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this drug. Overall, 52% of men reported improvement in their erections compared to 20% of men receiving placebo. A later analysis demonstrated that 36% of men using the alprostadil cream had a clinically relevant improvement in vaginal penetration ability and 31% clinically relevant improvement in ability to have successful intercourse to ejaculation.''Other medical therapies under evaluation include ROCK inhibitors and soluble guanyl cyclase activators. Melanocortin receptor agonists are a new set of medications being developed in the field of erectile dysfunction. Their action is on the nervous system rather than the vascular system. PT-141 is a nasal preparation that appears to be effective alone or in combination with PDE5 inhibitors. The main side effects include flushing and ''nausea''. These drugs are currently not approved for commercial use.''Research in stem cell therapy and gene therapy for erectile dysfunction is also ongoing.' "
Testosterone deficiency introduction,"'Testosterone is a hormone produced by the testicles and is responsible for the proper development of male sexual characteristics. Testosterone is also important for maintaining muscle bulk, adequate levels of ''red blood cells'', memory, bone growth, sense of well-being and sexual function.''Inadequate production of testosterone is not a common cause of ''erectile dysfunction''; however, when ''ED'' does occur due to decreased testosterone production, ''testosterone replacement therapy'' may improve the problem.' "
What causes testosterone deficiency?,"'As a man ages, the amount of testosterone in his body gradually declines. This natural decline starts after age 30 and continues throughout life. Other causes of lowered testosterone levels include:''The significance of age-related testosterone decline is controversial and poorly understood.' Injury, infection, or loss of the testicles. Chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer. Genetic abnormalities such as Klinefelter's Syndrome (extra X chromosome). Hemochromatosis (too much iron in the body). Dysfunction of the pituitary gland (a gland in the brain that produces many important hormones). Inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis (a condition that causes inflammation of the lungs). Medications, especially hormones used to treat prostate cancer and corticosteroid drugs. Chronic illness. Chronic kidney failure. Liver cirrhosis. Stress. Alcoholism Chronic pain and use of narcotics for pain contol. HIV and AIDS"
What are the symptoms of testosterone deficiency?,"'Without adequate testosterone a man may lose his sex drive, experience ''erectile dysfunction'', feel ''depressed'', have a decreased sense of well-being, and have ''difficulty concentrating''.' "
What changes occur in the body due to testosterone deficiency?," Decrease in muscle mass, with an increase in body fat and weight gain Changes in cholesterol levels. Decrease in hemoglobin and possibly mild anemia. Fragile bones (osteoporosis). Decrease in body hair. Changes in cholesterol levels and lipid levels."
How do I find out if I have a testosterone deficiency?,"'The only accurate way to detect the condition is to have your doctor measure the amount of testosterone in your blood. Because testosterone levels fluctuate throughout the day, several measurements will need to be taken to detect a deficiency. Doctors prefer, if possible, to test levels early in the morning since this is when testosterone levels are at their highest.' "
How is testosterone deficiency treated?,"'Testosterone deficiency can be treated by:''Each of these options provides adequate levels of hormone replacement; however, they all have different advantages and disadvantages. Talk to your doctor to see which approach may be right for you.' Intramuscular injections, generally every two or three weeks Testosterone patch worn either on the body or on the scrotum (the sac that contains the testicles) Testosterone gel Mucoadhesive material applied above the teeth twice a day Injectible pellets"
Who shouldn't take testosterone replacement therapy?,'Men who have ''prostate cancer'' or ''breast cancer'' should not take testosterone replacement therapy. All men considering testosterone replacement therapy should undergo a thorough ''prostate cancer screening'' prior to starting this therapy with a rectal exam and ''PSA test''.' 
What are the side effects of testosterone replacement therapy?,"'In general, ''hormone replacement therapy'' is safe. Possible side effects include:''Laboratory abnormalities that can occur with hormone replacement include:''If you are taking hormone replacement therapy, regular follow-up appointments with your doctor are important.''Like any other medication, directions for administering testosterone should be followed exactly as your doctor orders. If you are unsure or have any questions about testosterone replacement therapy, ask your doctor.' Acne or oily skin. Mild fluid retention. Stimulation of prostate tissue, with perhaps some increased urination symptoms such as a decreased stream or frequency. Breast enlargement. Worsening of sleep apnea (a sleep disorder that results in frequent night time awakenings and daytime sleepiness). Decreased testicular size. Changes in cholesterol and lipid levels. Increase in red blood cell count. Decrease in sperm count, producing infertility (especially in younger men). Increase in PSA"
What is electroretinography (ERG)?,"'Electroretinography (ERG) is an eye test that detects function of the retina (the light-detecting portion of the eye). The retina is comprised of layers of specialized cells, including photoreceptors (rods and cones), that detect light and ''ganglion'' cells that transmit images to the brain. Specifically, the ERG picks up electrical signals from the photoreceptors, as well as other cells (Muller cells and bipolar cells) that act as intermediaries between the photoreceptors and the ''ganglion'' cells. Abnormal ERG readings can detect certain abnormalities of these cell layers. During the test, a medical professional places an electrode on the ''cornea'' (at the front of the eye) to measure the electrical responses to light of these cells.' "
How do health care professionals perform an ERG?,"'ERG is one type of ophthalmic ''electrophysiology test''. Depending on which eye condition is being studied, ERG may be performed in conjunction with other tests, such as electrooculography (EOG) or dark adaptometry testing. ERG is usually well tolerated, painless, and medical professionals can perform ERG even in cooperative children and infants. Occasionally, sedation may be necessary.'""The patient assumes a comfortable position either lying down or sitting up. An eye doctor dilates the patient's eyes with standard dilating eyedrops. Anesthetic drops are also given. The doctor then props the eyelids open with a speculum and gently places a contact ""'lens'' electrode or an electrode resembling a fine thread on each eye. The physician places an additional electrode on the forehead skin.'""During an ERG recording session, the patient looks into a bowl displaying different amounts of light. Retinal cells emit small electrical signals when stimulated by certain types of light. The ERG machine records the resulting electric signals' amplitude (voltage) and time course.""'The visual stimuli vary; some are done with no light in the background (dark-adapted, or scotopic readings), and some are done with light in the background (light-adapted, or photopic readings). The light stimuli include flashes of light (flash ERG) and flickering lights.' "
What do the electrodes do?,'The electrodes measure the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. The information that comes from each electrode transmits to a monitor where it displays as wave patterns.' 
"How do medical professionals make electroretinography 
readings?","'Dark-adapted readings are taken when light flashes are presented after the patient has adapted to the dark for 20 minutes, and light-adapted readings are taken when light flashes are presented after the patient has adapted to light for 10 minutes. Generally, dark-adapted readings correlate with the health of the cells known as rods, while light-adapted readings correlate with the health of the cone cells.' "
Why do medical professionals perform an ERG?,'An ERG is useful in evaluating both ''inherited'' (hereditary) and acquired disorders of the retina.' 
What diseases is my doctor looking for with an ERG?,"'There are a number of retinal conditions in which the ERG may provide useful information, including'  retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, disorders that mimic retinitis pigmentosa (RP), as well as carriers of RP genes who otherwise show little sign of the disease, Leber's congenital amaurosis, choroideremia, congenital stationary night blindness, X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, achromatopsia, cone and rod dystrophies and degenerations, total retinal detachment, and retinal abnormalities due to metallic foreign bodies, autoimmune disease, inflammatory diseases, toxic drug damage, retinal vascular occlusion, malnutrition, and metabolic storage diseases."
What is a multifocal ERG?,"'While a standard ERG detects activity of the entire retina, the multifocal ERG tests different areas of the retina, looking for localized areas of abnormality. This test takes longer than a standard ERG.' "
What is a normal outcome for an ERG?,'A normal ERG shows an a-wave (photoreceptor activity) and b-wave (Muller and bipolar cells activity) patterns in dark-adapted (scotopic) and light-adapted (photopic) settings. Wave patterns that are diminished in size or delayed or prolonged in time provide clues about the types of damaged cells.' 
What do abnormal ERG results mean?,"'Abnormal ERG results provide clues as to which specific retinal cells are affected by disease. There are retinal diseases in which specific cells are missing or weak at birth, while other abnormalities are acquired over time.' "
What are the risks of an ERG test?,"'Some patients experience mild ''ocular'' discomfort during or after the procedure, but if you have irritation following an ERG, you should let your eye doctor know, so that he or she can rule out a ''corneal abrasion'' (scratch of the surface of the eye).' "
Does the ERG test hurt?,"'The test does not hurt. However, the electrode that rests on the eye may produce a foreign body sensation like having an eyelash on the eye. This sensation may persist up to several hours following completion of the ERG.'  "
How long does the ERG test take?,"'The standard ERG typically takes about an hour. For the dark-adapted portion of the test, the patient sits in the dark for 20 minutes. Dim light flashes that gradually increase in brightness then appear and the retinal responses recorded. This part takes another 10 to 15 minutes. Next is the light-adapted portion of the test. The patient views a medium-bright light for 10 minutes. Once the eyes are light-adapted, another series of flashes and flickering lights are presented and the retinal responses recorded. This takes another 10 to 15 minutes.''A multifocal ERG may take an additional hour to complete.' "
What happens after the ERG test?,"'One should not rub the eyes for an hour after an ERG (or any test in which the cornea has been anesthetized), so as not to injure the cornea.''An ophthalmologist or electrophysiologist who has special training in interpretation of ERGs will review the results of the test.' "
What is fifth disease? What causes fifth disease?,"'Fifth disease is a viral illness caused by human parvovirus B19. ''Erythema infectiosum'' and ''slapped cheek syndrome'' are other names for fifth disease. Health care professionals first described fifth disease in 1896 and named the illness fifth disease because of its fifth position in the numerical classification of six ''childhood illnesses'' associated with ''rashes'' (exanthems). Other numbered viral exanthems included ''measles'' (''rubeola'' or first disease), ''rubella'' (''German measles'' or third disease), and ''roseola'' infantum (''sixth disease''). The bacterium ''Streptococcus'' pyogenes'' causes ''scarlet fever'', or ""second disease."" Doctors no longer classify fourth disease as a clinical entity. Health care providers did not rename these illnesses until the molecular era, when it became possible to isolate ''viruses'' and bacteria. Parvovirus infection is very common. Almost 50% of adults have had a parvovirus B19 infection but often do not remember having it because this infection frequently does not cause symptoms.'  "
What are fifth disease symptoms and signs in children and adults?,"'Fifth disease generally occurs in school-age children between 4-10 years of age, but it can affect any age group. Parvovirus infection most commonly occurs during the winter and spring. The illness classically begins with a low-grade ''fever'', ''headache'', ''runny nose'', ''sore throat'', and malaise (a sense of not feeling well). Of course, these ''cold-like symptoms'' mimic any other viral illness, so it is impossible to determine the cause early in the illness. After about a week, a characteristic bright red rash on the cheeks (the so-called ""slapped cheeks"") follows the initial symptoms. Finally, after three to four days, a fine, red, lace-like rash can develop over the rest of the body. This rash may last for five to seven days and occasionally comes and goes for several weeks. The other symptoms are usually gone by the time the rash appears. Patients with the rash are usually not ''contagious''. Unfortunately, as with many other viral illnesses, the features and timing of the different stages of illness are often unpredictable.''Unlike other viral infections that usually cause ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' (namely coxsackievirus A16 and ''enterovirus'' 71), fifth disease does not typically involve the palms and soles. However, some adults infected with parvovirus B19 can develop redness and swelling of hands and ''feet''.'  "
Are there other symptoms that can occur with fifth disease?,"'Around 5% of children and about half of adults with fifth disease experience joint pains. This ''arthritis'' or arthropathy is more common in females than males, is usually temporary, lasting for a few days to weeks, and may become a long-term problem for months. People with arthritis from fifth disease usually have ''stiffness'' in the morning, with redness and swelling of the same joints on both sides of the body (""symmetrical"" arthritis). The joints most commonly involved are the knees, fingers, and wrists.' "
What are the serious complications of fifth disease? Is infection with fifth disease dangerous during pregnancy?,"'Rarely, these patients develop erythrocyte aplasia, meaning the bone marrow stops forming a normal number of ''red blood cells'' (''anemia''). This complication is rare and usually transient, but ''anemia'' can be life-threatening. Patients who have compromised immune systems (by disease or treatment) are at high risk of this complication.''Pregnant women (who have not previously had the illness) should avoid contact with patients who have fifth disease. The fifth disease virus can infect the fetus prior to birth. Although no ''birth defects'' have been reported because of fifth disease, for 2%-10% of B19-infected pregnant women, fifth disease can cause severe anemia and even the death of the unborn fetus (by hydrops fetalis). Blood tests for parvovirus B19 are not routinely included in preconception or antenatal screenings.' "
What is the treatment for fifth disease?,"'The only available treatment is supportive. Fluids, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), and rest provide relief. Antibiotics are useless against fifth disease, because it is a viral illness. People with persistent arthritis can use anti-inflammatory medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), though children should not take ''aspirin'' due to the risk of developing Reye syndrome.'  "
"How does fifth disease spread? When is the contagious stage, and should I be isolatedif I have fifth disease?","'Parvovirus B19 usually spreads by droplets. The virus spreads whenever an infected person ''coughs'' or sneezes. However, once the rash is present, that person is usually no longer contagious and need not be isolated.' "
Is it possible to prevent the spread of fifth disease?,"'Similar to most viral illnesses, the best way to prevent the spread of the disease is by proper hand washing, by covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or ''cough'', and by staying home when you become sick.' "
What is erythema nodosum?,"   Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that is located in a certain portion of the fatty layer of skin. Erythema nodosum (also called EN) results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs. The tender lumps, or nodules, of erythema nodosum range in size from one to five centimeters. Inflammation in the fatty layer of skin causes the nodular swelling. Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in three to six weeks. Upon resolution, it may leave only a temporary bruised appearance or leave a chronic indentation in the skin where the fatty layer was injured."
What causes erythema nodosum?,"'Erythema nodosum may occur as an isolated condition or in association with other conditions. Conditions that are associated with erythema nodosum include:' medications (sulfa-related drugs, birth control pills, and estrogens), strep throat, Cat scratch disease, fungal diseases, infectious mononucleosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and normal pregnancy."
What are the signs and symptoms of erythema nodosum?,"'Characteristic features of erythema nodosum include barely raised, tender, reddish nodules, most commonly below the knees in the front of the legs. They are typically painful and can slowly come and go.''There are several scenarios for the outcome of erythema nodosum. Typically, these nodular areas are tender and inflamed off and on for a period of weeks. They usually then resolve spontaneously, each one of the little areas of inflammation shrinking down and then becoming flat rather than raised and inflamed. They leave a bruised appearance. Then, they resolve completely on their own. Other lesions can sometimes pop up elsewhere. This may occur for periods of weeks to months, and then they eventually disappear. However, chronic erythema nodosum that may last for years is another pattern. Chronic erythema nodosum, with intermittent recurrences, can occur with or without an underlying disease present.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose erythema nodosum?,"'Usually, erythema nodosum is a straightforward, simple diagnosis for a doctor to make by examining a patient and noting the typical firm area of raised tenderness that is red along with areas which have had lesions resolved, which might show a bruised-like appearance. It does not typically require other investigative tests.''Sometimes doctors perform a biopsy for confirmation. For example, if a patient presents with an isolated, nodule and a doctor is unable to make a diagnosis based on its appearance. The biopsy of the deeper layers of tissue of skin can prove that it is erythema nodosum.' "
Can erythema nodosum be confused with other conditions?,'The nodules of erythema nodosum are sometimes confused with ''insect bites''. Sometimes the inflammation of erythema nodosum is more widespread and can mimic ''skin infection'' (''cellulitis'').' 
What are treatment options for erythema nodosum?,"'Doctors manage erythema nodosum by identifying and treating any underlying condition present. Simultaneously, health care professionals direct treatment toward the inflamed skin from the erythema nodosum.''Treatments for erythema nodosum include anti-inflammatory drugs and ''corticosteroids'' by mouth or local injection. Physicians sometimes administer ''colchicine'' to reduce inflammation. Treatment must be customized for the particular patient and conditions present, such as the existence of any associated diseases. It is important to note that erythema nodosum, while annoying and often painful, does not threaten internal organs and the long-term outlook is generally very good.'  "
What is a sedimentation rate?,"'A sedimentation rate is common blood test that is used to detect and monitor inflammation in the body. The sedimentation rate is also called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate because it is a measure of the ''red blood cells'' (erythrocytes) sedimenting in a tube over a given period of time. Sedimentation rate is often abbreviated as ""sed rate"" or ESR. Although this test measures a general state of inflammation, it is not specific to what causes the inflammation. It is elevated in inflammatory diseases, including ''arthritis'' as well as in autoimmune diseases such as ''lupus''. It can also be elevated due to other conditions such as certain ''cancers'' and '""Grave's disease""'.'  "
Why is a sedimentation rate performed?,'A blood sedimentation rate is tested to detect inflammation in the body. It can also be used to follow the progress of a disease.' 
What specialists order a sedimentation rate?,'All specialties of medicine can order this simple blood test while evaluating symptoms in order to determine whether or not there is inflammation in the body.' 
How is a sedimentation rate performed?,"'A sedimentation rate is performed by measuring the rate at which red blood cells (RBCs) settle in a test tube. The RBCs become sediment in the bottom of the test tube over time, leaving the blood serum visible above. The classic sedimentation rate is simply how far the top of the RBC layer has fallen (in millimeters) in one hour. The sedimentation rate will be higher in the presence of increased inflammation.' "
What is the normal range for sedimentation rate?,"'The normal sedimentation rate (Westergren method) for males is 0-15 millimeters per hour, females is 0-20 millimeters per hour. The sedimentation rate may normally be slightly higher in the elderly.'  "
What is apheresis?,"'Apheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from a donor or patient and separating the blood into individual components so that one particular component can be removed. The remaining blood components then are re-introduced back into the bloodstream of the patient or donor. ''Apheresis is used for the collection of donor blood components (such a platelets or plasma) as well as for the treatment for certain medical conditions in which a part of the blood that contains disease-provoking elements is removed.''Apheresis is also called pheresis or hemapheresis. The terminology used may also reflect the component of blood that is being removed, such as:''Total plasma exchange (removal of plasma and replacement with fresh frozen plasma) can also be performed using the apheresis procedure. It is also used for the collection of ''stem cells'' from the peripheral blood.' Plasma (plasmapheresis)  Platelets (plateletpheresis)  Leukocytes (leukapheresis or leukopheresis)  Lymphocytes (lymphopheresis or lymphapheresis)  Red blood cells (erythropheresis)"
How is apheresis performed?,"""All apheresis procedures involve directing the blood in the patient/donor's veins through tubing to a machine that separates the blood components. The separation is done by either a centrifuge process or a filtration process on the blood in the machine. After the separation, the desired component of the blood is removed, while the remainder of the blood components are reinfused back into the patient. The entire procedure is painless and typically takes about two hours, or only slightly longer than a conventional blood donation.""  "
What are some possible complications of apheresis?,"'Serious complications of donor apheresis are rare. Minor complications of donor apheresis can include bleeding at the donation site and feelings of ''lightheadedness'' that usually resolve quickly. ''More serious complications can occur when apheresis is used to treat serious conditions and include:' bleeding and a tendency to bleed (because clotting factors are removed), infection and a tendency toward infection (because the immune system is somewhat suppressed when antibodies are removed),  low blood pressure (as fluids are removed),  muscle cramping (as low blood calcium can occur and other electrolytes can be imbalanced)."
What diseases can be treated with apheresis?,"'When used in a therapeutic manner, the apheresis procedure is individualized regarding the frequency of treatments, the volume of blood or components to be removed, and the type of solution used for volume replacement.''The following list of conditions for which apheresis may be of benefit is not all-inclusive. Apheresis can be used in the treatment of:''Apheresis can also be effective in certain cases of:'   myasthenia gravis,  Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,  Goodpasture's syndrome,  familial hypercholesterolemia,  hyperviscosity syndrome (such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),  the HELLP syndrome of pregnancy,  clogging of blood vessels (leukostasis) cause by severely elevated white blood count in leukemia, and  severely elevated platelet counts in leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. systemic lupus with life-threatening complications,  severe vasculitis,  polymyositis or dermatomyositis,  severe rheumatoid arthritis,  rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,  chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy, and  in cases of solid organ transplantation with a high risk of antibody-mediated rejection of the transplant. "
What are contraindications to apheresis?,"'Hemapheresis is generally avoided if a patient has active infection, unstable ''heart'' or lung conditions, severely low white blood cell or platelet counts, a bleeding tendency, or a significantly ''low blood pressure''. The overall status of the patient as well as the seriousness and progression of the disease in question are all taken into consideration relative to these contraindications for each individual patient. ' "
What is erythropoietin (EPO)?,"'Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced by the kidney that promotes the formation of red blood cells by the bone marrow.''The kidney cells that make erythropoietin are sensitive to low oxygen levels in the blood that travels through the kidney. These cells make and release erythropoietin when the oxygen level is too low. A low oxygen level may indicate a diminished number of red blood cells (''anemia''), or ''hemoglobin'' molecules that carry oxygen through the body.'  "
What does erythropoietin do? Why do we need it?,"'Erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. The resulting rise in ''red cells'' increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.'""As the prime regulator of red cell production, erythropoietin's major functions are to:""'Chemically, erythropoietin a protein with an attached ''sugar'' (a glycoprotein). It is one of a number of similar glycoproteins that serve as ''stimulants'' for the growth of specific types of blood cells in the bone marrow.' Promote the development of red blood cells. Initiate the synthesis of hemoglobin, the molecule within red blood cells that transports oxygen."
What organ produces erythropoietin?,'Erythropoietin is produced to a lesser extent by the ''liver''. Only about 10% of erythropoietin is produced in the liver. The erythropoietin gene has been found on human chromosome 7 (in band 7q21). Different DNA sequences flanking the erythropoietin gene act to control liver versus kidney production of erythropoietin.' 
Why is an erythropoietin test performed?,"'The erythropoietin hormone can be detected and measured in the blood. An abnormal level of erythropoietin in the blood can indicate bone marrow disorders, (such as ''polycythemia'', or increased red blood cell production) ''kidney disease'', or erythropoietin abuse. Testing erythropoietin blood levels is of value if:'   Too little erythropoietin might be responsible for too few red blood cells (anemia), especially anemia related to kidney disease. Too much erythropoietin might be causing too many red blood cells (polycythemia). Too much erythropoietin might be evidence for a kidney tumor. Too much erythropoietin in an athlete may suggest erythropoietin abuse."
Do I need to fast before an erythropoietin blood test?,"'The patient is usually asked to fast for 8-10 hours (overnight) and sometimes to lie quietly and relax for 20 or 30 minutes before the test. The test requires a routine sample of blood, which is sent to the laboratory for analysis.' "
What are normal erythropoietin levels?,'Normal levels of erythropoietin range from 4 up to 24 mU/ml (milliunits per milliliter).' 
What does an abnormal erythropoietin level mean?,"'Abnormal erythropoietin levels suggest possible disease of the bone marrow or kidneys. Another possibility is abuse by an athlete to increase the ''red cell count'' for better athletic performance. The correct interpretation of an abnormal erythropoietin level depends on the particular clinical situation. Sometimes, the erythropoetin level may be inappropriately normal when it should be elevated (such as when there is an anemia), indicating a problem with the kidneys.' "
Can a person without a medical disease or condition have a high erythropoietin (EPO) level?,"'Yes. For example, erythropoietin has been misused as a performance-enhancing drug in athletes such as cyclists (in the Tour de France), long-distance runners, speed skaters, and Nordic (cross-country) skiers. When misused in such situations, erythropoietin is thought to be especially dangerous (perhaps because ''dehydration'' due to vigorous ''exercise'' can further increase the thickness (viscosity) of the blood, raising the risk for ''blood clots'', ''heart attacks'', and ''strokes''. Erythropoietin has been banned by the Tour de France, the Olympics, and other sports organizations.' "
Is erythropoietin available as a prescribed medication?,"'Yes. Using recombinant DNA technology, erythropoietin has been synthetically produced for use as a treatment for persons with certain types of anemia. Erythropoietin can be used to correct anemia by stimulating red blood cell production in the bone marrow in these conditions. The medication is known as ''epoetin alfa'' (''Epogen'', ''Procrit'') or as darbepoietin alfa (Arnesp). It can be given as an injection intravenously (into a vein) or subcutaneously (under the skin).' "
What diseases or conditions does prescription erythropoietin treat or manage?,"'Erythropoietin is used in many clinical settings. The most common use is in people with anemia (low blood count) related to kidney dysfunction. When the kidneys are not properly functioning, they produce less than normal amounts of erythropoietin, which can lead to low red blood cell production, or anemia. Therefore, by replacing the erythropoietin with an injection of synthetic erythropoietin, anemia related to kidney disease may be treated. Currently, Epogen or Procrit is a standard part of therapy in patients with kidney disease who require ''dialysis'' to both treat and prevent anemia.''Other uses of erythropoietin may include treatment of anemia related to the medication AZT (used to treat ''AIDS''), anemia caused by ''chemotherapy'', anemia caused by dysfunctional bone marrow (where the blood cells are made), and anemia associated with ''cancer''.'

What is the esophagus?,"'The esophagus is the first part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a tube-like structure that connects the mouth to the stomach, allowing food and liquid to be swallowed. There are muscles that encircle the esophagus that allow it to contract and push food and liquid toward the stomach. When cancer cells develop in the tissues of this muscular tube, it is defined as esophageal cancer.' "
What is esophageal cancer?,"'Esophageal cancer describes the disease where cells that line the esophagus change or mutate and become malignant. These cells grow out of control and form a mass or tumor.''There are two main types of esophageal cancer:''There are more rare forms of cancer that affect the esophagus, including ''lymphoma'', ''malignant melanoma'', sarcoma, choriocarcinoma, and small cell cancer.'   Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma affects the squamous cells and usually develops within the middle third of the esophagus. Squamous cells describe thin, flat cells that line the inner surface of the entire esophagus and this type of cancer may occur anywhere in the esophagus, though most are found in the upper half. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus affects the lower third of the esophagus. This type of cancer arises from the glandular cells found in that area of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ or GE junction, a specific part of the esophagus where the esophagus and stomach meet) is a specific subset of esophagus cancers."
What are risk factors and causes of esophageal cancer?,"'Esophageal cancer occurs because changes occur in the DNA of cells that line the esophagus. The exact reason for these changes or mutations is uncertain, but there are known risk factors for developing these cancers.'   Squamous cell cancer of the esophagus is related to the use of alcohol and tobacco products, both smoke and smokeless. When the two are used together, the risk of this type of cancer increases. Adenocarcinoma involves the lower third of the esophagus and is thought to be related to gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). When acid backwashes from the stomach into the lower esophagus, inflammation and cell damage may occur. Over a period of time, abnormal cells begin to form (metaplasia) and if the GERD is not treated and inflammation continues, the lining of the esophagus begins to change the way it looks and functions (dysplasia). Adenocarcinoma of the GE junction describes cancers that arise either in the lower esophagus or upper stomach, very close to the GE junction. Barrett's esophagus describes abnormal dysplasia and is thought to perhaps be a precursor to the development of further cell mutations and adenocarcinoma. Smoking increases the risk of adenocarcinoma. Alcohol use does not increase the risk of adenocarcinoma. Other potential risk factors for both types of esophageal cancer include esophageal burns and strictures due to accidental or intentional swallowing of caustic materials such as bleach; unusual infections with yeast, fungi, or human papillomavirus (HPV); and certain unusual foods (for example betel nuts that are prominent in some Asian diets). Drinking scalding hot liquids and diets low in fruits and vegetables may increase the risk of esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer tends to be a disease of older people, usually occurring after the age of 65, and tends to affect males much more frequently than females (3-4: 1). Achalasia, a motility disease of the esophagus where it does not contract appropriately, increases the risk of esophageal cancer. There are some chromosome and gene abnormalities that are associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. There has been a shift in the type of esophageal cancer that is now prevalent in the United States and Western Europe. In the past, squamous cell cancer was the most common worldwide, but that has changed. Adenocarcinoma is more common than squamous cell cancer in western countries, including the U.S. The reason for this change has yet to be determined. Esophageal adenocarcinoma of the GEJ junction is becoming more frequent as well."
What are the symptoms and signs of esophageal cancer?,"'Esophageal cancer tends not to be associated with symptoms until it grows large enough to narrow the esophagus and make it difficult for food to pass. This also means there is time and opportunity for the cancer to grow beyond the esophagus and spread (''metastasize'') either to surrounding tissues or to distant parts of the body before it is discovered.''The first symptom of esophageal cancer is almost always ''dysphagia'' (dys=abnormal + phagia=swallowing). Initially there may be ''difficulty swallowing'' solid foods, but symptoms may worsen and if the obstruction of the esophagus becomes more high-grade, there may also problems swallowing liquids.''Because adenocarcinoma of the esophagus may be related to chronic ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'', ''symptoms of GERD'' may also be present, including heartburn and ''indigestion''. This is often described as a burning sensation located behind or just beneath the breastbone in the upper abdomen.''Patients with esophageal cancer also can present with unexplained ''weight loss'' which occurs in more than half of patients. Esophageal cancers bleed and may cause ''vomiting'' of blood, or passing of melena (black, ''tarry stools''). Sometimes the bleeding can be microscopic and not seen by the naked eye. The patient may experience weakness due to ''low red blood cell count'', and because it is due to blood loss, it is most often an iron-deficiency ''anemia''.''Pain'' from esophageal cancer can be felt in the lower chest behind the breastbone or in the upper abdomen. If the cancer has spread, there may be pain in other places around the chest or back.''Patients may experience voice ''hoarseness'' due to vocal cord damage caused by reflux of stomach acid into the throat. Water brash describes hypersalivation and bad taste in the back of the mouth from reflux. Acid droplets that cause this foul taste can be aspirated and can inflame the vocal cords, causing a change in voice.''As the tumor grows, it may cause nerve damage if it inflames the recurrent laryngeal nerve that helps control the vocal cords. The nerve runs close to the esophagus, so if cancer spreads to the nerve, it means the cancer has grown beyond the esophageal wall.''Physical examination may not be helpful in making the diagnosis; the esophagus is hidden within the chest ''cavity'' and not easily evaluated by physical examination. In the early stage of esophageal cancer, there may be no symptoms at all. It is only when the tumor grows enough to cause problems, do symptoms begin to appear. That is the reason why patient history is so important in making the diagnosis and why all complaints of difficulty swallowing should be taken seriously.''If the cancer has metastasized through the lymph system, beyond the esophagus, there may be abnormal lymph nodes palpable in the neck below the jaw or above the clavicles (collarbones). If cancer has spread to the ''liver'', the liver may become enlarged and may be palpated on examination of the abdomen.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose esophageal cancer?,"'The diagnosis of esophageal cancer is made by endoscopy and biopsy.''When symptoms of difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) occur, a ''gastroenterologist'' can do a procedure called an endoscopy where the patient swallows a flexible tube with an attached camera and the doctor can look at the full length of the esophagus, the stomach, and the first part of the intestine (duodenum). If a mass or tumor is seen in the esophagus, the gastroenterologist has the ability to take a sample of tissue (biopsy) through the same tube. The patient is usually sedated for endoscopy.''The tissue biopsy is examined by a pathologist using a microscope and the clinical diagnosis is then confirmed if cancer cells are found.''Plain ''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', and PET scans may be used to look for metastases and spread of the cancer to different sites in the body.'  "
How do physicians determine esophageal cancer staging?,"'Staging describes a system used to show how deep the cancer has extended into the esophageal tissue, whether it has spread to lymph nodes, and what other organs in the body might be involved.''There is a common system agreed upon by the Union for International Cancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer that uses TNM staging.''With the endoscope, the gastroenterologist can use ''ultrasound'' to determine how deep into the layers of the esophagus the tumor has grown. The doctor can also tell whether lymph nodes that line the esophagus have been invaded.''Either ''CT scan'' of the chest and abdomen or PET scan is then used to determine the extent of tumor spread.''Depending on the type of cancer and the extent the tumor has spread, there are certain circumstances where more invasive procedures are warranted to help with staging: ''laparoscopy'' (an operation where a surgeon inserts a camera into the abdominal ''cavity''), thoracoscopy (the camera is inserted into the chest cavity), and ''bronchoscopy'' (a camera is inserted into the lung airways).'   T refers to the size and reach of the primary tumor. N refers to the spread to lymph nodes. M refers to the presence of metastases."
What are the stages of esophageal cancer?,"'The stages of esophageal cancer can be complicated to understand and are related to the following:''Stages are as follows:' T1 to T4: This depends on total tumor depth and what layers of the esophagus have been invaded by the cancer. N0 to N3: This refers to the number of lymph nodes containing cancer. M0 to M1: This refers to whether there are metastases to distant organs, usually lung, liver, and bone. Stage IA: T1, N0, M0 Stage IB: T2, N0, M0 Stage IIA: T3, N0, M0 Stage IIB: T1, T2, N1, M0 Stage IIIA: T4a, N0, M0; or T3, N1, M0; or T1, T2, N2, M0 Stage IIIB: T3, N2, M0 Stage IIIC: T4a, N1, N2, M0; or T4b, any N, M0; or any T, any N, M1 Stage IV: any T, any N, M1"
What are the treatments for esophageal cancer?,"""The approach to cancer treatment is individualized to each patient's situation. Recommended treatments depend on the stage and health of the patient. A team of physicians will help decide with the patient and family what might be the best approach to their specific situation. These providers may include specialists in medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgery, in addition to the patient's primary care provider.""'Esophageal cancer is often found in older patients who have other underlying illnesses that complicate treatment. Esophageal cancer is usually diagnosed late in the course of the disease because symptoms often occur only after a tumor has grown and potentially spread. Most often, if the patient can tolerate it, treatment consists of a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.''The National Comprehensive Cancer Network maintains up-to-date guidelines based upon ongoing clinical trials that allow cancer specialists to offer treatment advice to patients and family.''The decision to undergo surgery and the type of surgery that might be appropriate depends upon the type of esophageal carcinoma (squamous cell or adenocarcinoma), its staging, and the underlying health of the patient. Some patients are high-risk for surgery and anesthesia because of pre-existing health conditions like ''heart'' or lung disease.''Treatment guidelines are continuously being evaluated and revised, based upon the development of new treatments and the results of ongoing clinical trials. Decisions about treatment effectiveness often involve statistical analysis that combines many treatment studies. This meta-analysis helps adjust treatment options and protocols as more patients are enrolled in studies, more data is obtained, and hopefully, better survival is achieved.''Surgery may involve esophagectomy or removal of the whole esophagus.''Some patients are able to have the removed esophagus replaced with another piece of bowel to connect the mouth to the stomach. If that is not possible, percutaneous gastrostomy may be required to get food and fluid into the stomach to be digested. A tube is placed through the skin and anchored into the stomach to allow tube feedings.''Chemotherapy and radiation therapy (also called external beam radiation) may be administered prior to surgery to help shrink the tumor. There are a variety of chemotherapy protocols that may be considered. Surgery may be delayed after the diagnosis is made to allow the chemotherapy and radiation to be administered.''Chemotherapy and radiation therapy that have been started after surgery have not been shown to increase survival. However, there may be a benefit to survival when these therapies are continued after surgery, if they were started before the operation.''There are disease-specific genes associated with esophageal cancer. In certain circumstances, the tumor can be tested to see whether genes like HER2 are present. Targeted medications can attach or bind to different protein sites on the tumor cells and inhibit tumor growth. This is immunotherapy, specific cancer-fighting medications that try to kill only tumor cells, unlike chemotherapy, which also kills normal cells as a side effect.''If there is high-grade dysplasia confined to the walls of the esophagus with no spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs (stage I), surgical removal of the tumor may be accomplished via endoscopic procedure. The gastroenterologist may be able to resect (remove) the damaged tissue using different techniques.''Light therapy may be used to treat esophageal cancers that are small in size and have not spread or metastasized. In this treatment, a photo-sensitizing drug is injected into the body where it is absorbed by cells, where they can last for two to three days. However, cancer cells seem to keep a concentration of the drug longer. When the patient is exposed to light from a laser, the drug may kill the cancer cell.''This type of treatment is limited because light cannot penetrate deeply into the body and is effective in only small tumors. At present, ''photodynamic therapy'' is approved for esophageal cancer and non-small-cell ''lung cancer''.'  "
What kinds of doctors treat esophageal cancer?,"'Esophageal cancer is a condition that usually requires surgical procedures. In addition to the general surgeon, there are many other types of physicians who may contribute to care.''Should the cancer become untreatable or symptom control be needed, palliative care specialists may be involved to help improve quality of life.'   Gastroenterologists may be involved in diagnosing, treating, and monitoring the disease. Oncologists make treatment plans that include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Radiation is administered by a radiation oncologist. Surgeons are responsible for operating and removing organs that are involved by tumor. General surgeons and thoracic surgeons are commonly responsible for the operation. Other types of surgeons may provide care depending upon what other organs are affected by the cancer. The primary care provider may help care for side effects, controlling other illnesses and providing nutrition and metabolic support. The primary care provider may also be a resource and provider of emotional support to the patient and their family. Dieticians are important to help maintain nutrition to aid healing and prevent complications when food cannot be easily swallowed, both before and after surgery."
What are the statistics related to esophageal cancer?,"'The American Cancer Society estimates that here will be 17,650 new cases of esophageal cancer in the United States in 2019, with more than 16,000 deaths expected.''Esophageal cancer occurs more frequently as people age and is more commonly diagnosed in male patients 60 to 70 years of age. It is 20 times more common to be found in patients older than age 65 than in those who are younger. Esophageal cancer affects males more than females, almost four to one.''Hispanics and African-Americans are more likely than whites to have squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. They are also less likely to undergo esophagectomy (surgical removal of the esophagus) for their cancer. However, survival did not differ between racial groups when adjusted for types of surgery performed.' "
What support is available for those with esophageal cancer?,"'Patients, families, and friends are all affected when the diagnosis of cancer is made. Most hospitals and treatment facilities will have support systems available to help with the difficult journey ahead. In addition to the physical ''stress'' of recovering from diagnosis, treatment, and therapy, there is significant emotional ''stress'' that extends beyond the initial treatment time period.''The treating professionals will be important resources to relay understanding of the disease, the potential treatment options, and the expected outcomes. It is important for all who are involved to be advocates for the patient; much of the information can be overwhelming. It is reasonable to ask questions of the doctors, nurses, and other care providers.''There are many community resources available. The American Cancer Society is a good place to begin, contacting the organization at a local office or online. As well, most hospital cancer programs have support groups and social service programs to help provide guidance and assistance to patient and their families.' "
What is the prognosis with esophageal cancer? What is the survival rate for esophageal cancer?,"'Most often, esophageal cancer is a treatable disease but not a curable one.'""Patients who have severe Barrett's esophagus (some consider this stage T0 or ""'precancerous'') and those with few cancer cells tend to have relatively successful long-term outcomes.''The overall five-year survival rate is estimated by the National Cancer Institute as 18%. ''Lymph node'' and other organ involvement markedly lowers survival rate.''There is a better survival rate in patients whose tumors disappeared with radiation and chemotherapy before surgery (three-year survival rate of 48%), as compared to those who had some residual tumor at time of surgery (27%).''The prognoses for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are about the same.''The five-year survival rate for'   localized esophagus cancer that hasn't spread from its primary site is 42.9%; esophagus cancer with regional spread is 23.4%; esophagus cancer with distant metastasis is 4.6%; and esophagus cancer with unknown staging is 12.4%."
Is it possible to prevent esophageal cancer?,"'Since squamous cell carcinoma is associated with ''smoking'' (and ''smokeless tobacco'' products), stopping smoking will significantly decrease the risk of this type of esophageal cancer.''Alcohol abuse'' is also related to squamous cell carcinoma, especially when combined with tobacco product use. Alcohol products should be used in moderation.''Eating a ''diet'' rich in fruits and vegetables may decrease the risk of esophageal cancer.''Obesity is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma and weight loss may be appropriate.'""Esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with GERD and the subsequent development of Barrett's esophagus. It is important to limit the risk factors for developing esophageal reflux. These include""""If symptoms of GERD develop, they should be assessed and treated by your health care professional. Should symptoms persist or worsen, the recommendation may be to undergo endoscopy to determine whether Barrett's esophagus is present.""""Barrett's esophagus needs to be managed and monitored to assess whether there is progression of cell damage. This may include endoscopic ablation, or killing of abnormal tissue using different techniques including ""'radiofrequency ablation'', photodynamic therapy, or ''cryotherapy''.' losing weight, moderating alcohol use, avoiding excess anti-inflammatory medication use (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), and avoiding smoking."
What is esophageal manometry?,'Esophageal manometry is a procedure for determining how the muscles of the ''esophagus'' and the sphincter (valve) works by measuring pressures (manometry) generated by the esophageal muscles and the sphincter.' 
When is esophageal manometry used?,'Esophageal manometry is used primarily in three situations:'   To evaluate the function of the sphincter and muscles of the esophagus when there is reflux (regurgitation) of stomach acid and contents back into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD)  To determine the cause of problems with swallowing food (dysphagia) when an endoscopy is normal When there is chest pain that may be coming from the esophagus after the heart as a cause of chest pain has been ruled out
How is esophageal manometry performed?,"'At the start of the esophageal manometry procedure, one nostril is anesthetized with a numbing lubricant.  A flexible ''plastic'' tube approximately one-eighth inch in diameter is then passed through the anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows.  Once inside the esophagus, the tube allows the pressures generated by the esophageal muscle to be measured when the muscle is at rest and during swallows. The procedure usually takes 15 to 20 minutes.' "
How is esophageal manometry used to assist in the diagnosis of diseases and conditions?,"'The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat with the stomach.  When food is propelled by a swallow from the mouth into the esophagus, a wave of muscular contraction starts behind the food in the upper esophagus and travels down the entire length of the esophagus (referred to as the body of the esophagus), thus propelling the food in front of the wave through the esophagus and into the stomach.  At the upper and lower ends of the esophagus are two short areas of specialized muscle called the upper and lower esophageal sphincters. At rest (that is, when there has been no swallow) the muscle of the sphincters is active and generates pressure that prevents anything from passing through them.  As a result, material within the esophagus cannot back up into the throat, and stomach acid and contents cannot back up into the esophagus. When a swallow occurs, both the sphincters relax for a few seconds to allow food to pass through the esophagus into the stomach.''The most common use for esophageal manometry is to evaluate the lower esophageal sphincter and the muscle of the body of the esophagus in patients who have ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').  Manometry often can identify ''weakness'' in the lower esophageal sphincter that allows stomach acid and contents to back up into the esophagus. It also may identify abnormalities in the functioning of the muscle of the esophageal body that may add to the problem of reflux.''Manometry can help diagnose several esophageal conditions that result in food sticking after it is swallowed.  For example, ''achalasia'' is a condition in which the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter does not relax completely with each swallow.  As a result, food is trapped within the esophagus.  Abnormal function of the muscle of the body of the esophagus also may result in food sticking.  For instance, there may be failure to develop the wave of muscular contraction (as can occur in patients with ''scleroderma'') or the entire esophageal muscle may contract at one time (as in an esophageal spasm). Manometry reveals an absence of the wave in the first case and the contraction of the muscle everywhere in the esophagus at the same time, or spasm, in the second case.''The abnormal functioning of the esophageal muscle also may cause episodes of severe chest ''pain'' that can mimic heart ''pain'' (''angina'').  Such pain may occur if the esophageal muscle goes into spasm or contracts too strongly. In either case, esophageal manometry may identify the muscular abnormality.' "
What limitations are there to the use of esophageal manometry?,"""There are several situations in which esophageal manometry may not demonstrate the esophageal abnormality that is responsible for a patient's problem. For example, many patients with GERD have transient (coming and going infrequently), but prolonged relaxation (minutes rather than seconds) of the lower sphincter, as the cause of their reflux. Such relaxations may be missed in the short period during which the manometric study is being conducted. Similarly, if a patient is having infrequent episodes of chest pain due to esophageal spasm, for example, every few days or weeks, the spasm may not be seen during a short manometric study. There have been attempts to get around these problems by using portable equipment and prolonged manometry for two or more days."" "
What are the side-effects of esophageal manometry?,"'Although esophageal manometry is uncomfortable, the procedure is minimally painful because the nostril through which the tube is inserted is anesthetized.  Once the tube is in place, patients talk and breathe normally.  The side-effects of esophageal manometry are minor and include mild ''sore throat'', ''nosebleeds'"", and, uncommonly, sinus problems due to irritation and blockage of the ducts leading from the sinuses and into the nose.  Occasionally, during insertion, the tube may enter the larynx (voice box) and cause choking.  When this happens, the problem usually is recognized immediately, and the tube is rapidly removed.  Care must be used in passing the tube in patients who are unable to easily swallow on command because without a swallow to relax the upper esophageal sphincter the tube often doesn't enter the esophagus but instead may enter the larynx.""  "
Are there alternatives to esophageal manometry?,"'There are no good alternatives to esophageal manometry. Esophageal manometry is usually performed after anatomic abnormalities have been ruled out by endoscopy. The function of the muscles of the esophagus and the working of the esophageal sphincter may be assessed initially by performing a ''barium swallow''. However, a normal barium swallow will not rule out any abnormal function of the muscles of the esophagus. or the esophageal sphincter.

What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.  This may obviate the need to do a pH monitoring study.' "
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.

What is esophagitis?,"'Esophagitis describes inflammation of the esophagus, which is the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. There are several types of esophagitis depending on the cause. Esophagitis can be caused by infection, irritation of the esophagus, or inflammation of the lining of the esophagus.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of esophagitis?,"'Symptoms of esophagitis include:'   Bad breath (halitosis) A feeling of food getting stuck while swallowing Difficult and/or painful swallowing Pain in the middle of the chest, often radiating to the back, usually associated with swallowing or occurring soon after a meal. An unpleasant taste in mouth Indigestion Heartburn Acid reflux Sore throat Hoarseness Cough Mouth sores Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain or indigestion"
What causes esophagitis? What is dysphasia?,"'Esophagitis can be caused by infection or irritation of the esophagus.''Infections of the esophagus can be caused by bacteria, ''viruses'', or fungi, including:''One of the main causes of esophageal irritation is reflux of stomach acid. There are several causes for reflux:''Medical treatments for other problems can also cause esophageal irritation.''Surgery, including certain types of bariatric (''weight loss'') surgery, can lead to increased risk of esophagitis. Medications such as ''aspirin'' and other anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' can irritate the lining of the esophagus, and cause increased acid production in the stomach that can lead to acid reflux.''Drug-induced esophagitis occurs when large pills are taken with too little water or just before bedtime and they dissolve get stuck in the esophagus, causing irritation. ''Radiation'' to the chest (thorax), for cancer treatment can cause ''burns'' leading to scarring and inflammation of the esophagus.''Other causes of esophageal irritation:'   Candida, a yeast infection. This is more common in patients with weakened immune systems, such as those with diabetes, HIV/AIDS, patients undergoing chemotherapy, or people who are taking antibiotics or steroids. Herpes, a viral infection. It may develop in the esophagus when the body's immune system is weak. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease): weakness or dysfunction of the muscle that keeps the stomach closed (lower esophageal sphincter) can allow stomach acid to leak into the esophagus (acid reflux), causing irritation of the inner lining. Also called GERD esophagitis - in severe cases it can become erosive esophagitis (this also may be referred to as ulcerative esophagitis). Vomiting: when vomiting is frequent or chronic it can lead to acid damage to the esophagus. Excessive or forceful vomiting may cause small tears of the inner lining of the esophagus (a rare condition called Mallory-Weiss syndrome [MWS]), leading to further damage. Hiatal hernia: This abnormality occurs when a part of the stomach moves above the diaphragm producing a small abnormal pouch, or hiatal hernia, which can lead to excess acid refluxing into the esophagus. Achalasia: This is a disorder where the lower end of the esophagus does not open normally, and as a result, food can get stuck in the esophagus or is regurgitated. People with achalasia have a higher than normal risk of esophageal cancer. Swallowing of foreign material or toxic substances Diets high in acidic foods or excessive caffeine Smoking"
What are the grades of esophagitis?,"'There are number of grading systems used to evaluate the severity of the disease. The Los Angeles Classification System is most commonly used.''Los Angeles Classification System grades reflux esophagitis:''In the past, the Savary-Miller Classification System was more widely used but the Los Angeles Classification System is considered more thorough.' Grade A: One (or more) mucosal break no longer than 5 mm that does not extend between the tops of two mucosal folds Grade B: One (or more) mucosal break more than 5 mm long that does not extend between the tops of two mucosal folds Grade C: One (or more) mucosal break that is continuous between the tops of two or more mucosal folds but which involve less than 75% of the circumference Grade D: One (or more) mucosal break which involves at least 75% of the esophageal circumference"
What are the types of esophagitis?,"'There are several types of esophagitis.' Reflux esophagitis is caused by a reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus. This can lead to erosive esophagitis. Infectious esophagitis is caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungus. Barrett's esophagus results from untreated inflammation of the esophagus that can cause changes in the type of cells that make up the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus. Barrett's esophagus increases the risk for esophageal cancer. Eosinophilic esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus due to an increase in the number of a type of white blood cells (eosinophils) in the lining of the esophageal wall. It is considered an allergic/immune condition. This leads to dysmotility of the esophagus (the muscles do not work properly to move food through) and difficulty in swallowing. Causes of eosinophilic esophagitis include food allergies, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), parasitic diseases, or inflammatory bowel diseases. Behçet's syndrome (also called Behçet's disease) is a form of vasculitis that can cause ulcers in the mouth, esophagus, and other parts of the body. This disease is rare in the U.S. Graft-versus-host disease is a complication that can occur after a transplant (usually bone marrow transplant) when the newly transplanted cells attack the recipient's body. Esophagitis may occur in this condition. Cancer esophagitis may be a symptom of cancer of the esophagus, or metastatic cancer (cancer that started in another part of the body and then spreads to the esophagus)."
What procedures or tests diagnose esophagitis?,"'A gastroenterologist may order specialized tests to look for the cause and extent of the esophagitis. These tests include:' Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): An endoscope is used to directly examine the esophagus, stomach and first part of the intestines. In addition, tissue samples can be obtained (biopsy) to assess the severity of the damage to the esophagus. Esophageal manometry: this test is used to measure the pressure inside the lower part of the esophagus. A thin, pressure-sensitive tube is passed through the mouth or nose and into the stomach, which is then pulled slowly back into the esophagus. Patients are asked to swallow, and the pressure of the muscle contractions is measured along several sections of the tube. Upper GI series or barium swallow is a test where X-rays are taken of the esophagus after drinking a barium solution. Barium coats the lining of the esophagus and appears white on an X-ray, and can show the location and extent of damage to the esophagus."
Is esophagitis painful? What treatments are available for pain?,'Many ''over-the-counter'' medications can help neutralize stomach acid and provide short-term relief for the ''pain'' of esophagitis caused by acid reflux. Do not take these medications long-term. See a doctor if symptoms persist for more than two weeks.''Pain medications and medications that decrease inflammation such as ''corticosteroids'' can be used as adjuncts in the treatment of any inflammatory cause of esophagitis.' 
Is there a diet that soothes esophageal pain?,"'Diet is often a key to reducing the symptoms of esophagitis. The GERD diet is aimed at reducing acid reflux, the main cause of esophagitis.'   Eat low fat, high protein meals Eat smaller meals, more frequently Eat soft foods that are easily digested Avoid fatty foods Avoid spicy foods Avoid acidic foods and beverages such as citrus and tomatoes Avoid foods that may trigger or worsen heartburn including chocolate, mint, onions or garlic Stop eating before you feel full Avoid coffee or tea (even decaffeinated), alcohol, and soda"
What lifestyle changes help alleviate symptoms of GERD and esophagitis?,"'Lifestyle changes that may alleviate ''symptoms of GERD'' and esophagitis include:' Stop smoking Remain upright while eating and for about 2-3 hours afterwards Take small bites and chew food slowly Avoid eating within 3 hours of bedtime or laying down Raise the head of the bed by 4 to 6 inches (put blocks or a foam wedge under the head of the bed) Lose weight Wear loose clothing Avoid aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve)"
What are the medical treatments for esophagitis?,"'Treatment for esophagitis depends on its cause.''If esophagitis is diagnosed early enough, medications and dietary or lifestyle changes are often enough to allow the body to heal. If the damage is severe or leads to ''scar tissue'', which causes ''difficulty swallowing'', more invasive treatments may be necessary.'   Esophagitis caused by an infection it is treated with medications to cure the infection. Esophagitis caused by acid reflux or GERD, the condition is treated with medications to reduce or block acid production, for example, heartburn drugs such as H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Esophagitis due to a medical procedure may need to take acid-blocking medications for a long time. Esophagitis due taking medications may need changes in his/her medications. Consult your doctor before stopping or changing your medications. Endoscopy can be used to remove any lodged pill fragments, food, or foreign bodies stuck in the esophagus. Stretching (dilatation) of the esophagus can also be done as part of the endoscopy procedure. Surgery may be necessary to remove any damaged portions of the esophagus. In the case of Barrett's esophagus, where the risk of cancer is increased, surgery might be the treatment of choice. Eosinophilic esophagitis is treated with gentle stretching of the esophagus (dilatation) and medications to decrease white blood cells (eosinophils) in the lining of the esophagus. Achalasia may be treated with stretching of the esophagus (dilatation) when oral medications fail to improve symptoms."
What are the complications of esophagitis?,"'If untreated, esophagitis caused by GERD can lead to bleeding, ulcers, and chronic scarring. This scarring can narrow the esophagus, eventually interfering with the ability to swallow.'""A major complication that occurs in a significant portion of people with chronic or longstanding GERD, is Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal cancer. A very few of those who develop Barrett's esophagus will develop esophageal ""'adenocarcinoma''.''Severe esophagitis may lead to difficult or painful swallowing, and malnutrition.' "
How long does it take esophagitis to heal? Can it be cured?," The prognosis for esophagitis often depends on the underlying cause. Esophagitis caused by infection or inflammation is generally treatable with medications, diet or behavioral changes and in some cases, surgery. Most people can recover fully, while some have chronic inflammation that is managed with long-term medical treatment. Esophagitis caused by reflux, while often manageable, can recur frequently. Many people with reflux require medication or other treatments to prevent relapses. A significant percentage of people with GERD go on to develop Barrett's esophagus. Very few of patients with Barrett's esophagus develop cancer. A gastroenterologist should monitor those who have Barrett's esophagus. The outlook for people with eosinophilic esophagitis is favorable. It is a chronic, relapsing condition, but not usually one that is life threatening. Treatments are evolving using different immune modulators to decrease the allergy-like reactions. Achalasia is a progressive, but treatable disorder. A gastroenterologist must monitor patients closely. A small number of individuals with achalasia may develop squamous cell cancer (carcinoma) as a result."
Which specialties of doctors treat esophagitis?,"""A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family medicine specialist, an internist, or a child's pediatrician, may initially diagnose esophagitis. If you need further treatment you will likely be referred to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in disorders of the ""'digestive system''.' "
Can esophagitis be prevented?,"'Some types of esophagitis can be prevented.' Esophagitis caused by GERD may be prevented by changes in lifestyle and diet. Proper oral hygiene can aid in prevention of esophagitis caused by the Candida yeast. Take all pills with plenty of water, and in an upright position."
What is upper endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to examine the ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope with a camera on the tip through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.'  "
How do I prepare for endoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's ""'allergies''. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.'  "
Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional.

It is elevated in inflammatory diseases, including ''arthritis'' as well as in autoimmune diseases such as ''lupus''. It can also be elevated due to other conditions such as certain ''cancers'' and '""Grave's disease""'.'  "
Why is a sedimentation rate performed?,'A blood sedimentation rate is tested to detect inflammation in the body. It can also be used to follow the progress of a disease.' 
What specialists order a sedimentation rate?,'All specialties of medicine can order this simple blood test while evaluating symptoms in order to determine whether or not there is inflammation in the body.' 
How is a sedimentation rate performed?,"'A sedimentation rate is performed by measuring the rate at which red blood cells (RBCs) settle in a test tube. The RBCs become sediment in the bottom of the test tube over time, leaving the blood serum visible above. The classic sedimentation rate is simply how far the top of the RBC layer has fallen (in millimeters) in one hour. The sedimentation rate will be higher in the presence of increased inflammation.' "
What is the normal range for sedimentation rate?,"'The normal sedimentation rate (Westergren method) for males is 0-15 millimeters per hour, females is 0-20 millimeters per hour. The sedimentation rate may normally be slightly higher in the elderly.'  "
What is cryoglobulinemia?,"'Cryoglobulinemia is a medical condition that is caused by proteins called cryoglobulins, which are present in the blood. Cryoglobulins are abnormal proteins that by definition have the unusual property of precipitating from the serum when it is chilled in the laboratory and then dissolves back into the serum upon rewarming.''Cryoglobulins may or may not cause disease. Cryoglobulins can accompany another condition (such as ''dermatomyositis'', ''multiple myeloma'', viral infections, or ''lymphoma'') or be an isolated condition themselves, called cryoglobulinemia.'  "
What conditions are associated with cryoglobulinemia?,"'Cryoglobulins in the blood (cryoglobulinemia) can cause a variety of problems throughout the body. These include complications resulting from abnormal ""thickness"" of the blood (such as ''stroke'' or ''blood clots'' in the eyes leading to ''blindness'') and inflammation of blood vessels, referred to as ''vasculitis''. ''Vasculitis'' of arteries can result in blockage of blood flow, leading to damage to the organ(s) supplied by the affected blood vessels, such as in the skin, kidneys, or elsewhere. It can also cause bleeding when the blood vessels leak.' "
What is essential mixed cryoglobulinemia?,"'When the cryoglobulin proteins are a mixture of various antibody types, and forming for unknown reasons (essential), the conditions is referred to as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia.''Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is characterized by ''joint pains'' and swelling (''arthritis''), enlargement of the spleen, skin vasculitis with purplish patches, and nerve and ''kidney disease''. This can lead to recurrent ''pain'' in the abdomen, ''heart attack'', and bleeding in the ''lungs''. ''Weight loss'' can occur as well as poor appetite.''Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is sometimes associated with ''hepatitis C'' virus infection.' "
"What is the prognosis (outlook) for patients with essential mixed
cryoglobulinemia?","'The prognosis and natural history of the illness is not predictable. Kidney damage can be serious and some reports state that permanent failure of the kidney occurs in approximately 10% of patients. Death can occur, usually from serious ''heart disease'', infection, or ''brain hemorrhage''.' "
How is essential mixed cryoglobulinemia treated?,"'Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is treated with combinations of medications which reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Medications used include nonsteroid antiinflammatory ''drugs'' (''ibuprofen'', ''aspirin'', and others), steroids (''prednisone'', ''prednisolone''), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''Leukeran''), and ''azathioprine'' (Imuran). Plasmapheresis (''hemapheresis'""), a procedure whereby the blood's serum is filtered to remove the cryoglobulins, is also performed for severe symptoms.""'Studies have demonstrated some benefit of using ''interferon''-alpha for those patients with evidence of ''hepatitis C'' virus, particularly those with mild disease or in those with remission of manifestations after immune suppression treatment.'  "
1. Who develops breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is the most frequently diagnosed non-''skin cancer'' in American women. An estimated 213,000 American women will be diagnosed with ''breast cancer'' in 2006. The risk of ''breast cancer'"" increases as women get older. Over the years, researchers have identified certain characteristics, usually called risk factors, which influence a woman's chance of getting the disease. Still, many women who develop breast ""'cancer'' have no known risk factors other than growing older, and many women with known risk factors do not develop breast ''cancer''. '  "
2. What is the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool?,"'The Breast ''Cancer'"" Risk Assessment Tool is a computer program that was developed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) to assist health care providers in discussing breast cancer risk with their female patients. The tool allows a health professional to project a woman's individual estimate of breast cancer risk over a 5-year period of time and over her lifetime and compares the woman's risk calculation with the average risk for a woman of the same age. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool can be found at: ""'http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool''.' "
"3. What are the risk factors used to estimate breast cancer risk in the 
Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool?","'The risk factors included in the tool are: ''For women with 0 or 1 affected relative, risks increase with age at first live birth. For women with 2 or more first degree relatives, risks decrease with age at first live birth.'' Adapted from Table 1, Gail MH, Brinton LA, Byar DP, Corle DK, Green SB, Shairer C, Mulvihill JJ: Projecting individualized probabilities of developing breast cancer for white females who are being examined annually. J Natl Cancer Inst 81(24):1879-86, 1989. [PubMed Abstract]'   Personal history of breast abnormalities. Two breast tissue abnormalities -- ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) -- are associated with increased risk for developing invasive breast cancer. Age. The 
risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The majority of breast 
cancer cases occur in women older than age 50. Age at menarche (first menstrual 
period). Women who had their first menstrual period before age 12 have a 
slightly increased risk of breast cancer. Age at first live birth. Risk depends 
on age at first live birth and family history of breast cancer, as shown in the 
following table of relative risks. Breast cancer among first-degree relatives (sisters, mother, daughters). 
Having one or more first-degree blood relatives who have been diagnosed with 
breast cancer increases a woman's chances of developing the disease. Breast 
biopsies. Women who have had breast biopsies have an increased risk of breast 
cancer, especially if the biopsy showed a change in breast tissue, known as 
atypical hyperplasia. These women are at increased risk because of whatever 
prompted the biopsies, not because of the biopsies themselves. Race. White women 
have greater risk of developing breast cancer than Black women (although Black 
women diagnosed with breast cancer are more likely to die of the disease)."
4. Why are some other risk factors left out of the Tool?,"'Other risk factors for breast cancer have been identified or proposed but are not included in the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool for several reasons: because evidence that these factors contribute to breast cancer risk is not conclusive, because researchers cannot determine whether these factors add useful information to factors already in the model, or because data on other risk factors was not available in the research data used to develop the model. Such risk factors include: age at ''menopause'', use of ''birth control pills'', high body mass index, a high-fat ''diet'', ''alcohol'', ''radiation'' exposure, and environmental pollutants. Recently published research indicates that breast tissue density, measured from mammograms, can add useful information, but risk models with breast tissue density measurement still need to be validated with additional independent studies. Research also indicates that other risk factors, such as use of hormone therapy, might improve the tool. ' "
5. Is the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool useful for all women?,"'The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was developed for women in the United States population age 35 years or older. It should not be used for women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer, women exposed to breast radiation for treatment of Hodgkin ''lymphoma'', or women who reside in, or recently migrated from, regions with low breast cancer risk, such as rural China or Japan. More accurate methods to project risk may be available for women with certain rare identified mutations, such as alterations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2''. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool was developed and has been validated in populations consisting mainly of non-Hispanic white women. More research is needed to validate or refine the model for other racial and ethnic groups. ' "
6. What are some of the latest research findings on breast cancer risk?,"'Two studies in the September 6, 2006, issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute identified breast density as an important risk factor.* In one, a study of 11,638 women diagnosed with breast cancer, researchers identified different sets of risk factors in pre- and post-menopausal women. For pre-menopausal women, the risk factors included age, breast density, family history of breast cancer, and prior cancer diagnosis. For post-menopausal women, the risk factors included ethnicity, body mass index, age at ''natural menopause'', use of ''hormone therapy'', and a prior false-positive ''mammogram'', in addition to all the risk factors for pre-menopausal women. The two separate models in this study for predicting breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women may be particularly helpful in identifying women at high risk for breast cancer. ''The other study adds breast density and weight to the Gail model, a model that is the basis for the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (see Question 2). As before, the new model can be used to project risk over 5, 10, 20 and 30 year intervals. The new model predicted higher risks than the previous model in women with high breast density, and previous analyses indicated that the new model had modestly higher accuracy. Independent validation studies are needed before this model should be used for counseling, and before making a permanent change to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. ' "
7. Are there ways to decrease the chance of developing breast cancer?,"'Launched in April 1992, the ''Breast Cancer Prevention'' Trial (BCPT) was designed to see whether the drug ''tamoxifen'' could prevent breast cancer in women with an increased risk. Data reported in 1998 showed that both pre- and post-menopausal women taking tamoxifen had 49 percent fewer diagnosed cases of breast cancer. These results were also the first clear indication that a chemopreventive agent could be effective in preventing cancer in a high-risk population. For women over 50, tamoxifen was associated with serious side effects, such as ''endometrial cancer'' and ''blood clots''. (http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/''Prevention''/breast-cancer)''Starting in 1999, ''postmenopausal'' women ages 35 or older at increased risk for breast cancer participated in the Study of Tamoxifen and ''Raloxifene'' (STAR). The study compared tamoxifen with raloxifene, an ''osteoporosis'' drug. The initial results of the trial were announced on April 17, 2006 (see ''http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/STARresultsApr172006''), and showed that the drug raloxifene works as well as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk for postmenopausal women at increased risk of the disease. In STAR, both ''drugs'' reduced the risk of developing invasive breast cancer by about 50 percent. In addition, within the study, women who were prospectively and randomly assigned to take raloxifene daily, and who were followed for an average of about four years, had 36 percent fewer uterine ''cancers'"" and 29 percent fewer blood clots than the women who were assigned to take tamoxifen. Uterine cancers, especially endometrial cancers, are a rare but serious side effect of tamoxifen. Both tamoxifen and raloxifene are known to increase a woman's risk of blood clots. Data from STAR continues to be analyzed. (""'http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/STARresultsQandA'')' "
"8. How did BCPT and STAR use the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to add 
to our knowledge of breast cancer risk?","'Both breast ''cancer prevention'"" studies, BCPT and STAR, explored ways of reducing the risk of developing breast cancer; their findings have increased our knowledge of risk. Both trials involved women who have not had breast cancer, but were at high risk of developing it. BCPT used the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to determine eligible participants by projecting each woman's individualized estimate of breast cancer risk. The projections were accurate; thus the BCPT results validated the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool. STAR researchers used the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool for determining eligibility for enrollment. All STAR participants had to have an increased risk of breast cancer equivalent to or greater than that of an average 60- to 64-year-old woman. "" "
9. What else can a woman do about breast cancer?,"'NCI recommends that women in their 40s and older get screening mammograms every one to two years. Women who are at higher than average risk of breast cancer should talk with their health care providers about whether to have mammograms before age 40 and how often to have them. Women also can take an active part in the early detection of breast cancer by having regular clinical breast exams (breast exams performed by health professionals). ''Advances in screening have provided new tools for detection. In September of 2005, preliminary results from a large clinical trial of digital vs. film ''mammography'' found no difference in detecting breast cancer for the general populations of women in the trial. However, the Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) found that women with dense breasts, who are pre- or perimenopausal (women who had a ''last menstrual period'' within 12 months of their mammograms), or who are younger than age 50, may benefit from having a digital rather than a regular film mammogram. More information about DMIST can be found at ''http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pressreleases/DMISTQandA''.

What is menopause?,"'Menopause'"" is the stage in a woman's life when ""'menstruation'' stops and she can no longer bear children. During ''menopause'', the body produces less of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. After ''menopause'', the lower hormone levels cause the monthly menstrual periods to stop and gradually eliminate the possibility of ''becoming pregnant''. These fluctuations in hormone levels can also cause troublesome symptoms, such as hot flashes (a sudden sensation of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing, and often followed by ''sweating'') and ''sleep'' disturbance. Sometimes women experience other symptoms, such as ''vaginal dryness'' and ''mood changes''. ''While many women encounter little or no trouble during menopause, others endure moderate to severe discomfort. ' "
Does menopause cause bone loss?,"'The lower estrogen levels of menopause can lead to progressive bone loss that is especially rapid in the first five years after menopause. Some bone loss in both men and women is normal as people age. Lack of estrogen after menopause adds another strain on the bones in addition to the usual age-related bone loss. When bone loss is severe, a condition called ''osteoporosis'' weakens bones and renders them susceptible to breaking. ' "
What are estrogen therapy and hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Estrogen, in pill, patch, or gel form, is the single most effective therapy for suppressing hot flashes. ''The term estrogen therapy, or ET, refers to estrogen administered alone. Because ET alone can cause uterine cancer (endometrial cancer) (see below), a progestin is administered together with estrogen in women who have a uterus (those who have not undergone a ''hysterectomy'') to eliminate the increased risk. Thus, the term ''estrogen/progestin therapy'', or EPT, refers to a combination of estrogen and progestin therapy, as is given to a woman who still has a uterus. This method of prescribing hormones is also known as combination hormone therapy. ''The term hormone therapy (HT) is a more general term that is used to refer to either administration of estrogen alone (women who have had a hysterectomy), or combined ''estrogen/progestin'' therapy (women with a uterus).''All forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are FDA-approved for therapy of hot flashes are similarly effective in suppressing hot flashes. ' "
What are the side effects and risks of hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Women can experience side effects during hormone therapy; these can be divided into more minor side effects, and more serious side effects. The more minor side effects are more common than the serious side effects, and are generally perceived by women as ""annoying."" These symptoms include:''It is still controversial which of these side effects are due to the estrogen component as compared to the progesterone component. Therefore, if side effects persist for a few months, the doctor will often alter either the progesterone or the estrogen part of the hormone therapy (HT).''Contrary to common belief, recent research has confirmed that women who take commonly prescribed doses of hormone therapy (HT) are no more likely to gain weight than women not taking hormone therapy (HT). This is probably because menopause or ''aging'' itself is associated with ''weight gain'', regardless of whether or not a woman takes hormone therapy.''The more serious health concerns for women undergoing hormone therapy (HT) include:' headaches, nausea, breast pain. Hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of vein clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis ) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolus) by about 2 or 3 fold. However, it is important to remember that these conditions are extremely rare in healthy women. Thus, the true increase in risk for healthy women is minimal. Women with a personal or family history of these blood clots should review this issue when considering hormone therapy (HT). Uterine Cancer (endometrial cancer): Research shows that women who have their uterus and use estrogen alone are at risk for endometrial cancer. Today, however, most doctors prescribe the combination of estrogen and progestin. Progestin protects against endometrial cancer. . If there is a particular reason why a woman with a uterus cannot take some form of progesterone, her doctor will take a sample of tissue from her uterus (endometrial biopsy) to check for cancer annually while she is taking estrogen. Women without a uterus (women who have had a hysterectomy) have no risk of endometrial cancer. Breast cancer: Recent research indicates that hormone therapy (HT), and especially EPT, increases the risk of breast cancer, although the increase in risk is very small. For example, the Women's Health Initiative, a reliable large study of hormone therapy (HT) in menopausal women, predicted that there were approximately eight extra cases per 10,000 women who took hormone therapy (HT) for 1 year, compared to women taking a placebo pill. The increase in risk of breast cancer associated with hormone therapy (HT) likely increases with duration of use and is especially increased with five or more years of use. Heart disease: Even though hormone therapy (HT) lowers the bad LDL cholesterol and raises the good HDL cholesterol, hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of heart attacks in women who already have heart disease, as well as in women who do not have known heart disease. Hormone therapy (HT) does not prevent heart attack based on recent research from the Women's Health Initiative. Abnormal vaginal bleeding: Women on hormone therapy (HT) are more likely than other postmenopausal women to experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. What is called ""abnormal bleeding"" depends on the type of hormone therapy (HT). With cyclic therapy, in which monthly bleeding is expected, bleeding is abnormal if it occurs when it is not expected or is excessively heavy or long in duration. With daily continuous therapy, irregular bleeding can last for six months to a year, therefore, irregular bleeding that lasts for more than a year is considered abnormal. When abnormal bleeding occurs, a doctor usually takes a sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrial biopsy) to rule out an abnormality or cancer in the uterus. This procedure is usually done in the office. After the evaluation is done, if nothing is found to be wrong, hormone therapy (HT) doses will often be adjusted to minimize further abnormal bleeding. Stroke: Hormone therapy (HT) slightly increased the risk of stroke in women studied in the Women's Health Initiative. The WHI predicted that there were 8 extra strokes per 10,000 women taking hormone therapy (HT) for one year, compared to women taking a placebo (sugar pill). Because of the possibility of increased breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease risks, women who have no major menopause symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT). The effects of other types of hormone therapy (HT) (aside from the Women's Health Initiative types) on breast cancer risk are still unclear."
How is hormone therapy (HT) prescribed?,"""Doctors usually prescribe hormone therapy (HT) as a combination of estrogen and another\xa0 female hormone, progesterone. Synthetic progesterone compounds are referred to as progestins. Long term estrogen use without progesterone increases the risk of uterine cancer (endometrial cancer), whereas addition of progesterone counteracts this risk. Therefore estrogen without progestin is usually only recommended for women who have had their uterus removed (hysterectomy). Estrogen is available as pills, tablets, patches, creams, mist sprays, or vaginal preparations (vaginal rings, vaginal tablets, or vaginal cream). The choice of estrogen preparation recommended by the doctor depends on the women's symptoms. For instance, vaginal creams, vaginal tablets, and vaginal rings are used for vaginal dryness, while pills or patches are used to ease hot flashes. Estrogen pills are also useful for vaginal dryness and are sometimes used along with vaginal creams, tablets, or rings.""'Although progestin is usually taken in pill form, it is also available, together with estrogen, in patch form.'""Doctors may prescribe different schedules for taking hormone therapy (HT). Every woman's hormone therapy (HT) treatment and schedule should be individualized based on her particular situation. Below are some standard forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are used:""'Pills (Oral Therapy)''In order to avoid monthly vaginal bleeding, some women choose to take small doses of estrogen and progesterone together every day. This is called ''daily continuous therapy.'' Sometimes, daily continuous therapy can cause some irregular, unexpected vaginal bleeding for the first several months of treatment, especially in younger women entering menopause. For these women, and for some other women, planned cyclic bleeding is more acceptable. In these women, progesterone is usually added to estrogen for the first 12 calendar days of the month.''Patches and spray mists (Transdermal Therapy)''Hormone therapy (HT) skin patches are to be worn on a continuous basis. Newer patches need to be changed once or twice per week. Combination estrogen/progesterone patches are available for women who have not undergone hysterectomy to prevent ''cancer of the uterus''. Patches are as effective as oral hormone therapy (HT) for controlling hot flashes. Spray mists for ET are available as a transdermal spray used once daily.''Vaginal Tablets rings, and Creams''Estrogen vaginal tablets and creams are generally prescribed nightly for 2 weeks, and then reduced to twice per week as a long-term ""maintenance therapy."" There is a low level of absorption of estrogen into the body with the use of vaginal preparations as directed. Circulating blood levels of estrogen are slightly increased from vaginal estrogen use, and the long-term safety of vaginal estrogen rings, creams and tablets has not been clearly established (for example risk of uterine cancer, heart disease, or breast cancer). For this reason, occurrence of vaginal bleeding during any type of vaginal estrogen use should be promptly evaluated.''Vaginal estrogen rings are approved to treat genital dryness and irritation that can occur due to the lack of estrogen in women after menopause. A higher dose vaginal ring is available to treat hot flashes, so the hormone released from this higher dose ring clearly reaches sufficient levels to affect other parts of the body besides the genital area. The vaginal ring remains in place for 12 weeks, after which it can be changed by either the woman herself or her physician. The long-term safety of estrogen rings is not yet clear, but there is a low level of absorption of the hormone into the bloodstream with use of the vaginal estrogen ring.''Bioidentical hormone therapy''There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Who should take hormone therapy (HT)?," Women with hot flashes , especially when they are causing sleep disturbance, can consider hormone therapy (HT). Estrogen given short-term is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, and benefit of short-term (less than 5 years) use outweighs potential risks for most women. Because the risks outweigh the benefits of long-term hormone therapy (HT) for most women, women who are at risk of, or who have been diagnosed with, osteoporosis should talk to their doctors about non-estrogen medications such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), teriparatide (Forteo), and calcitonin (Miacalcin) in preventing and treating osteoporosis. Women with vaginal dryness or itching due to menopause can consider HT. Oral pills, skin patches, gel, or vaginal forms of estrogen can be used. Women who only have vaginal menopause symptoms and are not experiencing hot flashes should pick a vaginal form of estrogen, whereas women with both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms can use any form of ET. Sometimes, if a woman has both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms, both oral and vaginal forms of ET will be prescribed together, especially if vaginal symptoms do not improve with oral ET alone. It is recommended that women who do choose to take hormone therapy should take the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period possible."
Who should not take hormone therapy (HT)?," Contrary to common myth, women with high blood pressure that is controlled by medication can take hormone therapy (HT) because hormone therapy (HT) does not cause significant elevations in blood pressure. A major medical reason for not taking hormone therapy (HT) is a personal medical history of breast cancer or uterus cancer. Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding should have an evaluation prior to embarking on hormone therapy (HT) to exclude the presence of cancer of the uterus. Similarly, routine mammograms and breast examinations are important to exclude the presence of breast cancer. While hormone therapy (HT) may be used in women with migraines or liver disease, certain types of hormone therapy (HT) (often a patch or vaginal form) may be chosen to try to avoid aggravating these conditions. Women should not be taking hormone therapy (HT) to prevent heart disease, and should initiate hormone therapy (HT) only with caution if they already have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (such as past heart attack), as hormone therapy (HT) may be increase the risk of heart attacks. Women with a personal history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) should avoid hormone therapy (HT). Women with phosopholipid antibodies, including cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, should not take HT because of the added risk of blood clotting and thrombosis."
What medical checkups are advised for women on hormone therapy (HT)?,"'\tAll women receiving hormone therapy (HT) should undergo a medical checkup every year. At that time, the doctor or nurse will perform a breast exam and order a ''mammogram'' (a special X-ray picture of the breasts) to check for masses in the breasts that might possibly be cancer. At, or even prior to these check-ups, a woman should discuss her bleeding pattern with her physician to be sure it is within the expected pattern for her specific type of hormone therapy (HT). Other routine screening evaluations may also be performed at this annual check-up.' "
What if a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT)?,"'If a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT), there are other methods to deal with the symptoms of menopause. Although hormone therapy (HT) is by far superior to other medications in relieving hot flashes, other prescription non-hormonal medications can also reduce hot flashes. Likewise, personal lubrication products such as a water-soluble jelly (not petroleum jelly) can be applied to the vagina to reduce dryness.''A woman may also want to ask her doctor about non-hormonal prescription osteoporosis medications. These new treatments appear safe and effective in preventing ''fractures''.' "

The increase in risk of breast cancer associated with hormone therapy (HT) likely increases with duration of use and is especially increased with five or more years of use. Heart disease: Even though hormone therapy (HT) lowers the bad LDL cholesterol and raises the good HDL cholesterol, hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of heart attacks in women who already have heart disease, as well as in women who do not have known heart disease. Hormone therapy (HT) does not prevent heart attack based on recent research from the Women's Health Initiative. Abnormal vaginal bleeding: Women on hormone therapy (HT) are more likely than other postmenopausal women to experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. What is called ""abnormal bleeding"" depends on the type of hormone therapy (HT). With cyclic therapy, in which monthly bleeding is expected, bleeding is abnormal if it occurs when it is not expected or is excessively heavy or long in duration.

When abnormal bleeding occurs, a doctor usually takes a sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrial biopsy) to rule out an abnormality or cancer in the uterus. This procedure is usually done in the office. After the evaluation is done, if nothing is found to be wrong, hormone therapy (HT) doses will often be adjusted to minimize further abnormal bleeding. Stroke: Hormone therapy (HT) slightly increased the risk of stroke in women studied in the Women's Health Initiative. The WHI predicted that there were 8 extra strokes per 10,000 women taking hormone therapy (HT) for one year, compared to women taking a placebo (sugar pill). Because of the possibility of increased breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease risks, women who have no major menopause symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT). The effects of other types of hormone therapy (HT) (aside from the Women's Health Initiative types) on breast cancer risk are still unclear."
How is hormone therapy (HT) prescribed?,"""Doctors usually prescribe hormone therapy (HT) as a combination of estrogen and another\xa0 female hormone, progesterone. Synthetic progesterone compounds are referred to as progestins. Long term estrogen use without progesterone increases the risk of uterine cancer (endometrial cancer), whereas addition of progesterone counteracts this risk. Therefore estrogen without progestin is usually only recommended for women who have had their uterus removed (hysterectomy). Estrogen is available as pills, tablets, patches, creams, mist sprays, or vaginal preparations (vaginal rings, vaginal tablets, or vaginal cream). The choice of estrogen preparation recommended by the doctor depends on the women's symptoms. For instance, vaginal creams, vaginal tablets, and vaginal rings are used for vaginal dryness, while pills or patches are used to ease hot flashes. Estrogen pills are also useful for vaginal dryness and are sometimes used along with vaginal creams, tablets, or rings.""'Although progestin is usually taken in pill form, it is also available, together with estrogen, in patch form.'""Doctors may prescribe different schedules for taking hormone therapy (HT). Every woman's hormone therapy (HT) treatment and schedule should be individualized based on her particular situation. Below are some standard forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are used:""'Pills (Oral Therapy)''In order to avoid monthly vaginal bleeding, some women choose to take small doses of estrogen and progesterone together every day. This is called ''daily continuous therapy.'' Sometimes, daily continuous therapy can cause some irregular, unexpected vaginal bleeding for the first several months of treatment, especially in younger women entering menopause. For these women, and for some other women, planned cyclic bleeding is more acceptable. In these women, progesterone is usually added to estrogen for the first 12 calendar days of the month.''Patches and spray mists (Transdermal Therapy)''Hormone therapy (HT) skin patches are to be worn on a continuous basis. Newer patches need to be changed once or twice per week. Combination estrogen/progesterone patches are available for women who have not undergone hysterectomy to prevent ''cancer of the uterus''. Patches are as effective as oral hormone therapy (HT) for controlling hot flashes. Spray mists for ET are available as a transdermal spray used once daily.''Vaginal Tablets rings, and Creams''Estrogen vaginal tablets and creams are generally prescribed nightly for 2 weeks, and then reduced to twice per week as a long-term ""maintenance therapy."" There is a low level of absorption of estrogen into the body with the use of vaginal preparations as directed. Circulating blood levels of estrogen are slightly increased from vaginal estrogen use, and the long-term safety of vaginal estrogen rings, creams and tablets has not been clearly established (for example risk of uterine cancer, heart disease, or breast cancer). For this reason, occurrence of vaginal bleeding during any type of vaginal estrogen use should be promptly evaluated.''Vaginal estrogen rings are approved to treat genital dryness and irritation that can occur due to the lack of estrogen in women after menopause. A higher dose vaginal ring is available to treat hot flashes, so the hormone released from this higher dose ring clearly reaches sufficient levels to affect other parts of the body besides the genital area. The vaginal ring remains in place for 12 weeks, after which it can be changed by either the woman herself or her physician. The long-term safety of estrogen rings is not yet clear, but there is a low level of absorption of the hormone into the bloodstream with use of the vaginal estrogen ring.''Bioidentical hormone therapy''There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Who should take hormone therapy (HT)?," Women with hot flashes , especially when they are causing sleep disturbance, can consider hormone therapy (HT). Estrogen given short-term is the most effective treatment for hot flashes, and benefit of short-term (less than 5 years) use outweighs potential risks for most women. Because the risks outweigh the benefits of long-term hormone therapy (HT) for most women, women who are at risk of, or who have been diagnosed with, osteoporosis should talk to their doctors about non-estrogen medications such as alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), raloxifene (Evista), teriparatide (Forteo), and calcitonin (Miacalcin) in preventing and treating osteoporosis. Women with vaginal dryness or itching due to menopause can consider HT. Oral pills, skin patches, gel, or vaginal forms of estrogen can be used. Women who only have vaginal menopause symptoms and are not experiencing hot flashes should pick a vaginal form of estrogen, whereas women with both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms can use any form of ET. Sometimes, if a woman has both hot flashes and vaginal symptoms, both oral and vaginal forms of ET will be prescribed together, especially if vaginal symptoms do not improve with oral ET alone. It is recommended that women who do choose to take hormone therapy should take the lowest effective dose for the shortest time period possible."
Who should not take hormone therapy (HT)?," Contrary to common myth, women with high blood pressure that is controlled by medication can take hormone therapy (HT) because hormone therapy (HT) does not cause significant elevations in blood pressure. A major medical reason for not taking hormone therapy (HT) is a personal medical history of breast cancer or uterus cancer. Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding should have an evaluation prior to embarking on hormone therapy (HT) to exclude the presence of cancer of the uterus. Similarly, routine mammograms and breast examinations are important to exclude the presence of breast cancer. While hormone therapy (HT) may be used in women with migraines or liver disease, certain types of hormone therapy (HT) (often a patch or vaginal form) may be chosen to try to avoid aggravating these conditions. Women should not be taking hormone therapy (HT) to prevent heart disease, and should initiate hormone therapy (HT) only with caution if they already have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease (such as past heart attack), as hormone therapy (HT) may be increase the risk of heart attacks. Women with a personal history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the veins) should avoid hormone therapy (HT). Women with phosopholipid antibodies, including cardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant, should not take HT because of the added risk of blood clotting and thrombosis."
What medical checkups are advised for women on hormone therapy (HT)?,"'\tAll women receiving hormone therapy (HT) should undergo a medical checkup every year. At that time, the doctor or nurse will perform a breast exam and order a ''mammogram'' (a special X-ray picture of the breasts) to check for masses in the breasts that might possibly be cancer. At, or even prior to these check-ups, a woman should discuss her bleeding pattern with her physician to be sure it is within the expected pattern for her specific type of hormone therapy (HT). Other routine screening evaluations may also be performed at this annual check-up.' "
What if a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT)?,"'If a woman decides against hormone therapy (HT), there are other methods to deal with the symptoms of menopause. Although hormone therapy (HT) is by far superior to other medications in relieving hot flashes, other prescription non-hormonal medications can also reduce hot flashes. Likewise, personal lubrication products such as a water-soluble jelly (not petroleum jelly) can be applied to the vagina to reduce dryness.''A woman may also want to ask her doctor about non-hormonal prescription osteoporosis medications. These new treatments appear safe and effective in preventing ''fractures''.' "
What is menopause?,"'Menopause'"" is the stage in a woman's life when ""'menstruation'' stops and she can no longer bear children. During ''menopause'', the body produces less of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. After ''menopause'', the lower hormone levels cause the monthly menstrual periods to stop and gradually eliminate the possibility of ''becoming pregnant''. These fluctuations in hormone levels can also cause troublesome symptoms, such as hot flashes (a sudden sensation of warmth, sometimes associated with flushing, and often followed by ''sweating'') and ''sleep'' disturbance. Sometimes women experience other symptoms, such as ''vaginal dryness'' and ''mood changes''. ''While many women encounter little or no trouble during menopause, others endure moderate to severe discomfort. ' "
Does menopause cause bone loss?,"'The lower estrogen levels of menopause can lead to progressive bone loss that is especially rapid in the first five years after menopause. Some bone loss in both men and women is normal as people age. Lack of estrogen after menopause adds another strain on the bones in addition to the usual age-related bone loss. When bone loss is severe, a condition called ''osteoporosis'' weakens bones and renders them susceptible to breaking. ' "
What are estrogen therapy and hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Estrogen, in pill, patch, or gel form, is the single most effective therapy for suppressing hot flashes. ''The term estrogen therapy, or ET, refers to estrogen administered alone. Because ET alone can cause uterine cancer (endometrial cancer) (see below), a progestin is administered together with estrogen in women who have a uterus (those who have not undergone a ''hysterectomy'') to eliminate the increased risk. Thus, the term ''estrogen/progestin therapy'', or EPT, refers to a combination of estrogen and progestin therapy, as is given to a woman who still has a uterus. This method of prescribing hormones is also known as combination hormone therapy. ''The term hormone therapy (HT) is a more general term that is used to refer to either administration of estrogen alone (women who have had a hysterectomy), or combined ''estrogen/progestin'' therapy (women with a uterus).''All forms of hormone therapy (HT) that are FDA-approved for therapy of hot flashes are similarly effective in suppressing hot flashes. ' "
What are the side effects and risks of hormone therapy (HT)?,"'Women can experience side effects during hormone therapy; these can be divided into more minor side effects, and more serious side effects. The more minor side effects are more common than the serious side effects, and are generally perceived by women as ""annoying."" These symptoms include:''It is still controversial which of these side effects are due to the estrogen component as compared to the progesterone component. Therefore, if side effects persist for a few months, the doctor will often alter either the progesterone or the estrogen part of the hormone therapy (HT).''Contrary to common belief, recent research has confirmed that women who take commonly prescribed doses of hormone therapy (HT) are no more likely to gain weight than women not taking hormone therapy (HT). This is probably because menopause or ''aging'' itself is associated with ''weight gain'', regardless of whether or not a woman takes hormone therapy.''The more serious health concerns for women undergoing hormone therapy (HT) include:' headaches, nausea, breast pain. Hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of vein clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis ) and blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolus) by about 2 or 3 fold. However, it is important to remember that these conditions are extremely rare in healthy women. Thus, the true increase in risk for healthy women is minimal. Women with a personal or family history of these blood clots should review this issue when considering hormone therapy (HT). Uterine Cancer (endometrial cancer): Research shows that women who have their uterus and use estrogen alone are at risk for endometrial cancer. Today, however, most doctors prescribe the combination of estrogen and progestin. Progestin protects against endometrial cancer. . If there is a particular reason why a woman with a uterus cannot take some form of progesterone, her doctor will take a sample of tissue from her uterus (endometrial biopsy) to check for cancer annually while she is taking estrogen. Women without a uterus (women who have had a hysterectomy) have no risk of endometrial cancer. Breast cancer: Recent research indicates that hormone therapy (HT), and especially EPT, increases the risk of breast cancer, although the increase in risk is very small. For example, the Women's Health Initiative, a reliable large study of hormone therapy (HT) in menopausal women, predicted that there were approximately eight extra cases per 10,000 women who took hormone therapy (HT) for 1 year, compared to women taking a placebo pill. The increase in risk of breast cancer associated with hormone therapy (HT) likely increases with duration of use and is especially increased with five or more years of use. Heart disease: Even though hormone therapy (HT) lowers the bad LDL cholesterol and raises the good HDL cholesterol, hormone therapy (HT) increases the risk of heart attacks in women who already have heart disease, as well as in women who do not have known heart disease. Hormone therapy (HT) does not prevent heart attack based on recent research from the Women's Health Initiative. Abnormal vaginal bleeding: Women on hormone therapy (HT) are more likely than other postmenopausal women to experience abnormal vaginal bleeding. What is called ""abnormal bleeding"" depends on the type of hormone therapy (HT). With cyclic therapy, in which monthly bleeding is expected, bleeding is abnormal if it occurs when it is not expected or is excessively heavy or long in duration. With daily continuous therapy, irregular bleeding can last for six months to a year, therefore, irregular bleeding that lasts for more than a year is considered abnormal. When abnormal bleeding occurs, a doctor usually takes a sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrial biopsy) to rule out an abnormality or cancer in the uterus. This procedure is usually done in the office. After the evaluation is done, if nothing is found to be wrong, hormone therapy (HT) doses will often be adjusted to minimize further abnormal bleeding. Stroke: Hormone therapy (HT) slightly increased the risk of stroke in women studied in the Women's Health Initiative. The WHI predicted that there were 8 extra strokes per 10,000 women taking hormone therapy (HT) for one year, compared to women taking a placebo (sugar pill). Because of the possibility of increased breast cancer, stroke, and heart disease risks, women who have no major menopause symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT). The effects of other types of hormone therapy (HT) (aside from the Women's Health Initiative types) on breast cancer risk are still unclear."

What is Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)?,"'Endoscopic ''Ultrasound'' (EUS) combines ''endoscopy'' and ultrasound in order to obtain images and information about the digestive tract and the surrounding tissue and organs. Endoscopy refers to the procedure of inserting a long flexible tube via the mouth or the rectum to visualize the digestive tract (for further information, please visit the ''Colonoscopy'' and ''Flexible Sigmoidoscopy'' articles),  whereas ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the organs and structures inside the body such as ovaries, uterus, ''liver'', gallbladder, pancreas, or ''aorta''.''Traditional ultrasound sends sound waves to the organ(s) and back with a transducer placed on the skin overlying the organ(s) of interest. Images obtained by traditional ultrasound are not always of high quality.  In EUS a small ultrasound transducer is installed on the tip of the endoscope. By inserting the endoscope into the upper or the lower digestive tract one can obtain high quality ultrasound images of the organs inside the body.''Placing the transducer on the tip of an endoscope allows the transducer to get close to the organs inside the body.  Because of the proximity of the EUS transducer to the organ(s) of interest, the images obtained are frequently more accurate and more detailed than the ones obtained by traditional ultrasound.  The EUS also can obtain information about the layers of the intestinal wall as well as adjacent areas such as ''lymph nodes'' and the blood vessels.''Other uses of EUS include studying the flow of blood inside blood vessels using Doppler ultrasound, and to obtain tissue samples by passing a special needle, under ultrasound guidance, into ''enlarged lymph nodes'' or suspicious tumors.  The tissue or cells obtained by the needle can be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. The process of obtaining tissue with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).' "
When is EUS useful?,"'The uses for EUS are still being developed and, presently, it is being utilized in some of the following situations:''Staging of ''cancer'' is becoming an important use of EUS. The prognosis of a ''cancer'' victim is related to the stage of the ''cancer'' at the time of cancer detection. For example, early stage ''colon cancer'' refers to cancer confined to the inner surface of the colon before it is spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs. Therefore early stage colon cancer can be completely resected with good chances for cure. However, if cancer is detected at later stages, the cancer tissues have already penetrated the colon wall and invaded neighboring organs and lymph nodes, or have spread to distant organs such as liver and ''lungs''. Complete surgical excision becomes highly unlikely.  EUS can provide information regarding the depth of penetration of the cancer and spread of cancer to adjacent tissues and lymph nodes, information useful for staging.'  Staging of cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas and rectum. 
 Staging of lung cancer. 
 Evaluating chronic pancreatitis and other masses or cysts of the pancreas. 
 Studying bile duct abnormalities including stones in the bile duct or gallbladder, or bile duct, gallbladder, or liver tumors. 
 Studying the muscles of the lower rectum and anal canal in evaluating reasons for fecal incontinence. 
 Studying 'submucosal lesions' such as nodules or 'bumps' that may be hiding in the intestinal wall covered by normal appearing lining of the intestinal tract."
What is the preparation for EUS?,"'Your doctor will want to know about your health status especially if you have any ''allergies'', other significant health problems such as ''heart disease'', lung disease, or ''diabetes mellitus''.You will also be asked about ''allergies'' to ''iodine'' or shellfish as, under certain circumstances, iodine containing contrast material may be used. If there is a possibility of fine needle aspiration (FNA), the doctor will want to check your blood for proper clotting. It is important to inform your doctor of any family history of bleeding problems or if you are taking medications that interfere with blood clotting (such as ''Coumadin'') or platelet function (such as ''aspirin'', ''Motrin'', ''ibuprofen'', ''Aleve'', and other ''NSAIDs''). The wisest approach is to inform your doctor of any prescription or non-prescription medication you might be taking. Antibiotics are usually not required except in patients with certain ''heart'' valve problems.''EUS is performed with sedation so you will not be able to return to work or to drive for 24 hours. It also means that you will need someone to take you home as this is usually an out-patient procedure.''You will need to have an empty stomach, which means no oral intake for 6 or more hours. In case of a rectal EUS, you will probably need to take some enemas or laxatives. In either case, full instructions will be given to you.' "
How is EUS performed?,"'Upon arrival at the endoscopy center, the nurse or the doctor will discuss the procedure and answer any questions. You will then be asked to sign a consent form indicating you were informed about the procedure, its alternatives, and its risks. You will undress and put on a hospital gown. An IV will be placed in a vein and kept open with a slow drip of IV fluid. This IV will be used to administer the ''sedatives'' or other required medication. Anesthesia is rarely used. You will then be taken into the procedure room and, after the administration of the sedation, the EUS will be carried out. Small electrode patches will be placed on your skin for the monitoring of your pulse and a\xa0''blood pressure''\xa0cuff will be placed as well as a monitor on your finger to follow your blood oxygen.''Once sleepy, the special endoscope will be inserted and the procedure started. Due to the sedation, you will only feel minimal discomfort, if any, during the entire procedure. The physician will observe the inside of your intestinal tract on a TV monitor and the ultrasound image on another monitor. The entire procedure generally takes 30 to 90 minutes depending on the complexity and whether fine needle aspiration (FNA) is performed.''After the procedure, you will be sleepy for up to one hour and be unable to drink or walk. Once you are fully awake, the doctor will discuss with you and, if desired the person with you, the findings of the procedure. Barring any rare complications, when you are fully awake, your companion will be able to take you home where you should rest for the remainder of the day. Light meals and fluids are allowed. You may feel ''bloated'' from the carbon dioxide that may have been used to distend your abdomen, but this feeling will only be temporary. Should your throat be mildly sore, for a day or two, salt-water gargles will provide relief. You should call your doctor if concerned about your progress or having severe ''pain'', ''vomiting'', passage or ''vomiting'' of blood, ''chills'' or ''fever''. If EUS was particularly difficult or complicated you may be kept in the hospital overnight. The endoscopist will discuss this with you, when you wake up.' "
What are the risks of EUS ?,"'Like other endoscopy procedures, EUS is safe and well tolerated.  No procedure is without risk, but complications with EUS are quite rare. Complication rate for EUS without the fine needle aspiration is about one in two thousand. This is similar to the complication rate of other endoscopy procedures. Sometimes, patients can develop reactions such as ''hives'', skin ''rash'' or ''nausea'' to the medications used during EUS.  A lump may appear in the area of the vein where the IV was placed. This usually resolves over time. Should it persist, you should contact your physician. The main complication of serious note is perforation (making a hole in the intestinal wall) that may require surgical repair. This is quite rare and all precautions are taken to avoid it.''When FNA is performed complications occur more often but are still uncommon  (0.5-1.0%). Passing a needle through the gut wall may cause minor bleeding. If unusual bleeding occurs, the patient may be hospitalized briefly for observation, but blood transfusions are rarely needed. Infection is another rare complication of FNA. Infection can occur during aspiration of fluid from cysts and antibiotics may be given before the procedure. If the FNA is performed on the pancreas, ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas) can rarely occur. Pancreatitis calls for hospitalization, observation, rest, IV fluid, and medication for ''abdominal pain''. It usually resolves spontaneously in a few days.' "
What should you know about Eustachian tubes?,"'The Eustachian tube originates in the rear of the nose adjacent to the soft palate, runs a slightly uphill course, and ends in the middle ear space. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear space to the rear of the nose near the soft palate. The middle ear space is the hollowed out portion of the skull bone that contains the ''hearing'' apparatus and is covered on one side by the eardrum.''Cartilage provides the supporting structure for the first two-thirds of the Eustachian tube, with the last third (the part closest to the middle ear space) being made of bone.''In adults, the Eustachian tube is approximately 35 mm long (1.3 inches) and approximately 3 mm in diameter (less than 1/10 inch).''The tissue that lines the Eustachian tube is similar to that inside the nasal ''cavity'' and may respond the same way (swelling and mucous production) when presented with similar stimuli. Normally, the Eustachian tube is closed, but it can become partially or completely blocked as a consequence of common colds or ''allergies''.''Partial or complete blockage of the Eustachian tube can cause sensations of popping, clicking, and ear fullness. Altitude changes can cause symptoms in persons with Eustachian tube problems. Several maneuvers can be done to improve Eustachian tube function.''The Eustachian tube was named in honor of the 16th century Italian anatomist Eustachius. Sources credit Alcmaeon of Sparta as the first to describe the structure in approximately 400 BC.'  "
What is the anatomy of Eustachian tubes (pictures)?,"'The primary function of the Eustachian tube is to ventilate the middle ear space, ensuring that its pressure remains at near normal environmental air pressure. The secondary function of the Eustachian tube is to drain any accumulated secretions, infection, or debris from the middle ear space. Several small muscles located in the back of the throat and palate control the opening and closing of the Eustachian tube. Swallowing and yawning cause contractions of these muscles located in the back of the throat and help regulate Eustachian tube function. If it were not for the Eustachian tube, the middle ear ''cavity'' would be an isolated air pocket inside the head that would be vulnerable to every change in air pressure and lead to unhealthy middle ear space function.''Normally, the nasal opening of the Eustachian tube is closed, which helps prevent the inadvertent contamination of the middle ear space by the normal secretions found in the back of the nose. A dysfunctional Eustachian tube that is always open is called a ""patulous"" Eustachian tube. Patients with this rare condition are plagued by chronic ''ear infections''. A much more common problem is a failure of the Eustachian tube to effectively regulate air pressure. Partial or complete blockage of the Eustachian tube can cause sensations of popping, clicking, and ear fullness and occasionally moderate to severe ear ''pain''. Such intense ''pain'' is most frequently experienced during sudden air pressure changes during airplane travel, particularly during take-off and landing. Young children may describe the popping sensation as ""a tickle in my ear"" or ""my ears are ''itching''.""''If the Eustachian tube function worsens, air pressure in the middle ear falls, and the ear feels full and sounds are perceived as muffled. Eventually, a vacuum is created which can then cause fluid to be drawn down the Eustachian tube into the middle ear space (termed serous ''otitis media''). If the fluid becomes infected, the common ''ear infection'' (suppurative otitis media) develops.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of blocked Eustachian tubes?,"'People with some Eustachian tube dysfunction may experience signs and symptoms, for example,'   intermittent ear fullness, ear-popping or cracking, pain, mild hearing loss (an attenuation of sound), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and occasionally poor balance"
What causes blocked Eustachian tubes?,"'Eustachian tube problems and the associated ''ear infections'' are among the most common problems seen by health-care professionals. Many people have chronic problems regulating middle ear pressure. The Eustachian tube can be blocked, or obstructed, for a variety of reasons, for example:' The most common cause is a ""cold"" (upper respiratory infection). Sinus infections and allergies may also cause swelling of the tissue lining the Eustachian tube. Simply put, a stuffy nose leads to stuffy ears. Children are particularly prone to Eustachian tube blockage because their tubes are narrower in diameter, more horizontal in orientation, and closer at the nasal opening of the Eustachian tube to the adenoids. Adenoid tissue in the back of the nose near the Eustachian tube can act as a reservoir for bacteria, contributing to recurrent ear infections. Enlarged adenoids obstructing the opening of the Eustachian tube may also be present. Adenoid removal (adenoidectomy) is frequently recommended in children with chronic ear infections (chronic otitis media). Rarely, masses or tumors in the skull base or nasopharynx can lead to Eustachian tube obstruction. Excessively small Eustachian tubes (as may afflict children with Down Syndrome) Smoking is associated with damage to the cilia that sweep mucus and debris from the middle ear space via the Eustachian tube to the back of the nose where it may be expelled. Causes of Eustachian tube dysfunction range from allergies to excessively small Eustachian tubes (as may afflict children with Down Syndrome)."
"What home remedies treat pain, function, and help clear blocked Eustachian tubes?","'Several maneuvers may be done to improve the Eustachian tube function and thus aid in the equalization of air pressure.' The simple act of swallowing activates the muscles in the back of the throat that help open the Eustachian tube. Any activity that promotes swallowing can help open the Eustachian tube, for example, chewing gum, drinking, or eating. Yawning is even more effective because it is a stronger muscle activator. If the ears still feel full, the person can try to forcibly open the Eustachian tube by taking a deep breath and blowing while pinching your nostrils and closing the mouth. When a ""pop"" is felt, you know you have succeeded. If problems persist despite trying to forcibly open the tubes you may need to seek medical attention. If you feel dizzy performing this maneuver, then stop and discuss this with your doctor. If you have a cold, sinus infection, ear infection, or suffering from allergies, it may be advisable to postpone air travel. Similarly, individuals with Eustachian tube problems may find such sports as scuba diving painful, and in some situations quite dangerous. Babies traveling on airplanes cannot intentionally pop their ears but may do so if they are sucking on a bottle or pacifier. Crying, similar in function to yawning, will also enable equalization of air pressure."
What is the medical treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction?,"'An evaluation with an ''allergy'' specialist or Allergist may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of the Eustachian tube dysfunction or blockage.'   Many people with Eustachian tube blockage or dysfunction that travel use a decongestant pill or nasal spray an hour prior to takeoff, and if necessary, prior to descent. The decongestant acts to shrink the membranes lining the nose and throat, allowing the ears to equalize more easily. Similarly, people experiencing chronic daily problems with Eustachian tube dysfunction can benefit from aggressive control of allergies (with antihistamines, decongestants, and prescription nasal sprays). Acid reflux control may help some people if their reflux is irritating the lining in the back of the nose and Eustachian tube opening."
Will surgery cure Eustachian tube dysfunction?,"'In severe situations, a ""pressure equalization tube"" (PET) can be surgically placed in the eardrum, replacing the role of a functioning Eustachian tube, and thus guaranteeing equalization of middle ear pressure. This procedure is most commonly seen in young children who experience recurrent ear infections as a consequence of a poorly functioning Eustachian tube.' "
What changes can you make to avoid Eustachian tube dysfunction at altitudes?,"   A rapid change in altitude, and thus air pressure is equalized across the eardrum by a normally functioning Eustachian tube. A healthy tube opens frequently and widely enough to equalize these changes in air pressure. With altitude changes during the descent of an airplane, air pressure increases as the plane lowers. The air pressure change pushes the eardrum inward (retraction). Persons with Eustachian tube blockage can develop the fullness of the ear, dulled hearing, and possibly pain when this occurs. Those with poorly functioning Eustachian tubes may experience similar symptoms when riding in elevators, driving through the mountains, or diving to the bottom of a swimming pool. Scuba divers learn tricks to equalize their ear pressures."
What is a breast self-exam?,"""A breast self-exam is a woman's examination of her own breasts. Breast self-exams were formerly encouraged to help women detect ""'breast cancer'', but experts and medical organizations do not agree about whether this is necessary or helps save lives. Many women feel comfortable doing breast self-exams as a way to monitor their own health.'  "
Is a breast self-exam necessary?,"'As mentioned, agencies that issue health practice guidelines do not agree on whether doing breast self-exams are helpful in terms of ''cancer'' detection or saving lives from ''cancer''. The best way to detect ''breast cancer'' is by having regular mammograms combined with a breast examination by a health care professional.''According to the American ''Cancer'' Society, breast self exam is an option for women starting in their 20s, but women should be informed about the limitations as well as the benefits of this practice. According to the ACS, ""Research has shown that BSE plays a small role in finding breast cancer compared with finding a ''breast lump'' by chance or simply being aware of what is normal for each woman.""' "
How should one do a breast self-exam?,"'If you choose to do breast self-exams, your doctor can help show you the best technique. Many women find it convenient to do the exam while bathing or showering. The best time to do the exam is 3 to 5 days after the start of the ''menstrual period'', since the breasts are not as tender or lumpy at this time of the cycle. Women who no longer have menstrual periods should do the exam about the same time each month.''Part of a breast self-exam involves examination of the appearance of the breasts in a mirror. For this step, it is best to stand in front of a mirror and examine your breasts in different positions: with your arms relaxed by your side, with your hands pressed down on your hips, leaning forward with chest muscles tightened, and with hands behind the head and chest muscles tightened. Turning from side to side may be helpful to view all angles. Look for any changes like sores on the skin, dimpling or puckering of the skin, or changes in skin color. Look for discharge or changes in the skin of the ''nipple'"" areas, as well. Don't forget to examine the skin underneath the breasts.""""Next, use the flat part of the fingers to feel your breasts, following an up and down or circular motion until you have examined all breast tissue from collarbone to the lower border of the breasts. Examine the armpit areas too since these may contain breast tissue. Look for lumps or irregularities in density or any changes since your last exam. Feel beneath the nipple for any changes. It's best to do this both standing (with your hand on your hip; use the opposite hand to do the exam) and while lying down."" "
What if I find a lump or abnormality on my breast self-exam?,"'See your doctor if you find any abnormality or unexplained change in your breasts. Most breast lumps are benign (non-cancerous), but it is important to have your doctor evaluate any changes you observe during the breast self-exam.' "
What is a pelvic exam?,"""A pelvic exam is an examination of a woman's genital system. A pelvic exam examines organs including the vulva, vagina, uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes; the bladder and rectum are also usually included in the exam. A pelvic exam involves visual examination of the external genitalia and an internal visual exam of the vaginal walls and cervix using a speculum to open the vaginal canal. It also involves palpation, or examination by feeling the size and shape of the pelvic organs."" "
Why is a pelvic exam performed?,"'A pelvic exam may be performed as part of a regular checkup (or wellness visit) or can be done to investigate symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, unusual ''vaginal discharge'', or ''pain''. Pelvic exams are also done during ''pregnancy'' check-ups. Pelvic exams are necessary for ''cervical cancer'' screenings, in which a sample of cells from the uterine opening (cervix) are taken for microscopic examination (known as the ''Pap smear'' or ''Pap test'').' "
What conditions can be evaluated with a pelvic exam?,"'A pelvic exam can be useful in the evaluation and diagnosis of multiple conditions. ''Some examples include:'  sexually-transmitted infections, such 
as gonorrhea,
	syphilis, 
	Trichomonas, 
	human papillomavirus, and 
	Chlamydia 
bacterial vaginosis yeast infections urinary tract infections abnormal uterine bleeding fibroid tumors ovarian cysts  infertility polycystic ovary syndrome rectal bleeding endometriosis tumors of the genital organs 
genital warts pregnancy ectopic pregnancy"
How is a pelvic exam performed?,"""There is no special preparation needed for a pelvic exam. A pelvic exam is performed in the doctor's office and takes only a few minutes. The woman undergoing the exam lies on an examination table, covered with a sheet. The doctor and/or nurse will help the woman get in position for the speculum examination, which involves bending the knees and placing the ""'feet'' in metal supports on the side of the exam table. The speculum is a metal or ''plastic'' device that is inserted into the vagina to allow the vaginal walls and cervix to be seen. A small sample of the cells of the cervix is taken by a brush or a small spatula for the Pap test. While there may be some discomfort, a pelvic exam should not be painful. ''A bimanual exam is another component of the pelvic exam. This involves placement of two fingers inside the vaginal canal and pressing on the lower abdomen with the other hand to palpate (feel) the pelvic organs. A rectal exam is also often performed at this time. The bimanual exam may reveal enlarged organs or tissue masses.' "
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
The importance of physical activity,"'The evidence is growing and is more convincing than ever! People of all ages who are generally inactive can improve their health and well-being by becoming active at a moderate-intensity on a regular basis. ''Regular physical activity substantially reduces the risk of dying of coronary ''heart disease'"", the nation's leading cause of death, and decreases the risk for ""'stroke'', ''colon cancer'', ''diabetes'', and ''high blood pressure''. It also helps to control weight; contributes to healthy bones, muscles, and joints; reduces falls among older adults; helps to relieve the ''pain'' of ''arthritis''; reduces symptoms of ''anxiety'' and ''depression''; and is associated with fewer hospitalizations, physician visits, and medications. Moreover, physical activity need not be strenuous to be beneficial; people of all ages benefit from participating in regular, moderate-intensity physical activity, such as 30 minutes of brisk ''walking'' five or more times a week. ''Despite the proven benefits of physical activity, more than 50% of American adults do not get enough physical activity to provide health benefits. 25% of adults are not active at all in their leisure time. Activity decreases with age and is less common among women than men and among those with lower income and less education. ''Insufficient physical activity is not limited to adults. More than a third of young people in grades 9-12 do not regularly engage in vigorous-intensity physical activity.''This section explains why you should be active, how inactivity may hurt your health, and how physical activity can benefit everyone. ' "
Why should I be active?,"'""It\'s easier to maintain your health than regain it."" -Dr. Ken Cooper''Physical activity can bring you many health benefits. People who enjoy participating in moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity physical activity on a regular basis benefit by lowering their risk of developing coronary ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', non-''insulin''-dependent (type 2) ''diabetes mellitus'', ''high blood pressure'', and colon ''cancer'' by 30-50% (USDHHS, 1996). Additionally, active people have lower premature death rates than people who are the least active.''Regular physical activity can improve health and reduce the risk of premature death in the following ways:''Can a lack of physical activity hurt your health? Evidence shows that those who are not physically active are definitely not helping their health, and may likely be hurting it. The closer we look at the health risks associated with a lack of physical activity, the more convincing it is that Americans who are not yet regularly physically active should become active.'

Can everyone benefit from physical activity?,"'""Do it, move it, make it happen. No one ever sat their way to success."" -Unknown''The good news about regular physical activity is that everyone can benefit from it (USDHHS, 1996).'  Older adults: No one is too old to enjoy the benefits of regular physical activity. Evidence indicates that muscle-strengthening exercises can reduce the risk of falling and fracturing bones and can improve the ability to live independently. Parents and children: Parents can help their children maintain a physically active lifestyle by providing encouragement and opportunities for physical activity. Families can plan outings and events that allow and encourage everyone in the family to be active. Teenagers: Regular physical activity improves strength, builds lean muscle, and decreases body fat. Activity can build stronger bones to last a lifetime. People trying to manage their weight: Regular physical activity burns calories while preserving lean muscle mass. Regular physical activity is a key component of any weight-loss or weight-management effort. People with high blood pressure:Regular physical activity helps lower blood pressure. People with physical disabilities, including arthritis: Regular physical activity can help people with chronic, disabling conditions improve their stamina and muscle strength. It also can improve psychological well-being and quality of life by increasing the ability to perform the activities of daily life. Everyone under stress, including persons experiencing anxiety or depression:Regular physical activity improves one's mood, helps relieve depression, and increases feelings of well-being."
"What are the recommendations for increasing fitness for youth, adults, and seniors?","'There is good news for all Americans. Scientific evidence shows that physical activity done at a moderate-intensity level can produce health benefits (USDHHS, 1996). If people have been sedentary, they can improve their health and well-being with regular, moderate levels of activity each day. ''Those who participate in moderate- to vigorous-intensity activities regularly should be encouraged and supported in their efforts to continue. While activity at a higher intensity or performed longer offers more health benefits, this level of activity may not be a realistic goal for everyone, at least not to start with. Many Americans, for whom the term ""''exercise''"" brings up negative images and emotions, can celebrate the good news by setting a new personal goal-achieving and enjoying the benefits of a regularly active lifestyle that includes a variety of moderate- and/or vigorous-intensity activities.''Adults should strive to meet either of the following physical activity recommendations. See ''General Physical Activities Defined By Level of Intensity'' for a chart that lists the intensity levels of many types of activities.''- Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention''/American College of Sports Medicine ''OR ''- Healthy People 2010 '""More good news is that it's never too late to start an active lifestyle. No matter how old you are, how unfit you feel, or how long you've been inactive, research shows that starting a more active lifestyle now through regular, moderate-intensity activity can make you healthier and improve your quality of life. ""'This next section provides guidelines for how active you need to be to gain some benefit and general information on activity levels of Americans. ''Physical activity does not need to be hard to provide some benefit. Participating in moderate-intensity physical activity is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle for people of all ages and abilities. There is no demographic or social group in America that could not benefit from becoming more active. ''The table* below provides recommendations on how to increase your physical activity based on your current activity level. Check it out to see where you are and how you can challenge yourself. ''*Scientific evidence to date supports the statements above.''Moderate-intensity physical activity refers to any activity that ''burns'' 3.5 to 7 Calories per minute (kcal/min) (Ainsworth et al., 2000). These levels are equal to the effort a healthy individual might ''burn'' while walking briskly, mowing the lawn, dancing, ''swimming'' for recreation, or bicycling. ''Vigorous-intensity physical activity refers to any activity that burns more than 7 Calories per minute (kcal/min) (Ainsworth et al., 2000). These levels are equal to the effort a healthy individual might ''burn'' while jogging, engaging in heavy yard work, participating in high-impact aerobic dancing, swimming continuous laps, or bicycling uphill. ''It is recommended that children and adolescents participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity most days of the week, preferably daily.''1''Children and adolescents can choose any type of moderate or higher intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking, playing tag, jumping rope, or swimming, as long as it is adds up to at least one hour a day. ''For children and adolescents, regular physical activity has beneficial effects on the following aspects of health: ''Children and adolescents who are just beginning to be physically active should start out slowly and gradually build to higher levels in order to prevent the risk of injury or feel defeated from unrealistic goals. It is important that children and adolescents are encouraged to be physically active by doing things that interest them. This will help them establish an active lifestyle early on.''1''This physical activity recommendation is from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. '""As a parent, you have an important role in shaping your children's physical activity attitudes and behaviors. Here are some tips to encourage your children to be more physically active.""'Being physically active can prevent and help treat many of the most common chronic medical conditions associated with old age. Physical activity is one of the most important steps older adults can take to maintain physical and ''mental health'' and quality of life. Scientists have proven that being active can help reduce the risk of ''obesity'', high blood pressure, ''diabetes'', ''osteoporosis'', ''stroke'', depression, colon ''cancer'', and premature death. Yet today, more than 60% of older adults are inactive. Older adults face the same obstacles to being more physically active as younger adults but also have special concerns.''Getting older adults to be active is a challenge. The average American lives a long time, but many are sedentary, physically unfit, and experience disability from chronic medical conditions as they age. Physicians and ''exercise'"" experts hear many reasons from older adults as to why they are not active: It doesn't feel good. It makes my arthritic joints hurt. It takes too much time. It's boring. However, older adults need physical activity like everyone else, at least as much as younger adults. In fact, the loss of strength and stamina often attributed to ""'aging'' is in part caused by reduced physical activity. ''Walking groups and physical activity programs especially designed for older adults can help seniors become-and remain active. For example, senior swim clubs and water aerobic classes are excellent activities for people with arthritis.''Strength training'' is recommended for all adults, but it is a vital link to health for older adults. The reason is that strength training prevents sarcopenia, the muscle deterioration that comes with ''aging'', and also helps maintain bone mass. ""Stronger people have better health outcomes,"" noted Dr. David Buchner, Chief of CDC\'s Physical Activity and Health Branch and renowned Gerontologist. However, some elderly people avoid physical activity and become sedentary out of fear of falling and fracturing a bone. Dr. Buchner added that emerging data indicate that physical activity can prevent falls by improving strength, balance, and endurance. ''Keeping Young at Heart Aerobic activity (also known as cardiorespiratory or cardiovascular endurance activity) is also important. It keeps the heart strong, lowers blood pressure, and relieves anxiety and depression. Older adults can obtain significant health benefits with moderate physical activity, such as walking or gardening. ''""We need to make physical activity part of the daily routine for older adults,"" said Dr. Buchner. Health clubs also provide older adults with a variety of opportunities to improve their aerobic ''fitness'', muscular strength, and flexibility. Dr. Buchner adds, ""Traditionally health and fitness facilities have marketed mainly to body-conscious younger adults, who focus on the cosmetic effects. It\'s great to see that health clubs have developed more programs for older adults, and we hope this trend continues."" ''*The above information was adapted from: CDC, NCCDPHP. Special focus: healthy aging. Chronic Disease Notes and Reports 1999;12(3):10-11.''The CDC/ACSM recommends that all adults should accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on five or more days of the week. Cardiorespiratory (aerobic) endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises should all be part of a physical activity program for older adults. No one type of activity will bring about all the benefits of physical activity. It is important to include all of them. Older adults can meet the physical activity recommendation with a combination of these activities using the following sample schedule:''*''Flexibility'"" refers to how fully one's joints or limbs are able to move. Being flexible allows for easier movements and reduced ""'pain'' in joints so that it is also easier to perform daily activities of independent living. By adding stretching to your daily physical activity plan, you can help keep your joints flexible which will help you move with more freedom and comfort.''Participating in these types of activities can help you more easily perform many of your day-to-day tasks. For example, being more flexible will help you more easily do things like reaching in your cupboard and tying your shoes. Being stronger and having more balance will help you lift and carry items like sacks of groceries and will make it easier to get in and out of chairs and the bathtub. Improving your cardiorespiratory endurance will allow you to do things like climbing stairs, dancing, or playing with grandchildren without getting out of breath. '""The chart below provides ideas of activities in the areas of cardiorespiratory endurance, strength, and flexibility. Many of these activities will also help improve your balance. Most importantly, choose activities that you enjoy. This will make it more likely that you'll keep doing them!"" Adults should engage in moderate-intensity physical activities for at least 30 minutes on 5 or more days of the week.  Adults should engage in vigorous-intensity physical activity 3 or more days per week for 20 or more minutes per occasion  moderate-intensity physical activity for 30 minutes or more on 5 or more days of the week, or 
 vigorous-intensity physical activity for 20 minutes or more on 3 or more days of the week.  On average, regularly participating in one or more moderate-intensity or vigorous-intensity activities is required to burn a minimum of 150 Calories of energy per day, 7 days per week, or total of 1,000 Calories/week (Jones et al., 1998). 
 The time needed to burn 150 Calories of energy in a day depends on the intensity of the activities chosen. For example, if someone selects moderate-intensity activities, the time required to meet the minimum recommendation would be generally 30 minutes per day. The more vigorous the activities chosen, the less time needed (22 minutes or less) to burn the minimum of 150 Calories during the day. Weight  Muscular strength Cardiorespiratory (aerobic) fitness  Bone mass (through weight-bearing physical activities)  Blood pressure (for hypertensive youth)  Anxiety and stress  Self-esteem  Set a positive example by leading an active lifestyle yourself, and make physical activity part of your family's daily routine such as designating time for family walks or playing active games together. Provide opportunities for children to be active by playing with them. Give them active toys and equipment, and take them to places where they can be active.  Offer positive reinforcement for the physical activities in which your child participates and encourage them as they express interest in new activities.  Make physical activity fun. Fun activities can be anything the child enjoys, either structured or non-structured. They may range from team sports, individual sports, and/or recreational activities such as walking, running, skating, bicycling, swimming, playground activities, and free-time play.  Ensure that the activity is age appropriate and, to ensure safety, provide protective equipment such as helmets, wrist pads, and knee pads.  Find a convenient place to be active regularly. Limit the time your children watch television or play video games to no more than two hours per day. Instead, encourage your children to find fun activities to do with family members or on their own that simply involve more activity (walking, playing chase, dancing).  Cardiorespiratory: Participate in moderate-intensity aerobic activities 3-5 days a week for at least 30 minutes each session. Flexibility*: Stretch every day.  Strength training: Do strength-building activities 2-3 days per week. "
Getting started,"'The victory is not always to the swift, but to those who keep moving. ''So, you already know that regular physical activity can do great things for your health and well-being. And when you pair that with good ''nutrition'"", your body is sure to thank you! But isn't getting started the hardest part? Like any change in your life, knowing where you are and where you're going is important.""'Have you ever noticed that what works for some people when they make a change in their life may not work for you? Most people move through a series of five stages of readiness as they change behaviors. What helps someone in one stage may not work for someone in another stage. Look at the graphic below to see where you fall in the stages of change. ''These stages represent a spiral path to adopting regular physical activity into your life. Each stage takes a period of time to acquaint yourself with new behaviors. ''Effort and commitment is needed in all stages. You will move through each stage as you are ready to change. The interesting part of this model is that is recognizes you may not always move forward in a straight line. There will be times when you lapse, going back to an earlier stage. Then the time will come when you are ready to advance forward. This is expected and part of the process of adopting new behaviors. You will progress when you are ready. '""Which of the stages below are you at? The ideas and suggestions you'll read are designed just for where you are. """"As the title suggests, you're not ready for change right now. You're not even thinking about adding physical activity into your daily routine. If you were thinking about it, you'd be planning to do something different than what you're doing today-little or nothing. You may have tried physical activity in the past, and not succeeded in adding it into your life. This is a good time to consider the pros, and then the cons, of becoming more active. ""'Check off the benefits (pros) that you want to experience. Maybe you want to...''Maintain a healthy weight.'' Feel better in body, mind, and spirit.'' Shed extra pounds and ''abdominal fat''.''Live longer by reducing the risk of heart disease and diabetes.''Look your best.''

'""Now that you've identified your pros and cons, where do you stand? Which benefits are you most excited about? Which barriers do you feel strongest about? Often when you see what items are most important, you will begin to shift your views about physical activity and decide that finding easy ways to add physical activity into your life is exactly what you want to do. """"Do you see those barriers as something you want to explore, or are you satisfied in remaining inactive? If you have no desire to learn more about physical activity or you get upset when people mention it to you, you're not ready to consider easy ways to have more energy throughout the day. However, if you are open to learning more, you will find that working with the barriers you identified will help release you from your defenses. ""'So, you are thinking about becoming physically active within the next six months! Imagining yourself involved in physical activity is the first step in adopting a healthier lifestyle. You assessed the benefits of engaging in physical activity, and you determined your barriers to success. Congratulations! You have taken some important steps, and now it is time to continue down the road to becoming more physically active.''Perhaps you\'re waiting for the magic moment to make some changes. Why not start now? Do you remember a time when you were physically active and felt great? Physical activity does not have to follow the old and incorrect maxim of ""no pain, no gain."" Physical activity can be fun! Can you imagine taking a 15-minute walk on a beautiful day? Playing touch football with your kids in the backyard? You can do it! Remember, physical activity makes more energy than it takes, and taking just one of the following steps is all you need to get started.''Find the time'': Figure out when you could possibly fit physical activity into your already busy schedule. You will find opportunities at home, work, and elsewhere (e.g., walking up and down the stairs for 15 minutes during your lunch break). What is important is discovering that you do have time in your schedule. All it takes is that first step. Remember, accumulating 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (such as brisk walking) 5 or more days of the week is recommended.''Remember your physical activity successes and interests'': Think about physical activities that you have enjoyed or that sound interesting. Were there times in your life when you played a sport on a regular basis? Are you interested in taking a physical activity class such as aerobic kickboxing, tennis, or fly-fishing? Consider activities that you can do alone (e.g., walking) or with a friend (e.g., tennis), and include indoor and outdoor activities. Some possibilities include the following: walking, ''yoga'', low-impact aerobics, gardening/yard work, frisbee, volleyball, swimming, basketball, dancing, skating, biking, tennis, hiking, stair climbing, softball, and jogging. Keep a list by your phone at work or home and jot down new ideas as they come to mind.''Develop a support network'': Not yet convinced that you can become more physically active? That\'s where the people you know can help you out. Discuss your concerns with peers, family, friends, or co-workers who are physically active. Find out how they got started and what keeps them motivated. They might have some great ""tips for success"" about how to incorporate moderate-intensity physical activity into your daily routine. Turn to them for ideas, motivation, and support. Work together to get started and keep you going. Name two people with whom you will talk to and seek support. Set dates within the month for your discussion with them.''Recall your current level of activity'': Nobody knows you better than you do. In this case, knowing your current level of activity will help you decide where there is room for change. Consider the following questions to help you recall your current level of activity.''Be honest with yourself. Choose one of the following areas in which you think you can make realistic changes.''Set small, specific goals'': Okay. You\'ve thought about your favorite physical activities, chosen a support network, and identified one target area that you want to address in the next month. This information can help you set some achievable goals. For example, if you chose physical activity at work as the target area you want to address this month, a specific goal might be to use the stairs instead of the elevator at least twice a week. This is always better than a general approach such as, ""I will be more active this month."" By starting small and increasing your goals at a pace that feels right for you, all the benefits of physical activity can be yours. And, if you have some setbacks, that\'s okay. Accept that lapses happen and begin again. You will achieve success.'""It is also important to build on your goals. For example, if you are successfully walking once a week as your specific goal, after several weeks add an additional day. Now you'll be walking twice a week. The following month increase the number of days per week and the amount of time you walk. Also, add another activity such as ""'cycling'' or gardening on the weekends.''Reward yourself'"": You deserve a medal! Once you've set and achieved some specific goals, celebrate your successes-no matter how small. You might choose a reward that is related to physical activity. How about workout clothing or new athletic shoes? Or reward yourself with a trip to the movies or tickets to your favorite play or sporting event.""'Develop long-term vision'': Keep in mind that health professionals recommend 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (e.g., gardening or walking) a day at least five days a week. This can be your long-term goal, but for now just keep building on your successes month by month.'""Whether you've decided to start being physically active now or you would like to be physically active on a more consistent basis, congratulations! You have taken an important step by focusing on future goals. Now, it's time to take action.""'Do you remember a time when you were physically active and felt great? You can feel that way again. Simply make a commitment to incorporate moderate-intensity physical activity into your lifestyle, slowly but surely. For instance, this could mean riding your bike to the local market to pick up a few items for dinner. The following steps will provide you with the tools you need to develop a plan of action to meet your goals. You can do it!''Develop support'': Share your commitment to becoming physically active with those around you. When seeking the support of others, help them understand your reasons for change so they can help you. Make use of the support networks that exist around you, such as friends or co-workers who are willing to help you remain motivated. Find friends, co-workers or family who will join you for evening walks. Gather a group for a weekend hike and picnic. Name two people who you will rely on for support and motivation.''Getting ready for physical activity can also mean changing your surrounding (e.g., home, work, and car) to support your goals. Keep comfortable walking shoes at work or in the car. Have an exercise bag packed and ready to go. Post motivating messages in your day planner or on your bathroom mirror.''Name two ways you would like to alter your environment to support your goals.''Find the time'"": With some creative thinking, you'll find ways to squeeze a little more time out of your busy schedule. Adding short bouts of physical activity throughout the day really works. Walk down the hall instead of using the telephone or e-mail. Park farther from the door. Could you get up earlier to take a brisk walk? Climb up and down the stairs for 20 minutes during lunch?""'Think about your schedule at work, home, and elsewhere. Find at least three slots that you could devote to physical activity during the next week, and write them down.''Make change a priority'"": Perhaps you've already made small changes in your level of activity that you can build on, or maybe you will be starting fresh. Either way, adding physical activity into your lifestyle is now at the top of your priority list. You can be confident that you are on the road to success. Choose one area of your life (e.g., work, lunch/break time, before/after work, weekends, active indoor chores, active outdoor chores) that you want to address in the next week.""'Create a plan of action'"": You've developed a strong support network, found three time slots for physical activity, and chosen one area of your life that you want to address in the next week. The next step is to set some achievable goals and create a plan of action. For example, if you chose physical activity after work as the area to work on for the week, a specific goal might be walking the dog after work 4 days a week. Consider the plan developed by John, who makes his living as an aerospace engineer...""'""I wanted to look better and was ready to make some changes to allow for physical activity. I did not know where to start, so I started small. My first goal was to be physically active in the workplace three days a week. In the morning, I\'d walk to the cafeteria for coffee instead of using the vending machine near my desk. Throughout the workday whenever I wanted more coffee or a bite to eat, I would take the stairs to the basement instead of using the snack shop outside of my office. The changes were fairly simple to make. By the end of six months, I worked up to brisk walking during my lunch break five days a week and taking the stairs to get coffee or snacks. I\'ve been able to maintain a healthier weight and I feel good. Without heroic measures, I have made significant progress.""'""Now it's your turn! Choose four physical activity goals that you hope to accomplish within the next month.""'Monitor your progress'': Keep in mind that occasional setbacks do not mean failure. On the contrary, you have set and achieved some specific goals. However, it is important to plan for events that might disrupt your physical activity routine. For example, if you know it will rain all week, rent a physical activity video to use in your home. Right now, make a list of potential setbacks to your routine and how you will overcome them.''It is also important to monitor your progress. Self-monitoring can help you meet your goals by increasing your awareness of the changes you have or have not made. It is also important to build on your goals. For example, if your first weekly goal is to walk to dog 30 minutes twice a week, build on this goal the following week. So, by the end of week 2, your goal will be to walk the dog 30 minutes twice a week plus gardening on Sundays. Try keeping an activity log for your daily activity.''Reward yourself'': You deserve a medal! You set and achieved some specific goals. Reward yourself with a gift. Here are some ideas: a health club membership, tickets to a sporting event, a ''massage'', a new CD, or a sitter for the kids.''Use long-term vision'': Keep in mind as you are progressing that health professionals recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity at least 5 days per week. This can be your long-term goal, but for now, just keep building on your successes week by week.'""At this stage, you've been busy the last few months planning and becoming physically active on a regular basis.

Here are some helpful tips.''Support yourself in thoughts and action'': Surround yourself with people who support your new, active lifestyle. Not all of your family members, friends, or co-workers may want you to succeed in becoming more active. You will develop new habits that might not include them and that may be a problem. Remember the stages of change. Your path will be different from theirs. Visualize your response to a non-supportive friend who discourages you from wanting to be something different-more energetic and healthy. Be assertive in your response.''Some people find supportive messages surrounding them very helpful. Leave encouraging notes to yourself or ""to-do lists"" at home, in the car or at the office. A message in the car that reminds you to part farther away from the grocery store will give you an opportunity to walk a few extra minutes.'""Can you find ways to make it easier to add activity into your day? Leaving an extra pair of walking shoes at the office or in your car would be one way. Your dog only has to walk around the block once to believe you will walk him every day at that same time. How can you say no to your favorite pet, even if you grumble the entire time? You'll soon find yourself looking forward to the time...you really will. What are two supportive actions you can take to maintain or enhance your current level of physical activity?""'Pat on the back'': Give yourself a big pat on the back for becoming physically active. You are making great strides in adding health benefits and strength to your life. Build in rewards to maintain your motivation. These can be setting goals for yourself or something you can get your hands on, such as a new pair of walking shoes. What would motivate you?''Review long-term vision'': You may want to contract with yourself to reach certain goals. What are your long-range (one year or longer) goals for physical activity? List three short-term (three to six months) goals that will help you reach your long-range goal. Be specific.''Utilize your support network'': Maintain a buddy system. Knowing you can ask a co-worker or family member for support is helpful. Mentors are important in the work setting. They help you make the right decisions and show you the ropes.''Do you know someone who would make a good mentor or buddy in maintaining or increasing your current activity patterns? What type of support and feedback do you need from your friends or mentor to be successful?''Plan for setbacks'': Think about times when you will be tempted not to be active (e.g., added demands of work and family, the ''flu'', a blizzard, or out-of-town visitors). List for yourself any events that have gotten in the way so far.''Accept that these lapses will happen. It does not mean that you have failed or will not get back into your regular habit. Be aware that during the first six months of any behavior change, you are at risk of reverting to old habits. Lapses are a normal part of the change process. If you plan and prepare for events that are likely to happen, you can prepare to hurdle over them as well. You\'ve heard the term, ""jump back in the saddle again."" If you do lapse, just start right back where you left off. You\'ll thank yourself afterwards.'""Regular physical activity has become a part of who you are. You have kept the commitment to include activity in your everyday life and are a source of encouragement to others. The benefits of good health are important to you.

Do you remember some of your early struggles? You made the decision to overcome the barriers and succeeded in finding ways to increase your energy level and physical skills. One of the most important steps in maintaining your current success is anticipating minor slips.''Threats to success'': It may be difficult for you to imagine a time when you will not want to continue regular physical activity. Repeat this next sentence three times (out loud and with feeling). ""Minor slips will happen.""\xa0'""The greatest threat for relapse is overconfidence or believing it won't happen to you.

If you know they will happen, you can plan around them. What can you do to reschedule physical activity during one of the situations you listed?""""You have special friends and co-workers who have been encouraging you. Often as your activity level increases and becomes routine, this support stops. Because you're doing so well and exercise now is part of who you are, your friends may not believe you need the extra encouragement. Re-examine what you need from them and ask them to help you again. They can be the first ones to see old behaviors coming back. Ask them for continued feedback.""'Have you heard yourself say any of the above sentences? These are signs that you may be in danger of overconfidence. Old habits die hard. Watch for times when temporary lapses lead to disappointment or giving up. That old couch will be calling you and reminding you of its comfort and support for your weary bones. What will you say back? Remember how hard it was in the beginning. Keeping up your commitment to physical activity today is as important as it was when you started.''Keep your balance'': Just as you planned how to remove your barriers to physical activity months or years ago, it\'s time for you to do so again. Review the benefits and barriers from when you assessed the ""pros and cons"" earlier. How have your barriers changed from when you started becoming physically active? What are some of the things you can put around your home or office to reinforce your efforts? What are some of the things you can remove that contribute any threat to your activity?

You have more energy and are also adding health benefits such as reducing the risk of developing or dying from some of the leading causes of illness and death. Maintaining this sense of well-being is important. When you are confident that you will continue to remain physically active, your success rate goes up.''How confident are you of participating in regular physical activity under the following conditions:''Mentor others'"": Look back at how others helped you adopt new behaviors. Their support and encouragement may have made a difference in your efforts. Did someone offer to show you the ropes or share a new technique that worked for you? It's time you become part of the buddy system but on the other end. You have made progress through the transition of adding regular physical activity into your life. It's been both hard and rewarding, even fun on most days. Share your skills with someone else. ""'Having others depend on you will increase your likelihood of continued success''.

When is a medical evaluation necessary?,"'Experts advise that people with chronic diseases, such as a heart condition, arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure, should talk to their doctor about what types and amounts of physical activity are appropriate. If you have a chronic disease and have not already done so, talk to your doctor before beginning a new physical activity program. ''If you have symptoms that could be due to a chronic disease, you should have these symptoms evaluated, whether you are active or inactive. If you plan to start a new activity program, take the opportunity to get these symptoms evaluated. Symptoms of particular importance to evaluate include ''chest pain'' (especially ''chest pain'' that is brought on by exertion), loss of balance (especially loss of balance leading to a fall), ''dizziness'', and passing out (''loss of consciousness'').'

Components of physical activity,"'What does it mean to be physically ""fit?"" Physical fitness is defined as ""a set of attributes that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity"" (USDHHS, 1996). In other words, it is more than being able to run a long distance or lift a lot of weight at the gym. Being fit is not defined only by what kind of activity you do, how long you do it, or at what level of intensity. While these are important measures of fitness, they only address single areas. Overall fitness is made up of five main components: ''In order to assess your level of fitness, look at all five components together.'""Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability of the body's circulatory and respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained physical activity (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Corbin & Lindsey, 1994). To improve your cardiorespiratory endurance, try activities that keep your heart rate elevated at a safe level for a sustained length of time such as walking, swimming, or bicycling. The activity you choose does not have to be strenuous to improve your cardiorespiratory endurance. Start slowly with an activity you enjoy, and gradually work up to a more intense pace. ""'Muscular strength is the ability of the muscle to exert force during an activity (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). The key to making your muscles stronger is working them against resistance, whether that be from weights or gravity. If you want to gain muscle strength, try exercises such as lifting weights or rapidly taking the stairs. ''Muscular endurance is the ability of the muscle to continue to perform without ''fatigue'' (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). To improve your muscle endurance, try cardiorespiratory activities such as walking, jogging, bicycling, or dancing. '""Body composition refers to the relative amount of muscle, fat, bone, and other vital parts of the body (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Corbin and Lindsey, 1994). A person's total body weight (what you see on the bathroom scale) may not change over time. But the bathroom scale does not assess how much of that body weight is fat and how much is lean mass (muscle, bone, tendons, and ligaments). Body composition is important to consider for health and managing your weight!""'Flexibility is the range of motion around a joint (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). Good flexibility in the joints can help prevent injuries through all stages of life.

Common physical activity and fitness terms,"'Calorie'': A measure of energy from food. (3,500 kilocalories of food energy = 1 pound of body weight). Also the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1° C (1000 calories = 1 kilocalorie).

What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''. '  "
"What are common initial screening tests for 
coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
Exercise Stress Test Introduction,'A ''stress'' test can be used to test for ''heart disease''. ''Stress'' tests are tests performed by a doctor and/or trained technician to determine the amount of stress that your ''heart'' can manage before developing either an abnormal rhythm or evidence of ischemia (not enough blood flow to the heart muscle). The most commonly performed stress test is the ''exercise'' stress test.' 
What Is an Exercise Stress Test?,"'The ''exercise'' stress test -- also called a stress test, exercise ''electrocardiogram'', treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ''ECG'' -- is a test used to provide information about how the heart responds to exertion. It usually involves ''walking'' on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty, while your electrocardiogram, heart rate, and ''blood pressure'' are monitored.' "
Why Do I Need a Stress Test?,'Your doctor uses the stress test to:' Determine if there is adequate blood flow to your heart during increasing levels of activity. Evaluate the effectiveness of your heart medications to control angina and ischemia. Determine the likelihood of having coronary heart disease and the need for further evaluation. Check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve blood flow within the heart vessels in people with coronary heart disease. Identify abnormal heart rhythms. Help you develop a safe exercise program.
What Types of Stress Tests Are There?,"'There are many different types of stress tests, including:''Preparation for these types of stress tests will vary from preparation for the exercise stress test. Ask your doctor about any specific instructions.' Dobutamine or Adenosine Stress Test: This test is used in people who are unable to exercise. A drug is given to make the heart respond as if the person were exercising. This way the doctor can still determine how the heart responds to stress, but no exercise is required. Stress echocardiogram: An 
echocardiogram (often called ""echo"") is a graphic outline of the heart's movement. A stress echo can accurately visualize the motion of the heart's walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed; it may reveal a lack of blood flow that isn't always apparent on other heart tests. Nuclear stress test: This test helps to determine which parts of the heart are healthy and function normally and which are not. A very small and harmless amount of radioactive substance is injected into the patient. Then the doctor uses a special camera to identify the rays emitted from the substance within the body; this produces clear pictures of the heart tissue on a monitor. These pictures are done both at rest and after exercise. Using this technique, a less than normal amount of thallium will be seen in those areas of the heart that have a decreased blood supply."
How Should I Prepare for the Exercise Stress Test?," Do not eat or drink anything except water for four hours before the test. Do not drink or eat foods containing caffeine for 12 hours before the test. Caffeine will interfere with the results of your test. Do not take the following heart medications on the day of your test unless your doctor tells you otherwise, or if the medication is needed to treat chest discomfort the day of the test: Isosorbide dinitrate (for example, Isordil, Dilatrate SR); Isosorbide mononitrate (for example, ISMO, Imdur, Monoket); Nitroglycerin (for example, Deponit, Nitrostat, Nitro-bid). Your doctor may also ask you to stop taking other heart medications on the day of your test. If you have any questions about your medications, ask your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first talking with your doctor. If you use an inhaler for your breathing, please bring it to the test."
What If I have Diabetes?," If you take insulin to control your blood sugar, ask your doctor what amount of your medication you should take the day of the test. Often, you will take only half of your usual morning dose and eat a light meal 4 hours before the test. If you take pills to control your blood sugar, do not take your medication until after the test is complete. Do not take your diabetes medication and skip a meal before the test. If you own a glucose monitor, bring it with you to check your blood sugar levels before and after your exercise stress test. If you think that your blood sugar is low, tell the lab personnel immediately. Plan to eat and take your blood sugar medication following your stress test."
What Should I Wear the Day of the Test?,"'On the day of your stress test, wear soft-soled shoes suitable for walking and comfortable clothes. Do not bring valuables.' "
What Happens During the Exercise Stress Test?,"'First, during a stress test, a technician will gently clean 10 small areas on your chest and place electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph monitor (ECG or ''EKG'"") that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test.""'Before you start exercising, the technician will perform an EKG, to measure your heart rate at rest and will take your blood pressure.''You will begin to exercise by walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. The rate of exercise, or degree of difficulty will gradually increase. You will be asked to exercise until you feel exhausted.''At regular intervals, the lab personnel will ask how you are feeling. Please tell them if you feel chest, arm or ''jaw pain'' or discomfort, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or any other unusual symptoms. It is normal for your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and ''perspiration'' to increase during the test. The lab personnel will watch for any symptoms or changes on the ECG monitor that suggest the test should be stopped.''After the test you will walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will continue to be monitored until the levels begin returning to normal.''Although the appointment lasts about 60 minutes, the actual exercise time is usually between seven and 12 minutes.''Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the exercise stress test.' "
What Is Exercise-Induced Asthma?,"'Like it sounds, ''exercise-induced asthma'' is ''asthma'' that is triggered by vigorous or prolonged ''exercise'' or physical exertion. Most people with chronic ''asthma'' experience ''symptoms of asthma'' during ''exercise''. However, there are many people without chronic ''asthma'' who develop symptoms only during exercise.' "
Why Does Exercise Induce Asthma?,"'During normal ''breathing'', the air we take in is first warmed and moistened by the nasal passages. Because people tend to breathe through their mouths when they exercise, they are inhaling colder and drier air.''In exercise-induced asthma, the muscle bands around the airways are sensitive to these changes in temperature and humidity and react by contracting, which narrows the ''airway''. This results in symptoms of exercised-induced asthma, which include:''The symptoms of exercise-induced asthma generally begin within 5-20 minutes after the start of exercise, or 5-10 minutes after brief exercise has stopped. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms with exercise, inform your doctor.'  Coughing with asthma Tightening of the chest Wheezing Unusual fatigue while exercising Shortness of breath when exercising"
"If I Have Asthma, Should I Avoid Exercise?","""No. You shouldn't avoid physical activity because of exercise-induced asthma. There are steps you can take for ""'prevention'' of ''asthma symptoms'' that will allow you to maintain normal physical activity. In fact, many athletes -- even Olympic athletes -- compete with asthma. For example, in the 1996 Olympic Games, 1 out of every 6 athletes had asthma. These Olympians competed in a variety of sports such as track and field, mountain biking, kayaking, ''cycling'', and rowing. The following is an abbreviated list of athletes who have competed despite their asthma.' Jackie Joyner-Kersee - track and field Jerome Bettis - NFL running back Amy Van Dyken - swimming Dennis Rodman - NBA basketball Ray Bourque - NHL hockey"
Can My Exercise-Induced Asthma Be Prevented?,"'Yes. Asthma inhalers or ''bronchodilators'' used prior to exercise can control and prevent exercise-induced asthma symptoms. The preferred ''asthma medications'' are short-acting beta-2 agonists such as ''albuterol''. Taken 15-20 minutes before exercise, these medications can prevent the airways from contracting and control exercise-induced asthma for as long as 4-6 hours.''Other asthma treatments that may be useful are the long-acting beta-2 agonists, such as ''Serevent'' and ''Foradil'', which provide 12-hour control. When these medications are taken in the morning, exercise-induced asthma symptoms may be avoided with any exercise throughout the day. It is important, however, to always have an asthma inhaler available in case symptoms still occur.''In addition to taking medications, warming up prior to exercising and cooling down after exercise can help in asthma prevention. For those with ''allergies'' and asthma, exercise should be limited during high ''pollen'' days or when temperatures are extremely low and air pollution levels are high. Infections can cause asthma (colds, ''flu'', ''sinusitis'"") and increase asthma symptoms, so it's best to restrict your exercise when you're sick."" "
What Are the Best Exercises for Someone With Asthma?,"'For people with exercise-induced asthma, some activities are better than others. Activities that involve short, intermittent periods of exertion, such as volleyball, gymnastics, baseball, ''walking'', and wrestling, are generally well tolerated by people with exercise-induced asthma.''Activities that involve long periods of exertion, like soccer, distance running, basketball, and field hockey, may be less well tolerated, as are ''cold'' weather sports like ice hockey, cross-country skiing, and ice skating. However, many people with asthma are able to fully participate in these activities.''Swimming, which is a strong endurance sport, is generally well tolerated by asthmatics because it is usually performed in a warm, moist air environment.''Maintaining an active lifestyle, even exercising with asthma, is important for both physical and ''mental health''. You should be able to actively participate in sports and activities.' "
Are There Some Tips to Prevent and Treat Exercise-Induced Asthma?,"'Again, asthma should not be used as an excuse to avoid exercise. With proper diagnosis and treatment of asthma, you should be able to enjoy the benefits of an exercise program without experiencing asthma symptoms.''SOURCES: American Academy of ''Allergy'' Asthma & Immunology: ""''Allergic'' Conditions: Exercise-Induced Asthma (EIA)."" American Lung Association: ""Search LungUSA.""''Reviewed by Jonathan L. Gelfand, MD, on July 20, 2008''Portions of this page © Cleveland Clinic 2008'  Always use your pre-exercise inhaled medicines before beginning exercise. Perform warm-up exercises and maintain an appropriate cool down period after exercise. If the weather is cold, exercise indoors or wear a mask or scarf over your nose and mouth. Avoid exercising outdoors when pollen counts are high (if you have allergies), and also avoid exercising outdoors when there is high air pollution. Restrict exercise when you have a viral infection. Exercise at a level that is appropriate for you."
What is heat exhaustion?,"'The body cools itself most efficiently by sweating and having that sweat evaporate. Should sweating be unable to meet the cooling demands of the body, ''heat-related illness'' can occur. This is a spectrum of conditions with minor symptoms such as ''prickly heat'' or ''heat rash'', progressing to heat ''cramps'', then heat exhaustion, and finally to heat ''stroke'', a life-threatening medical condition.''The line between each diagnosis is not sharply drawn. Heat cramps describe involuntary spasm of the large muscles of the body, while heat exhaustion has more systemic complaints such as the signs and symptoms listed above.''The affected individual may be a low-grade ''fever'"". Heat stroke is a life-threatening situation where the body's cooling system fails. The body temperature spirals out of control usually greater than 106F (41 C), sweating stops, and there are ""'mental status changes'' like ''confusion'', ''seizure'', or ''coma''.'""Heat exhaustion occurs when a person exercises or works in a hot environment and sweating cannot dissipate the heat generated within the body. Often dehydration occurs because the person hasn't replaced the water lost by sweating. Heat exhaustion also may occur if a person lives in a hot environment without adequate air circulation and does not drink an adequate amount of water."" "
What is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?,"'There is no set line that distinguishes heat exhaustion from heat stroke. If a person is suffering from a heat-related illness such as heat exhaustion, and changes in mental status occur, he or she should be considered to be suffering from heat stroke. This includes confusion, lethargy, seizure, or ''coma''. This is a medical emergency, and if treatment is delayed mortality can be greater than 50%. While victims of heat exhaustion sweat profusely, people suffering from heat stroke stop sweating and have ''dry skin''. This is a warning sign of impending heat stroke.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion?,"'Individuals with heat exhaustion tend to have symptoms such as''As dehydration increases from the loss of body water, lightheadedness may occur and ''fainting'' (''syncope'') may occur, especially if the affected individual stands up quickly (due to ''orthostatic hypotension'').The person also may have a low-grade ''fever''.'   profuse sweating, weakness, muscle cramps, headache, and nausea and vomiting."
What causes heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion occurs when a person exercises and works in a hot environment and the body cannot cool itself adequately. Dehydration occurs with water loss from ''excessive sweating'"", which causes muscle cramps, weakness, and nausea and vomiting. The nausea and vomiting makes it difficult to drink enough fluid to replenish the body's water supply, and the lack of body water impairs further sweating, evaporation and cooling.""'Relative humidity is an important factor in developing heat exhaustion. If the humidity is too high, sweat on the skin cannot evaporate into the surrounding air and body temperature cooling fails.''Living in a hot environment may predispose a person to heat exhaustion. During a heat wave, the elderly, the poor, and those who live an isolated life may not have access to air conditioning and are at risk of heat-related illnesses.'  "
Who is at risk for heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion usually affects people who are working or exercising in a hot environment, and those who do not have access to adequate water. Those at risk for heat exhaustion include:''The body has the ability to acclimate to hot weather but if heat waves come suddenly, or if a person travels from a cooler environment to a hot environment, the risk of heat exhaustion increases. It takes about 7 to 10 days for the body to adapt to hot weather. A non-acclimated person can produce a liter or almost a quart of sweat in an hour to assist in cooling the body. A person who is acclimated to the heat can produce 2 or 3 liters of sweat per hour, doubling or tripling the cooling potential for the body.''This water lost in sweat needs to be replaced for the sweating/cooling mechanism to work. A liter of sweat weighs 1 kilogram or 2.2 pounds.' Infants and young children are at risk because their temperature regulation mechanisms are not fully developed. They also are dependent upon others for water and appropriate clothing. The elderly are similarly at risk because of underlying medical conditions that limit the ability to sweat including poor circulation, skin changes, and chronic medication usage. Socioeconomic issues increase the risk of heat exhaustion if access to air conditioning is limited. During heat waves, large cities often open cooling centers to help minimize the risk of large numbers of people succumbing to heat-related illness. Certain medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and tranquilizers may impair the ability of the body to sweat. Alcohol consumption The overweight or obese"
When should an individual seek medical care for heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion usually can be treated at home as long as the affected individual can replace the lost fluid, keep well hydrated, and find a cool place to rest. Water, ''electrolyte'' replacement solutions, or sport ''drinks'' are appropriate to consume. If nausea and vomiting prevent rehydration, the individual should seek medical attention, and may need IV fluids for rehydration.''Muscles cramps can be severe and if stretching and rehydration cannot relieve recurrent cramps, medical care may be necessary.''It is important to recognize that if the person stops sweating, becomes confused, or has a seizure, ''heat stroke'', a life-threatening condition, may be developing. Emergency medical services should be activated immediately (call 911 if available). The affected individual should be moved to a cooler place, have their clothing removed, and attempts should be made to cool the body with ''cold'' compresses, spraying or sponging the body with cool water and promoting air circulation with oscillating fans.' "
Which type of doctors treat heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion is often treated by emergency physicians and health care providers working in urgent care clinics.''Since heat exhaustion also routinely occurs during athletic activities including practices, certified athletic trainers and team physicians are able to care for these patients.' "
How is heat exhaustion diagnosed?,"'Diagnosis of heat exhaustion is made by circumstantial evidence:''Laboratory tests are not routinely performed unless the health care professional is concerned about electrolyte imbalance or significant dehydration and ''kidney failure''.''However, it is important for the health care professional to consider other diagnoses, since there are many infectious illnesses that accompany a fever, weakness, nausea and vomiting. This is especially the case in the elderly and very young. In these groups, heat exhaustion may be a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other more serious illnesses should be considered before settling on heat as the cause of the problem. History and physical examination may be all that is needed.' History (exercising or working in a hot environment, living in a hot apartment with no air-conditioning) Symptoms (excess sweating, headache, weakness, nausea and vomiting) Physical examination (signs of dehydration)"
What is the first aid treatment for heat exhaustion?,"   Cooling and rehydration are the cornerstones for treating heat exhaustion. The affected individual should stop their activity, and then move or be moved from the hot environment to a cooler environment. The person may be placed in the shade or taken to an air-conditioned environment (don't forget that cars have air conditioning). Clothes may be removed to help with air circulation across the body. Misting the skin with cool water also helps by stimulating evaporation and cooling the body. Rehydration is the next important step in treating heat exhaustion. This may be a challenge if the person begins to suffer from nausea and vomiting. Small sips of water, a mouthful at a time, might be tolerated even if some vomiting persists. Water, sports drink and other electrolyte replacement drinks are reasonable options. If oral rehydration fails or if symptoms persist, intravenous fluids may be required to replace the water loss because of the excessive sweating. Hydration continues until the patient begins to urinate, a signal that the kidneys have sensed that there is enough fluid in the body, and it no longer retains fluid. Muscles cramps and pain may be treated with over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, etc.) and acetaminophen (Tylenol and others)."
What are the complications of heat exhaustion?,"'Heat exhaustion is one part of the spectrum of heat-related illness, and symptoms should be reversible with treatment. However, some affected individuals do not recognize their symptoms and if they are not removed from the hot environment, cooled, and rehydrated, the heat-related illness can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition.''Individuals who have suffered from heat exhaustion are more prone to experience another episode and should be cautious when working or exercising in hot conditions.'  "
How can heat exhaustion be prevented?,"""Understanding one's environment is perhaps the most important step in preventing heat-related illness. If possible, strenuous activities should not be performed in excessively hot or humid environments. However, people often have to work in the heat of the day, or indoors in hot situations and need to make the effort to protect their bodies. These can include frequent breaks taken in a cooler areas, adequate fluid intake, and slowing the pace of work to decrease heat generated by the body.""'A person at risk for heat exhaustion should watch their urine output to monitor their hydration status .If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will hold onto water, and make concentrated, strong smelling urine. If enough water is present, the urine will turn clear.''Acclimating to conditions allows the body to perform in situations that would otherwise be difficult. The body will make physiologic changes allowing it to cool more efficiently, if it has gradual exposure to hot conditions. Moving from a cool to very hot environment quickly increases the risk of developing heat related-illness symptoms.'""It is important to look after family and loved ones during heat waves. When the temperature rises, the elderly or those less fortunate may not have air conditioning or the ability to cool their homes. Cities often set up cooling centers when the heat index rises, and there is an increased risk of heat-related illness. In 1995, Chicago experienced a record heat wave that killed hundreds of people. Most were elderly and the poor who had no air conditioning or could not afford to use it. Some wouldn't open their windows for fear of crime. In 2015, heat waves were responsible for more than 5,000 deaths in India and Pakistan."" "
What is the prognosis for heat exhaustion?,"'Most individuals recover well from heat exhaustion. The key to recovery is recognizing symptoms before they progress to heat stroke. The earlier the activity is stopped, the individual is cooled and hydration begins, the greater the likelihood that complications will not occur.' "
What is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)?,"""Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency or EPI is a term that describes a condition in which a person's pancreas is unable to produce and/or secrete normal levels of enzymes into the gastrointestinal track resulting in the inability of the person to digest and thus absorb some fats, vitamins, and minerals from foods (maldigestion). The exocrine (secreted) enzymes made by the pancreas are mainly amylase, protease, and lipase. Any malfunction in the production of one or more of these enzymes can result in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency because these enzymes are needed to help the body to modify and/or absorb foods. EPI has multiple possible causes and occurs more frequently in men than in women (8 vs. 2/100,000 population). ""  "
What causes exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)?,"'Most researchers and doctors classify the causes of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency into either pancreatic or non-pancreatic causes, with the most common cause being ''chronic pancreatitis'' because that leads to the damage or loss of pancreatic exocrine cells. ''Pancreatic causes of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are:''Non-pancreatic causes of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are:'   Chronic pancreatitis (recurrent 
inflammation of the pancreatic tissue) Cystic fibrosis (inherited genetic 
disorder that effects mucous, digestive enzymes and secretions) Obstruction of the pancreatic duct Swachman-Diamond syndrome (rare 
congenital disorder that includes exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and other problems) Celiac disease (autoimmune disorder 
resulting in problems with gluten digestion) Crohn's disease (inflammatory bowel 
disease) Autoimmune pancreatitis Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

Although dietitians and not doctors can play a major role in treating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency by providing dietary suggestions that may help to minimize the symptoms.' "
How is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) diagnosed?,"""Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is diagnosed by the patient's history, physical exam, and certain tests that help distinguish exocrine pancreatic insufficiency from other problems. For example, the history of abdominal pain, bad smelling bowel movements and ""'weight loss'' clinically suggests a diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. ''Blood tests may be ordered to check vitamin levels and pancreatic enzymes. A three day ""fecal test"" that requires collection of bowel movement samples is often ordered to determine if fats are being digested appropriately. This test includes a test for fecal elastase 1 to see if the pancreas is making enough of this digestive enzyme. Other tests may include a ''CT scan'', MRI and/or ''endoscopic ultrasound'' to determine if the pancreas is inflamed or has other changes.' "
What is the treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)?,"'The treatment for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is termed pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). This therapy involves taking prescription ''drugs'' that replace the enzyme(s) that your pancreas either produces in insufficient amounts or simply does not produce any enzyme(s). The following six pancreatic enzyme products (PEPs) have been approved by the US FDA to treat maldigestion and/or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency:''Your doctors can prescribe those drugs that are most likely to benefit you as an individual.

How can I help manage exocrine pancreatic insufficiency at home?,"'In general, people with EPI can help manage it at home by treating causes of diseases according to their treatments. In addition, to obtain good results from PERT therapy at home, patients are advised that PEPs should be administered together with meals and/or snacks. If this is not done, the PERT therapy may become far less effective. Patients should follow up with their health-care professional to determine if the therapy is still effective or needs modification as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can be a progressive disease.''Lifestyle modifications recommended by many health-care professionals include''Eating smaller meals more frequently (for example, six small meals per day) also is recommended.

What is breast reconstruction surgery?,"'Breast reconstruction'' is a surgical procedure to recreate symmetrical, natural-looking breasts after complete (''mastectomy'') or partial (''lumpectomy'') removal of the breasts of ''breast cancer'' patients. Breast reconstruction is also considered for patients with inborn deformities of the breasts and certain patients who have had a serious injury to the breast.' "
What type of breast reconstruction is best?,"'Breast reconstruction falls into three broad types:''1. Implant-based reconstruction: ''This procedure uses ''breast implants'' to help form a new breast mound. In expander-implant breast reconstruction,\xa0a balloon-like sac is used. The expander-implant starts flat and is slowly expanded to the desired size to allow the skin to stretch. Once the skin over the breast area has stretched enough, a second surgery is done to remove the expander and put in the permanent implant. Expander-implant breast reconstruction allows time for other ''cancer'' treatment options to be given. For example, the expander can be filled during ''chemotherapy''. However, the final placement of the implant is postponed if ''radiation'' treatment is needed until radiation treatment is complete.''Two types of expanders are available. In one type, the surgeon injects a salt-water solution through a tiny valve under the skin at regular intervals (every 1, 2, or 3 weeks) to fill the expander over several months. In the other type, the expander uses compressed carbon dioxide ''gas''. The patient uses a remote control to release small amounts of the gas into the expander several times a day over 2 to 3 weeks.''2. Flap (autologous) reconstruction:'"" This procedure uses the patient's tissue from another part of the body for breast reconstruction.""'3. Reconstruction of the nipples and areolae''Several factors are considered when choosing which breast reconstruction option is best:' Type of original breast removal: Complete/partial Cancer treatments planned Patient's body type Whether the patient wants reconstructive surgery on one or both breasts Desire to match the look of the other breast"
What to expect before the breast reconstruction surgery?," The patient is evaluated in the upright position. The surgeon evaluates the patient’s general health status and any pre-existing health conditions or risk factors. Breasts are examined and measurements are taken of their size and shape, skin quality, and placement of nipples and areolas. Photographs are taken. The doctor will discuss the likely outcomes of breast reconstruction and any risks or potential complications. The size of the tissue expander is estimated. Routine preoperative precautions, such as antibiotic prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention therapies, are used as needed."
What happens during an expander-implant breast reconstruction?," After the completion of the mastectomy, a pocket is created below the chest muscles for placement of the implant. Care is taken to preserve or recreate the fold below the breasts. The upper two-thirds of the implant is covered with muscles while the lower one-third has only skin over it. Following complete expansion, the expander-implant is removed through a cut. The permanent implant is inserted and filled with saline. The wound is closed in layers."
What are the complications of an expander-implant breast reconstruction?," Pain Implant rupture or deflation Skin sloughing Infection Asymmetrical breasts Numbness Bleeding Scarring Displaced implant Certain types of breast implants are associated with a rare kind of cancer, known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)"
"What is 
XDR TB?","'Extensively drug-resistant ''tuberculosis'' (XDR ''TB'') is a relatively rare type of multidrug-resistant ''tuberculosis'' (MDR ''TB''). It is resistant to almost all ''drugs'' used to treat TB, including the two best first-line drugs: ''isoniazid'' and rifampin. XDR TB is also resistant to the best second-line medications: fluoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). ' "
How is XDR TB spread?,"'Drug-susceptible (regular) TB and XDR TB are spread the same way. TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the ''lungs'' or throat ''coughs'', sneezes, speaks, or sings. These germs can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB germs can become infected. ''TB is not spread by' shaking someone's hand sharing food or drink touching bed linens or toilet 
seats sharing toothbrushes kissing smoking or sharing cigarettes"
"Why is XDR TB 
so serious?","'Because XDR TB is resistant to the most powerful first-line and second-line drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective and often have worse treatment outcomes. XDR TB is of special concern for persons with ''HIV'' infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB disease. ' "
Who is at risk for getting XDR TB?,"'Drug-resistant TB (MDR or XDR) is more common in people who: '   Do not take their TB medicine regularly Do not take all of their TB medicines 
as told by their doctor or nurse Develop active TB disease again, after having 
taken TB medicine in the past Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant 
TB is common Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB 
disease"
How can I prevent myself from getting TB?,"'Avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments like clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. ' "
Can the TB vaccine (BCG) help prevent XDR TB?,"'There is a ''vaccine'' for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB in adults. The effect of BCG against XDR TB would likely be similar to the effect on drug-susceptible TB. ' "
"If I have regular (drug-susceptible) TB, how can I prevent getting 
drug-resistant TB?","'The most important thing is for you to continue taking all your TB medicines exactly as prescribed. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. You should tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medications. If you plan to travel, make sure you have enough medicine to last while away. ' "
Can XDR TB be treated and cured?,"'Yes, in some cases. Some TB control programs have shown that cure is possible for an estimated 30% of affected people. Successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the ''drug resistance'"", the severity of the disease, and whether the patient's immune system is weakened."" "
What are the symptoms of XDR TB?,"'The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''fever'', and ''night sweats''. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include ''coughing'', ''chest pain'', and ''coughing up blood''. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department. ' "
What should I do if I have been around someone who has XDR TB?,"'If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT-G), a blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person. ' "
How long does it take to find out if you have XDR TB?,"'If TB bacteria are found in the sputum (''phlegm''), the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two, but this finding will not be able to distinguish between drug-susceptible (regular) TB and drug-resistant TB. To determine drug susceptibility, the bacteria need to be grown and tested in a laboratory. Final diagnosis for TB, and especially for XDR TB, may take from 6 to 16 weeks. ' "
Is XDR TB a problem in the United States?,"'The risk of acquiring XDR TB in the United States appears to be relatively low. However, it is important to acknowledge the ease at which TB can spread. As long as XDR TB exists, the United States is at risk and must address the threat. ' "
How many cases of XDR TB have been reported in the United States?,"'In the United States, 49 cases of XDR TB have been reported between 1993 and 2006. ' "
Is it safe to travel where cases of XDR TB have been reported?,"'Although MDR and XDR TB are occurring globally, they are still rare. ''HIV''-infected ''travelers'' are at greatest risk if they come in contact with a person with MDR or XDR TB.''All ''travelers'' should avoid high risk settings where there are no infection control measures in place. Documented places where transmission has occurred include crowded hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, and other settings where susceptible persons come in contact with persons with TB disease. ''Air travel itself carries a relatively low risk of infection with TB of any kind. ' "
What can health care providers do to prevent XDR TB?,"""Health care providers can help prevent MDR and XDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients' response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed. ""'Providers should also ensure proper implementation of infection control procedures to prevent exposure to TB in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen. ' "
Are immigrants putting the U.S. at increased risk for TB?,"'Persons applying to enter the U.S. with immigrant or refugee visas must complete a questionnaire about any symptoms of TB they may have and obtain a chest radiograph. If positive, the person submits sputum specimens for examination for TB bacteria. Persons identified as having infectious TB are not granted entry to the United States, until they have been treated. ' "
Why haven't we heard about XDR TB before now?,"'For some years we have seen isolated cases of very highly resistant TB around the world that we would today call XDR TB. The drugs used to treat TB have been around a long time and drug resistance has taken many years to develop. Over time, countries have improved their laboratory capacity to test for drug resistance and their ability to track the number of cases. All of these factors have contributed to an increase in reporting of cases of drug-resistant TB. With more cases being identified, the problem was more closely examined, defined, and given a name. ' "
What is CDC doing to prevent XDR TB from becoming a bigger problem?,"'CDC is collaborating with other federal agencies and international partners to raise awareness and enhance strategies for TB ''prevention'' worldwide by ''SOURCE: ''Centers for Disease Control & Prevention' Strengthening TB services for people living with HIV/AIDS Assembling outbreak 
response teams Improving access to TB drugs Developing international TB testing

"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "
Where can you find men's urinary incontinence products?,"'Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet.'""If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help."" "
How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems.""'Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by. They may not be a long-term solution, but they can vastly improve your quality of life right now.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What are premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)?,"'Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs, PVC) are premature heartbeats originating from the ventricles of the ''heart''. Premature ventricular contractions are premature because they occur before the regular heartbeat.''Normal function of the heart''The heart has four chambers. The upper two chambers are the atria, and the lower two chambers are the ventricles.''The heartbeat is normally controlled by the electrical system of the heart. The electrical system of the heart consists of the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrioventricular (AV) node and special tissues in the ventricles that conduct electricity.'""The SA node is the heart's electrical ""'pacemaker''. It is a small patch of cells located in the wall of the ''right atrium''; the frequency with which the SA node discharges electricity determines the rate at which the heart normally beats. The SA node keeps the heart beating in a regular manner. At rest, the frequency of the electrical discharges originating from the SA node is low, and the heart beats at the lower range of normal (60 to 80 beats/minute). During ''exercise'' or excitement, the frequency of discharges from the SA node increases, increasing the rate at which the heart beats. In people who ''exercise'' regularly, the resting heart rate may be below 50 to 60 and is not of concern.''The electrical discharges pass from the SA node through the special tissues of the atria into the ''AV node'' and through the ''AV node'' to the special conduction tissues of the ventricles, causing them to contract.''{C}'   The atria deliver blood to the ventricles, and the ventricles deliver blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body. The right ventricle delivers blood to the lungs while the left ventricle delivers blood to the rest of the body. The heartbeat (pulse) that we feel is caused by the contraction of the ventricles."
What happens during a premature ventricular contraction?,"'During a premature ventricular contraction, the ventricle electrically discharges (and contracts) prematurely before the normal electrical discharges arrive from the SA node. These premature discharges are due to electrical ""irritability"" of the heart muscle of the ventricles and can be caused by ''heart attacks'', ''electrolyte'' imbalances, lack of oxygen, or medications. Immediately after a premature ventricular contraction, the electrical system of the heart resets. This resetting causes a brief pause in heartbeat, and some patients report feeling the heart briefly stopping after a premature ventricular contraction. ' "
How common are premature ventricular contractions?,"'Premature ventricular contractions are common. Many people have premature ventricular contractions without any symptoms. Premature ventricular contractions may be more common among older patients, patients with ''high blood pressure'', and patients with ''heart disease''. Premature ventricular contractions can also occur in young healthy individuals without ''heart disease'' or ''high blood pressure''. ' "
What causes premature ventricular contractions?,"'There are many causes of premature ventricular contractions, which include'   heart attack; high blood pressure;  cardiomyopathy, including congestive heart failure;  disease of heart valves such as mitral valve prolapse;  hypokalemia (low blood levels of potassium), and hypomagnesaemia (low blood levels of magnesium) -- hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia can occur, for example, in patients taking diuretics (water pills); hypoxia (low amounts of oxygen in the blood), for example, hypoxia occurs with lung diseases such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);  medications such as digoxin (Lanoxin), aminophylline (Phyllocontin, Truphylline), tricyclic antidepressants, and ephedrine-containing, decongestants; excessive intake of alcohol; excess caffeine intake; stimulant drug use such as cocaine, and amphetamines;  myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and cardiac contusion (heart muscle injury), and  premature ventricular contractions also occur in healthy individuals without heart diseases. "
What are premature ventricular contraction symptoms?,"'Patients with mild infrequent premature ventricular contractions often report no symptoms (asymptomatic) and are unaware of their premature ventricular contractions. Their premature ventricular contractions may be discovered when an ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG'') is performed for a routine physical, insurance physical, or preoperative evaluation.''Patients with premature ventricular contractions sometimes report ''palpitations'' in the chest and in the neck. ''Palpitations'' are discomforting feelings due to forceful heartbeats. The heartbeat immediately after a premature ventricular contraction is usually stronger (the ''heart ventricle'' contracts more forcefully) than normal. Patients with premature ventricular contractions may report feeling that the heart has stopped briefly. This is because there is usually a brief pause in heartbeat after a premature ventricular contraction when the electrical system of the heart resets. Moreover, the actual premature ventricular contraction beat may not be felt because the heart hasn\'t had time to fill with blood before beating so patients with PVCs often complain of ""skipped"" or ""missed"" beats.''Patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions such as bigeminy (every other heartbeat is a premature ventricular contraction), couplets (two consecutive premature ventricular contractions), or triplets (three consecutive premature ventricular contractions) often report no symptoms. But in rare occasions they may report ''weakness'', ''dizziness'', or ''fainting''. This is because frequent premature ventricular contractions can diminish the ability of the heart to pump blood to the other organs (diminished cardiac output), resulting in ''low blood pressure''.''Patients with three or more consecutive premature ventricular contractions in a row have ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia that is prolonged can result in low cardiac output, ''low blood pressure'', and ''fainting'' (''syncope''). Ventricular tachycardia can also develop into ventricular ''fibrillation'', which is a fatal heart rhythm (see below).'  "
What are the dangers of premature ventricular contractions?,"'Premature ventricular contractions in healthy individuals without ''high blood pressure'' and heart diseases do not pose any health risks. Premature ventricular contractions in patients with heart diseases (''heart attacks'', ''heart failure'', diseases of the heart valves) may be associated with increased risks of developing ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is a sustained run of rapid ventricular contractions. Ventricular tachycardia is life-threatening because: 1) it occurs suddenly with no prior warning, and 2) it frequently develops into ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is a chaotic rhythm where the ventricles quiver rapidly in a purposeless fashion. The heart with ventricular fibrillation cannot pump blood effectively to the brain and the rest of the body. If untreated, ventricular fibrillation can be fatal within minutes. An estimated 325,000 Americans die from ''sudden cardiac arrest'', including ventricular fibrillation, each year. Many doctors believe that premature ventricular contractions do not necessarily cause ventricular tachycardias or ventricular fibrillations. Instead, premature ventricular contractions may be merely indicators (symptoms) of serious heart diseases or other serious conditions such as hypokalemia, hypoxia, and ongoing heart damage from ''heart attacks'', or medications such as digoxin and aminophylline toxicity. It must be emphasized that many premature ventricular contractions are harmless (benign) and not associated with structural ''heart disease''. If the workup for underlying heart disease is unrevealing, the patient can be assured that their prognosis is excellent.' "
How are premature ventricular contractions diagnosed (EKG and Holter)?,"'There are two aspects in the diagnosis of premature ventricular contractions -- detecting them and diagnosing the underlying causes. Electrocardiograms (EKGs) and Holter monitors are used to diagnose premature ventricular contractions. EKGs, blood tests, echocardiograms, and cardiac ''stress'' tests are used to determine the underlying causes of premature ventricular contractions.''Electrocardiogram (EKG)'""An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a brief recording of the heart's electrical discharges. EKGs can be performed in the doctors' offices, clinics, and hospital emergency rooms. Doctors frequently ask for a rhythm strip (a prolonged EKG recording) to be performed at the same time as an EKG to increase the chances of detecting premature ventricular contractions and other abnormal rhythms. The premature ventricular contractions are easy to recognize on EKG and rhythms strips, provided premature ventricular contractions occur during the recording. EKG may also demonstrate other problems such as heart attacks, hypokalemia, digoxin toxicity, and heart muscle thickening (hypertrophy) due to long term high ""'blood pressure''.''Holter monitor'""A standard EKG and a rhythm strip performed at the time of a visit to the doctor's office may not detect the premature ventricular contractions because they may not be occurring at that moment. Holter monitoring is then necessary to detect the premature ventricular contractions in these patients with heart palpitations. A Holter monitor is a continuous recording of the heart's rhythm for 24 hours. Holter monitoring can be used diagnose premature ventricular contractions as well as other heart rhythm abnormalities such as ""'atrial fibrillation'', ''atrial flutter'', and ventricular tachycardias.'""PVCs are present in 1% to 4% in the general population. PVCs can be demonstrated during Holter monitoring. However, not all premature ventricular contractions found during Holter monitoring are clinically important. Doctors interpreting the Holter monitoring studies must take into account the patient's medical history in determining the importance of Holter monitor findings.""'In patients with infrequent symptoms an event marker may be used in lieu of a Holter monitor as this can be worn for up to 30 days.' "
How are premature ventricular contractions diagnosed (echo and stress test)? ,"'Echocardiography''Echocardiography uses ''ultrasound'"" waves to produce images of the heart's chambers and valves and the lining around the heart (pericardium). Echocardiography is useful in measuring the size of the heart chambers, the forcefulness of heart ventricle contractions, the thickness of the heart muscles, and the functioning of the heart valves. Echocardiography is therefore useful in diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions such as:""'Exercise ''cardiac stress test'' (''treadmill stress test'')''Exercise cardiac stress testing'' (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac ''stress'"" test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at 3-minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes may be observed in the EKG, including increases in premature ventricular contractions and development of ventricular tachycardias."" Mitral valve prolapse: Echocardiography can detect and measure the severity of mitral valve prolapse and other valvular diseases. Muscle hypertrophy: Echocardiography can detect heart muscle hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle) as a result of long-term high blood pressure. Heart muscle damage: Echocardiography can measure the extent of heart muscle damage from heart attacks or cardiomyopathy. Ejection fraction: Echocardiography can be used to calculate the ejection fraction of the left ventricle. Ejection fraction is a measure (estimate) of the amount of blood pumped during each contraction of the ventricle. Heart ventricles extensively weakened by heart attacks or cardiomyopathy will have low ejection fractions. Patients with low ejection fractions have higher risks of developing life-threatening ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations than patients with normal ejection fractions."
How is premature ventricular contraction diagnosed  (ECST and blood tests)? ,"'Adjuncts to ECST (stress echo and nuclear imaging)''Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ultrasound are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the left ventricle (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of ''cardiovascular disease'', if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant cardiovascular disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. Alternatively, nuclear imaging may be used as an adjunct to ECST and may be even more sensitive in noninvasively detecting underlying ''coronary artery disease''.''Blood tests in diagnosing causes of premature ventricular contractions''Blood tests for diagnosing conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions include:' blood electrolyte levels can be performed to detect low potassium or magnesium levels (hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia); blood drug levels can be performed to detect digoxin and aminophylline drug toxicity or thyroid levels, for example, an overactive thyroid may result in premature ventricular contractions; blood oxygenation (oximetry) can be measured to detect hypoxia; blood tests can be performed to detect illicit drugs, such as amphetamine abuse; and blood levels of cardiac enzymes (creatine phosphokinase [CPK], troponins [regulatory proteins]) can be performed to assess for heart muscle damage as a result of heart attacks."
What are the reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions?,"'The reasons for treating premature ventricular contractions are:''In healthy individuals without heart disease, premature ventricular contractions need no treatment. For relief of palpitations, one may consider the following measures:'""Conditions that can cause premature ventricular contractions can also be potentiality life-threatening. These conditions are often treated in hospital-monitored beds. Monitored beds are beds (or rooms) that are equipped to record the patients' heart rhythm continuously. Patients are also given intravenous medications. These conditions are:""   to relieve symptoms of palpitations; to treat conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions since many conditions that cause premature ventricular contractions are potentially life threatening; and to prevent ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. stop alcohol and caffeine intake; stop the use of over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestants that may contain adrenaline such as medications containing pseudoephedrine (certain weight loss supplements may aggravate premature ventricular contractions and should never be used without consulting with one's physician); stop drug abuse such as amphetamines, cocaine; and stop cigarette smoking. low potassium or magnesium levels (hypokalemia and hypomagnesaemia) -- potassium and magnesium can be given intravenously; digoxin and aminophylline toxicity -- medications can be given to counteract drug toxicity; acute heart attack -- medications and procedures (coronary angiogram and PTCA) are performed urgently to open blocked coronary arteries to restore blood supply to the heart muscle; and low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia) -- oxygen can be given nasally and medications can be given to treat the underlying lung diseases."
What medications treat premature ventricular contractions?,"'Antiarrhythmia medications''Antiarrhythmia medications are used to control premature ventricular contractions with the goal of preventing ventricular tachycardias, ventricular fibrillations, and sudden death. Examples of antiarrhythmia medications include ''beta-blockers'' ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone'') and several others. Unfortunately, there is little scientific evidence that suppressing premature ventricular contractions with antiarrhythmic medications prevents ventricular tachycardias, ventricular fibrillations, and sudden death.''Some antiarrhythmia medications actually can cause ''abnormal heart rhythms''. Thus antiarrhythmic medications are only prescribed cautiously in patients at high risk of developing ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and usually initially in the hospital setting. This does not apply to beta-blockers, which are prescribed to many heart patients for many reasons, and not only do not accelerate arrhythmias, but usually decrease premature ventricular contractions. In many patients with premature ventricular contractions and significant underlying cardiac disease, or with severe symptoms, electrophysiology testing (EP) may be recommended. This is a test performed with catheters to see if a patient is at risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, which are treated with either medications or sometimes tiny implantable defibrillators.' "
Extratemporal Cortical Resection Introduction,"'The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Each lobe controls a specific group of activities. With temporal lobe ''epilepsy'', which is the most common type of ''epilepsy'' in ''teens'' and adults, the area where the ''seizures'' start -- called the ''seizure'' focus -- is located within the temporal lobe. However, ''seizures'' can start in any portion of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer (''gray matter'') of the cerebrum.' "
What Is an Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"'In ''epilepsy'', an extratemporal cortical resection is an operation to resect, or cut away, brain tissue that contains a ''seizure'' focus. Extratemporal means the tissue is located in an area of the brain other than the temporal lobe. The frontal lobe is the most common extratemporal site for seizures. In some cases, tissue may be removed from more than one area/lobe of the brain.' "
Who Is a Candidate for Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"""Extratemporal cortical resection may be an option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are disabling and/or not controlled by medications, or when the side effects of the medication are severe and significantly affect the person's quality of life. In addition, it must be possible to remove the brain tissue that contains the seizure focus without causing damage to areas of the brain responsible for vital functions, such as movement, sensation, language and memory."" "
What Happens Before an Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"'Candidates for extratemporal cortical resection undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation including video electroencephalographic (''EEG'') seizure monitoring, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and positron emission tomography (PET). Other tests include neuropsychological memory testing, WADA test (to lateralize the side of language), ictal SPECT, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These tests help to pinpoint the seizure focus and determine if surgery is possible.' "
What Happens During an Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"'An extratemporal cortical resection requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. After the patient is put to ''sleep'' (general anesthesia), the surgeon makes an incision in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts special instruments to remove brain tissue. Surgical microscopes are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of the area of the brain involved. The surgeon utilizes the information gathered during the pre-operative evaluation -- as well as during surgery -- to define, or map out, the route to the correct area of the brain.''In some cases, a portion of the surgery is performed while the patient is awake, using medication to keep the person relaxed and ''pain'' free. This is done so that the patient can help the surgeon find and avoid areas in the brain responsible for vital functions such as brain regions of language and motor control. While the patient is awake, the doctor uses special probes to stimulate various areas of the brain. At the same time, the patient may be asked to count, identify pictures, or perform other tasks. The surgeon can then identify the area of the brain associated with each task. After the brain tissue is removed, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using ''stitches'' or staples.' "
What Happens After an Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"'After surgery, the patient generally stays in the hospital for two to four days. Most people having extratemporal cortical resection will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in four to six weeks after surgery. The hair over the incision will grow back and hide the surgical ''scar''. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure ''drugs'' for two or more years after surgery. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,'Extratemporal cortical resection is successful in eliminating or dramatically reducing seizures in 45% to 65% of cases. Surgery generally is more effective if only one area of the brain is involved.' 
What Are the Side Effects of Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"'The following symptoms may occur after an extratemporal cortical resection, although they generally go away on their own:' Scalp numbness. Headaches. Nausea. Difficulty speaking, remembering things, or finding words. Feeling tired or depressed."
What Are the Risks of Extratemporal Cortical Resection?,"'The risks associated with extratemporal cortical resection are rare and mainly depend on which area of the brain is involved. They may include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia. Swelling of the brain. Failure to relieve seizures. Changes in personality or behavior. Partial loss of vision, memory, or speech. Stroke."
Facts you should know about eye allergies," Most allergic eye conditions are more irritating than dangerous. Allergic or vernal keratoconjunctivitis may result in scarring of the cornea and vision problems. Itchy, watery eyes are probably allergic eyes. Topical antihistamine/decongestant preparations are effective and safe for mildly itchy, puffy, red eyes. Patanol, a topical mast-cell stabilizer, is a safe, highly effective, long-acting treatment. Topical steroids should be used with caution and under the supervision of an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). If in doubt about an eye condition, seek medical advice from a doctor sooner rather than later."
Eye allergy introduction,"""The eyes are the windows to the soul because they reflect our state of mind. This certainly can't be true if our eyes are red, swollen, watery, and itchy from an ""'allergic reaction''. Severe allergic eye symptoms can be very distressing and are a common reason for visits to the allergist, ophthalmologist, and even the emergency room. Occasionally, severe ''eye allergies'' cause serious damage that can threaten eyesight.' "
What are eye allergy symptoms and signs?,"'Typical symptoms associated with eye ''allergies'' include inflammation of the ''conjunctiva'' that is caused by a reaction to allergens. The inflammation causes enlargement of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva (""''congestion''""), resulting in a red or bloodshot appearance of the eyes. These ''allergy symptoms'' can range from very mild redness to severe swelling associated with discharge.'  "
What causes eye allergies?,"'Eye ''allergies'' usually are associated with other allergic conditions, particularly ''hay fever'' (''allergic rhinitis'') and atopic ''eczema'' (''dermatitis''). The causes of eye ''allergies'' are similar to those of allergic ''asthma'' and hay ''fever''. Medications and ''cosmetics'' can play a significant role in causing eye allergies. Reactions to eye irritants and other ''eye conditions'' (for example, infections such as ''pink eye'') are often confused with eye ''allergy''. Any kind of irritant, whether environmental, infectious, or manmade, can cause symptoms consistent with eye allergies.'  "
What is the basic anatomy of the outer eye?,"'Eye allergies mainly involve the conjunctiva, which is the tissue lining (''mucus'' membrane) that covers the white surface of the eyeball and the inner folds of the eyelids. The conjunctiva is a barrier structure that is exposed to the environment and the many different allergens (substances that stimulate an allergic response) that become airborne. It is rich in blood vessels and contains more mast cells (cells that release histamine, a chemical mediator of allergic reactions) than the ''lungs''.''The lacrimal (tear) glands are located in the upper and outer portions of the eye. They are responsible for producing the watery part of tears, which keeps the eye moist and washes away irritants. The tears also contain important parts of the immune defense such as immunoglobulins (antibodies), lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells), and enzymes.''The cornea is the transparent sheath in front of the ''lens'' of the eye. The cornea has no blood vessels and very little immune activity.' "
Why are the eyes an easy target for allergies?,"'When you open your eyes, the conjunctiva becomes directly exposed to the environment without the help of a filtering system such as the cilia, the hairs commonly found in the nose.''Approximately 54 million people, about 20% of the U.S. population, have symptoms of allergies. Almost half of these people have allergic eye disease.''People who are more susceptible to allergic eye disease are those with a health history of allergic ''rhinitis'' and ''atopic dermatitis'' and those with a strong family and/or personal history of ''allergy''. Symptoms and signs usually appear before the age of 30.''The scenario for developing ''allergy'' symptoms and signs is much the same for the eyes as that for the nose. Allergens cause the allergy antibody IgE to coat numerous mast cells in the conjunctiva. Upon reexposure to the ''allergen'', the mast cell is prompted to release histamine and other mediators. The result is ''itching'', burning, and runny eyes that become red and irritated due to inflammation, which results in congestion and discomfort. The eyelids may swell, even to the point of closing altogether. Sometimes, the conjunctiva swells with fluid and protrudes from the surface of the eye, resembling a ""''hive''"" on the eye. These reactions may also induce light sensitivity. Typically, both eyes are affected by an allergic reaction. Occasionally, only one eye is involved, particularly when only one eye is rubbed with an allergen, as this causes mast cells to release more histamine.' "
What are allergic eye conditions?,"'Allergic conjunctivitis'', also called ""allergic rhinoconjunctivitis,"" is the most common allergic eye disorder. The condition is usually seasonal and is associated with hay ''fever''. The main cause is pollens, although ''indoor allergens'' such as dust mites, molds, and dander from household pets such as cats and ''dogs'' may affect the eyes year-round. Typical complaints include ''itching'', redness, tearing, burning, watery discharge, and ''eyelid'' swelling. To a large degree, the acute (initial) symptoms appear related to histamine release.''The treatments of choice are topical antihistamine drops such as olopatadine (Patanol), decongestants, and the newer mast-cell stabilizer medications. Topical steroids should be used only if prescribed by a doctor for severe reactions and on a short-term basis because of the potential for side effects. In general, oral ''antihistamines'' like ''loratadine'' (''Claritin'') or ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec'') are the least effective option, but they are often used for treating allergic rhinitis together with allergic ''conjunctivitis''.''Rubbing itchy eyes is a natural response. However, rubbing usually worsens the allergic reaction due to the physical impact on the mast cells, which causes them to release more mediators of the immune response. Translation: Do not rub your eyes!''Commonly called ""atopic keratoconjunctivitis,"" this health condition is a notorious cause of severe eye changes, particularly in young adults. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis implies inflammation of both the conjunctiva and cornea. ""Kerato"" means pertaining to the cornea. This form of ''conjunctivitis'"" usually affects males 3 times more frequently than females and may begin in late adolescence. It's peak incidence is in males aged 30 to 50. It is more common in those who had ""'atopic dermatitis'' in early childhood. The condition is characterized by intensely itchy, red areas that appear on the eyelids. A heavy discharge from the eyes can occur, and the skin of the eyelid may show scales and crusts. In severe cases, the eyes become sensitive to light, and the eyelids noticeably thicken. If managed poorly, there can be permanent scarring of the cornea due to chronic rubbing and scratching of the eyes. This scarring can cause visual changes.''The triggers for atopic keratoconjunctivitis appear to be similar to those of ''atopic dermatitis''. A search for common ''food allergies'', such as eggs, peanuts, milk, ''soy'', wheat, or fish is important. Airborne allergens, particularly dust mites and pet dander, have been overlooked as a significant contributing factor and should be evaluated and controlled.''The hallmark of treatment for allergic ''conjunctivitis'' is the use of potent antihistamines (similar to those used in ''atopic dermatitis'') to subdue the itching. Topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, and the short-term use of oral steroids are all beneficial for relief of the itching. Occasionally, an infection of the area (usually with ''staphylococcus'', commonly referred to as ""''staph''"") worsens the symptoms, and antibiotic treatment may help control the itching. ''Allergy shots'' are useful in selected cases.''Atopic keratoconjunctivitis can lead to ''cataract'' formation in up to 10% of cases. In rare cases, ''blindness'' can occur.''Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is an uncommon health condition that tends to occur in preadolescent boys (3:1 male to female ratio) and is usually outgrown during the late ''teens'' or early adulthood. (Vernal is another term for ""spring."") Vernal keratoconjunctivitis usually appears in the late spring and particularly occurs in rural areas where dry, dusty, windy, and warm conditions prevail. The eyes become intensely itchy, sensitive to light, and the lids feel uncomfortable and droopy. The eyes produce a ""stringy"" discharge and, when examined, the surface under the upper eyelids appears ""cobblestoned."" A closer examination of the eye reveals severe inflammation due to the vast number of mast cells and accumulated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in the allergic response), producing so-called called ""Trantas dots.""''Improper treatment of vernal keratoconjunctivitis can lead to permanent visual impairment. The most effective treatment appears to be a short-term course of low-dose topical steroids. Topical mast-cell stabilizers and topical antihistamines can also be beneficial. Wraparound ''sunglasses'' are helpful to protect the eyes against wind and dust.''Keratitis'', or the inflammation of the cornea, in vernal and atopic keratoconjunctivitis is largely caused by a substance that is released from the eosinophils called major basic protein.''This health condition is named for its typical feature, large papillae, or ''bumps'', on the conjunctiva under the upper eyelid. These bumps are likely the result of irritation from a foreign substance, such as ''contact lenses''. Hard, soft, and rigid ''gas''-permeable lenses are all associated with the condition. The reaction is possibly linked to the protein buildup on the contact lens surface. This condition is believed, in part, to be due to an allergic reaction to either the contact lens itself, protein deposits on the contact lens, or the preservative in the solution for the contact lenses. Redness and itching of the eye develop, along with a thick discharge.''Allergy to contact lenses is most common among wearers of hard contact lenses and is least common among those who use disposable lenses, especially the one-day or one-week types. Sleeping with the contact lenses on greatly increases the risk of developing GPC.''The most effective treatment is to stop wearing the contact lenses. Occasionally, changing the type of lens in addition to more frequent cleaning or using disposable daily wear lenses will prevent the condition from recurring.''The giant papillae on the conjunctiva, which are characteristic of GPC, however, may persist for months despite these measures. Eye medications, such as ''cromolyn'' (''Opticrom'') or lodoxamide (''Alomide''), often are used in this condition, sometimes for several months. Contact lenses should not be worn while these medications are being used.'  "
What are eyelid allergies (also called contact eye allergies)?,"'Contact eye allergies are essentially ''contact dermatitis'' of the eyelids. This is allergic inflammation of the eyelid from direct contact with certain allergens. Women in particular may experience this problem due to allergic reactions to preservatives in eye products and ''makeup'' (for example, eye creams, eyeliner or eye pencils, mascara, and nail ''polish -- from'' rubbing the eye with the fingers). Other irritants include common ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ointments such as ''neomycin''/bacitracin/polymyxin (''Neosporin'' or Bacitracin) as well as contact lens solutions (especially if they contain thimerosal). Symptoms and signs that are similar to those of a ''poison ivy'' ''rash'' appear 24 to 48 hours after exposure to the offending agent. The eyelids may develop ''blisters'', itching, and redness. The conjunctiva may also become red and watery. If the eyelids continually come into contact with the offending allergens, the lids may become chronically (long term) inflamed and thickened.''The best treatment for eyelid allergies is avoidance of the sensitizing agent(s). Changing to hypoallergenic lens solutions, cosmetics, or topical ''eye care'' products is usually necessary. Application of a mild topical ''corticosteroid'' cream for short periods will probably help. As is the case with atopic dermatitis, it is important to treat any secondary bacterial ''skin infection'' that may develop.'  "
What conditions can be confused with eye allergies?,"'The following is a list of health conditions, the symptoms of which are commonly confused with eye allergy.' Dry eye: This condition results from reduced tear production and is frequently confused with allergy. The main symptoms are usually burning, grittiness, or the sensation of ""something in the eye."" Dry eye usually occurs in people over 65 years of age and can certainly be worsened by oral antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl), hydroxyzine (Atarax), Claritin, or Zyrtec, sedatives, and beta-blocker medications. Tear-duct obstruction: This is caused by a blockage in the tear passage that extends from the eyes to the nasal cavity. This condition is also typically seen in the elderly. The main complaint is watery eyes that do not itch. Allergy testing will be negative in this case. Conjunctivitis due to infection can be caused by either bacteria or viruses. In bacterial infections, the eyes are often ""bright red"" and the eyelids stick together, especially in the morning. A discolored mucous discharge is often seen, so-called ""dirty eyes."" Viral conjunctivitis causes slight redness of the eyes and a glassy appearance from tearing. Adenovirus is a major cause of viral conjunctivitis. Herpes viruses, such as the varicella virus that causes chickenpox or shingles, can also affect the eye. Adenovirus infection is very contagious and may be spread by either direct contact, such as hand contact, or in contaminated swimming pools. You should seek medical attention if you suspect any of the above. If your eye itches and is ""milky"" red, it is most likely allergy. If it burns, it is probably dry eye. If it ""sticks"" in the morning and is bright red, it is usually bacterial or viral conjunctivitis."
What is the treatment for eye allergies? Are there home remedies for eye allergies?,"'Most people with eye allergies treat themselves and do so quite effectively with OTC eye care products. Most commonly, home care consists of an allergy sufferer flushing the eye with water. With exposure to an allergen to the eye, it is important to thoroughly ''flush'' the eye with lukewarm tap water or commercially prepared eyewash solution. If these remedies are not working or if there is ''eye pain'', extreme redness, or heavy discharge, you should seek medical advice. Some conditions, for example, are serious with potential sight-threatening health complications if required treatment is delayed.''Moistening the eyes with artificial tears helps to dilute accumulated allergens and also prevents the allergens from sticking to the conjunctiva. Tear substitutes may also improve the defense function of the natural tear film.''Antihistamine eye drops work by blocking histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The histamine, therefore, is unable to attach to the conjunctiva and exert its effects. They are effective in relieving itching but have little impact on swelling or redness. They have two advantages over antihistamine tablets; there is a quicker onset of action and less drying of the eye. The new generation of topical antihistamines includes emedastine difumarate (''Emadine'') and levocabastine (''Livostin''). The side effects of these medications include mild stinging and burning of the eyes upon use, ''headaches'', and sleepiness. But treatment with antihistamines at the point of irritation is still preferable than treating systemically with oral antihistamines if possible.''Decongestants take the redness away as advertised. However, they do not help relieve itching. They act by shrinking the blood vessels on the conjunctiva. (They are not really effective against allergic eyes.) The decongestants oxymetazdine (''Visine'' LR) and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride (Visine Original) are available OTC. They do have a potential for abuse and should not be used by people with narrow-angle ''glaucoma'', an eye disease characterized by elevated pressure within the eye.''The prolonged use of decongestant nasal sprays can produce a rebound phenomenon in which the medication begins to cause more congestion than it relieves. This phenomenon rarely occurs in the eyes with the repeated use of decongestant drops. The mucous membranes of the eye are different from those of the nose. The eyes can become irritated and less responsive to the drops, but unlike the nose, the eyes tend not to develop ""rebound"" redness.''Combination antihistamine-decongestant preparations can provide quick relief that lasts a few hours. They lessen the ''itch'', redness, and swelling and are very useful for milder symptoms. Common combinations include pheniramine with naphcyoline hydrochloride (''Naphcon-A'' or ''Opcon-A'') and antazoline with naphazoline (''Vasocon''-A). Side effects are minimal, but the drops may become less effective if used for prolonged periods. They do have a potential for abuse and should not be used by people with narrow-angle ''glaucoma''.''Mast-cell stabilizers prevent the release of chemical mediators of inflammation from the mast cells. These are effective for all eye allergies. The first of this class of drug was cromolyn sodium (Crolom or Opticrom), which is available OTC. This topical medicine has been effective for treating mild cases of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and probably mild allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and has no significant side effects. It does have a slow onset of action. The newer agent, lodoxamide (Alomide), is 2,500 times more potent than Crolom and has a faster onset of action. This prescription medicine may be used in children older than 2 years of age and has minimal side effects. One disadvantage is the need to use the drops four times a day, and long-term use is necessary to prevent symptoms.''The most effective mast-cell stabilizer, which also has antihistamine properties, is olopatadine (Patanol). Available by prescription, it is 250 times more effective than Alomide in relieving itching and redness. This drug provides rapid relief of itching and burning eyes. It can also prevent symptoms when used before an exposure or before the ''pollen'' season. The drops are very comfortable in the eye and can be used in children as young as 3 years old. The longer duration of action allows dosing of twice a day.''Another new product, ketotifen (''Zaditor''), also has dual mast-cell-stabilizing and antihistamine effects. It dramatically reduces itching and redness and gives more rapid relief within minutes.''Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'' (''NSAIDS'') are particularly useful in treating itchy eyes. They reduce redness and swelling to a lesser degree. ''Ketorolac'' (''Acular'') is a topical ''NSAID'', which may cause temporary stinging and burning in 40% of users.''Steroid antiinflammatory eyedrops are very effective in treating eye allergies, but they are reserved for severe symptoms that are unresponsive to other treatments. They must be used with caution in people with bleeding tendencies because they can increase the bleeding risk. Since there are significant risks with long-term treatment, their use should be supervised by an ophthalmologist.''Caution must be taken, however, because of the potential side effects of the long-term use of steroids, even in eye drop form. Side effects of steroids include elevated pressure in the eyes and ''cataracts''. The elevated pressure in the eyes can become glaucoma and lead to damage of the optic (eye) nerve and ''loss of vision''. ''Cataracts'' are a clouding or opacification of the clear natural lens within the eye, which can interfere with vision. The purpose of the lens is to focus the light or images that enter the eye. Remember, however, that the side effects of steroids usually occur with long-term use and that steroid eye drops may be very effective when used over the short term. Loteprednol etabonate (Alrex) is a short-acting steroid with fewer side effects that shows great promise in the treatment of allergic eye disease.''Topical steroids may cause or worsen glaucoma and result in cataracts with long-term use. About 500 drops of a high-dose preparation can cause cataracts. Also, remember that with topical steroid eye drops, short-term, low-potency preparations are recommended and should only be used under the supervision of an ophthalmologist.''Oral antihistamines, either OTC or prescription (non- or lightly sedating), may be used for itchy eyes. The OTC products may cause drowsiness, and both can cause drying of the eyes.''In general, treating topical conditions with topical medications is preferable.''When avoidance of offending allergens and local treatments are not effective, allergy shots may be indicated. Your allergist may suggest this form of treatment when other measures have been unsuccessful.''Here are a few general tips worth remembering:'   Eyes that are dry may aggravate eye allergy symptoms. Tear substitutes, such as artificial tears, are an often forgotten but are an effective lubricant. Cold compresses may help, particularly with sudden allergic reactions and swollen eyes. Keep eyedrops refrigerated since this makes application more soothing."
What is the prognosis of eye allergies?,"'The prognosis is favorable for most patients with eye allergies. Typically symptoms clear up quickly with OTC/home treatment or when the offending allergen is not present any more. Unfortunately the symptoms may reoccur depending on the cause of the eye allergy. Health complications are very rare, but medical attentions should be sought immediately for any ''pain'' or ''vision loss'' that occurs or for symptoms that do not resolve within 12 hours.' "
Is it possible to prevent eye allergies?,"'Avoidance is the cornerstone of allergy treatment. It is particularly important to avoid both airborne and contact allergens. Remember, rubbing your eyes is a physical trigger and therefore care should be taken to avoid this.'  "
Black eye introduction,"'A black eye often results from injury to the face or the head, and is caused when blood and other fluids collect in the space around the eye. Swelling and dark discoloration result in a ""black eye"" -- sometimes called a ""shiner.""''Most black eyes are relatively minor injuries. Many heal on their own in a few days, but they may signify a more serious injury.''Despite the name, ""black eye,"" the eye itself is not usually injured. The tissues around the eye may be significantly discolored and swollen without any injury to the eye itself, like a bruise (ecchymosis) around the eye.''The skin around the eye is very loose, with mostly fat underneath it, and fluid accumulates easily in this area. The skin around the eye is one of the first places to swell when the facial area is injured. Depending on the location and type of injury, one or both eyes may be affected. Injuries to the eyebrow, nose, and forehead area often result in black eyes because gravity pulls the blood and inflammatory fluid into the soft tissues under and around the eyes.''As a black eye heals, the swelling around the eye decreases, and the bruise gradually fades away. The ''bruising'' will usually start out a very dark purple, and as it fades, it may change to light purple, then greenish, then yellow before disappearing.'  "
What causes a black eye?,"'The most common cause of a black eye is a blow to the eye, nose, or forehead. Depending on where the blow lands, one or both eyes may be affected.''A blow to the nose often causes both eyes to swell because the swelling from the nasal injury causes fluid to collect in the loose tissues of the eyelids.''Other causes of black eye include:''Other causes of swelling around the eye include (these conditions do not necessarily make the skin turn black and blue around the eye):'   surgical procedures to the face, such as a facelift, jaw surgery, or nose surgery; a certain type of head injury, called a basilar skull fracture, causes both eyes to swell and blacken; this condition is typically described as ""raccoon eyes."" allergic reactions, bites, cellulitis (skin infection around the eye), angioedema (swelling, usually around both eyes), and dental infections."
What are the signs and symptoms of a black eye?,"'Edema'' (swelling) and ''pain'' are the most common signs and symptoms of a black eye, and may be accompanied by discoloration caused by ''bruising''.''Initially, the swelling and discoloration may be mild. The area around the eye often starts off slightly reddened and then progresses to a darker shade, and swelling increases. Some blurry vision or difficulty opening the eye may occur, but more serious visual problems are less common. Over the course of a few days, the area becomes lighter and the swelling decreases.''Signs of a more serious injury are ''double vision'', loss of sight, or inability to move the eye. ''Loss of consciousness'', blood or clear fluid coming out of the nose or the ears, blood on the surface of the eye itself, or persistent ''headache'' can also indicate a severe injury.'  "
When should I call the doctor for a black eye?,"'Most black eyes are minor injuries that heal on their own in a few days with ice and OTC pain medications. Depending on the mechanism of injury and accompanying symptoms, an ophthalmologist might have to examine the injured eye to make sure that no significant injury to the eye has occurred.''Call a doctor if the person:''Consult a health care professional any time you are unsure about treatment or concerned about symptoms.''Some conditions require immediate medical care. Call 9-1-1 or get to an emergency department immediately in the following situations:' experiences changes in vision; has severe pain or swelling that does not go away; has swelling around the eyes that is not related to an injury; has signs of infection (for example, fever, warmth, redness, pus-like drainage), has behavioral changes, has forgetfulness or lethargy, or nausea, vomiting and/or dizziness. the person experiences changes in or loss of vision (especially double vision); an inability to move the eye itself (i.e., unable to look in different directions); any injury in which an object may have pierced the eye or may be inside the eyeball; if there is obvious blood in the eye itself; if there is deformity to the eye; fluid leaking from the eyeball; there are any lacerations (cuts) to the eye area, face, or head; the person has signs of a serious head or facial injury; if the black eye is accompanied by broken bones or teeth; loss of consciousness; changes in behavior; nausea, vomiting and/or dizziness; inability to walk; blood or clear fluids coming out of the nose or the ears; people who take blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), or those with a history of bleeding problems such as hemophilia; swelling after a bee sting near the eye; or from a suspected infection of the eye."
How is a black eye diagnosed?,"'For most black eyes, a doctor will perform a physical exam and will ask about the injury and look for any associated injuries or symptoms.'""The doctor will shine a light into the patient's eyes to look at the pupils and inside the eye itself for any injury, and to check for foreign bodies or abrasions on the eye. The doctor will test the motion of the patient's eye (following the doctor's finger with the eyes) and examine the facial bones around the eye.""'Depending on what the doctor finds, he or she may perform additional testing like an X-ray or a ''CT scan'' if the doctor suspects a fracture to the bones of the face or around the eye (the orbit) or that something is inside the eye.''If there are any special concerns, the doctor may refer the patient to a specialist, such as an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in ''eye care'' and surgery), for follow-up care.' "
What is the treatment for a black eye?,"'Home remedies''Home remedies for black eye include rest and ice applied early after the injury to decrease swelling and pain.''Ice helps decrease swelling by constricting blood vessels, by decreasing fluid accumulation, and by cooling and numbing the area.''For simple, uncomplicated black eyes, the treatment prescribed by health care professionals is similar to home treatment:''Avoid possibly injurious activities until after the eye has healed.'""For more complicated injuries, the patient may be referred to an appropriate specialist; such as an ophthalmologist, who can treat the patient's injuries to the eye itself, or an otorhinolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat [ENT]), or an oral/maxillofacial surgeon for ""'fractures'' to the face.'   Apply ice for 20 minutes every hour for the first 24 hours (a package of frozen vegetables such as peas or corn can be used as it will conform to the shape of the face better than ice cubes). To avoid potential cold injury to the site, wrap the ice or frozen object in a cloth or use a commercial ice pack. Do not use raw meat on a black eye, as putting potentially bacteria-laden meat on a mucous membrane or an open skin injury can be dangerous. ice; pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) (avoid taking aspirin [unless prescribed by your doctor or cardiologist for your heart] because this may increase bleeding); rest; and protection of the injured area."
What are the complications of black eye?,"'Black eye in itself usually is a minor condition that resolves on its own. Severe injuries, especially forceful blunt ''trauma'' to the eye area may result in complications.''Traumatic ''uveitis'' and ''iritis'' ''(iritis is a type of ''uveitis'') result from blunt ''trauma'' to the eye. A black eye may be the first sign of this condition. Iritis generally affects only one eye. Signs and symptoms of ''uveitis'' (and iritis) may include:''Any of these symptoms should be brought to the attention of a physician.''Hyphema'' is an accumulation of blood in the front (anterior) chamber of the eye following injury and can cause damage to the interior tissues of the eye. The amount of blood may be too small to see with the naked eye, or the entire front of the eye may fill with blood.''Glaucoma'' may also result from blunt trauma to the eye, and can occur immediately or years later. The force of the trauma can cause bleeding inside the eye which leads to an increase in eye pressure, and damages the ''optic nerve''. Delayed onset ''glaucoma'' (angle recession ''glaucoma'') can occur as ''scar tissue'' from the injury builds in the eye.''Orbital floor fracture'' (blowout fracture) may also occur as a result of the forceful blunt trauma to the eye. The force of the blow pushes the eyeball further into the eye socket, fracturing the very thin walls of bone that make up the eye socket. This can lead to pinching (entrapment) of the ''optic nerve'' and the muscles that move the eye. Loss of vision or ''double vision'' can result and must be treated emergently.''Retinal detachment'' can result in permanent ''vision loss''. Trauma to the eye can lift or pull the retina from its normal position, lining the back of the eyeball. Symptoms include partial or total loss of vision or flashing lights or spots in the field of vision and must be treated immediately.'   reddened eye (especially around the iris, the colored part of the eyeball); pain that increases with exposure to bright light; a small or irregularly shaped pupil; floating spots before the eyes; or blurred vision."
How can I prevent a black eye?,"'Black eye injury can be avoided with basic injury ''prevention''.' Check the home for items that might cause a fall, such as throw rugs or objects on the floor (such as toys). Wear the appropriate protective gear for any athletic or work-related activity. Wear goggles or other eye protection when working, doing yard work, or other hobbies and sports that may be injurious to the eyes. Wear seat belts while driving and wear helmets when riding a motorcycle."
Eye care introduction,"'""Oh, something is wrong with my eye!"" We have all said this at some time. How uncomfortable it can be! Fortunately, many common eye (''ocular'') disorders disappear without treatment or can be managed by self-treating. Various products -- from artificial tears and ointments to ocular decongestants -- are available over the counter (OTC). These products can help with dryness, ''itching'', or excessive watering of the eye. However, a word of caution...In some instances, what may seem like a minor eye problem may lead to a severe, potentially blinding condition. So, always check with your doctor for any persisting eye symptoms or problem.''Many safe and effective OTC products for mild eye disorders are available for self-treatment. Two important factors to remember when considering self-treatment are:''Ophthalmologists and optometrists both provide routine eye exams. Ophthalmologists are physicians (MDs) who have specialized in diagnosing and medically or surgically treating diseases of the eyes and visual system. Ophthalmology is the medical specialty dealing with the eye. Optometrists are health care professionals who provide vision care and diagnosis. The scope of their care ranges from sight testing and correction to the diagnosis and management of changes in vision. An optician is a technician who is skilled in fitting ''eyeglasses'', their frames, and ''contact lenses''. To self-treat common ocular disorders with OTC eye care products, readers should understand' if the problem appears to involve the eyeball itself, you should consult a physician immediately; and if you use an OTC eye care product for 72 hours without improvement of the symptoms being treated or the condition worsens, you also should see a doctor immediately. If blurring of vision, double vision, eye pain, or visual loss is one of your symptoms, see an ophthalmologist (MD) immediately. what an eye examination consists of; the structure of the eye; the potential causes of the symptoms or disorder; which ocular symptoms and eye disorders are safe to self-treat and those which should be seen by an eye doctor; and the types of OTC eye care products that are available and the disorders in which they may be useful."
What should patients expect during an eye examination?,"""Routine eye exams today often use state-of-the-art technology to examine all portions of the eye in order to both determine the eye's refractive state (whether or not glasses are necessary) and allow the diagnosis of certain eye diseases, such as ""'macular degeneration'' and other retinal diseases, ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', and diabetic changes in the eye. Vision problems may be due to either a need for glasses or a disease of the eyes. Your eye care provider will determine the cause of any ''vision loss'' and evaluate your eye health. A prescription for glasses will be provided if needed. Contact lenses or refractive surgery, such as ''LASIK'', may be discussed. If eyeglasses are prescribed, an optician will fit you for eyeglass frames and order the appropriate lenses, which may be for distance or near or may be for both, as in a bifocal or multifocal glass.' "
"Which common disorders of the eye can (sometimes) be self-treated? Blepharitis, lice, and dermatitis","   Blepharitis: Blepharitis is a common condition that is caused by inflammation of the eyelid. It results in red, scaly, and thickened eyelids and typically some loss of the eyelashes. Blepharitis may be due to either bacterial infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus, seborrheic dermatitis (a type of skin inflammation of unknown cause), or a mixture of the two. It is sometimes associated with rosacea of the face. The most common complaints of blepharitis are itching, flaking of the lids, and a feeling of burning of the eyes. Blepharitis is initially treated by applying hot compresses to the affected lids, followed by an eyelid scrub. If the condition persists, you should see the doctor, who may prescribe antibiotic eyedrops, eye ointments, or oral medication. Lice: The eyelids can become infested with one of two different lice, the crab louse (Phthirus pubis) or the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis). Lice of the eyelids cause symptoms and signs that are similar to those of blepharitis (red, scaly, and thickened eyelids, usually with some loss of the eyelashes). It is common in young school-age children. One can sometimes see movements of the adult lice at the base of the lashes. Petrolatum or a non-medicated ointment is applied to the eyelid and suffocates the lice eggs. RID, NIX, A-2000, or any other preparation that is designed for lice eradication in the hair should not be used near the eyes. Contact dermatitis: Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin that causes swelling, scaling, or redness of the eyelid with intense itching. This condition usually is triggered by the topical use of a product (soap or makeup) or exposure to a foreign substance. If both the upper and lower eyelids are affected, the cause of the inflammation is likely to be an allergic reaction. Even if the foreign substance has previously been used for many years without reaction, allergy can result. Antihistamines that are taken by mouth can be used to treat contact dermatitis of the eyelid. Discontinuation of the offending agent is necessary to minimize recurrences."
What common eye conditions usually require treatment by an ophthalmologist?,"'Trauma'': Blunt trauma to the eye requires immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Trauma to the eye can cause bleeding into the eye from ruptured blood vessels or result in structural ocular alterations that may cause detachment of the retina. Any of these situations can seriously impair vision.''Abrasion'': An abrasion usually occurs when a fingernail or other foreign object rubs across the ''cornea'' or ''conjunctiva'' and removes some surface tissue. There is a risk of bacterial or fungal contamination and infection following an eye abrasion.''Chemical exposure'': Exposure of the eye to household cleaning solutions, fumes, or an actual chemical splash requires immediate evaluation by a physician, though initially it may be self-treated with water or another irrigant.''Keratitis'': Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea that may occur alone or simultaneously with ''conjunctivitis''. This inflammation may be infectious (resulting from a virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite) or noninfectious in origin. The symptoms of keratitis include ''blurred vision'', ''pain'', and intolerance to light (''photophobia''). It also may be due to contact ''lens'' overwear.''Corneal swelling'': Corneal swelling, or ''edema'', is a condition in which excess fluid accumulates within the cornea. The edema causes visual disturbances such as halos or starbursts around lights. Reduced vision may or may not occur. Corneal swelling can arise as a complication of contact lenses, trauma, surgical damage to the cornea, elevated ''intraocular pressure'' or an ''inherited'' defect of the cornea. Hyperosmotic drops or ointment can be used to treat corneal swelling, but additional treatment by a physician is usually necessary.''Uveitis'': ''Uveitis'' is an inflammation of the eye structures in the uveal tract (the ''iris'' and other structures within the eye to which the iris attaches). ''Uveitis'' may occur without an obvious cause or may be due to trauma or an inflammatory disease present throughout the body. Symptoms and signs of uveitis include eye ''pain'', tearing, light sensitivity, and visual blurring. Treatment is directed at both the cause of the uveitis and these symptoms.''Acute angle-closure glaucoma'': ''Angle-closure glaucoma'' is due to an obstruction of the system that drains aqueous fluid from the inside of the eye. As a result, fluid accumulates within the eye and the pressure within the eye increases. Some people have a tendency to develop angle-closure ''glaucoma'' because of crowding of the anatomy of the front of their eyes. It is more common in people who are hyperopic (farsighted). This disorder may be triggered after an eye exam in which the pupils have been dilated or by taking certain oral medications in the susceptible individual. Common symptoms include a severe ''headache'' or eye pain accompanied by ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Vision is also usually blurry. Angle-closure glaucoma should be suspected if these symptoms develop after an agent is used to dilate the pupils for an eye exam. Most patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma in one eye are at risk for developing it in the other eye. The treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma is surgical.'  "
What types of OTC eye care products are available?,"'There are eight types of OTC eye care products commonly available. Each product contains one or more active and inactive ingredients.''A second group of chemical decongestants are the imidazoles (naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, and oxymetazoline). Imidazoles are longer acting than phenylephrine and have fewer side effects, including rebound ''congestion''. Caution still is recommended with imidazoles because of the potential for an increase in ''blood pressure''. Of the three imidazoles, oxymetazoline generally appears to exhibit the least side effects. Naphazoline may dilate the pupils, more in people with lightly pigmented (blue or green) eyes.''Examples of eye drops containing decongestants are ''Naphcon'', Prefrin, and Opcon A.'  Artificial tear drops: Lubricants (also called artificial tears) are synthetic (manmade), water-based solutions that are used to lubricate the eye and thicken tears. Artificial tears are formulated as solutions or suspensions, varying in viscosity. Popular examples of artificial tears include AquaSite, Bion Tears, Celluvisc, Duratears, Gen Teal, HypoTears, Liquifilm Tears, OcuCoat, Refresh, Systane, Tears Naturale, and TheraTears. Many people develop sensitivity to the preservatives in these solutions, causing increasing redness, burning, or itching. Most of these products are also available in a preservative-free (PF) form. Artificial tears usually are used two to five times a day as needed for relief of symptoms. Artificial tear ointments or emollients: Ointments also are useful lubricants. These products are not water-based and contain lubricating ingredients similar to petroleum jelly. Examples of ointments include Lacri-Lube, Moisture Eyes PM, and Refresh PM. Their advantage over a water-based solution is that they remain in the eye longer. These ointments cause visual blurring immediately after their use. Therefore, they are often used only prior to sleep. Eye washes: Eye washes (also known as ocular irrigants) are used to cleanse and/or rinse debris from the eye. These products are balanced to the proper acidity and electrolyte concentration so as to be non-irritating to the eye. Washes are available as liquids or drops. These products may contain boric acid with sodium borate, sodium phosphate, or sodium hydroxide to maintain the proper acidity. Examples of washes include AK Rinse, Dacriose, and Eye-Stream. Hyperosmotics: Hyperosmotics are used to treat corneal swelling. Hyperosmotics draw water out of the cornea and thus reduce corneal swelling. Most OTC hyperosmotics contain sodium chloride in various concentrations as either a solution or an ointment. The 2% solution tends to cause less stinging and burning than the 5% solution but is much less effective in treating corneal swelling. An example of a hyperosmotic for corneal swelling is Adsorbonac. Scrubs: Eyelid scrubs are useful for removing oils, debris, or loose skin that can be associated with eyelid inflammation. Soap agents provide the foaming action. An example of this type of product is Eye-Scrub. Decongestants: Decongestants are used to shrink swollen blood vessels in the congested (red) eye, for example, in conjunctivitis. Phenylephrine is the most common decongestant for this purpose. Patients at risk for angle-closure glaucoma should cautiously use phenylephrine because it can cause an attack of the disease. Rebound congestion, in which blood vessels become dilated even with continued use of decongestants, is a common side effect of phenylephrine. Therefore, if no improvement in redness or symptoms occurs within 72 hours of use, phenylephrine should be discontinued. A frequent side effect of phenylephrine is dilation of the pupils. If phenylephrine is absorbed from the eye into the body, an increase in blood pressure may occur, although this is rare. Nevertheless, patients with high blood pressure should be cautious in using phenylephrine. Additionally, if phenylephrine is absorbed, side effects may occur due to interactions with atropine, tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (Nardil) or tranylcypromine sulfate (Parnate), reserpine (Hydropres), guanethidine (Ismelin), or methyldopa (Aldomet). Antihistamines: Ocular antihistamines are available OTC. These antihistamines are combined with ocular decongestants for the treatment of congestion (conjunctivitis), particularly when caused by allergy. Pheniramine maleate and antazoline both block histamine receptors in the eye, and thus provide relief from the symptoms of itchy, watery eyes. Antazoline may increase pressure slightly in the eye (of concern to patients with glaucoma) whereas pheniramine maleate has little effect on pressure. Common side effects of antihistamines include burning, stinging, and discomfort in the eye. Important side effects that may be associated with oral antihistamines have not been reported with ocular antihistamines. Antihistamines should not be used in patients at risk for developing angle-closure glaucoma. Examples of products that combine an antihistamine and decongestant are Naphcon A and Ocuhist. Newer allergy eye-drop preparations: Recently, new classes of eye drops for the treatment of itching due to allergy have become available over the counter. Zaditor, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drop, is an example of these."
"Superficial foriegn bodies, thermal damage, and pink and dry eye"," Superficial foreign bodies: Lint, dust, an eyelash, or other foreign matter can become stuck on the surface of the eye or under the lids. When the substance cannot easily be removed either with your finger, water, or an eye irrigating solution, a doctor should be seen. Thermal damage: Thermal damage is a burn injury to the eye itself. Exposure to the sun's UV radiation during outdoor activities is an example of minor ocular thermal damage. This commonly affects both, rather than one, eye. An eye lubricant can be applied to soothe the eyes. If there is no relief of the symptoms of pain, irritation or burning of the eyes after 24 hours, a physician should be seen. A more severe thermal injury to the eyes, for example from a welder's arc or from sunlamp exposure, warrants the immediate attention of a doctor. Conjunctivitis: Bacteria, viruses, fungi, allergic substances, or inflammation-promoting agents can cause inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, also known as conjunctivitis. The inflammation causes enlargement of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva (""congestion"") and causes the conjunctiva to become red (""bloodshot""). Itchy eyes may or may not accompany the inflammation. The eyelids may be stuck together in the morning and there may be tearing or discharge from the eye or eyes. The congestion and itchiness can be temporarily treated with ocular decongestants or wetting drops, but the underlying cause may need treatment from a physician. Dry eye: Dry eye is characterized by a white or mildly reddened eye combined with a sandy, gritty, dry feeling. Paradoxically, dry eye can sometimes be accompanied by excessive reflex tearing, with the dryness itself stimulating an increase in the production of tears. Dry eye, also known as DES (dry eye syndrome) or KCS (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), is very common and is increasing in frequency due to an aging population and environmental factors such as increased pollution in the air. Dry eye symptoms are worse at high altitudes and in low humidity situations, such as in airplanes. Dry eye is more common in females. It is sometimes associated with dry mouth (Sjögren's syndrome) or other autoimmune diseases. Other factors thought to contribute to dry eye are some drugs such as antihistamines, antidepressants, or diuretics (water pills). There are many OTC eyedrops available for the self-medication of dry eyes. These vary in their formulations, consistency, and preservatives used. Although these lubricants are effective for treating many cases of dry eye, a physician also should be consulted."
What is the structure of the eye?,"'The eyes are extremely complex sensory organs. About 85% of the total sensory input to our brains originates from our sense of sight, while merely 15% comes from the other four senses of ''hearing'', smell, touch, and taste. The eyes are designed to optimize unobstructed vision under conditions of varying light. Their location, on the outside of the face, makes them susceptible to trauma, environmental chemicals and particles, and infectious agents. The eyelids and the position of the eye within the bones of the orbital ''cavity'' are the major protective mechanisms for the eye.'""The eye itself has the shape of a sphere measuring about 1 inch in diameter. It consists of a clear, transparent dome at the front (the cornea) that is surrounded by the white of the eyeball (the sclera). The iris of the eye is the circular, colored portion within the eye. Behind the cornea is located the pupil, which is the central opening within the iris. Behind the iris and pupil is the eye's lens. The space between the back of the cornea and the front of the lens is called the anterior chamber and is filled with a fluid, called the aqueous humor. Behind the lens is a large space that is filled by the transparent vitreous liquid gel. The inside of the back of the eye is lined by the retina, the thin, light-sensitive tissue that changes light images to electrical signals via a chemical reaction. These electrical signals generated by the retina are sent to the brain through the ""'optic nerve''. Our brain interprets what our eyes see.''The inner sides of the eyelids, which touch the front surface of surface of the eye, are covered by a thin membrane (the palpebral conjunctiva) that produces ''mucus'' to lubricate the eye. This thin membrane folds back on itself and covers the visible sclera of the eyeball. (This continuation of the palpebral conjunctiva is called the bulbar conjunctiva.) Natural oil for the tears is produced by tiny glands located at the edges of the eyelids, providing additional lubrication for the eye. The main component of tears is formed by the lacrimal gland located under the upper lid at the outer corner of each eye. The tears are composed of a combination of the substances produced by the lacrimal gland, the oil glands, and the mucus glands. Tears flow toward the nasal side of the eye and drain into the lacrimal sac, located in the area between the eye and the side of the nose, and then ultimately into the nose.'  "
What inactive ingredients are contained in OTC eye care products?,"'Most eye care products contain ingredients that have no therapeutic value. If an individual has a known sensitivity to one or more of these ingredients, then products containing them should be avoided.''Vehicles'': An ophthalmic vehicle is added to a product to enhance drug action by increasing the viscosity (thickness) of the product. Examples of ophthalmic vehicles are Dextran 70, gelatin, ''glycerin'', poloxamer 407, and propylene glycol.''Preservatives'': Preservatives are included to destroy or limit growth of bacteria that may be introduced into the product during repeated use. Examples of ophthalmic preservatives are benzalkonium chloride (BAK), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, methylparaben, sodium benzoate, and sorbic acid. To avoid ''allergies'', many ophthalmic products are preservative free and are supplied in tiny containers, which once used, are discarded.' "
Hordeolum and chalazion (pictures),"'Hordeolum: ''Commonly referred to as a ''stye'', a hordeolum is an inflammation of one or more obstructed glands within the eyelid, typically with infection caused by bacteria similar to those linked to blepharitis. The primary sign of a hordeolum is a tender, raised nodule on the eyelid. Sometimes, the eyelid is so swollen that the eye appears to be completely shut. Recurrent hordeola can be associated with ''acne rosacea''. Treatment usually is with hot compresses several times per day, but if the problem worsens or does not clear within a week, a physician should be seen. Topical or oral antibiotics may be necessary.''Chalazion'': ''A ''chalazion'' looks similar to a hordeolum and is also secondary to an obstruction of one of the glands of the eyelid. A chalazion is a raised nodule without the tenderness of a hordeolum. It usually does not harbor any infection. Like a hordeolum, it is treated with hot compresses. If the chalazion persists, a physician should be consulted. Although this is not a ''tumor'', surgical removal may be necessary for cosmetic or comfort reasons.' "

"Which common disorders of the eye can (sometimes) be self-treated? Blepharitis, lice, and dermatitis","   Blepharitis: Blepharitis is a common condition that is caused by inflammation of the eyelid. It results in red, scaly, and thickened eyelids and typically some loss of the eyelashes. Blepharitis may be due to either bacterial infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus, seborrheic dermatitis (a type of skin inflammation of unknown cause), or a mixture of the two. It is sometimes associated with rosacea of the face. The most common complaints of blepharitis are itching, flaking of the lids, and a feeling of burning of the eyes. Blepharitis is initially treated by applying hot compresses to the affected lids, followed by an eyelid scrub. If the condition persists, you should see the doctor, who may prescribe antibiotic eyedrops, eye ointments, or oral medication. Lice: The eyelids can become infested with one of two different lice, the crab louse (Phthirus pubis) or the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis). Lice of the eyelids cause symptoms and signs that are similar to those of blepharitis (red, scaly, and thickened eyelids, usually with some loss of the eyelashes). It is common in young school-age children. One can sometimes see movements of the adult lice at the base of the lashes. Petrolatum or a non-medicated ointment is applied to the eyelid and suffocates the lice eggs. RID, NIX, A-2000, or any other preparation that is designed for lice eradication in the hair should not be used near the eyes. Contact dermatitis: Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin that causes swelling, scaling, or redness of the eyelid with intense itching. This condition usually is triggered by the topical use of a product (soap or makeup) or exposure to a foreign substance. If both the upper and lower eyelids are affected, the cause of the inflammation is likely to be an allergic reaction. Even if the foreign substance has previously been used for many years without reaction, allergy can result. Antihistamines that are taken by mouth can be used to treat contact dermatitis of the eyelid. Discontinuation of the offending agent is necessary to minimize recurrences."
What common eye conditions usually require treatment by an ophthalmologist?,"'Trauma'': Blunt trauma to the eye requires immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Trauma to the eye can cause bleeding into the eye from ruptured blood vessels or result in structural ocular alterations that may cause detachment of the retina. Any of these situations can seriously impair vision.''Abrasion'': An abrasion usually occurs when a fingernail or other foreign object rubs across the ''cornea'' or ''conjunctiva'' and removes some surface tissue. There is a risk of bacterial or fungal contamination and infection following an eye abrasion.''Chemical exposure'': Exposure of the eye to household cleaning solutions, fumes, or an actual chemical splash requires immediate evaluation by a physician, though initially it may be self-treated with water or another irrigant.''Keratitis'': Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea that may occur alone or simultaneously with ''conjunctivitis''. This inflammation may be infectious (resulting from a virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite) or noninfectious in origin. The symptoms of keratitis include ''blurred vision'', ''pain'', and intolerance to light (''photophobia''). It also may be due to contact ''lens'' overwear.''Corneal swelling'': Corneal swelling, or ''edema'', is a condition in which excess fluid accumulates within the cornea. The edema causes visual disturbances such as halos or starbursts around lights. Reduced vision may or may not occur. Corneal swelling can arise as a complication of contact lenses, trauma, surgical damage to the cornea, elevated ''intraocular pressure'' or an ''inherited'' defect of the cornea. Hyperosmotic drops or ointment can be used to treat corneal swelling, but additional treatment by a physician is usually necessary.''Uveitis'': ''Uveitis'' is an inflammation of the eye structures in the uveal tract (the ''iris'' and other structures within the eye to which the iris attaches). ''Uveitis'' may occur without an obvious cause or may be due to trauma or an inflammatory disease present throughout the body. Symptoms and signs of uveitis include eye ''pain'', tearing, light sensitivity, and visual blurring. Treatment is directed at both the cause of the uveitis and these symptoms.''Acute angle-closure glaucoma'': ''Angle-closure glaucoma'' is due to an obstruction of the system that drains aqueous fluid from the inside of the eye. As a result, fluid accumulates within the eye and the pressure within the eye increases. Some people have a tendency to develop angle-closure ''glaucoma'' because of crowding of the anatomy of the front of their eyes. It is more common in people who are hyperopic (farsighted). This disorder may be triggered after an eye exam in which the pupils have been dilated or by taking certain oral medications in the susceptible individual. Common symptoms include a severe ''headache'' or eye pain accompanied by ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Vision is also usually blurry. Angle-closure glaucoma should be suspected if these symptoms develop after an agent is used to dilate the pupils for an eye exam. Most patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma in one eye are at risk for developing it in the other eye. The treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma is surgical.'  "
What types of OTC eye care products are available?,"'There are eight types of OTC eye care products commonly available. Each product contains one or more active and inactive ingredients.''A second group of chemical decongestants are the imidazoles (naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, and oxymetazoline). Imidazoles are longer acting than phenylephrine and have fewer side effects, including rebound ''congestion''. Caution still is recommended with imidazoles because of the potential for an increase in ''blood pressure''. Of the three imidazoles, oxymetazoline generally appears to exhibit the least side effects. Naphazoline may dilate the pupils, more in people with lightly pigmented (blue or green) eyes.''Examples of eye drops containing decongestants are ''Naphcon'', Prefrin, and Opcon A.'  Artificial tear drops: Lubricants (also called artificial tears) are synthetic (manmade), water-based solutions that are used to lubricate the eye and thicken tears. Artificial tears are formulated as solutions or suspensions, varying in viscosity. Popular examples of artificial tears include AquaSite, Bion Tears, Celluvisc, Duratears, Gen Teal, HypoTears, Liquifilm Tears, OcuCoat, Refresh, Systane, Tears Naturale, and TheraTears. Many people develop sensitivity to the preservatives in these solutions, causing increasing redness, burning, or itching. Most of these products are also available in a preservative-free (PF) form. Artificial tears usually are used two to five times a day as needed for relief of symptoms. Artificial tear ointments or emollients: Ointments also are useful lubricants. These products are not water-based and contain lubricating ingredients similar to petroleum jelly. Examples of ointments include Lacri-Lube, Moisture Eyes PM, and Refresh PM. Their advantage over a water-based solution is that they remain in the eye longer. These ointments cause visual blurring immediately after their use. Therefore, they are often used only prior to sleep. Eye washes: Eye washes (also known as ocular irrigants) are used to cleanse and/or rinse debris from the eye. These products are balanced to the proper acidity and electrolyte concentration so as to be non-irritating to the eye. Washes are available as liquids or drops. These products may contain boric acid with sodium borate, sodium phosphate, or sodium hydroxide to maintain the proper acidity. Examples of washes include AK Rinse, Dacriose, and Eye-Stream. Hyperosmotics: Hyperosmotics are used to treat corneal swelling. Hyperosmotics draw water out of the cornea and thus reduce corneal swelling. Most OTC hyperosmotics contain sodium chloride in various concentrations as either a solution or an ointment. The 2% solution tends to cause less stinging and burning than the 5% solution but is much less effective in treating corneal swelling. An example of a hyperosmotic for corneal swelling is Adsorbonac. Scrubs: Eyelid scrubs are useful for removing oils, debris, or loose skin that can be associated with eyelid inflammation. Soap agents provide the foaming action. An example of this type of product is Eye-Scrub. Decongestants: Decongestants are used to shrink swollen blood vessels in the congested (red) eye, for example, in conjunctivitis. Phenylephrine is the most common decongestant for this purpose. Patients at risk for angle-closure glaucoma should cautiously use phenylephrine because it can cause an attack of the disease. Rebound congestion, in which blood vessels become dilated even with continued use of decongestants, is a common side effect of phenylephrine. Therefore, if no improvement in redness or symptoms occurs within 72 hours of use, phenylephrine should be discontinued. A frequent side effect of phenylephrine is dilation of the pupils. If phenylephrine is absorbed from the eye into the body, an increase in blood pressure may occur, although this is rare. Nevertheless, patients with high blood pressure should be cautious in using phenylephrine. Additionally, if phenylephrine is absorbed, side effects may occur due to interactions with atropine, tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine sulfate (Nardil) or tranylcypromine sulfate (Parnate), reserpine (Hydropres), guanethidine (Ismelin), or methyldopa (Aldomet). Antihistamines: Ocular antihistamines are available OTC. These antihistamines are combined with ocular decongestants for the treatment of congestion (conjunctivitis), particularly when caused by allergy. Pheniramine maleate and antazoline both block histamine receptors in the eye, and thus provide relief from the symptoms of itchy, watery eyes. Antazoline may increase pressure slightly in the eye (of concern to patients with glaucoma) whereas pheniramine maleate has little effect on pressure. Common side effects of antihistamines include burning, stinging, and discomfort in the eye. Important side effects that may be associated with oral antihistamines have not been reported with ocular antihistamines. Antihistamines should not be used in patients at risk for developing angle-closure glaucoma. Examples of products that combine an antihistamine and decongestant are Naphcon A and Ocuhist. Newer allergy eye-drop preparations: Recently, new classes of eye drops for the treatment of itching due to allergy have become available over the counter. Zaditor, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drop, is an example of these."
"Superficial foriegn bodies, thermal damage, and pink and dry eye"," Superficial foreign bodies: Lint, dust, an eyelash, or other foreign matter can become stuck on the surface of the eye or under the lids. When the substance cannot easily be removed either with your finger, water, or an eye irrigating solution, a doctor should be seen. Thermal damage: Thermal damage is a burn injury to the eye itself. Exposure to the sun's UV radiation during outdoor activities is an example of minor ocular thermal damage. This commonly affects both, rather than one, eye. An eye lubricant can be applied to soothe the eyes. If there is no relief of the symptoms of pain, irritation or burning of the eyes after 24 hours, a physician should be seen. A more severe thermal injury to the eyes, for example from a welder's arc or from sunlamp exposure, warrants the immediate attention of a doctor. Conjunctivitis: Bacteria, viruses, fungi, allergic substances, or inflammation-promoting agents can cause inflammation of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, also known as conjunctivitis. The inflammation causes enlargement of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva (""congestion"") and causes the conjunctiva to become red (""bloodshot""). Itchy eyes may or may not accompany the inflammation. The eyelids may be stuck together in the morning and there may be tearing or discharge from the eye or eyes. The congestion and itchiness can be temporarily treated with ocular decongestants or wetting drops, but the underlying cause may need treatment from a physician. Dry eye: Dry eye is characterized by a white or mildly reddened eye combined with a sandy, gritty, dry feeling. Paradoxically, dry eye can sometimes be accompanied by excessive reflex tearing, with the dryness itself stimulating an increase in the production of tears. Dry eye, also known as DES (dry eye syndrome) or KCS (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), is very common and is increasing in frequency due to an aging population and environmental factors such as increased pollution in the air. Dry eye symptoms are worse at high altitudes and in low humidity situations, such as in airplanes. Dry eye is more common in females. It is sometimes associated with dry mouth (Sjögren's syndrome) or other autoimmune diseases. Other factors thought to contribute to dry eye are some drugs such as antihistamines, antidepressants, or diuretics (water pills). There are many OTC eyedrops available for the self-medication of dry eyes. These vary in their formulations, consistency, and preservatives used. Although these lubricants are effective for treating many cases of dry eye, a physician also should be consulted."
What is the structure of the eye?,"'The eyes are extremely complex sensory organs. About 85% of the total sensory input to our brains originates from our sense of sight, while merely 15% comes from the other four senses of ''hearing'', smell, touch, and taste. The eyes are designed to optimize unobstructed vision under conditions of varying light. Their location, on the outside of the face, makes them susceptible to trauma, environmental chemicals and particles, and infectious agents. The eyelids and the position of the eye within the bones of the orbital ''cavity'' are the major protective mechanisms for the eye.'""The eye itself has the shape of a sphere measuring about 1 inch in diameter. It consists of a clear, transparent dome at the front (the cornea) that is surrounded by the white of the eyeball (the sclera). The iris of the eye is the circular, colored portion within the eye. Behind the cornea is located the pupil, which is the central opening within the iris. Behind the iris and pupil is the eye's lens. The space between the back of the cornea and the front of the lens is called the anterior chamber and is filled with a fluid, called the aqueous humor. Behind the lens is a large space that is filled by the transparent vitreous liquid gel. The inside of the back of the eye is lined by the retina, the thin, light-sensitive tissue that changes light images to electrical signals via a chemical reaction. These electrical signals generated by the retina are sent to the brain through the ""'optic nerve''. Our brain interprets what our eyes see.''The inner sides of the eyelids, which touch the front surface of surface of the eye, are covered by a thin membrane (the palpebral conjunctiva) that produces ''mucus'' to lubricate the eye. This thin membrane folds back on itself and covers the visible sclera of the eyeball. (This continuation of the palpebral conjunctiva is called the bulbar conjunctiva.) Natural oil for the tears is produced by tiny glands located at the edges of the eyelids, providing additional lubrication for the eye. The main component of tears is formed by the lacrimal gland located under the upper lid at the outer corner of each eye. The tears are composed of a combination of the substances produced by the lacrimal gland, the oil glands, and the mucus glands. Tears flow toward the nasal side of the eye and drain into the lacrimal sac, located in the area between the eye and the side of the nose, and then ultimately into the nose.'  "
What inactive ingredients are contained in OTC eye care products?,"'Most eye care products contain ingredients that have no therapeutic value. If an individual has a known sensitivity to one or more of these ingredients, then products containing them should be avoided.''Vehicles'': An ophthalmic vehicle is added to a product to enhance drug action by increasing the viscosity (thickness) of the product. Examples of ophthalmic vehicles are Dextran 70, gelatin, ''glycerin'', poloxamer 407, and propylene glycol.''Preservatives'': Preservatives are included to destroy or limit growth of bacteria that may be introduced into the product during repeated use. Examples of ophthalmic preservatives are benzalkonium chloride (BAK), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorobutanol, methylparaben, sodium benzoate, and sorbic acid. To avoid ''allergies'', many ophthalmic products are preservative free and are supplied in tiny containers, which once used, are discarded.' "
Hordeolum and chalazion (pictures),"'Hordeolum: ''Commonly referred to as a ''stye'', a hordeolum is an inflammation of one or more obstructed glands within the eyelid, typically with infection caused by bacteria similar to those linked to blepharitis. The primary sign of a hordeolum is a tender, raised nodule on the eyelid. Sometimes, the eyelid is so swollen that the eye appears to be completely shut. Recurrent hordeola can be associated with ''acne rosacea''. Treatment usually is with hot compresses several times per day, but if the problem worsens or does not clear within a week, a physician should be seen. Topical or oral antibiotics may be necessary.''Chalazion'': ''A ''chalazion'' looks similar to a hordeolum and is also secondary to an obstruction of one of the glands of the eyelid. A chalazion is a raised nodule without the tenderness of a hordeolum. It usually does not harbor any infection. Like a hordeolum, it is treated with hot compresses. If the chalazion persists, a physician should be consulted. Although this is not a ''tumor'', surgical removal may be necessary for cosmetic or comfort reasons.' "
What are eye floaters?,"'""Eye ''floaters''"" are deposits or condensation in the vitreous (often referred to as vitreous humor, vitreous fluid, or vitreous gel), the material that fills the posterior part of the eye. People use the term eye floaters to describe seeing spots within their vision that move or ""float"" when they look around. Eye floaters may be present in only one eye or both eyes.'  "
Why do people notice an eye floater?,"'The structures in the front of the eye (the ''cornea'' and ''lens'') focus rays of light onto the retina, the light-sensitive tissue lining the inside of the eye. Light coming from images around us focused onto the retina allows one to see. The light going to the retina passes through the vitreous humor, which is a jellylike material that occupies the back two-thirds of the eye. At birth and during childhood years, the vitreous gel is usually totally clear and transparent. Later in life, strands, deposits, or liquid pockets very commonly develop within the vitreous gel. Each of these changes in density casts a small shadow onto the surface of the retina, and these shadows may be perceived by the patient as eye floaters. They are usually light black to gray in color. As the eye moves from side to side or up and down, these strands, deposits, or pockets also shift in position within the eye, making the shadows move and appear to float or undulate.' "
What do eye floaters look like?,"'People describe eye floaters as black spots or specks in the vision, spots in the eyes, straight and curved lines, cobwebs, strings, or ""O"" or ""C""-shaped blobs. Some people see a single ''floater'' while others may think they see hundreds. The lines may be squiggly, thick or thin, and they sometimes appear to be branched. To most people, they appear as various shades of gray and are darker in color than the background. The density of different eye floaters will vary within an individual eye. An eye floater may be more noticeable under certain lighting conditions and be more apparent when looking at a bright sky. Floaters are rarely seen in situations with reduced illumination.''Like fingerprints, no two people have identical patterns of eye floaters. If a person has eye floaters in both eyes, the pattern of the eye floaters within each eye will be different. In any eye that has eye floaters, that pattern of eye floaters may also change over time.''Eye floaters always appear darker than the background and cannot be seen in darkness or with the eyes closed. This is unlike seeing flashes of light, which people often notice in the dark and with the eyes closed.'  "
What are the causes of eye floaters?,"'Any eye condition in which the clarity of the vitreous humor is altered can produce the symptom of eye floaters. As one gets older, changes normally begin within the vitreous humor. The vitreous gel naturally undergoes some liquefaction, resulting in small pockets of more liquid vitreous lying within the firmer gel. This is called vitreous syneresis. The boundary between each liquid pocket and the gel may be noticeable to the individual as one or more eye floaters. In addition, it is normal for the collagen fibers that are within the vitreous to become thickened and denser with age, resulting in eye floaters. Any person who is over the age of 50 will have these changes within their eyes. However, the degree of eye floaters produced by these typical changes will vary from person to person.''As the vitreous normally ages, the gelatinous structure also begins to shrink within the space that it occupies. This shrinkage often leads to the back surface of the vitreous moving forward within that space. The vitreous is normally attached to the innermost tissue of the eye, the retina, at its posterior aspect at the edges of the ''optic nerve''. As the vitreous shrinks, this attachment to the optic nerve may release, and this former attachment now floats within the eye, causing one or more eye floaters that can sometimes seem very large and circular in shape. In addition, the back surface of the vitreous, now floating within the eye, will also cast shadows onto the retina, producing eye floaters. This shrinkage and pulling away of the back of the vitreous is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) or posterior vitreous separation. It is very different from a ''retinal detachment''. About 50% of 65-year-olds will have a PVD in one or both eyes. A person developing a PVD in one eye is likely to develop a PVD in the other eye within the following 18 months.''In addition to vitreous syneresis and posterior vitreous detachments, both of which are normal occurrences that cause eye floaters with ''aging'', there are a large number of abnormalities in the eyes that may also cause the symptoms of eye floaters. Any cellular material within the vitreous may cause eye floaters. ''Red blood cells'' as a result of hemorrhage and white blood cells as a result of inflammation are common types of cellular material causing eye floaters. Hemorrhage into the vitreous may be a result of injury, ''diabetic retinopathy'', a retinal tear through a blood vessel, or eye surgery. Inflammation in the vitreous may be caused by noninfectious ''uveitis'', injury, penetrating or blunt injury to the eye, severe eye infection, or eye surgery.'  "
How common are eye floaters?,"'Eye floaters are extremely common in adults and are a leading symptom that causes people to see an ophthalmologist. Almost everyone has eye floaters by age 70, although some people are much more aware of them than others. It is unusual for children under 16 years of age to notice eye floaters unassociated with eye disease.'  "
What eye diseases are associated with eye floaters?,"'Abnormal eye floaters are associated with the retinopathy of ''diabetes'', retinal tears, ''retinal detachment'', and large degrees of ''nearsightedness''. They occur more commonly in people who have had injury to the eyes, surgery to remove ''cataracts'', or YAG laser surgery after ''cataract surgery''. ''Tuberculosis'', ''sarcoidosis'', ''syphilis'', ''toxoplasmosis'', and acute retinal necrosis of the eye are other inflammatory diseases that are associated with eye floaters. An unusual ''ocular'' condition called asteroid hyalosis is also a cause of eye floaters. Primary or secondary tumors in the eye, including ''lymphoma'' and ''leukemia'', are associated with eye floaters, but these are extremely rare.' "
What are the risk factors for developing eye floaters?,"'Increasing age is a significant risk factor for the development of symptoms of floaters. Being nearsighted (myopic) is a risk factor for eye floaters occurring earlier in life. The process of vitreous syneresis is accelerated in eyes that are highly myopic, and posterior vitreous detachments occur at a younger age in people who are significantly nearsighted. ''Diabetes'' is a risk factor for the development of eye floaters that arise due to ''diabetic retinopathy''. Eye injury is an additional risk factor.' "
Are eye floaters dangerous?,"'Eye floaters can be annoying and may be ''anxiety''-provoking, but by themselves they are not dangerous. The majority of eye floaters are caused by normal ''aging'' changes within the eye. However, a person developing the sudden appearance of eye floaters should be checked by an ophthalmologist to make certain that there is no associated eye abnormality or systemic disease that requires treatment. A sudden onset of many eye floaters or the onset of eye floaters associated with flashing lights could signify a retinal tear that requires treatment to prevent retinal detachment. A curtain or cloud in the vision or a loss of side vision could be a symptom of associated retinal detachment.' "
What types of health care professionals treat eye floaters?,"'If you develop floaters, you should be examined promptly by a health professional trained in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. These include ophthalmologists and optometrists.''An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor (MD) who is specialized in eye and vision care. Most ophthalmologists in the United States are board certified by the American Board of Ophthalmology after taking rigorous written and oral tests. They can deliver total ''eye care'', including performing a complete eye examination, prescribing ''eyeglasses'' and ''contact lenses'', diagnosing and treating eye diseases, and performing surgery on the eyes and the area around the eye.''An optometrist is a doctor of optometry, an OD. To become an optometrist, one must complete a pre-professional undergraduate college education followed by four years of professional education in a college of optometry. Optometrists are licensed by the individual states to practice optometry, just as physicians are licensed to practice medicine by the individual states. Optometrists can perform an eye examination and can determine the presence of vision-related problems. They can also prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses. Depending on the state in which they practice, optometrists also may be allowed to treat eye diseases and prescribe eyedrops for various conditions, but they are not trained or licensed to perform surgery in an operating room.''It is important that the eye care professional dilate both pupils with eyedrops and examine the entire eye, including the vitreous and the retina, when evaluating a patient with a complaint of eye floaters.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose eye floaters?,"""When a patient goes to the ophthalmologist with the symptom of eye floaters, the doctor will first ask the patient questions about them. The ophthalmologist will check the patient's central and peripheral vision, look at the front of the eyes with a slit lamp, and then place drops in the eyes to dilate the pupils. After the pupils are dilated, the retina and vitreous will be examined with bright lights from an ophthalmoscope mounted on the head of the doctor. The ophthalmologist will be able to see the eye floaters themselves and will be able to tell the patient whether there are any associated abnormalities that require further tests or treatments."" "
Do eye floaters go away?,"'Most eye floaters decrease in size, density, and darkness with time. Some of this is due to actual absorption of the floater through the natural processes within the eye. Eye floaters may also shift in position within the eye, resulting in less of a shadow effect. In addition, the human brain tends to adapt to and often becomes used to the presence of eye floaters, ignoring them in a manner similar to the way a person only notices the feeling of shoes on their ''feet'' when they think about it. Eye floaters eventually tend to become less bothersome, both through reduction in density and size and the above described process of neuro-adaptation. ''Anxiety'' about the symptom of floaters can make the floaters more noticeable.'  "
What is the treatment for eye floaters?,'There are no safe and proven methods to cure the symptom of eye floaters caused by vitreous syneresis or posterior vitreous detachment. Most will fade over time and become less annoying or noticeable. Learning relaxation techniques may hasten the neurologic adaptation to persistent eye floaters.' 
Can medication help to remove eye floaters?,"'Although certain herbs, ''vitamins'', home remedies and ''iodine''-containing products have been touted as effective in decreasing eye floaters, none of these have been proven effective in ''clinical trials''. In the unusual cases in which the eye floaters are due to white blood cells in the vitreous from inflammation or infection, appropriate anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' or antibiotics will reduce the number of white blood cells. There are no oral or eyedrop medications of value for the reduction of the common type of eye floaters. Abnormal eye floaters due to bleeding in the vitreous from diabetic retinopathy or a retinal tear will decrease as the blood is absorbed. However, the cause of the bleeding must be addressed to prevent additional bleeding or retinal detachment.' "
Can surgery remove eye floaters?,"'Breaking up of eye floaters using a YAG laser has been advocated by some ophthalmologists, but there is no conclusive evidence that this procedure is both safe and effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye. The vitreous itself can also be surgically removed by a procedure called vitrectomy. This involves multiple incisions into the eye and is used in situations in which there is a large amount of non-clearing blood or inflammatory debris within the eye. Vitrectomy for the treatment of the common type of eye floaters due to vitreous syneresis or posterior vitreous detachment carries with it a significant risk of ''cataract'' formation or retinal detachment and a small but significant risk of serious infection or bleeding within the eye. In the past few years, use of smaller caliber instrumentation for vitrectomy and the performance of partial vitrectomy for vitreous floaters has reduced, but not eliminated those risks.'  "
Is it possible to prevent eye floaters?,'There is no known way to prevent normal eye floaters. Eye floaters as a result of injuries can be avoided by wearing safety glasses when working with power tools or protective ''eyewear'' when participating in certain sports. The incidence of eye floaters from vitreous hemorrhage in diabetic retinopathy can be reduced by improved control of ''hyperglycemia'' (elevated blood ''sugar'').' 
What is the prognosis for eye floaters?,'The prognosis for normal eye floaters is good. Well over 90% of people with floaters are not bothered by their presence.' 
What is tonometry?,'Tonometry is a method of measuring the pressure in the eye by measuring the tone or firmness of its surface.' 
What is the intraocular pressure?,"'Tonometry is very useful to doctors for measurement of the pressure in the eye, or the ''intraocular pressure'' (IOP). An elevated IOP can be dangerous because people with varying degrees of IOP elevation may develop damage to the ''optic nerve''. The optic nerve collects all of the visual information from the retina of the eye and transmits that information to the brain, where the signals are interpreted as vision. When changes occur in the optic nerve leading to decreased peripheral vision and loss of the nerve tissues, a diagnosis of ''glaucoma'' can be made.''Glaucoma'' is a fairly common condition. Many people with glaucoma have not been checked and therefore do not know that they have it. Thus, glaucoma screening efforts as well as regular eye examinations are essential to detect glaucoma at the earliest possible stages.''Glaucoma is usually, but not always, associated with elevated pressure in the eye Actually, glaucoma is now considered a disease of the optic nerve, or ''optic neuropathy''. Generally speaking, the ''vision loss'' in glaucoma usually occurs in both eyes, and is thus termed bilateral. As in many other disease states, the vision loss may not be symmetric, that is, one eye may be worse than the other. Vision loss due to glaucoma often begins with a subtle decrease in peripheral vision. If the glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it may progress to loss of ''central vision'' and ''blindness''.''Vision loss in the chronic open-angle form of glaucoma generally occurs gradually over many years, while the vision loss of acute angle closure glaucoma may occur within a matter of days if not immediately treated. Since patients with ''open-angle glaucoma'' rarely notice their gradual peripheral visual field loss, they may not visit an eye doctor until advanced changes have occurred. Unfortunately, the visual field loss in glaucoma represents permanent damage to the optic nerve and is therefore irreversible. For this reason, glaucoma is often called the sneak thief of sight.' "
Who is at risk for glaucoma?,"'Glaucoma occurs when the normal fluid in the front of the eye chamber, the aqueous humor, is blocked from leaving the eye during the normal aqueous turnover process. This blockage can occur for a number of reasons, the most common of which is simply poor outflow due to chronic open-angle glaucoma. A number of other problems can also impede the ability of the outflow channels to function properly, thus creating elevated IOP. Glaucoma is rarely if ever a disease of excessive aqueous humor production. An eye doctor, your ophthalmologist or optometrist, can usually detect those individuals who are at risk for glaucoma. These patients are called ""glaucoma suspects"" and must be monitored closely for subtle changes in their visual field or in their optic nerve.''There are many risk factors for glaucoma, including:''The eye doctor also can diagnose patients who already have glaucoma by observing their nerve for damage or detecting visual field loss with a peripheral ''visual field test''. Patients with glaucoma must be monitored closely for the remainder of their lifetime in order to adequately treat the IOP and assess treatment effectiveness. It is extremely cost effective to avoid visual disability due to glaucoma, enabling the at-risk patient or the patient with glaucoma to have an active lifestyle with functional central and peripheral vision.' family history of glaucoma, anatomical variations including narrow filtering angles or anatomical damage to the filtering angles, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), diabetes mellitus, previous ocular trauma, injury, or surgery, use of steroid pills, eye drops, patches, injections, or nasal sprays, excessive pigment in the front or anterior segment of the eye, many congenital disorders of the eye such as Peter's anomaly or Sturge-Weber syndrome, many degenerative disorders of the eye such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome, extremely advanced cataract, African American heritage, proven visual field loss or anatomical changes in the optic nerves, inflammatory disorders of the eye such as iritis, uveitis, or pars planitis, many infectious diseases of the eye such as Herpes simplex, toxoplasmosis, Fuch's uveitis syndrome, or shingles (Herpes zoster), an extremely thin cornea, and excessively high myopia, generally greater than 6 diopters."
How is tonometry done?,"'Tonometry is generally performed upon an anesthetized ocular surface.  Anesthesia is generally rendered with a single drop of topical anesthetic, such as proparicaine (Alcaine) or tetracaine (Pontocaine).  The tonometer device lightly touches the surface of the eye, ever so slightly indenting the cornea.  The resistance to indentation is measured by a precisely calibrated pressure sensing device, the tonometer.  Several types of tonometers are available for this test, the most common being the applanation tonometer:'""After the eye has been numbed by the technician or doctor with anesthetic eye drops, the tonometer's sensor is placed against the surface of the eye.  The firmer the tone of the surface of the eye, the higher the pressure reading.  The doctor can record the pressure reading, and this can be used to diagnose or monitor the treatment of glaucoma.  Also, the pressure reading is lower than otherwise expected if the cornea is thin.  Thus, patients with a thin cornea may obtain a falsely low IOP reading when the actual pressure is high.  These patients must be watched more closely for glaucoma."" Goldman applanation tonometer: the ""gold standard"" instrument attached to the slit lamp biomicroscope used in all eye doctors' offices. It requires a cobalt blue light source and a small droplet of fluorescein on the ocular surface. A tiny pressure sensor attached to a spring-loaded arm is gently placed against the tear film, and the doctor or technician reads the pressure through the microscope under the blue light. Tono-Pen handheld electronic contact tonometer: This widely used, portable, handheld device runs on hearing aid batteries and calibrates digitally with the push of a button.  It requires a disposable sterile cover for each patient.  The sterile device tip is gently placed against the tear film by the doctor or technician, and the pressure reading appears on the digital readout simultaneous to a faintly audible beep. pneumotonometer contact device: The device is operated similarly to the handheld tonopen tonometer, but due to its larger size, it's not readily portable.  It requires a continuous gas supply and separate gauge container with analog readout attached to a long tube and pressure probe.  This is an older technology and has largely been replaced by the handheld tonopen tonometer. The airpuff noncontact tonometer, which generally requires no anesthetic drop, is widely used in doctor's offices, clinics, and screening facilities.  It is very safe due to the ""no touch"" technology, but it often produces falsely elevated readings, particularly in patients who squeeze their muscles upon anticipation of the air puff.  The patient simply sits then places their chin in a rest while looking straight ahead, while the operator activates the air puff mechanism while aligning each eye individually. Tactile finger applanation over the closed eyelid by a skilled eye doctor is an age-old traditional method utilized by the experienced practitioner. Intraocular sensors for experimental or intraoperative use during surgery are utilized in research and technology development companies.  Hopefully, these will become universally available for long-term use and patient self-readout. Patient self-testing devices are in their infancy.  The ProVision device marketed by Bausch & Lomb allows the patient to gently press a calibrated spring-loaded piston against the closed eyelid over the upper, outer quadrant of the eyeball while gazing downward.  The true IOP is reached when the pressure applied onto the globe produces faint lights in the eye, or phosphenes, readily perceived by the patient and thereby recorded at home."
What is tonometry used for?,"'Tonometry is an essential component of the global examination in all eye check-ups and specifically for a glaucoma examination. A complete glaucoma examination has a number of important components.'""These tests together give a complete picture of the patient's ocular health and therefore the risks for developing or controlling a given disease such as ""'cataracts'', ''macular degeneration'', or glaucoma. The following tests make up a glaucoma examination:''Once the examinations have been completed, a decision is made as to whether or not glaucoma treatment should be given, maintained at its current level, or modified. If the patient is doing well, then glaucoma treatment may be withheld or cut back. If the patient is doing poorly, then more treatment may be recommended. There are several approaches to glaucoma treatment, any or all of which may be appropriate for a given patient. These include but are not limited to the following:''The bottom line for any patient, and particularly the patient who might be at risk for glaucoma, is to have regular visits to your eye doctor. Patients over the age of 50, or patients at risk of glaucoma over the age of 40, should have regular annual eye examinations.' medical and ocular history visual acuity testing refraction to measure the glasses or lens correction tonometry testing for IOP Slit lamp biomicroscope examination is the ""stethoscope"" of the eye doctor. This high-quality optical device allows the doctor to view the eyes in stereo under high magnification while the patient places their chin on a rest and their forehead against a bar to maintain consistent positioning. Numerous details can be discerned by the trained observer, rendering possible a specific diagnosis, including the etiology (or cause) of an individual patient's glaucoma. gonioscopy to examine the aqueous humor outflow channels peripheral visual field testing Optic nerve head photography is taken by high-quality cameras and recorded, usually digitally. This allows precise comparison from year to year, permitting analysis of subtle anatomical changes over time. Optic nerve head topography, including timaging techniques like Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), create precise digital images of the nerve thickness around the optic nerve to within 1/1000 of a millimeter. These detailed images of the retina document any changes in a precise objective way. Subtle loss of nerve thickness indicates the progression of glaucoma. topical eye drop medications: beta blockers, prostaglandins, alpha agonists, aqueous suppressants, and miotics oral ocular hypotensive or pressure-lowering medications: most commonly acetazolamide (Diamox) or methazolamide (MZM). laser treatment: SLT (selective laser trabeculoplasty) or ALT (argon laser trabeculoplasty) for open-angle glaucoma and PI (peripheral iridotomy) for closed-angle glaucoma filtering procedure: Traditional trabeculectomy surgery permits drainage of the aqueous humor in the front of the eye to a bubble or bleb on the conjunctiva, or clear surface over the white part of the eye. This surgery has been performed for centuries and has been highly perfected under the outstanding control of the operating-room microscope by skilled surgical hands. shunting procedure: The eye doctor places a plastic tube and emptying chamber into the eye in the operating room. Commonly used devices include the Molteno shunt, the Express shunt, the Baerveldt valve, and the Ahmed valve. This procedure accomplishes the same effect as the trabeculectomy but generally lasts longer because the plastic tube avoids closure by normal progressive tissue scarring. outflow enhancement procedures: These include the viscocanalostomy or the canaloplasty operations that allow the drainage of aqueous humor without a conjunctival bleb or plastic drainage device. Instead, the natural drainage pathways in the anterior or front of the eye are opened surgically, allowing more facile egress of aqueous into the channels of the ocular surface and orbit, or eye socket. Newer oral medication strategies to preserve or enhance optic nerve head function: These include antioxidants such as ginkgo biloba or prescription neuro-protectants such as memantine (Namenda)."
What is eye strain?,"'The term ''eye strain'' is frequently used by people to describe a group of vague symptoms that are related to use of the eyes. Eye strain is a symptom, not an eye disease. Eye strain occurs when your eyes get tired from intense use, such as driving a car for extended periods, reading, or working at the computer. If you have any eye discomfort caused by looking at something for a long time, you can call it eye strain.''Although eye strain can be annoying, it usually is not serious and goes away once you rest your eyes. In some cases, signs and symptoms of eye strain are a sign of an underlying eye condition that needs treatment. Although you may not be able to change the nature of your job or all the factors that can cause eye strain, you can take steps to reduce eye strain.' "
What causes eye strain?,"'The medical term for eye strain is ''asthenopia''. The symptoms of ''ocular'' ''fatigue'', tired eyes, blurring, ''headaches'', and occasionally doubling of the vision are brought on by concentrated use of the eyes for visual tasks. Some people, while concentrating on a visually intense task such as reading fine print, using the computer for hours at a time, or trying to see in the dark, unconsciously clench the muscles of their eyelids, face, temples, and jaws and develop discomfort or ''pain'' from overuse of those muscles. This may lead to a vicious cycle of tensing those muscles further and causing more distress. Other people attempting to do similar visual tasks may have no symptoms at all.''Common precipitating factors for the onset of eye strain include extended use of a computer or video monitor, straining to see in very dim light, and exposure to extreme brightness or glare. Many people will blink less than normal when performing extended visual tasks. This decreased blinking may lead to dryness of the ''ocular'' surface and symptoms of ''dry eyes''.''Refractive errors (a need for ''glasses'' for distance or near vision, or both) may produce the symptoms of eye strain.''The inability to make both eyes work together in a binocular fashion may also generate the symptoms of eye strain. However, most individuals who have limited or no binocular vision have no such symptoms.''In people who already have ''headaches'' or blurring of vision due to eye strain, symptoms may be worsened by an underlying eye problem such as an eye muscle imbalance or a need for glasses for the correction of ''myopia'', ''hyperopia'', or ''astigmatism''. Wearing glasses with an incorrect prescription may cause eye strain. In those who already have eye strain, not getting enough ''sleep'', certain medications, being under ''stress'', or being fatigued can also make those symptoms worse.'  "
What are the symptoms of eye strain?,"'If one asks patients who complain of eye strain to define what they mean by that term, they may describe nonspecific soreness of the eyes, mild tearing or dryness, blurring of vision, soreness of the back of the neck, doubling of vision, light sensitivity, difficulty focusing on images, tightness of the temples, forehead, brow area, or back of the head, or combinations of all of these. ''Headache'' is the most common symptom. It is usually mild, located in both temples, not pounding, and often relieved by stopping the visual task.'  "
What are the signs of eye strain?,"'The diagnosis of eye strain is made by a physician on the basis of the history as described by the patient and the absence of any serious eye disease. There are no specific tests to prove that the symptoms are indeed due to eye strain. There are no methods to objectively measure the degree of eye strain.''You should see an ophthalmologist if you have ongoing ''pain'' in the eye'', ''visual loss'', ''redness'', or irritation of the eyes. These symptoms cannot be explained by eye strain. In general, if your eye strain is not relieved by resting your eyes, an eye examination should be performed. If you are examined by your ophthalmologist for your symptoms of eye strain, he or she will do an examination, including checking to see if you need glasses. If the doctor feels glasses may make your eyes more comfortable, these will be prescribed.''Symptoms of eye strain are unusual in children under 12 years of age. If your child complains of ''headaches'' after reading, eye ''fatigue'', blurring of vision, or ''double vision'', a visit to an ophthalmologist is warranted to rule out any underlying eye condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose eye strain?,'Eye strain is diagnosed on the basis of the history that the patient provides and the absence of any serious eye disease.'  
What is the treatment for eye strain?,"'Eye strain is extremely common. As computer use has become commonplace, more people are experiencing what has been termed ""computer vision syndrome,"" which is synonymous with eye strain. In most of these people, the symptoms are mild and they are aware that their feelings of the eyes being ""tired"" can be relieved by briefly closing their eyes and taking a break from the visual task they are performing. The symptoms will often be absent or markedly reduced on days when computer use is more limited.''Although eye strain is uncomfortable, there are no long-term consequences of eye strain. There is no evidence that eye strain causes any adverse changes in the eyes. There is also no evidence that, in adults, continuing to do visual tasks while experiencing eye strain will result in any structural damage to the eyes.''Eye strain, however, can be unpleasant and disruptive to your ability to concentrate and work. The symptoms of eye strain may lead to physical ''fatigue'', decreased productivity, increased numbers of work errors, and ''anxiety''.''If you feel that you are experiencing eye strain after extended reading, try to adjust your lighting to maximize illumination while minimizing glare, take frequent brief breaks from the visual task, and consciously blink a few extra times. Firmly massaging the temples with your fingers in a rotary fashion for a minute while closing your eyes is often helpful in relieving the symptoms.''If you experience eye strain while working at your computer, increasing the resolution of your screen (CRT) and reducing ambient lighting may be helpful. Adjusting the distance of your eyes from both the computer screen and your reading material may also relieve your symptoms. Changing brightness and contrast levels on your monitor and increasing text size can also be advantageous. Rather than keeping your eyes focused on the computer screen for hours at a time, interrupt this process every 15 minutes by briefly looking out of the window or around the room.''When performing extended visual tasks of all sorts, occasionally stand up, move about and stretch your arms, legs, back, neck, and shoulders.''If the symptoms of eye strain are predominantly those of dryness and increasing your blink frequency is not helpful, using an ''over-the-counter'' tear substitute a few times a day can be efficacious.'""If all these home treatments don't work to relieve your eye strain symptoms, see your ophthalmologist."" "
What is the prognosis of eye strain?,"'The symptom of eye strain does not result in any damage to the eyes. Therefore, the prognosis is excellent. Relief of eye strain symptoms will usually occur using the above techniques.' "
Is it possible to prevent eye strain?,"'Once you recognize that your symptoms are caused by eye strain, you can usually modify the task that produces the eye strain sufficiently to reduce or eliminate the eye strain.'  "
Introduction,"' Are you frustrated with sagging skin in your forehead region? Then the forehead lift and eyebrow lift, also  called ""the brow lift,"" may be just what you\'re seeking. This popular procedure is used to help reverse the ''aging''  process (think deep ''wrinkles'"" and creases across your forehead caused by years of facial expressions and environmental effects).  But don't be fooled. Younger people are also candidates if they have ""'inherited'' traits, such as lowbrow or other problems.' "
What Is a Brow Lift?,"' A forehead lift can be performed using one of three common procedures: an endobrow lift performed through an endoscope, an open brow lift, or a temporal lift. The procedure cosmetically corrects sagging in the forehead skin, upper eyelids, and eyebrows.'""Here's how:""' Your surgeon will maneuver tissues and remove segments of muscles and skin that are responsible for ''wrinkles'' or deep frown. Sometimes, this procedure is performed in conjunction with a \tface-lift or reshaping of the nose.'' Think about it. You want your facial features to have the same contoured appearance. If you only have the work  done on your forehead, other areas will appear more aged. If you are interested in learning about other procedures,  you can discuss the options with your surgeon.'' There are two methods to lift your forehead and eyebrow areas:'"" Here's how the endoscopic lift differs: Instead of making one continuous incision, your   surgeon will make a few shorter incisions in the scalp. He or she will insert a scope (small camera on the end of   a thin tube) into one of the incisions in order to view the tissues and muscles from a screen. At the same time,   he or she will use another device inserted in another incision to make the necessary alterations."""" In this procedure, small anchors are used to secure the offending tissue once it's altered appropriately.   Those anchors are tiny, but mighty. They'll keep your tissue under control for years. Because the incisions are   smaller, this procedure is less invasive. You will experience minimal scarring and shortened recovery time."" the classic lift endoscopic lift."
Does My Health Insurance Cover This Procedure?,"""  A forehead lift is a cosmetic procedure and is not covered under health insurance plans unless you have severe visual field loss. It's important that you receive price quotes in writing from your surgeon's office and that you understand charges for any follow-up care."" "
What can I expect during a brow lift consultation?,"""You've selected the surgeon, now it's time for the consultation about your \tbrow lift.""'You should prepare by having your medical history handy (for instance, have you previously undergone facial   surgeries to correct ''aging'' or wrinkling?), current medical conditions and any medications. This will all affect   how your surgeon analyzes your case and determines how to approach your surgery. Also, you should know exactly   what you want to correct about the current appearance of your forehead.'' Your surgeon will evaluate your   entire forehead region, including your upper eyelids, paying attention to the muscles. The surgeon may have   you make a variety of facial expressions so he or she can evaluate exactly how to help you.' "
How do I prepare for brow lift surgery?,"'There might be some lifestyle adjustments you have to make before you can undergo a brow lift. For instance, do you smoke? Then you may have to quit, or at least curtail your habit for a few days. But this is up to your surgeon, and he or she will provide you with specific pre-operative instructions.''You may also have to avoid ''alcohol'' and certain medications. If you regularly take an ''aspirin'' or other anti-inflammatory drug, your surgeon will ask you to stop taking these for a certain period of time before the surgery. These ''drugs'' can cause increased bleeding and should be avoided.'' Also, be advised: if your hair is long and will get in   the way of the procedure, you may have to trim it. If your hair is shorter, you may seek to grow it out to cover   any ''scars''. You will be able to discuss all this with your surgeon and how you should prepare.' "
What will I need at home after brow lift surgery,"""You should make sure your house is stocked with plenty   of gauze and clean towels once you've arrived home after your brow lift. Also make sure to have the following on hand:"" Plenty of ice Container to use for ice or cold water Plastic freezer bags to hold the ice OR you can also 
  keep bags of frozen corn or peas on hand Pillows (you'll have to keep your head elevated for a 
  period of time) Ointment for the incision area (which your surgeon can recommend or prescribe, if necessary)"
What can I expect the day of surgery?,"""Typically, you can undergo a brow lift at your surgeon's office, in a hospital, or outpatient surgery facility. Your surgery should be completed within two hours and you will not normally need to stay overnight. However, you will need to bring someone along who can drive you home and, if you live alone, stay with you the first night or two.""'Your surgeon will use local anesthesia. But, if it makes you more comfortable, you can request an   anesthesia that will put you to ''sleep'' during the operation (general anesthesia). Once the operation has   ended, your surgeon will close the incision areas with ''stitches'' or staples. Then he or she will cleanse   the area to remove blood and cover the ''wound'' area with a soft, sterilized bandage that will surround your face.'""It's very important to follow the instructions on how to care for the bandage and how frequently you should change it."" "
What should I expect after brow lift surgery?,"'Your recovery is going to vary depending upon which procedure you had: a classic or endoscopic \tbrow lift.'' In either case, you will have stitches or staples in the incisions which will need to be removed in about a week.   If you have temporary fixation screws, these will be removed in about two weeks (these fixtures are installed beneath   the hairline to hold the elevated brow in place).'' You will probably experience swelling and ''bruising'', which can   also affect other parts of your face, including your cheeks and eyes. The swelling should be gone in about a week.   For at least two days following surgery, you should keep your head elevated to \thelp alleviate the swelling, and you can   gently apply ice packs to the affected region.''For those who undergo surgery via the classic method, you will   most likely experience more ''pain'' during your recovery. Your doctor will give you a prescription for a painkiller.   You may also experience more ''itching'', which can last for a few months.''Those patients who undergo surgery via endoscopic method will also receive a prescription painkiller. ''Itching'' can also be a side effect for those who have undergone the endoscopic method, though it is much more mild than with the classic method.''In either case, you may also   experience numbness or tingling. This will subside over time. Those who underwent the classic procedure may   experience more numbing.''Most patients can return to work or school within 10 days, some sooner, depending on which procedure   you underwent and your own personal rate of recovery.''You should be sure to avoid heavy lifting, vigorous   ''exercise'' or other activity for the first few weeks after surgery.'""Though the side effects are minimal,   possible complications can include infection, scars, complications with eyebrow movement or the loss of   sensation around the incision site.

Nonprescription eyeglasses,"'Nonprescription eyeglasses are primarily for people who can no longer read fine print. This condition, called ''presbyopia'' or ""old vision,"" usually begins at about the age of 35 and progresses until about the age of 55. This inability to focus clearly at near distances is a universal condition associated with human ''aging''. ''Presbyopia'' is not a disease, nor does it represent a degenerative process or presage ''blindness'"". Presbyopia is simplistically a result of gradual hardening of the eye's natural ""'lens'' proteins, rendering the lens less elastic and thus less able to change its shape and less able to alter its focal length to nearer objects.''Although ''over-the-counter'"" (OTC) glasses do not appear to harm vision, if they are not appropriate for a person's eyes, they can cause eyestrain, or asthenopia, after prolonged use. In addition, OTC glasses have the same focusing power in both the left and the right eye, which often does not match the exact prescription of many patients who have a significant difference in the power of their eyes. This power mismatch, called anisometropia, can also cause eyestrain or asthenopia even though the OTC glasses may be correct for one eye.""'Most vendors offer standard and bifocal lenses, and some vendor locations also offer transitional lenses that lighten up indoors and darken when outdoors. Reading glasses may be available in both full reading vision or in bifocals. Bifocals, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1790, have a lower segment to see up close, with an upper segment consisting simply of clear glass for distance vision.''The quality and durability of OTC eyeglasses vary widely. Cheap models -- costing as little as a few dollars -- may have lenses that scratch easily and distort vision. Expensive models -- costing $50 or more -- may incorporate some or all of the desirable characteristics of high-quality prescription lenses. There is no permanent harm to the eyes from wearing poorly focused or distorted lenses. However, ''eye strain'', computer vision problems, and poor quality vision from cheap or improperly fitted eyeglasses can reduce productivity and accuracy.''Manufacturers rate the power of nonprescription glasses from weakest (+1.00 diopters) to strongest (+3.50 diopters or more). When making a selection, the customer tries on eyeglasses and reads fine print while standing 12 to 14 inches from the print, or simply holding the printed material at a comfortable, customary reading distance. The customer keeps trying on glasses with different power ratings until the print comes into sharp focus. Suppose, for example, the print comes into focus when the customer is wearing eyeglasses with a power rating of +2.00. The customer then knows that a +2.00 rating is correct and can select from styles with that rating. This same customer may prefer a lower power, such as a +1.25, for intermediate distance work such as knitting or using a computer. Intermediate work generally focuses at a distance of 16 to 24 inches.''As we age, our eyes continue to gradually lose the ability to focus up close. Thus, a younger person first requiring reading glasses may require only +1.00 diopter lenses, which may progress with time to +2.50 diopter lenses.' "
Trifocals and variable lenses,"'Some people will require multiple distances or focal lengths for a wide variety of tasks, including near and intermediate tasks. Near tasks include reading, arts and crafts, fingernail trimming or model airplane building, while intermediate tasks include computer use, knitting, shaving at the bathroom mirror, or reading piano music while performing, for example. When presbyopia advances, our eyes lose the ability to see intermediate as well as near items. For these special needs, a trifocal lens may be required. This allows for clear distance, intermediate, and near vision. The trifocal lens is generally placed in the same location as the bifocal, with a smaller segment closer to the center of the lens.''A further advance is the variable focus lens, in which the lines between the bifocal and the distance lens are eliminated, providing a gradual transition from near to far, with intermediate therefore in between. Varilux is a common brand name among numerous others. Many people prefer these more expensive lenses because the transition line is so annoying. It may take several weeks to become accustomed to this type of lens. These lenses provide the intermediate distance in the region between the bifocal and the distance segments, thus creating a trifocal capability using a simple subtle tilt of the head as well.''In some cases, customers may also be asked for the ""pupillary"" distance. This is actually the interpupillary distance, the distance between the pupils of the eyes. The pupils, although black in appearance, actually represent the round clear optical space defined by the center of the colored brown or blue ''iris''. This distance is usually measured in millimeters.''Doctors do not recommend nonprescription glasses as a permanent solution to significant ''eye problems'' because they usually are not as accurate as prescription lenses. In addition, the use of OTC glasses could lead to the postponement of an eye examination that could reveal a serious underlying problem such as ''glaucoma'', ''cataract'', or ''macular degeneration''. However, OTC glasses are okay to keep as ""backups"" for times when prescription glasses have been misplaced or are being repaired. Be certain to follow the recommendation of your ''eye care'' provider, an ophthalmologist or optometrist, before relying upon OTC readers.' "
Sunglasses,"'Sunglasses that can be purchased without a prescription come in hundreds of models with varying shapes, materials, coatings, configurations, and colors.'""A must-have feature for all sunglasses is complete (100%) protection against the potentially damaging effects of the sun's ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. Avoid buying dark sunglasses that do not offer 100% UV protection. Dark glasses prompt the pupil of the eye to dilate (enlarge), allowing UV rays to enter. So, if dark glasses lack complete UV protection, they can paradoxically promote damage to the eye.""'Ultraviolet rays are well-known contributing causes of the following ''eye conditions'':''Ultraviolet rays are well-known causes of the following ''eye conditions'':''Some favorable features that consumers should be aware of include the following:'  Macular degeneration is a potentially blinding condition in which the pigment cells in the optical center of the retina slowly degenerate during the dry form of this increasingly common disease, creating distorted vision. The rapidly changing form, or wet macular degeneration, can lead to sudden vision loss. Fortunately, remarkable new medications are now available to arrest and reverse damage caused by wet macular degeneration if caught in time. Cataract is an extremely common condition in which the clear crystalline lens of the eye develops progressive clouding and opacity. People living at high altitudes, equatorial regions, and those with outdoor occupations generally develop cataracts at a younger age than others due to increased lifetime UV exposure. Pterygium is a degenerative process on the ocular surface in which the normally clear mucous membrane, called the conjunctiva, overlying the white part of the eye, or sclera, gradually becomes cloudy and elevated, and then grows toward the center of the cornea. Advanced cases can lead to vision distortion and permanent loss of visual acuity. Once again, people from equatorial regions and those with outdoor occupations are much more likely to develop pterygium. Fishermen, farmers, sailors, surfers, construction workers, and sun worshippers are particularly susceptible. Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing superficial cancer in which abnormal skin cells turn cancerous, particularly on the lower eyelids, where there is more UV exposure than the upper eyelids. When detected early, basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid can be cured with surgical excision. Squamous cell carcinoma is a more rapidly growing form of cancer in which abnormal conjunctival cells form a cancerous growth on the surface of the eyeball. This tumor type is more dangerous and invasive than the more common basal cell carcinoma, and it also benefits from early detection, surgical excision, and freezing or cryotherapy. Polarization: Polarized sunglasses reduce glare from snow, water, highways, and other reflective surfaces. Consequently, wearers see better and squint less. These advantages can be crucial to automobile drivers, airline pilots, heavy-equipment operators, and athletes. Impact resistance: Impact-resistant sunglasses resist breakage when dropped or mishandled. Glasses made of a trade-name plastic called CR-39 are lighter than glass and more impact-resistant. Glasses made of high-index plastic are even lighter than CR-39 glasses. In addition, these lenses have a coating that protects them against scratching. Photochromicity: Photochromic sunglasses have lenses that brighten or darken in response to the intensity of sunlight. This transitional lens treatment does not in and of itself provide UV protection, a common misconception. Thus, be sure to look for the UV protection rating of photochromic lenses as a separate value. Water-sheeting: Lenses with this feature help preserve visual acuity when water (from the rain, the sea, waterfalls, etc.) strikes the lens. With water-sheeting, the water forms in a see-through sheet on the lens rather than individual droplets that block or distort vision."
Magnifying glasses,"'Many pharmacies (and other vendors) today sell magnifying glasses for viewing tiny objects or fine print. These products are available as handheld magnifying glasses, headset magnifiers, magnifiers that rest on a stand, also known as coil stand magnifiers, and magnifiers that can be attached to eyeglasses, sunglasses, or even diving masks. Coil stand magnifiers are particularly well suited to prolonged near tasks because they maintain a consistent focal length, thereby reducing constant refocusing and eyestrain.''The power of these products usually ranges from 2x to 3x (two times actual size to three times actual size). Handheld magnifiers generally resemble a big lollipop. Headset magnifiers feature a wrap-around cinch that attaches to the head and a flip-up visor with the magnifiers. The magnifiers can be raised above the eyes or lowered to the eyes as necessary. Magnifiers on a stand allow viewing of a small object while the hands remain free. This feature keeps the focal distance constant, reducing ''fatigue'' while freeing the hands for other functions. Magnifiers attached to eyeglasses, sunglasses, or diving masks also enable the viewer to keep his or her hands free. Some magnifying glasses contain a light to illuminate viewed objects. These products require batteries or an electrical connection.''Inexpensive plastic magnifiers are also available. They may or may not be flexible. These devices may be attractive because of their light weight, handiness, and of course their low cost. However, they tend to scratch easily and have a short lifespan. It is generally best for anyone who really has a\xa0need for a good magnifying glass not to skimp but invest in high-quality products.''Eye doctors specializing in low-vision aids can provide the best advice and the best products for magnification and vision enhancement, particularly for people with eye diseases and compromised vision.

The trifocal lens is generally placed in the same location as the bifocal, with a smaller segment closer to the center of the lens.''A further advance is the variable focus lens, in which the lines between the bifocal and the distance lens are eliminated, providing a gradual transition from near to far, with intermediate therefore in between. Varilux is a common brand name among numerous others. Many people prefer these more expensive lenses because the transition line is so annoying. It may take several weeks to become accustomed to this type of lens. These lenses provide the intermediate distance in the region between the bifocal and the distance segments, thus creating a trifocal capability using a simple subtle tilt of the head as well.''In some cases, customers may also be asked for the ""pupillary"" distance. This is actually the interpupillary distance, the distance between the pupils of the eyes. The pupils, although black in appearance, actually represent the round clear optical space defined by the center of the colored brown or blue ''iris''. This distance is usually measured in millimeters.''Doctors do not recommend nonprescription glasses as a permanent solution to significant ''eye problems'' because they usually are not as accurate as prescription lenses. In addition, the use of OTC glasses could lead to the postponement of an eye examination that could reveal a serious underlying problem such as ''glaucoma'', ''cataract'', or ''macular degeneration''. However, OTC glasses are okay to keep as ""backups"" for times when prescription glasses have been misplaced or are being repaired. Be certain to follow the recommendation of your ''eye care'' provider, an ophthalmologist or optometrist, before relying upon OTC readers.' "
Sunglasses,"'Sunglasses that can be purchased without a prescription come in hundreds of models with varying shapes, materials, coatings, configurations, and colors.'""A must-have feature for all sunglasses is complete (100%) protection against the potentially damaging effects of the sun's ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. Avoid buying dark sunglasses that do not offer 100% UV protection. Dark glasses prompt the pupil of the eye to dilate (enlarge), allowing UV rays to enter. So, if dark glasses lack complete UV protection, they can paradoxically promote damage to the eye.""'Ultraviolet rays are well-known contributing causes of the following ''eye conditions'':''Ultraviolet rays are well-known causes of the following ''eye conditions'':''Some favorable features that consumers should be aware of include the following:'  Macular degeneration is a potentially blinding condition in which the pigment cells in the optical center of the retina slowly degenerate during the dry form of this increasingly common disease, creating distorted vision. The rapidly changing form, or wet macular degeneration, can lead to sudden vision loss. Fortunately, remarkable new medications are now available to arrest and reverse damage caused by wet macular degeneration if caught in time. Cataract is an extremely common condition in which the clear crystalline lens of the eye develops progressive clouding and opacity. People living at high altitudes, equatorial regions, and those with outdoor occupations generally develop cataracts at a younger age than others due to increased lifetime UV exposure. Pterygium is a degenerative process on the ocular surface in which the normally clear mucous membrane, called the conjunctiva, overlying the white part of the eye, or sclera, gradually becomes cloudy and elevated, and then grows toward the center of the cornea. Advanced cases can lead to vision distortion and permanent loss of visual acuity. Once again, people from equatorial regions and those with outdoor occupations are much more likely to develop pterygium. Fishermen, farmers, sailors, surfers, construction workers, and sun worshippers are particularly susceptible. Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing superficial cancer in which abnormal skin cells turn cancerous, particularly on the lower eyelids, where there is more UV exposure than the upper eyelids. When detected early, basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid can be cured with surgical excision. Squamous cell carcinoma is a more rapidly growing form of cancer in which abnormal conjunctival cells form a cancerous growth on the surface of the eyeball. This tumor type is more dangerous and invasive than the more common basal cell carcinoma, and it also benefits from early detection, surgical excision, and freezing or cryotherapy. Polarization: Polarized sunglasses reduce glare from snow, water, highways, and other reflective surfaces. Consequently, wearers see better and squint less. These advantages can be crucial to automobile drivers, airline pilots, heavy-equipment operators, and athletes. Impact resistance: Impact-resistant sunglasses resist breakage when dropped or mishandled. Glasses made of a trade-name plastic called CR-39 are lighter than glass and more impact-resistant. Glasses made of high-index plastic are even lighter than CR-39 glasses. In addition, these lenses have a coating that protects them against scratching. Photochromicity: Photochromic sunglasses have lenses that brighten or darken in response to the intensity of sunlight. This transitional lens treatment does not in and of itself provide UV protection, a common misconception. Thus, be sure to look for the UV protection rating of photochromic lenses as a separate value. Water-sheeting: Lenses with this feature help preserve visual acuity when water (from the rain, the sea, waterfalls, etc.) strikes the lens. With water-sheeting, the water forms in a see-through sheet on the lens rather than individual droplets that block or distort vision."
Magnifying glasses,"'Many pharmacies (and other vendors) today sell magnifying glasses for viewing tiny objects or fine print. These products are available as handheld magnifying glasses, headset magnifiers, magnifiers that rest on a stand, also known as coil stand magnifiers, and magnifiers that can be attached to eyeglasses, sunglasses, or even diving masks. Coil stand magnifiers are particularly well suited to prolonged near tasks because they maintain a consistent focal length, thereby reducing constant refocusing and eyestrain.''The power of these products usually ranges from 2x to 3x (two times actual size to three times actual size). Handheld magnifiers generally resemble a big lollipop. Headset magnifiers feature a wrap-around cinch that attaches to the head and a flip-up visor with the magnifiers. The magnifiers can be raised above the eyes or lowered to the eyes as necessary. Magnifiers on a stand allow viewing of a small object while the hands remain free. This feature keeps the focal distance constant, reducing ''fatigue'' while freeing the hands for other functions. Magnifiers attached to eyeglasses, sunglasses, or diving masks also enable the viewer to keep his or her hands free. Some magnifying glasses contain a light to illuminate viewed objects. These products require batteries or an electrical connection.''Inexpensive plastic magnifiers are also available. They may or may not be flexible. These devices may be attractive because of their light weight, handiness, and of course their low cost. However, they tend to scratch easily and have a short lifespan. It is generally best for anyone who really has a\xa0need for a good magnifying glass not to skimp but invest in high-quality products.''Eye doctors specializing in low-vision aids can provide the best advice and the best products for magnification and vision enhancement, particularly for people with eye diseases and compromised vision. These professional products are particularly well suited for patients with macular degeneration or hereditary visual conditions.' "
What is blepharitis?,"'Blepharitis'' is the medical term for inflammation of the eyelids. The word ""blepharitis"" is derived from the Greek word ''blepharos'', which means ""eyelid,"" and the Greek suffix ''itis'"", which is typically used in English to denote an inflammation. Inflammation is the process by which white blood cells and the body's chemicals react to and protect us from foreign substances, injury, or infection. Signs of inflammation are eye swelling, redness, ""'pain'', warmth, and often change in function.''Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids, causing red, irritated, ''itchy'' eyelids and the formation of ''dandruff''-like scales on the eyelashes. It is a common eye disorder with a wide variety of causes. It affects people of all ages. Although it may be uncomfortable, annoying, or unattractive, blepharitis is not ''contagious'' and does not cause permanent damage to eyesight. The skin condition can be difficult to manage and it tends to recur. Another term for blepharitis is granulated eyelids. Angular blepharitis describes inflammation that primarily affects the outer corners of the eyelids. Most patients with blepharitis have it in both eyes. MGD, or meibomian gland disease, is often used as a synonym for blepharitis.' "
What are the different types of blepharitis?,"'The cause of most cases of blepharitis is a malfunction of the oil glands of the lids, although ''allergies'', eye infections, and certain systemic diseases can also cause blepharitis. Common types include ''allergic'' blepharitis, seborrheic blepharitis, infectious blepharitis, and blepharitis associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).' "
What causes blepharitis?,"'Blepharitis involves the eyelid margins, where the eyelashes grow and the openings of the tiny oil glands are located. There may be involvement of the skin adjacent to the outer edges of the eyelid margins and/or the inner edge of the eyelid that comes into contact with the eyeball secondary to the underlying disorder of the lid margins.''Most cases of blepharitis are posterior blepharitis, due to inflammation of the meibomian glands of the lids. There are about 40 of these glands in each of the upper and lower lids. The openings of each gland lie behind the eyelashes. The eyelid margins can become inflamed, irritated, and itchy when these glands produce abnormal secretions. Blepharitis is often seen in patients with ''acne rosacea'', a common disorder of the oil glands of the skin of the face.''Anterior blepharitis is due to inflammation of the lid margin around the lashes. Seborrheic blepharitis is similar to ''dandruff'' of the ''scalp'' and is a type of ''seborrheic dermatitis'', a common skin condition that causes scaly patches, red skin, and stubborn dandruff. Seborrheic ''dermatitis'' can also affect oily areas of the body, such as the face, sides of the nose, eyebrows, ears, eyelids, and chest.''Allergies'' due to reactions from mascara, contact ''lens'' solutions, sprays, exposure to animals, environmental chemicals, or airborne allergens can also cause blepharitis.''Less commonly, inflammation of the lids can be caused by a primary infection of the eye lids by bacteria such as ''Staphylococci'' or infestation of the lashes by tiny mites (Demodex) or ''head lice''.'  "
Is blepharitis contagious?,"'Since blepharitis is usually noninfectious, the vast majority of blepharitis cases are not contagious.' "
What are blepharitis symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of blepharitis are usually present in both eyes, affecting the upper and lower lids. They can appear at any age. Symptoms (what one feels in the eyes or eyelids) include''Signs (observations that one makes) of blepharitis include''The symptoms and signs of blepharitis are often erroneously ascribed by the patient as being due to ""recurrent ''conjunctivitis''."" They are also often mistakenly attributed to ""''dry eye''"" by patients due to the gritty sensation that may occur. Lubricating drops, however, do little to improve the condition.'   itchy or irritated eyelids, mild tearing, dryness of the eyes, burning sensation, gritty or sandy sensation, foreign-body sensation (the feeling that something may be in the eye), crusting of the eyelids, decreased comfort while wearing contact lenses, and sensitivity to light. red eyelid margins, swollen eyelids, thickened eyelids, increased shedding of skin cells near the eyelids, causing flaking of the skin around the eyes, matting of the lashes or eyes appearing ""glued together"" in the morning, eyelids that appear greasy and crusted with scales that cling to the lashes, crusted eyelashes upon awakening, tears that are frothy or bubbly in nature, eyelashes that grow abnormally, loss of eyelashes, mild scarring of the eyelid margins, mild ulceration of the lid margins, dry and flaky patches of skin on the lid, and dandruff (seborrhea) of the lashes and eyebrows."
How do health care professionals diagnose blepharitis?,"'Blepharitis can be usually diagnosed by a physician based on the history as given by the patient and the physical examination. Taking a history includes a thorough discussion of symptoms that the patient is experiencing and a review of any general health problems that may be contributing to the eye problem.''The physical examination concentrates on an evaluation of the eyelids, lid margins, base of the lashes, oil gland openings, tear quantity and quality, and the front surface of the eyeball using a slit lamp, which allows a magnified view with sufficient illumination. The type of blepharitis is determined based on this examination and appropriate treatment recommended. Occasionally, cultures are taken by swabbing the discharge and sending this to the laboratory. In some cases, an ''allergy'' evaluation may be required.' "
What are complications of blepharitis?,"'It is unusual for blepharitis to cause serious medical problems. However, blepharitis can lead to the following changes in eye health.''Blepharitis does not affect vision generally, although disturbances of the tear film may intermittently blur vision, causing varying amounts of fluctuating vision during the day.''Call the ophthalmologist if these symptoms develop, which are not due to blepharitis:'  Sty: A sty (sometimes spelled stye) or hordeolum is a bacterial infection in one of the oil glands whose opening is clogged. The result is a painful lump on the edge or inside of the eyelid. Chalazion: A chalazion or conjunctival granuloma occurs when blockage in one or more of the oil glands causes it/them to become enlarged and scarred. Multiple chalazia can also develop, either on the same eyelid or on different lids. Chronic pinkeye: Blepharitis can lead to recurrent bouts of pinkeye (conjunctivitis). Ulceration of the cornea: Constant irritation from inflamed eyelids or misdirected eyelashes may cause a sore (ulcer) to develop on the cornea. Significant changes in vision A sore on the eyelid that persists or increases in size, especially if it is red, bleeding, and not healing Significant pain in either or both eyes Symptoms that become worse or last for longer than two weeks"
What types of health care professionals treat blepharitis?,"'If you develop blepharitis, you should be examined promptly by a health care professional trained in the diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. Such eye doctors include ophthalmologists and optometrists.' "
What are medical treatment options for blepharitis? Are there home remedies for blepharitis?,"'The single most important treatment principle is a daily routine of lid margin hygiene. The following is a typical lid margin hygiene routine:''Limit or stop using eye ''makeup'', as its use will make lid hygiene more difficult. If one wears contact lenses, temporarily discontinuing wearing them during treatment may be advised. Other treatment depends on the specific type of blepharitis. The key to treating most types of blepharitis is keeping the lids clean and free of crusts. Dandruff shampoo is a standard recommendation.''Antibiotics such as ''doxycycline'', ''tetracycline'', ''azithromycin'', or ''erythromycin'' may be prescribed topically or orally. If the blepharitis is due to ''allergy'', efforts should be made to identify and reduce exposure to the offending agent. Prescription, over-the-counter drops, or oral ''antihistamines'' may be used. If it is caused by an ''allergy'' at home or at work, simply avoiding the ''allergen'' (for example, a dog or cat) may avoid future problems. Oral ''omega-3 fatty acids'', pulsating thermal lid ''massage'', and intense pulsed light treatment to the meibomian glands have also been effective in chronic or severe cases.' Soften lid margin debris and oils: Apply a warm, wet compress to the lids, such as a washcloth with hot water, for five to 10 minutes two to four times a day. To keep the compresses warm for a longer period of time, place a small hot water bottle over the compress. Using a clean washcloth for each cleansing is important. Mechanically remove lid margin debris: After using the compresses, clean the eyelids with a cotton applicator stick soaked in a 4 to 1 mixture of water and baby shampoo or an over-the-counter lid-cleansing product. Gently and repeatedly rub along the lid margins while the eyes are closed. Be careful to avoid rubbing or scratching the eyes."
What is the prognosis for blepharitis?,"'Good hygiene (regular cleaning of the area) can control signs and symptoms of blepharitis and prevent complications. Good eyelid care is usually sufficient for treatment. Such a routine needs to be convenient enough to be continued lifelong to avoid relapses, as blepharitis is often a chronic condition. One episode, however, does not signify that one has a lifelong condition. Blepharitis is not a vision-threatening condition.''If blepharitis is linked to an underlying cause such as ''acne'' ''rosacea'', treating those conditions may alleviate the blepharitis. In patients who have multiple episodes of blepharitis, the condition rarely disappears completely. Even with successful treatment, relapses are common. Taking the time to devote extra attention to good hygiene at those times may help to control the condition.'  "
How long does blepharitis last?,"'Blepharitis due to allergies to mascara or other products like contact lens solutions, sprays, exposure to animals, environmental chemicals, or airborne allergens can be cured within a short period of time by removal of the inciting agent(s).''More commonly, blepharitis is due to inflammation of the meibomian glands of the lids or the lid margin around the lashes. This type tends to be chronic, and if untreated, may persist for years, although the symptoms may be mild and variable. Appropriate daily treatment can lessen the signs and symptoms and can lead to remissions.' "
Is it possible to prevent blepharitis?,"'It is not usually possible to prevent blepharitis. In many cases, good eyelid hygiene and a regular cleaning routine can control blepharitis. This includes frequent scalp and face washing, using a warm compress to soak the eyelids and doing eyelid scrubs using cotton swabs or other soft materials. Blepharitis is usually not contagious. Untreated blepharitis can last for many years, and chronic blepharitis can fluctuate in severity over time.'  "
What is eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty)?,"'An ''eyelid'' lift, or blepharoplasty, is a procedure to remove skin and to add or remove fat from the eyelids. The term ""eyelid lift"" is a misnomer because the eyelid is not truly lifted during surgery.''Upper blepharoplasty surgery uses incisions to allow for removal of skin and fat. A thin stitch is then used to bring the skin together to allow for a creation of an eyelid crease.''Lower eyelid surgery can involve skin incisions directly below the lash line or an incision on the inside of the eyelid, called a transconjunctival approach. The transconjunctival approach allows for access to the eyelid without visible incisions, making this technique perfect for patients who need fat removed or added. This approach can be combined with ''laser resurfacing'' of the eyelid skin to reduce lines and ''wrinkles''.' "
Why is eyelid surgery performed?,"'Upper eyelid excess skin and fat can create a heavy looking eyelid, aged appearance, puffiness, and sometimes block the upper field of vision. Upper blepharoplasty is performed to remove excess skin and fat and can improve the field of vision.''Double eyelid surgery, also called Asian eyelid surgery, is performed to create or enhance an upper eyelid crease. This type of surgery is performed on Asian people to ""westernize"" the appearance of the eyelid.''Lower blepharoplasty can be performed to remove excess skin and improve the contour of the eyelid by adding or removing fat. Sometimes tightening the eyelid is needed to correct sagging, while laser skin resurfacing can be used to improve ''wrinkles'' and skin texture.' "
Who is a good candidate for eyelid surgery?,'Those individuals with realistic expectations who are in good health are suitable for eyelid surgery.' 
How do you prepare for eyelid surgery?,"""Prior to eyelid surgery, the patient should have a detailed examination and discussion about blepharoplasty and potential risks and benefits associated with the procedure. The patient should follow the doctor's preoperative instructions carefully and thoroughly review the postoperative instructions before the day of surgery. This will allow the patient to have any medications for ""'pain'' relief or necessary items such a gel packs, artificial tears, and gauze at home prior to their return from surgery.''A physical may be required to have your medical doctor ""clear"" you for surgery if intravenous sedation or general anesthesia is used.' "
How long is the recovery time for eyelid surgery?,"'Patients usually have a short recovery time after blepharoplasty. Although ''bruising'' and swelling is usually worse on the day after surgery, they quickly begin to disappear. During the first 48 hours, the use of cool compresses can greatly reduce ''bruising'' and swelling around the eyes and face. Light activity such as ''walking'' will also help speed healing. Thin bandages are usually placed over the incision sites and removed in several days, while the ''stitches'' can remain in the skin for about a week. Sometimes self-absorbing stitches are used that do not require removal.''Most people return to normal activities after seven to 10 days following blepharoplasty. By two weeks after eyelid surgery, the majority of the bruising and swelling will resolve.'  "
What are the risks and complications of eyelid surgery?,"'As with any surgery, there are potential risks and complications of blepharoplasty. The major risks include;'   infection, bleeding, scarring, the inability to close the eyes, dry eye, abnormal eyelid position, double vision, and loss of vision."
How much does eyelid surgery cost? Does insurance cover the cost of blepharoplasty?,'The cost of eyelid surgery depends on the type and complexity of the procedure performed.''Insurance carriers will only cover the cost of upper eyelid surgery if the patient has obstruction of their visual field. This must be documented during an examination with formal visual field testing and photographs. Some insurance carriers require submission of the visual fields and photographs before approving the blepharoplasty as a medically indicated procedure.'
