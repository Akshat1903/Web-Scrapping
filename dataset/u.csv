Questions,Answer
What is a urinalysis?,"""A urinalysis is simply an analysis of the urine. It is a very common test that can be performed in many health care settings, including doctors' offices, urgent care facilities, laboratories, hospitals, and even at home.""'A urinalysis test is performed by collecting a urine sample from the patient in a specimen cup. Usually only small amounts (30-60 mL) may be required for urinalysis testing. The sample can be either analyzed in the medical clinic or sent to a laboratory to perform the tests. Urinalysis is abbreviated UA.''UA is in general easily available and relatively inexpensive. It is also a simple test and can provide many useful information about various diseases and conditions. Some physicians refer to urinalysis as ""a poor man\'s kidney biopsy"" because of the plethora of information that can be obtained about the health of the kidney or other internal diseases by this simple test.''Urine can be evaluated by its physical appearance (color, cloudiness, odor, clarity), also referred to as a macroscopic analysis. It can be also analyzed based on its chemical and molecular properties, including microscopic assessment.''Urinalysis is ordered by doctors for a number of reasons, including the following:'   Routine medical evaluation: general yearly screening, assessment before surgery (preoperative assessment), admission to hospital, screening for kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (high blood pressure), liver disease, etc. Assessing particular symptoms: abdominal pain, painful urination, flank pain, fever, blood in the urine (hematuria), or other urinary symptoms. Diagnosing medical conditions: urinary tract infections, kidney stones, uncontrolled diabetes (high blood sugars), kidney impairment, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), protein in urine (proteinuria), drug screening, and kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis). Monitoring disease progression and response to therapy: diabetes related kidney disease, kidney impairment, lupus related kidney disease, blood pressure related kidney disease, kidney infection, proteinuria, and hematuria Pregnancy testing"
What can urinalysis results show?,"'Urinalysis can disclose evidence of diseases, even some that have not caused significant signs or symptoms. Therefore, a urinalysis is commonly a part of routine health screening.''Urinalysis is commonly used to diagnose a urinary tract or kidney infection, to evaluate causes of ''kidney failure'', to screen for progression of some chronic conditions such as ''diabetes'' mellitus and ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''It also may be used in combination with other tests to diagnose some diseases. Additional tests and clinical assessment are often required to further investigate findings of urinalysis and ultimately diagnose the causes or specific features of underlying problems. For example, urine infection is generally diagnosed based on results of urinalysis. However, urine culture is often ordered as a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the bacteria that may be causing the infection. Other examples include kidney stones, inflammation or the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), or muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).'  "
Who is involved in the interpretation of urinalysis?,'Interpretation of urinalysis is generally based on reviewing all the components of the test and correlating it with the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient and the physical examination. The results are reviewed and interpreted by the doctor who ordered the test.' 
What types of doctors perform urinalysis?,"'Many types of doctors may order a urinalysis in their practice. Because of easy availability, relatively nominal cost, simplicity of performing the test, and quick turnaround time, UA is done in many settings by variety of doctors. Most frequently, UA is ordered by internists, family practitioners, emergency-room physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, nephrologists (kidney specialists), urologists, ''rheumatologists'', and possibly less often by many other specialists.' "
What does urinalysis involve?,"'Urinalysis is done by collecting a urine sample from a patient. The optimal sample tends to be an early morning urine sample because it is frequently the most concentrated urine produced in the day. Typically, no fasting is required before the collection of urine sample and routine medications can be taken before the test, unless otherwise instructed by the ordering physician.''Methods of collection are slightly different for female and male patient.''The collected urine sample should be taken to the laboratory for analysis, typically within one hour of collection. If transportation to the lab could take more than one hour, then the sample may be refrigerated.''In some patients who are unable to void spontaneously or those who are not able to follow instructions other methods may be used, such as placing a catheter (a small rubber tube) through the outside opening to the bladder (urethra) to collect the sample directly from the bladder.' For females, the patient is asked to clean the area around the urethra with a special cleansing wipe, by spreading the labia of the external genitals and cleaning from front to back (toward the anus). The cleaning hand is then used to maintain the spread while the cup is held by the other hand to collect the sample. For men, the tip of the penis may be wiped with a cleansing pad prior to collection. The urine is then collected in a clean urine specimen cup while the patient is urinating. It is best to avoid collecting the initial stream of urine. After the initial part of urine is disposed of in the toilet, then the urine is collected in the urine container provided. Once about 30 mL to 60 mL (roughly 3 to 5 tablespoons) are collected in the container for testing, the remainder of the urine may be voided in the toilet again. This is called the midstream clean catch urine collection."
What is macroscopic urinalysis?,"'Macroscopic urinalysis is the direct visual observation of the urine, noting its quantity, color, clarity or cloudiness, etc.''Normal urine is typically light yellow and clear without any cloudiness. Obvious abnormalities in the color, clarity, and cloudiness may suggest possibility of''Certain medications may also change the color of urine (for example, ''phenazopyridine'', a urinary antiseptic and ''pain reliever''). Very foamy urine may represent large amounts of ''protein in the urine'' (proteinuria).' an infection (cloudy urine), dehydration (dark urine color), liver disease (""bilirubin,"" a digestive substance secreted by the liver, stains urine a tea or cola color), blood in the urine (hematuria -- visible to the eye may indicate urinary tract infection, stones, tumors, or injuries), or breakdown of muscle (orange- or tea-colored urine)."
What is urine test strip chemical analysis?,"'Urine test strip\xa0is a narrow ''plastic'' strip which has several squares of different colors attached to it. Each small square represents a component of the test used to interpret urinalysis. The entire test strip is dipped in the urine sample and color changes in each square are noted. The color change takes place after several seconds to a few minutes from dipping the strip. If read too early or too long after the urinalysis strip is dipped, the results may not be accurate.''Each color change on a particular square may indicate specific abnormalities in the urine sample caused by a certain chemical reaction. The reference for color changes is posted on the plastic bottle container of the urine test strips. This makes for easy and quick interpretation of the urinalysis results by placing the strip next to the container and comparing its color changes to the reference provided.''The squares on the dipstick represent the following components in the urine:''Presence or absence of each of these color changes on the strip provides important information for clinical decisions.''After the dipstick test strip is dipped in urine briefly and completely, the reading is done within a few minutes. Each one of the squares on the box has next to it the time which is recommended for its interpretation (for example, whether these is a change in color on the square). The squares are placed in similar order on the box, from the ones requiring the shortest time to read of 30 seconds to the ones with the longest time to read of two minutes. This arrangement is based on result time and makes it easier to quickly read and interpret any color changes by simply scanning the strip from the shortest (glucose) to the longest (leukocytes).' Specific gravity (concentration of urine) Acidity of the urine (pH levels) Protein in the urine (proteinuria), mainly albumin Glucose (sugar) in the urine (glycosuria) Ketones in the urine (ketonuria), products of fat metabolism Hemoglobin/blood in the urine (hematuria) Leukocyte esterase (suggestive of white blood cells in urine) Nitrite (suggestive of bacteria in urine) Bilirubin (possible liver disease or red blood cell breakdown) Urobilinogen (possible liver disease or etodolac [Lodine] medication)"
What are the pros and cons of urine test strip?,"""The main advantage of a urine test strip is that they are convenient, easy to interpret, and cost-effective. They can be analyzed within minutes of urine collection in the doctor's office or in the emergency room to provide valuable information.""'However, what can be learned from a dipstick is limited by the design of the dipstick. The main disadvantage is that the information may not be very accurate, as the test is time-sensitive. It also provides limited information about the urine, as it is qualitative test and not a quantitative test (for example, it does not give a precise measure of the quantity of abnormality). Therefore, normal and abnormal values are not reported as part of urinalysis results.' "
What is microscopic urinalysis?,"'The microscopic urinalysis is the study of the urine sample under a microscope. It requires only a relatively inexpensive light microscope. Cells and cellular debris, bacteria, and crystals in the urine (crystalluria) can be detected by microscopic examination to provide confirmation of the dipstick color change (see above) and further clinical clues.' "
How is microscopic urinalysis done?,"'Microscopic urinalysis is done simply pouring the urine sample into a test tube and centrifuging it (spinning it down in a machine) for a few minutes. The top liquid part (the supernatant) is discarded. The solid part left in the bottom of the test tube (the urine sediment) is mixed with the remaining drop of urine in the test tube and one drop is analyzed under a microscope.''The sediment is examined through the microscope under low-power to identify what are called casts, crystals, squamous (flat) cells, and other large objects.''Examination is then performed through the microscope at higher power to further identify any cells, bacteria and clumps of cells or debris called casts.' "
What kind of cells can be detected?,"'Epithelial cells (flat cells), red and white blood cells may be seen in the urine.''Sometimes cells, cellular debris, and casts are seen in the microscopic exam. Epithelial cells (cells in the lining of the bladder or urethra) may suggest inflammation within the bladder, but they also may originate from the skin and could be contamination.''Casts and cellular debris originate from higher up in the urinary tract, such as in the kidneys. These are material shed from kidney cell lining due to injury or inflammation and travel down through the urinary tubes. These usually suggest an injury to the kidney from an inflammation or lack of blood flow to the kidneys. Rarely, ''tumor'' cells can be in the urine suggesting a urinary tract ''cancer''.' "
What can the presence of red blood cells in the urine mean?,"'Red blood cells'' can enter the urine from the vagina in ''menstruation'' or from the ''trauma'' of bladder catheterization.''A high count of red blood cells in the urine can indicate infection, trauma, tumors, or kidney stones. If red blood cells seen under microscopy look distorted, they suggest kidney as the possible source and may arise due to kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis). Small amounts of red blood cells in the urine are sometimes seen young healthy people and usually are not indicative of any disease.' "
What can the presence of white blood cells in the urine mean?,"'Urine is a generally thought of as a sterile body fluid, therefore, evidence of white blood cells or bacteria in the urine is considered abnormal and may suggest a ''urinary tract infection'' such as, ''bladder infection'' (''cystitis''), infection of kidney (''pyelonephritis''). White blood cells (WBC) may be detected in the urine through a microscopic examination (pyuria or leukocytes in the blood). They can be seen under high power field and the number of cells are recorded (quantitative) as ""rare, few, moderate, or many.""''White cells from the vagina or the opening of the urethra (in males, too) can contaminate a urine sample. Such contamination aside, the presence of abnormal numbers of white blood cells in the urine is significant.' "
"Other than urinalysis, what are other common urine tests available?","'Other commonly performed urine tests are drug tests, ''pregnancy tests'', specific chemicals and proteins in the body, which are not a part of routine urinalysis.''Urine drug screen is done routinely to check for ''drugs'' or their byproducts in the urine. There are many purposes for these tests including athletic screening, emergency rooms settings, drug detoxification programs, school and employment screening. This test detects the presence of commonly used drugs such as''Urine ''pregnancy test'' is very common and it measures a hormone in the urine associated with pregnancy (beta-HCG or beta- human chorionic gonadotropin). This test can be done in medical settings, but numerous kits are available for home use.''Other urine tests can also be used in evaluation of many medical conditions. Examples include' cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, marijuana, phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and opiates. urine culture (in determining the bacterial cause of urine infection), urine creatinine (in assessing kidney disease), urine total protein and albumin (in assessing kidney disease and protein loss from kidney), urine cytology (in evaluating for possible bladder or other urinary tumors), urine calcium (in evaluating elevated blood calcium levels), 24-hour urine collection for proteins (in diagnosing causes of kidney impairment, diabetic related kidney disease, lupus related kidney disease), 24-hour urine collection for protein electrophoresis (for measuring different components of proteins in urine in evaluating multiple myeloma, kidney inflammation with increased protein loss), or 24-hour urine collection of catecholamine metabolites (in evaluating adrenal gland disease, difficult to treat high blood pressure)."
What are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC)?,"   Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, or UC, are types of IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), but they are not the same disease. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory process with no known cause (idiopathic) that can affect any part of the gastroesophageal (GI) tract from the mouth to the anus. Ulcerative colitis (UC) also is a chronic and intense inflammatory process, with no known cause, but it is only confined to the large bowel. People with Crohn’s disease have episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea, followed by remission of symptoms. There is no medical or surgical cure for Crohn’s disease. Ulcerative colitis symptoms and signs are predominantly left-sided lower abdominal pain with rectal bleeding, frequent stools, and a mucousy rectal discharge.  There is no medical cure for ulcerative colitis, but surgical removal of the entire large intestine can cure it. However, there can be complications after surgery. Crohn's disease sometimes is referred to as Crohn disease. Although both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic diseases, UC may be considered “worse,” as people with extensive and severe ulcerative colitis may require surgery. People over age 50 that need surgery have increased mortality due to colitis-associated postoperative complications."
What are the differences and similarities between the signs and symptoms of Crohn's and ulcerative colitis?,"""There are a few differences in the symptoms between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Frequently, doctors cannot diagnose the cause of either disease by symptoms alone. However, for people with ulcerative colitis, the ""'abdominal pain'' is often confined to the left side of the abdomen, while Crohn’s disease may have ''abdominal pain'' anywhere in the abdomen.''Both Crohn’s disease and ''ulcerative colitis'' have many similar symptoms.'  Abdominal pain Diarrhea (sometimes bloody and/or containing mucus) Bloating Abdominal cramps Urgency to have a bowel movement (defecate) Anorexia Nausea/vomiting Constipation Weight loss"
What are the causes and triggers of Crohn's disease vs. ulcerative colitis?,"'Doctors and researchers don not know what causes both diseases, but they speculate that a number of factors such as genetics, heredity, mucosal immunity, gut microbes, ''diet'', environmental factors, vascular problems, psychosocial problems, and certain ''drugs'' may be triggers that may participate in causing these diseases.''Because the diseases have unknown causes, it is difficult to know what triggers their development. However, if you carefully note in a diary when symptoms reappear in Crohn’s disease or ''worsen ''in ulcerative colitis, you may be able to identify triggers that affect your disease.'  "
Can you drink alcohol with Crohn's disease?," Drinking alcohol is not recommended for most people with Crohn's disease. Alcohol may irritate the lining of the intestinal wall, causing or worsening symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. It also may contribute to malabsorption, further complicating nutritional deficiencies. Alcohol interacts with many medications, causing side effects that may be serious. Alcohol disrupts sleep cycles and can leave you feeling tired, and irritable the next day. However, if alcohol is well tolerated and not causing any complications, it can be consumed in moderation. Chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration very easily. Dehydration makes you feel weak, tired, light-headed, or just ""blah."" Alcohol can cause headaches, abdominal pain, and other symptoms. It also can place dangerous strain on your kidneys. Dehydration can be avoided by making a special effort to take in plenty of nonalcoholic fluids. You should take at least 8 full glasses of fluid every day. Try to stick to water, diluted fruit juice, sports drinks, decaffeinated beverages, and fruit and vegetable drinks. Avoid caffeinated beverages and sodas."
What procedures and tests diagnose Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis?,"'Doctor’s diagnose ulcerative colitis by ''endoscopy'' (sometimes with biopsy). During this procedure the doctor can see and take pictures of the patient’s abnormal gut mucosa (often with ulcers), and the presence of continuous disease (there are no areas of normal mucosa). Other blood tests and imaging tests like ''CT scan'' or ''MRI'' are used, but these tests are not definitive.''Doctors use the same procedures and tests to diagnose Crohn’s disease. However, they also use small bowel studies, ''colonoscopy'', and upper GI ''endoscopy'' to identify the abnormal gut mucosa that usually occur in multiple areas anywhere in the intestinal tract. These areas are not continuous, but are separated by normal areas of intestinal mucosa that distinguish them from ulcerative colitis lesions.' "
Are there special diet plans or supplements for Crohn's disease vs. ulcerative colitis?,"'As with Crohn’s disease, ''nutrition'' is important if you have ulcerative colitis because symptoms of ''diarrhea'' and bleeding can lead to dehydration, ''electrolyte'' imbalance, and loss of nutrients. It may be necessary to take nutritional ''supplements'' if your symptoms do not allow you to eat a nutritionally balanced diet. Talk to your health-care professional about what ''supplements'' to take.\xa0' There is no evidence that diet has anything to do with causing inflammation or Crohn's disease. There is no evidence linking food allergies, inflammation, with Crohn's disease. There is no specific diet that is recommended for everyone with Crohn's disease. However, many people with Crohn's disease can reduce their symptoms by changing their eating habits or avoiding certain foods. Nutritional deficiencies are a problem for almost everyone with Crohn's disease, but they are most serious in children and teens who are still growing. Growth can be stunted permanently and sexual development (puberty) delayed in children and teens with Crohn's disease. Girls and women can develop hormone imbalances and stop menstruating. Nutritional deficiencies also can prevent medications from working as well as they should in healthy people. In general, nutritional deficiencies can lead to overall poor health. If you have enough nutritional deficiencies they can make you feelweak, tired,depressed, orjust ""blah."" weak,  tired, depressed, or just ""blah."" Crohn's disease can leave you vulnerable to infections and other diseases. They can stop anyone from looking, feeling, or performing at his or her best."
What supplements should you take for Crohn's disease vs. ulcerative colitis?,"'As with Crohn’s disease, ''nutrition'' is important if you have ulcerative colitis because symptoms of diarrhea and bleeding can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and loss of nutrients. It may be necessary to take nutritional supplements if your symptoms do not allow you to eat a nutritionally balanced diet. Talk to your health-care professional about what supplements to take.\xa0' Your need for vitamin and mineral supplements depends on several factors, your diet, which parts of your digestive tract are affected, and whether you have had surgery on your small intestine. The most common vitamin deficiencies arevitamins D and B-12. vitamins D and B-12. And the most common mineral deficiencies areiron,calcium,potassium, andmagnesium. iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. You will need to take folic acid if you are taking an immunosuppressant such as azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) as it reduces the absorption of folic acid. Talk to your health-care professional about taking supplements."
What foods can you eat on a ulcerative colitis diet?,"'If you have ulcerative colitis you may need to modify your diet to help manage their symptoms. There is not a single diet or meal plan that fits everyone with ulcerative colitis, and diets are individualized for each patient. Depending on symptoms different types of diets may be recommended, such as:' a high-calorie diet  a lactose-free diet a low-fat diet a low-fiber diet (low-residue diet) a low-salt diet a low FODMAP diet a gluten-free diet"
What are the treatments for Crohn's vs. ulcerative colitis?,"'Treatments are complex, and some drugs should not be used for long time spans. You and your team (primary care and ''gastroenterologist'') should discuss what treatment protocol you should follow.'  Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease treatments may include corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory agents, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, Alpha 4 Integrin inhibitors and anti-diarrheal agents. Crohn’s disease treatments also may include anticholinergic agents and bile acid sequestrants, if there is no bowel obstruction. Severe ulcerative colitis may require surgical removal of the large intestine."
Can complications of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis be fatal? ,"'The prognosis for both diseases is fair to good in individuals that respond to medical therapy and avoid known triggers that increase symptoms. Most people can have a normal lifespan. However, for people with severe ulcerative colitis that are 50 years of age or older and require surgery, their lifespan may be reduced due to colitis-associated postoperative complications.' "
What is ulcerative colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammation of the large intestine (colon). The colon is the part of the ''digestive system'' where water is removed from undigested material, and the remaining waste material is stored. The rectum is the end of the colon adjacent to the anus. In patients with ulcerative colitis, ulcers, and inflammation of the inner lining of the colon lead to symptoms of ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''rectal bleeding''.''Ulcerative colitis is closely related to another condition of inflammation of the ''intestines'"" called Crohn's disease. Together, they are frequently referred to as ""'inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD'""). Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's diseases are chronic conditions. Crohn's disease can affect any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, including all layers of the bowel wall. It may not be limited to the GI tract (affecting the liver, skin, eyes, and joints). UC only affects the lining of the colon (large bowel). Men and women are affected equally. The most commonly begin during adolescence and early adulthood, but they also can begin during childhood and later in life.""'UC found worldwide but is most common in the United States, England, and northern Europe. It is especially common in people of Jewish descent. Ulcerative colitis is rarely seen in Eastern Europe, Asia, and South America, and is rare in the black population. For unknown reasons, an increased frequency of this condition has been observed recently in developing nations.''First degree relatives of people with ulcerative colitis have an increased lifetime risk of developing the disease, but the overall risk remains small.' "
What are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?,"'Common symptoms of ulcerative colitis include rectal bleeding, ''abdominal pain'', and ''diarrhea'', but there is a wide range of symptoms among patients with this disease. Variability of symptoms reflects differences in the extent of disease (the amount of the colon and rectum that are inflamed) and the intensity of inflammation. Generally, patients with inflammation confined to the rectum and a short segment of the colon adjacent to the rectum have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than patients with more widespread inflammation of the colon. The different types of ulcerative colitis are classified according to the location and the extent of inflammation:''While the intensity of colon inflammation in ulcerative colitis waxes and wanes over time, the location and the extent of disease in a patient generally stays constant. Therefore, when a patient with ulcerative proctitis develops a relapse of his or her disease, the inflammation usually is confined to the rectum. Nevertheless, a small number of patients (less than 10%) with ulcerative proctitis or proctosigmoiditis can later develop more extensive colitis. Thus, patients who initially only have ulcerative proctitis can later develop left-sided colitis or even pancolitis.'   Ulcerative proctitis refers to inflammation that is limited to the rectum. In many patients with ulcerative proctitis, mild intermittent rectal bleeding may be the only symptom. Other patients with more severe rectal inflammation may, in addition, experience rectal pain, urgency (sudden feeling of having to defecate and a need to rush to the bathroom for fear of soiling), and tenesmus (ineffective, painful urge to move one's bowels caused by the inflammation). Proctosigmoiditis involves inflammation of the rectum and the sigmoid colon (a short segment of the colon contiguous to the rectum). Symptoms of proctosigmoiditis, like that of proctitis, include rectal bleeding, urgency, and tenesmus. Some patients with proctosigmoiditis also develop bloody diarrhea and cramps. Left-sided colitis involves inflammation that starts at the rectum and extends up the left colon (sigmoid colon and descending colon). Symptoms of left-sided colitis include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and left-sided abdominal pain. Pancolitis or universal colitis refers to inflammation affecting the entire colon (right colon, left colon, transverse colon and the rectum). Symptoms of pancolitis include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramps, weight loss, fatigue, fever, and night sweats. Some patients with pancolitis have low-grade inflammation and mild symptoms that respond readily to medications. Generally, however, patients with pancolitis suffer more severe disease and are more difficult to treat than those with more limited forms of ulcerative colitis. Fulminant colitis is a rare but severe form of pancolitis. Patients with fulminant colitis are extremely ill with dehydration, severe abdominal pain, protracted diarrhea with bleeding, and even shock. They are at risk of developing toxic megacolon (marked dilatation of the colon due to severe inflammation) and colonic rupture (perforation). Patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon are treated in the hospital with potent intravenous medications. Unless they respond to treatment promptly, surgical removal of the diseased colon is necessary to prevent colonic rupture."
What causes ulcerative colitis?,"'The cause of ulcerative colitis is not known. To date, there has been no convincing evidence that it is caused by infection or is ''contagious''.''Ulcerative colitis likely involves abnormal activation of the immune system in the intestines. This system is supposed to defend the body against harmful bacteria, ''viruses'', fungi, and other foreign invaders. Normally, the immune system is activated only when the body is exposed to harmful invaders. In patients with ulcerative colitis, however, the immune system is abnormally and chronically activated in the absence of any known invader. The continued abnormal activation of the immune system causes chronic inflammation and ulceration portions of the large intestine. This susceptibility to abnormal activation of the immune system is genetically ''inherited''. First degree relatives (brothers, sisters, children, and parents) of patients with ''IBD'' are therefore more likely to develop these diseases.''There have been multiple studies using genome wide association scans investigating genetic susceptibility in ulcerative colitis. These studies have found there to be approximately 30 genes that might increase susceptibility to ulcerative colitis including immunoglobulin receptor gene FCGR2A, 5p15, 2p16, ORMDL3, ECM1, as well as regions on chromosomes 1p36, 12q15, 7q22, 22q13, and IL23R. At this early point in the research, it is still unclear how these genetic associations will be applied to treating the disease, but they might have future implications for understanding pathogenesis and creating new treatments.' "
How is the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis made?,"'The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is suggested by the symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea. As there is no gold standard for diagnosis, the ultimate diagnosis relies on a combination of symptoms, the appearance of the colonic lining at the time of ''endoscopy'', histologic features of biopsies of the colonic lining, and studies of ''stool'' to exclude the presence of infectious agents that may be causing the inflammation.''Knowledge of the extent and severity of the colitis is important in choosing among treatment options.''Some newer diagnostic modalities include video ''capsule endoscopy'' and CT/''MRI'"" enterography. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) might be useful for detection of small bowel disease in patients with a diagnosis of UC with atypical features and who might be suspected of actually having Crohn's disease. With VCE, patients swallow a capsule that contains a camera that takes pictures while it travels through the intestines and sends the pictures wirelessly to a recorder. The pictures are then reviewed. In a study in 2007, VCE confirmed the presence of small bowel disease in about 15% of patients with ulcerative colitis with atypical features or unclassified ""'inflammatory bowel disease'"", thus changing the diagnosis to Crohn's disease (which is not limited to the large bowel as in UC). This might be a useful diagnostic modality in this specific patient population.""'CT and MRI enterography are imaging techniques which use oral liquid contrast agents consisting of ''PEG'"" solutions or low concentration of barium to provide more adequate distension of the colon and small intestine. These have been reported to be superior to standard imaging techniques in the evaluation of small bowel pathology in patients with Crohn's disease. They have also been shown to provide adequate estimations of disease severity in ulcerative colitis (with some under- and overestimations)."" Stool specimens are collected for analysis to exclude infection and parasites, since these conditions can cause colitis that mimics ulcerative colitis. Blood tests may show anemia (a low red blood cell count), and an elevated white blood cell count and/or an elevated sedimentation rate (commonly referred to as ""sed rate""). An elevated white blood cell count and sed rate both reflect ongoing inflammation that may be associated with infection or with any type of chronic inflammation including UC and Crohn's disease. Anemia, especially in a young male with chronic pain and diarrhea should raise the clinician's suspicion for IBD. Other blood tests also may be checked including kidney function, liver function tests, iron studies, and C-reactive protein (another sign of inflammation). There is some evidence that a stool test for a protein called calprotectin could be useful in identifying patients who would benefit from colonoscopy. Calprotectin seems to be a sensitive marker of intestinal inflammation meaning that it can be elevated before symptoms become severe and the signs of inflammation are unclear. In the right setting, particularly early in the course of IBD, elevated levels can suggest inflammatory bowel disease. This test alone, however, cannot distinguish between different diseases causing the inflammation so should be used with caution. Confirmation of ulcerative colitis requires a test to visualize the large intestine. Flexible tubes inserted through the rectum (colonoscope) permit direct visualization of the inside of the colon to establish the diagnosis and to determine the extent of the colitis. Small tissue samples (biopsies) can be obtained during the procedure to determine the severity of the colitis. A barium enema X-ray also may indicate the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. During a barium enema, a chalky liquid substance is administered into the rectum and injected into the colon. Barium is so dense that X-rays do not pass through it so the outline of the colon can be seen on X-ray pictures. A barium enema is less accurate and useful than direct visualization (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) in the diagnosis of UC. If a barium enema is performed and ulcerative colitis is suspected, a colonoscopy is needed to verify the diagnosis."
What are the complications of ulcerative colitis?,"'Patients with ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum (proctitis) or colitis limited to the end of the left colon (proctosigmoiditis) usually do quite well. Brief periodic treatments using oral medications or enemas may be sufficient. Serious complications are rare in these patients. In those with more extensive disease, blood loss from the inflamed intestines can lead to anemia and may require treatment with ''iron supplements'' or even blood transfusions. Rarely, the colon can acutely dilate to a large size when the inflammation becomes very severe. This condition is called toxic megacolon. Patients with toxic megacolon are extremely ill with ''fever'', abdominal pain and distention, ''dehydration'', and malnutrition. Unless the patient improves rapidly with medication, surgery  usually is necessary to prevent colonic rupture. ''In a published Scandinavian study of over 500 patients with ulcerative colitis followed for up to 10 years after diagnosis, it was found that their mortality rate did not differ from the general population. Also, the cumulative need for colectomy after 10 years was 9.8%, nearly 50% of the patients were relapse free in the last five years of the study, and only 20% of the patients with proctitis or left-sided disease progressed to pancolitis.''Colon ''cancer'' is a recognized complication of chronic ulcerative colitis. The risk for ''cancer'' begins to rise after eight to ten years of colitis.  Patients with only ulcerative proctitis probably do not have increased risk of colon ''cancer'' compared to the general population. Among patients with active pancolitis (involving the entire colon) for 10 years or longer, the risk of colon cancer is increased compared to the general population. In patients with colitis limited to the left side of the colon, the risk of colon cancer is increased but not as high as in patients with chronic pancolitis.''Patients at higher risk of cancer are patients with positive family histories of colon cancer, long durations of colitis, extensive colon involvement, and ''primary sclerosing cholangitis'' (''PSC''), another complication of ulcerative colitis.''Since these ''cancers'' have a more favorable outcome when diagnosed and treated at an earlier stage, yearly colon examinations may be recommended after eight years of known extensive disease. During these examinations, samples of tissue (biopsies) can be taken to search for ''precancerous'' changes in the lining cells of the colon. When precancerous changes are found, removal of the colon may be necessary to prevent colon cancer.''Complications of ulcerative colitis can involve other parts of the body.'   Ten percent of the patients can develop inflammation of the joints (arthritis). Some patients have low back pain due to arthritis of the sacroiliac joints.   Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis that affects the vertebral joints of affected individuals. There seems to be an increased incidence of ankylosing spondylitis among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.   Rarely, patients may develop painful, red, skin nodules (erythema nodosum). Others can have painful, red eyes (uveitis, episcleritis). Because these particular complications can risk permanent vision impairment, eye pain or redness are symptoms that require a physician's evaluation. Diseases of the liver and bile ducts also may be associated with ulcerative colitis. For example, in patients with a rare condition called sclerosing cholangitis, repeated infections and inflammation in the bile ducts can lead to recurrent fever, yellowing of skin (jaundice), cirrhosis, and the need for a transplantation of the liver.  Finally, patients with ulcerative colitis also might have an increased tendency to form blood clots, especially in the setting of active disease."
What are the treatments for ulcerative colitis?,"'Both medications and surgery have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. However, surgery is reserved for those with severe inflammation and life-threatening complications. There is no medication that can cure ulcerative colitis. Patients with ulcerative colitis will typically experience periods of relapse (worsening of inflammation) followed by periods of remission (resolution of inflammation) lasting months to years. During relapses, symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding worsen. During remissions, these symptoms subside. Remissions usually occur because of treatment with medications or surgery, but occasionally they occur spontaneously, that is, without any treatment.'  "
What are ulcerative colitis medications?,"""Since ulcerative colitis cannot be cured by medication, the goals of treatment with medication are to 1) induce remissions, 2) maintain remissions, 3) minimize side effects of treatment, 4) improve the quality of life, and 5) minimize risk of cancer. Treatment of ulcerative colitis with medications is similar, though not always identical, to treatment of Crohn's disease.""'Medications for treating ulcerative colitis include 1) anti-inflammatory agents such as 5-ASA compounds, systemic ''corticosteroids'', ''topical corticosteroids'', and 2) immunomodulators.''Anti-inflammatory medications that decrease intestinal inflammation are analogous to arthritis medications that decrease ''joint inflammation'' (arthritis). The anti-inflammatory medications that are used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis are:'""Immunomodulators are medications that suppress the body's immune system either by reducing the cells that are responsible for immunity, or by interfering with proteins that are important in promoting inflammation. Immunomodulators increasingly are becoming important treatments for patients with severe ulcerative colitis who do not respond adequately to anti-inflammatory agents. Examples of immunomodulators include 6-""'mercaptopurine'' (6-MP), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Gengraf'', ''Neoral'').''It has long been observed that the risk of ulcerative colitis appears to be higher in nonsmokers and in ex-''smokers''. In certain circumstances, patients improve when treated with ''nicotine''.' Topical 5-ASA compounds such as sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), olsalazine (Dipentum), and mesalamine (Pentasa, Asacol, Lialda, Apriso Rowasa enema) that need direct contact with the inflamed tissue in order to be effective. Systemic anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids that decrease inflammation throughout the body without direct contact with the inflamed tissue. Systemic corticosteroids have predictable side effects with long term use."
5-ASA Compounds,"'5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid), also called mesalamine, is chemically similar to ''aspirin''. Aspirin (''acetylsalicylic acid'') has been used for many years in treating arthritis, ''bursitis'', and tendinitis (conditions of tissue inflammation). Aspirin, however, is not effective in treating ulcerative colitis. On the other hand, 5-ASA can be effective in treating ulcerative colitis if the drug can be delivered directly (topically) onto the inflamed colon lining. For example, Rowasa enema is a 5-ASA solution that is effective in treating inflammation in and near the rectum (ulcerative proctitis and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis). However, the enema solution cannot reach high enough to treat inflammation in the upper colon. Therefore, for most patients with ulcerative colitis, 5-ASA must be taken orally. When pure 5-ASA is taken orally, however, the stomach and upper small intestine absorb most of the drug before it reaches the colon. Therefore, to be effective as an oral agent for ulcerative colitis, 5-ASA has to be modified chemically to escape absorption by the stomach and the upper intestines. These modified 5-ASA compounds are sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), mesalamine (Pentasa, Rowasa, Asacol, Lialda, Apriso), and olsalazine (Dipentum).''Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) has been used successfully for many years in inducing remission among patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Inducing remission means decreasing intestinal inflammation and relieving symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Sulfasalazine has also been used for prolonged periods of time to maintain remissions.''Sulfasalazine consists of a 5-ASA molecule linked chemically to a sulfapyridine molecule. (Sulfapyridine is a sulfa antibiotic). Connecting the two molecules together prevents absorption by the stomach and the upper intestines prior to reaching the colon. When sulfasalazine reaches the colon, the bacteria in the colon will break the linkage between the two molecules. After breaking away from 5-ASA, sulfapyridine is absorbed into the body and then excreted in the urine. Most of the active 5-ASA drug, however, remains in the colon to treat colitis.''Most of the side effects of sulfasalazine are due to the sulfapyridine molecule. These side effects include ''nausea'', ''heartburn'', ''headache'', anemia, skin ''rashes'', and, in rare instances, ''hepatitis'' and kidney inflammation. In men, sulfasalazine can reduce the sperm count. The reduction in sperm count is reversible, and the count usually returns to normal after discontinuing sulfasalazine or by changing to a different 5- ASA compound.''The benefits of sulfasalazine generally are dose related. Therefore, high doses of sulfasalazine may be necessary to induce remission. Some patients cannot tolerate high doses because of ''nausea'' and stomach upset. To minimize stomach upset, sulfasalazine generally is taken after or with meals. Some patients find it easier to take Azulfidine-EN (enteric-coated form of sulfasalazine). Enteric-coating helps decrease stomach upset. The newer 5-ASA compounds do not have the sulfapyridine component and have fewer side effects than sulfasalazine.''Asacol is a tablet consisting of the 5-ASA compound, mesalamine, surrounded by an acrylic resin coating. (Asacol is sulfa free.) The resin coating prevents the 5-ASA from being absorbed as it passes through the stomach and the small intestine. When the tablet reaches the terminal ileum and the colon, the resin coating dissolves, thus releasing 5-ASA into the colon.''Asacol is effective in inducing remissions in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. It also is effective when used for prolonged periods of time to maintain remissions. The recommended dose of Asacol to induce remission is two 400-mg tablets three times daily (total of 2.4 grams a day). Two tablets of Asacol twice daily (1.6 grams a day) is recommended for maintaining remission. Occasionally, the maintenance dose is higher.''As with Azulfidine, the benefits of Asacol are dose-related. If patients do not respond to 2.4 grams a day of Asacol, the dose frequently is increased to 3.6 grams a day (and sometimes even higher) to induce remission. If patients fail to respond to the higher doses of Asacol, then alternatives, such as corticosteroids, are considered.''Lialda (mesalamine multi matrix, MMX) is an extended release formulation. It is a 5-ASA medication within an inert matrix that is surrounded by a coating. When the capsule reaches the distal ileum, the outer coating (the capsule) dissolves. The intestinal fluid then is absorbed into the matrix forming a gel-like substance which prolongs the contact of the medication with the colonic wall as the mesalamine slowly separates from the matrix. This extended release formulation allows for higher doses to be taken less frequently throughout the day and might and improve compliance.''The most common side effects experienced while taking Lialda are ''flatulence'', abdominal pain, ''headache'', nausea, and ''dyspepsia''.''Apriso is another formulation of 5-ASA that consists of extended-release mesalamine granules encased in microcrystalline cellulose within a capsule. Dissolution of the capsule occurs in the distal ileum, and, since the granules are encased in the cellulose and only slowly separates from the cellulose, there is prolonged delivery of medication as the cellulose and mesalamine travel through the colon.''The most common side effects of this medication are ''headache'', diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, ''influenza''-like illness, and ''sinusitis''.'""Pentasa is a capsule consisting of the 5-ASA compound mesalamine inside controlled-release spheres. Like Asacol, it is sulfa free. As the capsule travels down the intestines, the 5-ASA inside the spheres is slowly released into the intestines. Unlike Asacol, the mesalamine in Pentasa is released into the small intestine as well as the colon. Therefore, Pentasa can be effective in treating inflammation in the small intestine and the colon. Pentasa is currently the most logical 5-ASA compound for treating mild to moderate Crohn's disease involving the small intestine. Pentasa also is used to induce remission and maintain remission among patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.""'Olsalazine (Dipentum) consists of two 5-ASA molecules linked together. It is sulfa free. The linked 5-ASA molecules travel through the stomach and the small intestine unabsorbed. When the drug reaches the terminal ileum and the colon, the normal bacteria in the intestine break the linkage and release the active drug into the colon and the terminal ileum. Olsalazine has been used in treating ulcerative colitis and in maintaining remissions. A side effect unique to olsalazine is secretory diarrhea (diarrhea resulting from excessive production of fluid in the intestines). This condition occurs in some patients, and the diarrhea sometimes can be severe.''Balsalazide (''Colazal'') is a capsule in which the 5-ASA is linked by a chemical bond to another molecule that is inert (without effect on the intestine) and prevents the 5-ASA from being absorbed. This drug is able to travel through the intestine unchanged until it reaches the end of the small bowel (terminal ileum) and colon. There, intestinal bacteria break apart the 5-ASA and the inert molecule, releasing the 5-ASA. Because intestinal bacteria are most abundant in the terminal ileum and colon, Colazal is used to treat inflammation predominantly localized to the colon.''More ''clinical trials'' are needed to compare the effectiveness of Colazal to the other mesalamine compounds such as Asacol in treating ulcerative colitis. Therefore in the United States, choosing which 5-ASA compound has to be individualized. Some doctors prescribe Colazal for patients who cannot tolerate or fail to respond to Asacol. Others prescribe Colazal for patients with predominantly left sided colitis, since some studies seem to indicate that Colazal is effective in treating left sided colitis.''The sulfa-free 5-ASA compounds have fewer side effects than sulfasalazine and also do not impair male ''fertility''. In general, they are safe medications for long-term use and are well-tolerated.''Patients ''allergic'' to aspirin should avoid 5-ASA compounds because they are chemically similar to aspirin.''Rare kidney inflammation has been reported with the use of 5-ASA compounds. These compounds should be used with caution in patients with known ''kidney disease''. It also is recommended that blood tests of kidney function be obtained before starting and periodically during treatment.''Rare instances of acute worsening of diarrhea, cramps, and abdominal pain may occur which is at times may be accompanied by fever, ''rash'', and malaise. This reaction is believed to represent an ''allergy'' to the 5-ASA compound.''Rowasa is the 5-ASA compound mesalamine in enema form and is effective in ulcerative proctitis and ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (two conditions where active 5-ASA ''drugs'' taken as enemas can easily reach the inflamed tissues directly). Each Rowasa enema contains 4 grams of mesalamine in 60 cc of fluid. The enema usually is administered at bedtime, and patients are encouraged to retain the enema through the night.''The enema contains sulfite and should not be used by patients with sulfite ''allergy''. Otherwise, Rowasa enemas are safe and well-tolerated.''Rowasa also comes in suppository form for treating limited proctitis. Each suppository contains 500 mg of mesalamine and usually is administered twice daily.''While some patients improve within several days of starting Rowasa, the usual course of treatment is three to six weeks. Some patients may need even longer courses of treatment for optimal benefit. In patients who do not respond to Rowasa, oral 5-ASA compounds (such as Asacol) can be added. Some studies have reported increased effectiveness in treating ulcerative proctitis and proctosigmoiditis by combining oral 5-ASA compounds with Rowasa enemas. Oral 5-ASA compounds also are used to maintain remission in ulcerative proctitis and proctosigmoiditis.''Another alternative for patients who fail to respond to Rowasa or who cannot use Rowasa is cortisone enemas (''Cortenema''). Cortisone is a potent anti-inflammatory agent. Oral corticosteroids are systemic drugs with serious and predictable long-term side effects. Cortenema is a topical ''corticosteroid'' that has less absorption into the body than oral corticosteroids, and, therefore, it has fewer and less severe side effects.' "
Systemic corticosteroids (including side effects),"'Corticosteroids (''Prednisone'', ''prednisolone'"", hydrocortisone, etc.) have been used for many years in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis or who fail to respond to optimal doses of 5-ASA compounds. Unlike the 5-ASA compounds, corticosteroids do not require direct contact with the inflamed intestinal tissues to be effective. Oral corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. After absorption, corticosteroids exert prompt anti-inflammatory action throughout the body. Consequently, they are used in treating Crohn's ""'enteritis'', ''ileitis'', and ''ileocolitis'"", as well as ulcerative and Crohn's colitis. In critically ill patients, intravenous corticosteroids (such as hydrocortisone) can be given in the hospital.""'Corticosteroids are faster acting than the 5-ASA compounds. Patients frequently experience improvement in their symptoms within days of starting corticosteroids. Corticosteroids, however, do not appear to be useful in maintaining remissions in ulcerative colitis.''Side effects of corticosteroids depend on the dose and duration of use. Short courses of prednisone, for example, usually are well tolerated with few and mild side effects. Long term, high doses of corticosteroids usually produce predictable and potentially serious side effects. Common side effects include rounding of the face (moon face), ''acne'', increased body hair, ''diabetes'', ''weight gain'', ''high blood pressure'', ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', increased susceptibility to infections, muscle ''weakness'', ''depression'', ''insomnia'', ''mood swings'', personality changes, irritability, and thinning of the bones (''osteoporosis'') with an accompanying increased risk of compression ''fractures'' of the spine. Children on corticosteroids can experience stunted growth.''The most serious complication from long term corticosteroid use is ''aseptic necrosis'' of the hip joints. Aseptic necrosis means death of bone tissue. It is a painful condition that can ultimately lead to the need for surgical replacement of the hips. Aseptic necrosis also has been reported in knee joints. It is unknown how corticosteroids cause aseptic necrosis. Patients on corticosteroids who develop pain in the hips or knees should report the pain to their doctors promptly. Early diagnosis of aseptic necrosis with cessation of corticosteroids has been reported in some patients to decrease the severity of the condition and possibly help avoid ''hip replacement''.'""Prolonged use of corticosteroids can depress the ability of the body's adrenal glands to produce cortisol (a natural corticosteroid necessary for proper functioning of the body). Abruptly discontinuing corticosteroids can cause symptoms due to a lack of natural cortisol (a condition called ""'adrenal insufficiency''). Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include nausea, ''vomiting'', and even shock. Withdrawing corticosteroids too quickly also can produce symptoms of joint aches, fever, and malaise. Therefore, corticosteroids need to be gradually reduced rather than abruptly stopped.'""Even after the corticosteroids are discontinued, the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol can remain ""'depressed'' for months to two years. The depressed adrenal glands may not be able to produce enough cortisol to help the body handle ''stress'' such as accidents, surgery, and infections. These patients will need treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone, hydrocortisone, etc.) during stressful situations to avoid developing adrenal insufficiency.'""Because corticosteroids are not useful in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and because they have predictable and potentially serious side effects, these drugs should be used for the shortest possible length of time.""'Once the decision is made to use oral corticosteroids, treatment usually is initiated with prednisone, 40-60 mg daily. The majority of patients with ulcerative colitis respond with an improvement in symptoms. Once symptoms improve, prednisone is reduced by 5-10 mg per week until the dose of 20 mg per day is reached. The dose then is tapered at a slower rate until the prednisone ultimately is discontinued. Gradually reducing corticosteroids not only minimizes the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, it also reduces the chances of abrupt relapse of the colitis.''Many doctors use 5-ASA compounds at the same time as corticosteroids. In patients who achieve remission with systemic corticosteroids, 5-ASA compounds such as Asacol are often continued to maintain remissions.''In patients whose symptoms return during reduction of the dose of corticosteroid, the dose of corticosteroids is increased slightly to control the symptoms. Once the symptoms are under control, the reduction can resume at a slower pace. Some patients become corticosteroid dependent. These patients consistently develop ''symptoms of colitis'' whenever the corticosteroid dose reaches below a certain level. In patients who are corticosteroid dependent or who are unresponsive to corticosteroids, other anti-inflammatory medications, immunomodulator medications or surgery are considered.''The management of patients who are corticosteroid dependent or patients with severe disease which responds poorly to medications is complex. Doctors who are experienced in treating ''inflammatory bowel'' disease and in using the immunomodulators should evaluate these patients.''Long-term use of corticosteroids such as prednisolone or prednisone can cause ''osteoporosis'' . Corticosteroids cause decreased calcium absorption from the intestines and increased loss of calcium from the kidneys and bones. Increasing dietary calcium intake is important but alone cannot halt corticosteroid-induced bone loss. Management of patients on long term corticosteroids should include:''Oral ''budesonide'' (''Entocort EC'"") is a topically acting corticosteroid which was been shown to be effective in Crohn's disease, and in enema formulation for left-sided ulcerative colitis with fewer side effects than oral steroids. In a recent meta-analysis, however, it was found to be significantly less likely to induce clinical remission in patients with ulcerative colitis than oral mesalamine after 8 weeks of therapy. Therefore, use of this medication is not recommended at this time to treat flares of ulcerative colitis."" Adequate calcium (1000 mg daily if premenopausal, 1500 mg daily if postmenopausal) and vitamin D (800 units daily) intake. Periodic review with the doctor on the need for continued corticosteroid treatment and the lowest effective dose if continued treatment is necessary. A bone density study to measure the extent of bone loss in patients taking corticosteroids for more than three months. Regular weight-bearing exercise, and stop smoking cigarettes. Discussion with the doctor regarding the use of alendronate (Fosamax) or risedronate (Actonel) in the prevention and the treatment of corticosteroid induced osteoporosis."
Golimumab (Simponi),"'Golimumab'' is an injectable man-made protein that binds to ''tumor'' necrosis factor alpha in the body, and blocks the effects of tumor necrosis factor alfa in patients with ulcerative colitis. Golimumab is injected under the skin, and injection sites should be rotated. Golimumab interacts with several drugs and has several side effects. Consult with your prescribing physician or pharmacist to discuss these potential ''drug interactions'' and side effects.' "
What are immunomodulator medications?,"""Immunomodulators are medications that weaken the body's immune system. The immune system is composed of immune cells and the proteins that these cells produce. These cells and proteins serve to defend the body against harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other foreign invaders. Activation of the immune system causes inflammation within the tissues where the activation occurs. (Inflammation is, in fact, an important mechanism to defend the body used by the immune system.) Normally, the immune system is activated only when the body is exposed to harmful invaders. In patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, however, the immune system is abnormally and chronically activated in the absence of any known invader. Immunomodulators decrease tissue inflammation by reducing the population of immune cells and/or by interfering with their production of proteins that promote immune activation and inflammation. Generally, the benefits of controlling moderate to severe ulcerative colitis outweigh the risks of infection due to weakened immunity. Examples of immunomodulators include azathioprine (Imuran), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP, ""'Purinethol''), cyclosporine (''Sandimmune''), and methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall).'""Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are medications that weaken the body's immunity by reducing the population of a class of immune cells called lymphocytes. Azathioprine and 6-MP are related chemically. Specifically, azathioprine is converted into 6-MP inside the body. In high doses, these two drugs have been useful in preventing rejection of transplanted organs and in treating ""'leukemia'"". In low doses, they have been used for many years to treat patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.""""Azathioprine and 6-MP are increasingly recognized by doctors as valuable drugs in treating Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some 70% of patients with moderate to severe disease will benefit from these drugs. Because of the slow onset of action and the potential for side effects, however, 6-MP and azathioprine are used mainly in the following situations:""'When azathioprine and 6-MP are added to corticosteroids in the treatment of ulcerative colitis patients who do not respond to corticosteroids alone, there may be an improved response or smaller doses and shorter courses of corticosteroids may be effective. Some patients can discontinue corticosteroids altogether without experiencing relapses. The ability to reduce corticosteroid requirements has earned 6-MP and azathioprine their reputation as ""steroid-sparing"" medications.'""In patients with severe ulcerative colitis who suffer frequent relapses, 5-ASA may not be sufficient, and more potent azathioprine and 6-MP will be necessary to maintain remissions. In the doses used for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the long-term side effects of azathioprine and 6-MP are less serious than long-term oral corticosteroids or repeated courses of oral corticosteroids.""'Side effects of 6-MP and azathioprine include increased vulnerability to infections, inflammation of the liver (''hepatitis'') and pancreas, (''pancreatitis''), and bone marrow toxicity (interfering with the formation of cells that circulate in the blood).'""The goal of treatment with 6-MP and azathioprine is to weaken the body's immune system in order to decrease the intensity of inflammation in the intestines; however, weakening the immune system increases the patient's vulnerability to infections. For example, in a group of patients with severe Crohn's disease unresponsive to standard doses of azathioprine, raising the dose of azathioprine helped to control the disease, but two patients developed ""'cytomegalovirus'' (''CMV'') infection. ''CMV'' usually infects individuals with weakened immune systems such as patients with ''AIDS'' or cancer, especially if they are receiving ''chemotherapy'', which further weakens the immune system.''Azathioprine and 6-MP-induced inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) and pancreas (pancreatitis) are rare. Pancreatitis typically causes severe abdominal pain and sometimes ''vomiting''. Pancreatitis due to 6-MP or azathioprine occurs in a small percentage of patients, usually during the first several weeks of treatment. Patients who develop pancreatitis should not receive either of these two medications again.''Azathioprine and 6-MP also suppress the bone marrow. The bone marrow is where ''red blood cells'', white blood cells, and platelets are made. Actually, a slight reduction in the white blood cell count during treatment is desirable since it indicates that the dose of 6-MP or azathioprine is high enough to have an effect; however, excessively low red or white blood cell counts indicates bone marrow toxicity. Therefore, patients on 6-MP and azathioprine should have periodic blood counts (usually every two weeks initially and then every 3 months during maintenance) to monitor the effect of the drugs on their bone marrow.''6-MP can reduce the sperm count in men. When the partners of male patients on 6-MP conceive, there is a higher incidence of miscarriages and ''vaginal bleeding''. There also are respiratory difficulties in the ''newborn''. Therefore, it is recommended that whenever feasible, male patients should stop 6-MP and azathioprine for three months before attempting to\xa0conceive.''Patients on long-term, high dose azathioprine to prevent rejection of the kidney after kidney transplantation have an increased risk of developing ''lymphoma'', a ''malignant'' disease of lymphatic cells. There is no evidence at present that long term use of azathioprine and 6-MP in the low doses used in IBD increases the risk for lymphoma, ''leukemia'' or other malignancies.''One problem with 6-MP and azathioprine is their slow onset of action. Typically, full benefit of these drugs is not realized for three months or longer. During this time, corticosteroids frequently have to be maintained at high levels to control inflammation.''The reason for this slow onset of action is partly due to the way doctors prescribe 6-MP. Typically, 6-MP is started at a dose of 50 mg daily. The blood count is then checked two weeks later. If the white blood cell count (specifically the lymphocyte count) is not reduced, the dose is increased. This cautious, stepwise approach helps prevent severe bone marrow and liver toxicity, but also delays benefit from the drug.'""Studies have shown that giving higher doses of 6-MP early can speed up the benefit of 6-MP without increased toxicity in most patients, but some patients do develop severe bone marrow toxicity. Therefore, the dose of 6-MP has to be individualized. Scientists now believe that an individual's vulnerability to 6-MP toxicity is genetically inherited. Blood tests can be performed to identify those individuals with increased vulnerability to 6-MP toxicity. In these individuals, lower initial doses can be used. Blood tests can also be performed to measure the levels of certain by-products of 6-MP. The levels of these by-products in the blood help doctors more quickly determine whether the dose of 6-MP is right for the patient.""'Azathioprine is converted into 6-MP in the body, and 6-MP then is partially converted into other chemicals by an enzyme called thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). These chemicals then are eliminated from the body. The activity of TPMT that determines the ability to convert 6-MP into other chemicals is genetically determined, and approximately 10% of the population in the United States has reduced or absent TPMT activity. In this 10% of patients, 6-MP and another related chemical (6-''thioguanine'' or 6-TG) accumulate and are toxic to the bone marrow where blood cells are produced. Thus, when given normal doses of azathioprine or 6-MP, these patients with reduced or absent TPMT activity can develop seriously low white blood cell counts for prolonged periods of time, exposing them to serious life-threatening infections.''The Food and Drug Administration now recommends that doctors check TPMT levels prior to starting treatment with azathioprine or 6-MP. Patients found to have genes associated with reduced or absent TPMT activity are treated with alternative medications or are prescribed substantially lower than normal doses of 6-MP or azathioprine.''A word of caution is in order, however. Having normal TPMT genes is no guarantee against azathioprine or 6-MP toxicity. Rarely, a patient with normal TPMT genes can develop severe toxicity in the bone marrow and a low white blood cell count even with normal doses of 6-MP or azathioprine. In addition, with normal levels of TPMT activity, liver toxicity, another toxic effect of 6-MP, can still occur. Therefore, all patients taking 6-MP or azathioprine (regardless of TPMT genetics) have to be closely monitored by a doctor who will order periodic blood counts, and liver enzyme tests for as long as the medication is taken.''Another cautionary note: ''allopurinol'' (Zyloprim), used in treating high blood uric acids levels and ''gout'', can induce bone marrow toxicity when used together with azathioprine or 6-MP. This occurs because allopurinol reduces TMPT activity. The combination of genetically-reduced TMPT activity and further reduction of TMPT activity by the allopurinol increases greatly the risk of bone marrow toxicity.''In addition to monitoring blood cell counts and ''liver tests'', doctors also may measure blood levels of the chemicals that are formed from 6-MP (6-MP metabolites), which can be helpful in several situations such as:''Patients have been maintained on 6-MP or azathioprine for years without any important long-term side effects. Their doctors, however, should closely monitor their patients on long-term 6-MP. There is data suggesting that patients on long-term maintenance with 6-MP or azathioprine fare better than those who stop these medications. Those who stop 6-MP or azathioprine are more likely to experience relapses, more likely to need corticosteroids or undergo surgery.''Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) is an immunomodulator and anti-inflammatory medication. Methotrexate has been used for many years in the treatment of severe ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''psoriasis'"". It has been helpful in treating patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who are either not responding to 6-MP and azathioprine or are intolerant of these two medications. Methotrexate also may be effective in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who are not responding to corticosteroids or 6-MP and azathioprine. It can be given orally or by weekly injections under the skin or into the muscles. It is more reliably absorbed with the injections.""'One major complication of methotrexate is the development of liver ''cirrhosis'' when the medication is given over a prolonged period of time (years). The risk of liver damage is higher in patients who also abuse ''alcohol'' or have morbid (severe) ''obesity''. Generally, periodic liver biopsies are recommended for a patient who has received a cumulative (total) methotrexate dose of 1.5 grams and higher.''Other side effects of methotrexate include low white blood cell counts and inflammation of the ''lungs''.''Methotrexate should not be used in ''pregnancy''.'""Cyclosporine (Sandimmune) is a potent immunosuppressant used in preventing organ rejection after transplantation, for example, of the liver. It also has been used to treat patients with severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Because of the approval of ""'infliximab'' (''Remicade'"") for treating severe Crohn's disease, cyclosporine probably will be used primarily in severe ulcerative colitis. Cyclosporine is useful in fulminant ulcerative colitis and in severely ill patients who are not responding to systemic corticosteroids. Administered intravenously, cyclosporine can be very effective in rapidly controlling severe colitis and avoiding or delaying surgery.""'Cyclosporine also is available as an oral medication, but the relapse rate with oral cyclosporine is high. Therefore, cyclosporine seems most useful when administered intravenously in acute situations.''Side effects of cyclosporine include ''high blood pressure'', impairment of kidney function, and tingling sensations in the extremities. More serious side effects include ''anaphylactic shock'' and ''seizures''.'""Infliximab (Remicade) is an antibody that attaches to a protein called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is one of the proteins produced by immune cells during activation of the immune system. TNF-alpha, in turn, stimulates other cells of the immune system to produce and release other proteins that promote inflammation. In Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis, there is continued production of TNF-alpha as part of the immune activation. Infliximab, by attaching to TNF-alpha, blocks its activity and in so doing decreases the inflammation.""'Infliximab, an antibody to TNF-alpha, is produced by the immune system of mice after the mice are injected with human TNF-alpha. The mouse antibody then is modified to make it look more like a human antibody, and this modified antibody is infliximab. Such modifications are necessary to decrease the likelihood of allergic reactions when the antibody is administered to humans. Infliximab is given by intravenous infusion over two hours. Patients are monitored throughout the infusion for side effects.'""Infliximab has been used effectively for many years for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease that was not responding to corticosteroids or immuno-modulators. In Crohn's disease patients, a majority experienced improvement in their disease after one infusion of infliximab. Some patients noticed improvement in symptoms within days of the infusion. Most patients experienced improvement within two weeks. In patients who respond to infliximab, the improvements in symptoms can be dramatic. Moreover, there can be impressively rapid healing of the ulcers and the inflammation in the intestines after just one infusion.""'Only over the last few years infliximab also has been used to treat severe UCs. In a study of over 700 patients with moderate to severe UC, for example, infliximab was found to be more effective than placebo in inducing and maintaining remission.''Infliximab is typically given to induce remission in three doses - at time zero and then two weeks and four weeks later. After remission is attained, maintenance doses can be given every other month.''Infliximab, generally, is well tolerated. There have been rare reports of side effects during infusions, including ''chest pain'', ''shortness of breath'', and nausea. These effects usually resolve spontaneously within minutes if the infusion is stopped. Other commonly reported side effects include ''headache'' and ''upper respiratory tract infection''.''Infliximab, like immuno-modulators, increases the risk for infection. One case of ''salmonella'' colitis and several cases of ''pneumonia'' have been reported with the use of infliximab. There also have been cases of ''tuberculosis'' (''TB'') reported after the use of infliximab.''Because infliximab is partly a mouse protein, it may induce an immune reaction when given to humans, especially with repeated infusions. In addition to the side effects that occur while the infusion is being given, patients also may develop a ""delayed ''allergic reaction''"" that occurs 7-10 days after receiving the infliximab. This type of reaction may cause ''flu-like symptoms'' with fever, ''joint pain'"" and swelling, and a worsening of Crohn's disease symptoms. It can be serious, and if it occurs, a physician should be contacted. Paradoxically, those patients who have more frequent infusions of Remicade are less likely to develop this type of delayed reaction compared to those patients who receive infusions separated by long intervals (6-12 months).""'There are some reports of worsening ''heart disease'' in patients who have received Remicade. The precise mechanism and role of infliximab in the development of this side effect is unclear. As a precaution, individuals with ''heart disease'' should inform their physician of this condition before receiving infliximab.''There have been rare reports of nerve damage such as ''optic neuritis'' (inflammation of the nerve of the eye) and motor neuropathy (damage to the nerves controlling muscles).''There have also been rare reports of patients developing viral colitis (''cytomegalovirus'' and ''herpes'' simplex virus) while on immunosuppressive medications. These viral infections can mimic a flare of ulcerative colitis and mistakenly suggest resistance to therapy. Before increasing the dose or changing the medication being used to treat the ulcerative colitis, patients should have a thorough evaluation including ''flexible sigmoidoscopy'' or limited colonoscopy with biopsies to help make the diagnosis of viral colitis.''Infliximab can aggravate and cause the spread of an existing infection. Therefore, it should not be given to patients with ''pneumonia'', ''urinary tract infection'' or ''abscess'' (localized collection of pus).''It now is recommended that patients be tested for ''TB'' prior to receiving infliximab. Patients who previously had TB should inform their physician of this before they receive infliximab.''Infliximab can cause the spread of cancer cells; therefore, it should not be given to patients with cancer.''The effects of infliximab on the fetus are not known although the literature suggests that this medication is safe for women to continue until week 32 of pregnancy. At that time, the risk of exposure of the fetus to this medication by placental transfer is increased. Infliximab is listed as a pregnancy category B drug by the FDA (meaning there has been no documented human toxicity).''Because infliximab is partly a mouse protein, some patients can develop antibodies against infliximab with repeated infusions. The development of these antibodies can decrease the effectiveness of the drug. The chances of developing these antibodies can be decreased by concomitant use of 6-MP and corticosteroids. There are ongoing studies in patients who have lost their initial response to infliximab to determine whether measurement of antibody titers will be helpful in guiding further treatment. Results of these studies are not yet available.'""While infliximab represents an exciting new class of medications in the fight against Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, caution is warranted because of potentially serious side effects. Doctors are using infliximab in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis not responding to other medications.""'Adalimumab'' is an anti-TNF drug similar to infliximab. It decreases inflammation by blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). In contrast to infliximab, adalimumab is a fully humanized anti-TNF antibody containing no mouse protein and, therefore, might cause less of an immune reaction. Adalimumab is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) instead of intravenously as in the case of infliximab.''Rheumatologists'' have been using adalimumab for treating inflammation of the joints in patients with ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'"", and ankylosing spondylitis. It was also approved by the FDA in 2007 for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Though not approved formally by the FDA for treatment of ulcerative colitis, a few studies have shown it to have some efficacy in treating patients with ulcerative colitis who are refractory to or have lost their response to infliximab. More information will be required before recommending this as a standard therapy.""'Visilizumab is a humanized antibody that specifically binds to human CD3 expressing T cells, that inhibits the activity of the cells. (CD3 expressing T cells are part of the immune system and seem to play an important role in promoting the inflammation of ulcerative colitis.). In a phase 1 open-label study evaluating the safety and tolerability of this medication, 32 subjects received visilizumab. Results showed that 84% of these patients achieved a clinical response by day 30, 41% achieved clinical remission, and 44% achieved endoscopic remission. Main side effects were decreased CD4 counts and cytokine release syndromes (''flu-like'' symptoms, etc), though there were no serious infections. Initial data seems promising though more must be learned about this medication before it can be used routinely. This medication is not yet approved by the FDA for treatment of ulcerative colitis.''Alpha-4 integrins on the surface of cells of the immune system help the cells to leave the blood and travel into the tissues where they promote inflammation. Antibodies against these integrins have been developed, to dampen the inflammatory response. Natalizumab is one such agent, and in small studies in patients with ulcerative colitis has been shown to have some efficacy in leading to clinical remission. Another more gut-selective humanized antibody (MLN02) has been evaluated in multi-center trials and has also been found to lead to clinical and endoscopic remission in more patients than placebo. More studies must be conducted to evaluate long term effectiveness and side effects of these medications. This medication is not yet approved by the FDA for treatment of ulcerative colitis.' Patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease not responding to corticosteroids. Patients who are experiencing undesirable corticosteroid-related sideeffects. Patients who are dependent on corticosteroids and are unable to discontinue them without developing relapses. If a patient's disease is not responding to standard doses of 6-MP or azathioprine and his/her 6-MP blood metabolite levels are low, compliance should be checked, and if satisfactory, the dose of 6-MP or azathioprine may be increased. If a patient's disease does not respond to treatment and his/her 6-MP blood metabolite levels are very low, it is most likely that he/she is not taking his/her medication. The lack of response in this case is due to patient non-compliance."
Summary of medication treatment," Azulfidine, Asacol, Pentasa, Dipentum, Colazal, and Rowasa all contain 5-ASA compounds which are topical anti-inflammatory ingredients. These medications are effective in inducing remission among patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. They also are safe and effective in maintaining remission.   Pentasa is more commonly used in treating Crohn's ileitis because the Pentasa capsules release more 5-ASA compounds into the small intestine than the Asacol tablets. Pentasa also can be used for treating mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.  Rowasa enemas are safe and effective in treating ulcerative proctitis and proctosigmoiditis.   The sulfa-free 5-ASA compounds (Asacol, Pentasa, Dipentum, Colazal, Rowasa) have fewer side effects than Azulfidine, which contains sulfa.   Newer formulations of 5-ASA products (Lialda, Apriso) allow for higher doses to be taken less frequently throughout the day.  In ulcerative colitis patients with moderate to severe disease and in patients who fail to respond to 5-ASA compounds, systemic (oral) corticosteroids can be used. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone, cortisone, etc.) are potent and fast-acting anti-inflammatory agents for treating Crohn's ileitis, ileocolitis, and ulcerative colitis.   Systemic corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Serious side effects can result from prolonged corticosteroid treatment.   To minimize side effects, corticosteroids should be gradually reduced as soon as disease remission is achieved. In patients who become corticosteroid dependent or are unresponsive to corticosteroid treatment, surgery or immunomodulator treatments are considered.   Immunomodulators used for treating severe ulcerative colitis include azathioprine/6-MP, methotrexate, and cyclosporine.   Infliximab (Remicade) may be beneficial in controlling moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and in decreasing the need for urgent removal of the colon.   Other biological agents are currently being studied, and with more research, might be approved for use in the future."
Surgery for ulcerative colitis,"'Surgery for ulcerative colitis usually involves removing the entire colon and the rectum. Removal of the colon and rectum is the only permanent cure for ulcerative colitis. This procedure also eliminates the risk of developing colon cancer. Surgery in ulcerative colitis is reserved for the following patients:''Standard surgery involves the removal of the entire colon, including the rectum. A small opening is made in the abdominal wall and the end of the small intestine is attached to the skin of the abdomen to form an ''ileostomy''. Stool collects in a bag that is attached over the ileostomy. Recent improvements in the construction of ileostomies have allowed for continent ileostomies. A ''continent ileostomy'' is a pouch created from the intestine. The pouch serves as a reservoir similar to a rectum, and is emptied on a regular basis with a small tube. Patients with continent ileostomies do not need to wear collecting ''bags''.''More recently, a surgery has been developed which allows stool to be passed normally through the anus. In an ileo-anal anastomosis, the large intestine is removed and the small intestine is attached just above the anus. Only the diseased lining of the anus is removed and the muscles of the anus remain intact. In this ""pull-through"" procedure, the normal route of stool elimination is maintained. This procedure has a relatively good success rate, although pouchitis (inflammation of the distal ileum now acting as the rectum) is a well known complication (that should be confirmed by endoscopy) that is manifested by increased diarrhea, urgency, bleeding, and pain.'   Patients with fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon who are not responding readily to medications. Patients with long standing pancolitis or left-sided colitis who are at risk of developing colon cancers. Removal of the colon is important when changes are detected in the colon lining.  Patients who have had years of severe colitis which has responded poorly to medications. "
Treatment by disease severity and location (based on ACG Practice Guidelines),"'For refractory cases, oral steroids or IV infliximab can be used (though this is less well studied in distal colitis)''Also, surgery is recommended for severe colitis refractory to medical therapy' Oral aminosalicylates, topical mesalamine, or topical steroids  Combination of oral and topical aminosalicylates is better than either alone Oral sulfasalazine 4-6 g/day or alternative aminosalicylate 4.8 g/day  Oral steroids for patients refractory to above therapy + topical therapy  6-MP or azathioprine for patients refractory to oral steroids, but not so severe as to require IV therapy  Infliximab in patients who are steroid refractory/dependant on adequate doses of 6-MP/thiopurine or who are intolerant to these medications Infliximab if urgent hospitalization is not needed  If patient is toxic, should be admitted to the hospital for IV steroids
Failure to improve in 3-5 days is indication for colectomy or IV cyclosporine

 Failure to improve in 3-5 days is indication for colectomy or IV cyclosporine Maintenance 6-MP can also be added in these patients Absolute: Hemorrhage, perforation, documented or strongly suspected cancer"
Are there any special dietary requirements for persons with ulcerative colitis?,"'Although it seems plausible that a specialized ''diet'' might benefit patients with ulcerative colitis, there is actually no evidence to support treatment with dietary modification. Despite extensive research, no ''diet'' has been found to slow progression, treat, or cure the disease. It is recommended that patients stay on a balanced, healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, grains, lean meats, beans, fish, eggs, nuts. Patients should also try to limit foods with saturated ''fats'' ''high cholesterol'"". During flare-ups, patients should continue to eat as tolerated. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America recommends a bland diet with soft food during a flare including hot cereals, boiled eggs, mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, canned or cooked vegetables to minimize discomfort.""  "
What research is being done regarding ulcerative colitis?,"'Active research is also ongoing to find other biological agents that are potentially more effective with fewer side effects in treating ulcerative colitis including adalimumab, visilizumab, and alpha-4 integrin blockers.''Research in ulcerative colitis is very active, and many questions remain to be answered. The cause, mechanism of inflammation, and optimal treatments have yet to be defined. Researchers have recently identified genetic differences among patients which may allow them to select certain subgroups of patients with ulcerative colitis who may respond differently to medications. Newer and safer medications are being developed. Improvements in surgical procedures to make them safer and more effective continue to emerge. ''It is recommended that adults with ''inflammatory bowel'' disease generally follow the same vaccination schedules as the general population. ''Osteoporosis'' has also increasingly been recognized as a significant health problem in patients with IBD. IBD patients tend to have markedly reduced bone mineral densities. Screening with a bone density study is recommended in:''For this reason, most patients with IBD should be on calcium and ''vitamin D'' supplementation. ' Adults should receive a 1 time dose of Tdap, then Td booster every 10 years.   Women between the ages of 9 and 26 should receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine (and consideration should be given to older patients who are HPV negative on Pap smear).   Men in the same age range should also consider being vaccinated given the increased risk of HPV with immunosuppression.   Influenza (flu) vaccine should be given annually to all patients (though the live intranasal vaccine is contraindicated in patients on immunosuppressive therapy).   One dose of pneumococcal vaccine should be given between age 19-26 and then revaccination after 5 years.   If not previously vaccinated, all adults should receive 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine and 3 doses hepatitis B.   Meningococcal vaccine is only recommended for patients with anatomic or functional asplenia, terminal complement deficiencies, or others at higher risk (college students, military recruits, etc).   MMR, varicella, and zoster vaccines (shingles vaccine) are contraindicated for patients on biologic therapy, as they are all live vaccines.  postmenopausal woman,   men > age 50,   patients with prolonged steroid use (>3 consecutive months or recurrent courses),   patients with a personal history of low-trauma fractures, and  patients with hypogonadism.

What is ulcerative colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' (UC) is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the ''large intestine'' (colon) and the rectum and sores (ulcers) on the inner lining of the ''large intestine''. ''Ulcerative colitis'' is thought to be an autoimmune disease, that is, one where the body attacks itself. It is a type of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''). It is not the same as '""Crohn's disease""', another type of ''IBD'', which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas ''ulcerative colitis'' only affects the colon and rectum. It is also not the same as '' irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), which affects how the colon functions and does not cause inflammation.''Ulcerative colitis'' is estimated to affect nearly 907,000 Americans, and it affects males slightly more often than females. The disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40.'  "
What are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?,"'''Symptoms of ulcerative colitis'' include ' 
feeling an 
urgent need to take a bowel movement, 
	 fatigue, 

	 abdominal pain and cramping, 
	
	 diarrhea, 

	 loss of appetite, 
	
	 weight loss, 

	 rectal bleeding and 

	 anemia (low red 
blood cell count).
	"
What causes ulcerative colitis?,"'The cause of ''ulcerative colitis'' is unknown but it is believed to be caused by a combination of several factors including an overactive immune system, genetics, and the environment. ''Physical or e''motional stress'', and certain foods do not cause ulcerative colitis, however, they may trigger symptoms in a person who has ulcerative colitis. ' Overactive immune system: It is believed that in ulcerative colitis, the 
immune system is triggered to mistakenly attack the inner lining of the large 
intestine, causing inflammation and symptoms of ulcerative colitis.  Genetics: Ulcerative colitis 
can run in families. The genetic link is not entirely clear but studies show 
that up to 20% of people with ulcerative colitis have a close family member with the disease. 
	 Environment: Certain environmental factors including taking certain medications 
	(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs, antibiotics, and oral 
contraceptives), and eating a high fat diet may slightly increase the risk of 
developing ulcerative colitis."
What is an ulcerative colitis diet?,"'A person with ulcerative colitis may find they need to modify their ''diet'' to help manage their symptoms. There is not a single ''diet'' or meal plan that fits everyone with ulcerative colitis, and diets are individualized for each patient. Depending on symptoms different types of diets may be recommended, such as:''Attention to ''nutrition'' is important for patients with ulcerative colitis, as the symptoms of ''diarrhea'' and bleeding can lead to ''dehydration'', ''electrolyte'' imbalance, and loss of nutrients. It may be necessary to take ''nutritional supplements'' if your symptoms do not allow you to eat a nutritionally balanced diet. Talk to your health-care professional about what ''supplements'' to take. Many people with ulcerative colitis find it easiest to eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than a few large ones. This can also help increase the ''nutrition'' absorbed from the foods you eat. ' A high-calorie diet: Many people with ulcerative colitis lose weight and can 
develop signs of malnutrition. A high calorie diet may prevent these problems. 
	 A 
lactose-free diet: People with ulcerative colitis may also have lactose intolerance.  A low-fat 
diet: Ulcerative colitis may interfere with fat absorption and eating fatty 
foods may trigger symptoms. This is often recommended during an ulcerative 
	colitis flare.  A 
low-fiber diet  (low-residue 
	diet): This can help reduce the frequency of bowel movements and 
abdominal cramps.  A low-salt diet: This diet is used when patients are on 
corticosteroid therapy to help reduce water retention.  A low FODMAP diet: FODMAP 
stands for Fermentable Oligo-Di-Monosaccha-rides and Polyols, which are types of 
sugars found in certain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols. This diet is used in 
people who have intolerance to FODMAPS.  A gluten-free diet: 
	People with ulcerative colitis may 
also be sensitive to gluten. "
19 trigger foods to avoid with an ulcerative colitis diet plan,"'Dietary choices do not cause ulcerative colitis, but certain foods can trigger and worsen symptoms. Learning to identify trigger foods can help reduce the frequency and severity of ''ulcerative colitis symptoms''. Not all people with ulcerative colitis have the same triggers, but a list of some of the most common include: '   Alcohol can stimulate the intestine, triggering 
	diarrhea. Some people 
tolerate alcohol better than others.  
Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, 
	chocolate, 
and energy drinks, is a stimulant and can speed up the transit time in the 
colon, leading to more frequent trips to the bathroom.  Carbonated 
beverages including sodas and beer contain carbonation that can irritate the 
digestive tract, and cause 
	gas. Many contain 
	sugar, 
	caffeine, or artificial 
sweeteners, which can also be ulcerative colitis triggers.  Dairy products should be avoided if 
you are lactose intolerant, as they can cause symptoms similar to ulcerative 
colitis. Not everyone with ulcerative colitis is lactose intolerant.  Dried beans, peas, and 
legumes are all high in fiber and can increase bowel movements, abdominal 
cramping, and gas. If you are a 
vegetarian or vegan, you can try these foods in 
small amounts, or pureed to see if they do not trigger symptoms.  Dried fruits, 
berries, fruits with pulp or seeds are other foods high in fiber that can 
trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms.  Foods containing sulfur or sulfate can cause excess gas 
production. Sulfate may be found in many foods, including beer, wine, some 
juices, dairy milk, eggs, cheese, dates, dried apples and apricots, almonds, 
wheat pasta, breads, peanuts, cruciferous vegetables, raisins, prunes, red meat, 
and some supplements.  High fiber foods, including whole-grains, can increase 
bowel movements, abdominal cramping, and gas.  Meats, especially fatty meats, can 
trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms. Excess fat may not be properly absorbed during a flare, and 
this can make symptoms worse. Red meat can be high in sulfate, which triggers 
gas.  Nuts and crunchy nut butters, and seeds that are not ground up (such as in 
smooth peanut butter or tahini) can cause worsening abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. During a flare, even tiny fruit seeds (such as those in 
strawberries or in jams) may trigger symptoms.  Popcorn is another high fiber, 
bulky food that is not completely digested by the small intestine and can 
trigger diarrhea and bowel movement urgency.  Sugar alcohols (such as 
	sorbitol 
and mannitol) are found in sugar-free gum and candies, some ice creams, and some 
fruits and fruit juices (apples, pears, peaches, and prunes) and can cause 
diarrhea, bloating, and gas in some people.  Chocolate contains caffeine and 
sugar, both of which can irritate the digestive tract and cause cramping and 
more frequent bowel movements.  Vegetables, especially raw vegetables, are high 
in fiber and can be difficult to digest, causing bloating, gas, and abdominal 
cramps. This is particularly true for stringy vegetables such as broccoli, 
celery, cabbage, onions, and Brussels sprouts. Many people with ulcerative 
	colitis also find it 
hard to digest corn and mushrooms because they are hard to digest to begin with. 
	 Refined sugar can pull more water into the gut and cause diarrhea. 
	 Spicy foods, 
hot sauces, and pepper can cause diarrhea in many people, and in someone with 
ulcerative colitis experiencing a flare spicy hot foods may trigger or worsen 
symptoms.  Gluten, found in wheat, rye, barley, and some oats, can trigger 
symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis in people who have gluten sensitivity. 
	"
What foods help manage and soothe ulcerative colitis flares?,"'Avoiding foods that trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms is one way to help manage symptoms through diet. Another is knowing what foods to eat that may help relieve flares. Following is a list of foods that may help soothe ulcerative colitis flares: '  Salmon and albacore tuna contain 

omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation during a flare and may 
help you to stay in remission. Other sources of omega-3s include mackerel, 
herring, sardines,  flaxseed oil, ground flaxseed, and walnuts. Some people may 
be unable to eat whole nuts and flaxseeds during a flare, but they may be 
tolerated if ground up.  Lean meats and poultry are recommended 
following flares of ulcerative because proteins are often lost. Increasing your 
protein intake can help replenish the nutrients lost during a flare. Eggs are another great source of 
protein, and are often well-tolerated even during flares. Some eggs are 
fortified with omega-3 fatty acids, which can help 
	reduce inflammation.  
Soy-based protein can be substituted 
for animal protein in vegetarians and vegans. Other good sources of non-animal 
proteins include legumes and whole grains.  Probiotics, usually found in yogurt, 
kefir, sauerkraut, and miso, are good bacteria that can aid in digestion. Choose 
yogurts that are low in added sugars, as sugar can aggravate ulcerative colitis 
symptoms.  Avocados are an excellent source of 
protein and 
	healthy fats. They are calorie dense, but because they are about 70% 
water, they are easily digested.  Unsweetened applesauce is bland and may 
be tolerated after an ulcerative colitis flare, though some people may find it 
difficult to tolerate during a flare-up.  Instant oatmeal contains refined grains 
and is often easier than steel cut or old-fashioned oatmeal because it has a 
little less fiber.  Squash is a healthy choice that is 
usually well-tolerated during an ulcerative colitis flare. It's full of fiber, 
vitamin C, and beta carotene. Any variety of squash (butternut, zucchini, 
spaghetti, acorn, winter, and summer) are best tolerated cooked. Raw squash may 
aggravate ulcerative colitis symptoms during a flare.  Juice and smoothies can be tolerated by 
some during a flare, and can help you maintain good nutrition. Carrot juice is 
chock full of vitamin A and antioxidants and many 
	people with ulcerative colitis find it easy to 
tolerate.  Plantains, which are a variety of 
banana, can help aid digestion."
"How can I track foods that cause flare-ups and trigger symptoms of my 
ulcerative colitis?","""The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America recommends people with ulcerative colitis to keep a food journal to keep track of what they eat. Note what you eat and drink, and how you feel afterwards, noting any symptoms that arise. Start to keep a list of any foods you suspect may trigger or aggravate your ulcerative ""'colitis symptoms''. A food diary will also help you figure out if you are getting adequate ''nutrition'', and can help your doctor or dietician determine the right diet for you to manage your symptoms and prevent flares. '""The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America also has an interactive food tracking tool. It is available online or as a mobile app.""'www.ccfa.org/gibuddy' "
What other things trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms and flare-ups?,"'In addition to foods that trigger ulcerative colitis flare-ups, there are certain environmental risk factors that may also trigger flares. '   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen 
	[Advil, Motrin, Nuprin], 
naproxen 
	[Naproxen]) may cause colitis or worsen the condition. NSAIDs increase the 
occurrence of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, and 
abdominal pain.  Where you live may predispose you to a higher incidence of 
ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is found more commonly in developed countries, urban 
areas, and northern climates. The highest rates for ulcerative colitis are reported in the 
United States, Denmark, and Iceland.  Stress does not cause ulcerative colitis 
but it can make symptoms worse. Stress management techniques can be important in 
managing your ulcerative colitis symptoms.  Not taking medications or improper dosing of 
medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis can bring on a flare. 
Medications for ulcerative colitis must be taken regularly, even when you feel well. Take 
medications as prescribed. Do not skip doses, cut doses, or increase doses. 
 Antibiotics may cause diarrhea in some people. If you have an infection, tell 
your doctor to figure out the right antibiotic for you. You may also take a 
probiotic along with the antibiotic to help prevent diarrhea. "
"Which specialties of health-care professionals prescribe an ulcerative 
colitis diet?","'A ''gastroenterologist'' is a specialist in disorders of the digestive tract and can prescribe a diet for ulcerative colitis. In addition, dietitians and nutritionists who are familiar with the disorder may also help create a diet and meal plan to manage ulcerative colitis. ' "
What is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?,"""Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are known as the ""'inflammatory bowel'"" diseases (IBD). The precise cause of IBD remains unknown. These diseases are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic, or environmental factors (for example, infections) that interact with the body's immune (defense) system. When the intestinal immune system does not function properly, many white blood cells accumulate in the inner lining (mucosa) of the gut. The white cells then release chemicals that lead to tissue injury (inflammation). This inflammation of the mucosa can cause ""'diarrhea'"", which is the most common symptom of  ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with or without the intestinal complications.""  "
What are the intestinal complications of IBD?,"'''The intestinal complications of IBD occur when the intestinal inflammation is severe, extends beyond the inner lining (mucosa) of the intestines, is widespread, and/or is of long duration (chronic). For example, severe mucosal inflammation can cause ulcers, bleeding, and toxic megacolon (a condition in which the colon widens, or dilates, and loses its ability to properly contract). Inflammation that extends beyond the inner lining and through the intestinal wall is responsible for strictures (scarring that causes narrowing of the intestinal wall) and fistulas (tubular passageways originating from the bowel wall and connecting to other organs or the skin). Strictures, in turn, can lead to bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine (SIBO). If the inflammation of the small bowel is widespread, malabsorption of nutrients can be a complication. Chronic inflammation can also be associated with colon ''cancer''.'' The majority of IBD patients experience periods during which their disease intensifies (flares) or subsides (remissions). Although most patients require medication for IBD, they are able to live normal, productive lives. Some patients, but certainly not all, will develop intestinal complications of IBD. When these complications occur, they should be recognized and usually treated. Some patients with IBD develop complications outside of the intestine (extraintestinal), such as certain kinds of ''arthritis'', skin ''rashes'', ''eye problems'', and ''liver disease''. These extraintestinal complications are discussed in other articles on IBD.'' This review will describe the various types of intestinal complications that are associated with IBD, and will also summarize methods for their diagnosis and treatment. Please note that the terms bowel, intestine, and gut are used synonymously. The small bowel, or intestines, includes from top to bottom, the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large bowel is also called the colon.' "
Are the intestinal complications of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease different?,"""Some intestinal complications of IBD occur in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. For example, ulceration of the inflamed inner intestinal lining (mucosa), which causes ""'abdominal pain'"" and intestinal bleeding, may complicate both diseases. Since both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease involve the colon,  complications that are associated with the colon, such as toxic megacolon and  colon ""'cancer'"", occur in both diseases. Additionally, there are no intestinal complications that occur only in ulcerative colitis and not in  Crohn's disease. On the other hand, certain intestinal complications of IBD occur predominantly in Crohn's disease (for example, fistulas) or exclusively in Crohn's disease and not in  ulcerative colitis (for example, malabsorption and SIBO)."""" The differences in intestinal complications between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease depend on the characteristically dissimilar behaviors of the inflammation associated with these diseases. In Crohn's disease, the inflammation usually extends from the inner lining (mucosa) through the entire thickness of the bowel wall. This spreading inflammatory process may thereby lead to fistulas, abscesses, or strictures of the bowel. By contrast, the inflammation in ulcerative colitis is limited to the inner lining of the colon. The development of these particular complications is, therefore, much less common in ulcerative colitis. Also, Crohn's disease can affect any area of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus, whereas ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon. Therefore, complications involving the small intestine, such as malabsorption and SIBO, as previously noted, occur only in Crohn's disease and not in ulcerative colitis."" "
Do intestinal ulcers occur in IBD?,"""When the inflammation in the inner lining of the intestine becomes severe, it can break through the inner lining to form ulcers. The ulcers associated with ulcerative colitis are located in the colon, whereas ulcers in Crohn's disease may be found anywhere in the gut from the mouth (aphthous ulcers) to the anus. When examined, ulcerative colitis ulcers are typically shallow and more numerous, while Crohn's disease ulcers are usually deeper and with more distinct borders.""'The symptoms caused by intestinal ulcers are predominantly ''abdominal pain'', ''cramps'', and bleeding. Sometimes, however, ulcers may be present in IBD but are not associated with any symptoms (asymptomatic).'""In Crohn's disease, the inflammation and accompanying ulcers occur most commonly in the ileum, jejunum, and colon, but can occasionally occur in the duodenum. Note, however, that these ulcers are entirely different from the far more common acid-related peptic ulcers in the duodenum."" "
How are ulcers in IBD diagnosed and treated?,"'Intestinal ulcers can be diagnosed by directly viewing the lining of the intestines. Various procedures, utilizing viewing instruments called endoscopes, are available. Endoscopes are flexible, thin, tubular instruments that are inserted into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract through either the mouth or rectum, depending on the procedure. Which procedure is done depends on the part of the GI tract that is being examined. ''Endoscopy'' can be done for either the upper or ''lower GI'' tracts. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth for ''upper endoscopy'' or through the rectum for lower endoscopy. The colon is examinedeither by ''sigmoidoscopy'' (using sigmoidoscopes) for the lower (sigmoid) part ofthe colon or by ''colonoscopy'' (using a ''colonoscope'') for the entire colon.''The upper GI tract is examined by a procedure called esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (''EGD'""). An upper GI endoscope is used for this procedure. EGD is useful in detecting Crohn's disease ulcers in the ""'esophagus'', stomach, and the duodenum.''Crohn\'s disease ulcers in the small intestine may be seen by a procedure called enteroscopy, in which a special endoscope (called an enteroscope) is used. But enteroscopies need special equipments and are not widely available. Ulcers in the small intestine, however, are more often diagnosed with an X-ray study called a ""small bowel follow-through"" (SBFT). In this test, the patient swallows a few cups of barium, which coats the lining of the small intestine. On the X-ray, the barium may show the presence of ulcers. However, SBFT may not be accurate, and may not detect small ulcers in the small bowel. In patients suspected of having small bowel Crohn\'s disease ulcers and yet have normal SBFT studies, CT (''computerized tomography'') of the small bowel and capsule enteroscopy may be helpful in diagnosis.''Capsule enteroscopy is a procedure where a patient swallows a small camera the size of a pill. The camera located inside ''the pill'"" takes multiple images of the inside of the small bowel and transmits these images wirelessly onto a recorder worn around the patient's waist. The recorded images are later reviewed by a doctor. Both CT of the small bowel and capsule enteroscopy in some studies have been found to be more accurate than the traditional SBFT in diagnosing Crohn's disease of the small bowel.""'The treatment of ulcers in IBD is aimed at decreasing the underlying inflammation with various medications. These medications include ''mesalamine'' (''Asacol'', ''Pentasa'', or ''Rowasa''), ''corticosteroids'', antibiotics, or immunosuppressive\xa0medications such as 6-MP (6-''mercaptopurine'', ''Purinethol'') or ''azathioprine'' (Imuran). In some cases, ulcers can be very resistant to these treatments and the use of stronger ''drugs'' may be required. These drugs include an immunosuppressive medication, ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral'' or ''Sandimmune''), or the newer ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'""), which is an antibody to one of the body's inflammation-inducing chemicals called ""'tumor'' necrosis factor (TNFa). ''Adalimumab'' (''Humira'') and ''certolizumab'' (''Cimzia'') are also in the same class of drugs as infliximab. Occasionally, therapy with medications fails to heal IBD ulcers and surgical treatment is needed.' "
Does gastrointestinal bleeding occur in IBD?,"""Bleeding from the intestinal tract, or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, may complicate the course of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. ""'GI bleeding'' is often referred to as ''rectal bleeding'' when the blood comes out of the rectum, usually with the stools. If the source of bleeding is in the colon, the blood is usually a red color. The longer the blood the remains in the intestine, however, the darker it becomes. Thus, ''rectal bleeding'' originating from higher up in the intestinal tract is usually black, except for very rapid bleeding, which can still be red.'' Patients with ulcerative colitis usually experience some degree of chronic (long duration) rectal bleeding, which can be continuous or intermittent. The bleeding may be mild, as when it is limited to occasional drops on the toilet paper or streaks of blood around the stools. At times, however, the bleeding may be more severe or acute, with the passage of greater amounts of blood or large ''blood clots'"". The more severe rectal bleeding is most likely due to more severe inflammation and extensive ulceration of the colon. In Crohn's disease, mild or severe intestinal inflammation also may occur, but the ulcers and bleeding are less frequent than in ulcerative  colitis. Because of the deep nature of ulcers in Crohn's disease, however, the GI bleeding tends to be acute (sudden and brief) and sporadic. Furthermore, in Crohn's disease, the site of bleeding can be anywhere in the GI tract, including the colon."" "
How is gastrointestinal bleeding in IBD diagnosed and treated?,"'''Intestinal bleeding in IBD is usually diagnosed by EGD for the upper GI tract or colonoscopy for the lower GI tract. These methods allow for direct visualization of the bleeding site, which can be particularly helpful. Additionally, special instruments can be used through the upper GI endoscopes or colonoscopes, which may effectively treat the bleeding lesions and stop ongoing blood loss. Sometimes, if the bleeding is severe and the bleeding site is suspected to be in the small intestine, other tests may be needed. One of these tests is a special X-ray study called an ''angiogram'', which uses a dye to visualize the intestinal blood vessels that may be bleeding. Another test is a nuclear medicine study called a tagged red blood cell scan, which tracks the ''red blood cells'' from the blood stream to the gut. Each of these tests can help identify the site of bleeding. Pinpointing the bleeding site becomes additionally important if surgery is ultimately needed.'' No medications as yet have been shown to specifically stop acute GI bleeding in IBD. Nevertheless, the initial approach to IBD-associated GI bleeding is aggressive medical treatment of the underlying inflammation and ulceration. Chronic bleeding might respond to medications if the inflammation resolves and the ulcers heal. If the medications or endoscopic treatments do not stop acute or severe chronic bleeding, however, surgical removal (resection) of the bleeding area of the gut may be necessary.' "
How do intestinal strictures form in IBD?,"'When inflammation is present for a long time (chronic), it sometimes can cause scarring (fibrosis). ''Scar tissue'' is typically not as flexible as healthy tissue. Therefore, when fibrosis occurs in the intestines, the scarring may narrow the width of the passageway (lumen) of the involved segments of the bowel. These constricted areas are called strictures. The strictures may be mild or severe, depending on how much they block the contents of the bowel from passing through the narrowed area.'""Crohn's disease is characterized by inflammation that tends to involve the deeper layers of the intestines. Strictures, therefore, are more commonly found in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. Additionally, strictures in Crohn's disease may be found anywhere in the gut. Remember that the intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis is confined to the inner lining (mucosa) of the colon. Accordingly, in chronic ulcerative colitis, benign (not ""'malignant'') strictures of the colon occur only rarely. In fact, a narrowed segment of the colon in ulcerative colitis may well be caused by a colon cancer rather than by a benign (non-cancerous), chronic inflammatory stricture.' "
"What are symptoms of intestinal strictures, and how are they diagnosed and treated?","'Individuals may not know that they have an intestinal stricture. The stricture may not cause symptoms if it is not causing significant blockage (obstruction) of the bowel. If a stricture is narrow enough to hinder the smooth passage of the bowel contents, however, it may cause abdominal ''pain'', cramps, and ''bloating'' (distention). If the stricture causes an even more complete obstruction of the bowel, patients may experience more severe ''pain'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and an inability to pass stools.''An ''intestinal obstruction'' that is caused by a stricture can also lead to perforation of the bowel. The bowel must increase the strength of its contractions to push the intestinal contents through a narrowing in the bowel. The contracting segment of the intestine above the stricture, therefore, may experience increased pressure. This pressure sometimes weakens the bowel wall in that area, thereby causing the intestines to become abnormally wide (dilated). If the pressure becomes too high, the bowel wall may then rupture (perforate). This perforation can result in a severe infection of the abdominal ''cavity'' (''peritonitis''), abscesses (collections of infection and pus), and fistulas (tubular passageways originating from the bowel wall and connecting to other organs or the skin). Strictures of the small bowel also can lead to bacterial overgrowth, which is yet another intestinal complication of IBD.''Intestinal strictures of the small intestine may be diagnosed with a small bowel follow-through (SBFT) X-ray. For this study, the patient swallows barium, which outlines the inner lining of the small intestine. Thus, the X-ray can show the width of the passageway, or lumen, of the intestine. Upper GI endoscopy (EGD) and enteroscopy are also used for locating strictures in the small intestine. For suspected strictures in the colon, barium can be inserted into the colon (''barium enema''), followed by an X-ray to locate the strictures. Colonoscopy is another diagnostic option.''Intestinal strictures may be composed of a combination of ''scar'' tissue (fibrosis) and tissue that is inflamed and, therefore, swollen. A logical and sometimes effective treatment for these strictures, therefore, is medication to decrease the inflammation. Some medications for IBD, such as infliximab, however, may make some strictures worse. The reason is that these medications may actually promote the formation of scar tissue during the healing process. If the stricture is predominantly scar tissue and is only causing a mild narrowing, symptoms may be controlled simply by changes in the ''diet''. For example, the patient should avoid high ''fiber'' foods, such as raw carrots, celery, beans, seeds, nuts, fiber, bran, and dried fruit.'""If the stricture is more severe and can be reached and examined with an endoscope, it may be treated by stretching (dilation) during the endoscopy. In this procedure, special instruments are used through the endoscope to stretch open the stricture, usually with a balloon thatis passed through an endoscope. Once the balloon traverses the stricture, it is inflated and the force of the balloon dilates the stricture to a bigger size, thus opening the lumen to make it wider. If that doesn't work, some patients will require surgery. Typically, this procedure does not produce long-lasting results.""'Surgery sometimes is needed to treat intestinal strictures. The operation may involve cutting out (resecting) the entire narrowed segment of bowel, especially if it is a long stricture. More recently, a more limited operation, called stricturoplasty, has been devised. In this procedure, the surgeon simply ''cuts'"" open the strictured segment lengthwise and then sews the tissue closed crosswise so as to enlarge the width of the bowel's passageway (lumen). After surgery in Crohn's disease patients, medication still should be taken to prevent inflammation from recurring, especially at the site of the stricture. The reason for this recommendation is that after abdominal operations, recurrent intestinal inflammation is a common problem in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, the risk of post-operative intestinal fistulas and abscesses is increased in Crohn's disease patients. Therefore, only abdominal surgery that is absolutely necessary should be done in patients with Crohn's disease."" "
What are intestinal fistulas?,"""Intestinal fistulas are tubular connections between the bowel and other organs or the skin. Fistulas form when inflammation extends through all of the layers of the bowel and then proceeds to tunnel through the layers of other tissues. Accordingly, fistulas are much more common in Crohn's disease than in  ulcerative colitis. (In the latter, as you recall, the inflammation is confined to the inner lining of the large intestine.) Fistulas often are multiple. They may connect the bowel to other loops of the bowel (enteroenteric fistulas), to the abdominal wall (enterocutaneous), to the skin around the anus (perianal), and to other internal locations such as the urinary bladder (enterovesical), vagina (enterovaginal), muscles, and scrotum."""" In Crohn's disease patients, fistulas may form in conjunction with intestinal strictures. One reason for this association is that both fistulas and strictures can begin with inflammation of the entire thickness of the bowel wall (transmural inflammation). Subsequent scarring (fibrosis) causes strictures while continuing inflammation and tissue destruction leads to the fistulas. A stricture can also help create a fistula. As already mentioned, a perforation of the intestine can occur above an obstructing stricture. The perforation can create a tract outside of the bowel wall. A fistula then may develop in this tract."" "
What symptoms do fistulas cause and how are they diagnosed and treated?,"""Some fistulas, especially those that connect adjacent loops of bowel, may not cause significant symptoms. Other fistulas, however, can cause significant abdominal pain and external drainage, or create a bypass of a large segment of intestine. Such a bypass can occur when a fistula connects one part of the bowel to another part that is further down the intestinal tract. The fistula thereby creates a new route for the intestinal contents. This new route bypasses the segment of intestine between the fistula's upper and lower connections to the intestine. Sometimes, fistulas can open and close sporadically and unevenly. Thus, for example, the outside of a fistula might heal before the inside of the fistula. Should this occur, the bowel contents can accumulate in the fistulous tract and result in a pocket of infection and pus (""'abscess''). An abscess may be quite painful and can be dangerous, especially if the infection spreads to the bloodstream.''Fistulas sometimes are difficult to detect. Although the outside opening of a fistula may be simple to see, the inside opening that is connected to the bowel may not be easy to locate. The reason for this difficulty is that fistulas from the bowel can have long, winding tunnels that finally lead to the skin or an internal organ. Endoscopy might detect the internal opening of a fistula, but it can easily be missed. Sometimes, a small bowel barium X-ray will locate a fistula. Often, however, an exam under general anesthesia may be required to fully examine areas that have fistulas, especially around the anus and vagina.''Intestinal fistulas that do not cause symptoms often require no treatment. Fistulas that cause significant symptoms, however, usually require treatment, although they are frequently difficult to heal.''Fistulas located around the anus (perianal) sometimes can be improved by treatment with the antibiotics, ''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl'') or ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'""). In response to the antibiotics, some of these fistulas even close completely. Also, treatment with the immunosuppressive medications, azathioprine or 6MP, improves fistulas located around the anus (perianal) in almost two thirds of patients, including complete healing in one third. More recently, the new drug infliximab (Remicade), which is an antibody to one of the body's inflammation-inducing chemicals, has been shown to produce very similar results. Remember, however, that infliximab might worsen strictures, which, as mentioned, can sometimes be associated with fistulas.""'When medications for the treatment of fistulas are discontinued, they usually re-open within 6 months to a year. Steroids do not heal fistulas and should not be used for this purpose. Other medications that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine or ''tacrolimus'' (FK506 or ''Prograf''), are currently being studied for the treatment of fistulas. Sometimes, resting the bowel by feeding the patient solely with total parenteral (intravenous) ''nutrition'' (TPN), and thus nothing by mouth, is required to treat fistulas. Even if these fistulas heal in response to the TPN, they commonly recur when eating is resumed.'""Fistulas sometimes require surgery. For example, when fistulas around the anus become very severe, they can interfere with the patient's ability to control bowel movements (continence). In this situation, the surgeon might make an opening (ostomy) to the skin from the bowel above the fistulas. The intestinal contents are thereby diverted away from the fistulas. Occasionally, when absolutely necessary, intestinal fistulas are surgically removed, usually along with the involved segment of the bowel. Fistulas from the intestine to the bladder or vagina are frequently very difficult to close with medical treatment alone and often require surgery."" "
What are fissures and how are they treated?,"""Fissures are tears in the lining of the anus. They may be superficial or deep. Fissures are especially common in Crohn's disease. They differ from fistulas in that fissures are confined to the anus and do not connect to other parts of the bowel, other internal organs, or the skin. Still, fissures can cause mild to severe ""'rectal pain'' and bleeding, especially with bowel movements. The most common treatment for anal fissures is periodic sitz baths or topical creams that relax the muscle (sphincter) around the anus. Injections of tiny amounts of botulinum toxin into the muscles around the anus have been reported to be helpful in relaxing the sphincter, thereby allowing the fissures to heal. The benefit of this type of therapy, however, is still controversial. Sometimes, surgery is needed to relieve the persistent pain or bleeding of an ''anal fissure'"". For example, the surgeon may cut out (excise) the fissure. Alternatively, the muscle around the anus can be cut (sphincterotomy) to relax the sphincter so that the fissure can heal. However, as is the cases with any surgery in patients with Crohn's disease, post-operative intestinal complications can occur frequently.""  "
What is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?,"""Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can occur as a complication of Crohn's disease but not of ulcerative colitis since the small intestine is not involved in ulcerative colitis. SIBO can result when a partially obstructing small bowel stricture is present or when the natural barrier between the large and small intestines (ileocecal valve) has been surgically removed in Crohn's disease. Normally, the small bowel contains only few bacteria, while the colon has a tremendous number of resident bacteria. If a stricture is present or the ileocecal valve has been removed, bacteria from the colon gain access to the small bowel and multiply there. With SIBO, the bacteria in the small bowel begin to break down (digest) food higher up than normal in the GI tract. This ""'digestion'' produces ''gas'"" and other products that cause abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. In addition, the bacteria chemically alter the bile salts in the intestine. This alteration impairs the ability of the bile salts to transport fat. The resulting malabsorption of fat is another cause of diarrhea in Crohn's disease. (As previously mentioned, inflammation of the intestinal lining is the most common cause of diarrhea in patients with IBD.)""'SIBO can be diagnosed with a hydrogen breath test (HBT). In this test, the patient swallows a specified amount of glucose or another ''sugar'' called ''lactulose''. If bacteria have reproduced in the small bowel, the glucose or lactulose is metabolized by these bacteria, which causes the release of hydrogen in the breath. The amount of hydrogen in the breath is measured at specific time intervals after the ingestion of the ''sugar''. In a patient with SIBO, the hydrogen is eliminated into the breath sooner than the hydrogen that is produced by the normal bacteria in the colon. Accordingly, the detection of large amounts of hydrogen at an early interval in the testing indicates the possibility of SIBO. Another test, which may be more specific, uses a sugar called xylose. In this test, the swallowed xylose is tagged with a very small amount of radioactive carbon 14 (C14). The C14 is measured in the breath and interpreted by applying the same principles as used for hydrogen in the HBT.'' The best treatment for bacterial overgrowth is antibiotics for approximately 10 days using, for example, ''neomycin'', metronidazole, or ciprofloxacin. After this treatment, the breath test may be repeated to confirm that the bacterial overgrowth has been eliminated. SIBO may recur, however, if the stricture itself is not treated, or if the bacterial overgrowth is due to the surgical removal of the ileocecalvalve.' "
Does colon cancer occur in IBD?,"""The risk of developing colon cancer is 20 times higher for patients with IBD than it is for the general population. The association with colon cancer is more clearly established in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease. An increased risk most likely also exists, however, for patients with Crohn's disease that affects the colon. In ulcerative colitis, the risk of acquiring colon cancer increases according to how much of the colon is involved and the duration of colitis. Thus, after about 8 to 10 years of ulcerative colitis, especially if the entire colon is involved, the risk of developing colon cancersubstantially increases. Other risk factors for colon cancer in IBD patients include a ""'liver disease'' called ''primary sclerosing cholangitis'' (''PSC''), a family history of colon cancer, and a history of ''liver'' transplantation. Additional possible risk factors include the use of concurrent immunosuppressive medications and a deficiency of the vitamin, ''folic acid''.''The way in which colon cancer develops in IBD patients is thought to be different from the way in which it develops in other people. In individuals without IBD, usually a benign (not malignant) polyp initially forms in the colon. Then, depending on the type of polyp and the genetic ''makeup'' of the patient, the polyp may eventually become cancerous. In IBD, the constant processof inflammatory injury and repair of the lining of the colon (colonic mucosa) isbelieved to make the individual more susceptible to the cancer. The idea is that the mucosal cells are dividing so rapidly that they are liable to make mistakes in their DNA (mutations). These mutated cells can then become pre-cancerous (dysplastic) cells, which later can turn into cancer.''Additionally, pre-cancerous cells in IBD develop in ways other than in a polyp. In fact, pre-cancerous cells can develop in tissue that appears completely normal or exhibits only mild irregularities. For this reason, a colon cancer may not be discovered in IBDpatients until the cancer has progressed to a later stage. In later stages, thecancer can invade tissues beyond the colon or spread (''metastasize'') to otherparts of the body.'""As already mentioned, patients with IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, have an increasedrisk of developing colon cancer. Performing a colectomy (removal of the colon)before the cancer develops in these patients is a sure way to prevent coloncancer. Actually, the concept is to remove the pre-cancerous cells (dysplasia)in the colon before they can turn into cancer. Accordingly, inspection for dysplasia and cancer by yearly colonoscopies with multiple colonic biopsies isrecommended for patients with ulcerative colitis. The monitoring is suggested to begin after thepatient has had ulcerative colitis for 8 to10 years. Many physicians recommend a similarmonitoring program for Crohn's disease patients who have inflammation of the colon (colitis),even though the association with colon cancer is less well established in Crohn's disease.Remember that ulcerative colitis involves only the colon, whereas Crohn's disease, which involves the smallbowel, colon, or both, often does not affect the colon.""'Colonoscopy clearly is the best method for monitoring colon cancer. An otherwise negative colonoscopy in ulcerative colitis, however, does not guarantee that the colon is free of cancer orpre-cancerous cells. The reason for this is that the multiple biopsies that aredone during the colonoscopy still make up only a tiny percentage of the entire lining of the colon. However, if pre-cancerous cells are found on a microscopic examination of the biopsies, a colectomy (surgical removal of the colon) may be recommended to prevent cancer from developing. One caution here is that the diagnosis of dysplasia should be made only in the absence of concurrent, active, inflammation of the colon. This is due to the fact that inflammation sometimes can mimic the microscopic appearance of dysplasia.'""In patients with Crohn's disease, there is an increased risk of developing ""'lymphoma'' oradenocarcinoma of the small intestine. Since the small intestine is not involved in ulcerative colitis, there is no increased risk of this cancer in ulcerative colitis patients. Even though there is a higher risk of these ''cancers'"" in Crohn's disease, the percentage of patients actually contracting them is very small. Still, certain conditions predispose Crohn's disease patients to an even higher cancer risk. These conditions include bypassed segments of the bowel and chronic fissures, fistulas, or strictures. Even so,routine monitoring for small bowel cancer in Crohn's disease patients by X-ray or enteroscopy is not currently recommended because these diagnostic procedures are difficult, time-consuming, and not very effective for this purpose. If however, after many years of Crohn's disease, the disease suddenly changes its course or becomes difficult to treat, the possibility of a small bowel cancer should be investigated."" "
What should be done about polyps in IBD?,"'Not all polyps that are found in IBD patients are pre-cancerous or cancerous.Some polyps form as a result of the inflammatory and healing processes. These polyps are called inflammatory polyps or pseudopolyps, and they do not turn into cancer. The only way to make sure that polyps do not have pre-cancerous or cancerous cells, however, is to remove (biopsy) and examine them under the microscope.' "
What is toxic megacolon and what are its causes and symptoms?,"'Toxic megacolon is a widened (dilated) segment of the colon in a patient withsevere inflammation of the colon (colitis). The megacolon develops when thelining of the colon is so inflamed that the colon loses its ability to contractproperly. When this happens, the propelling (peristaltic) contractions areunable to move the ''intestinal gas'' along through the colon. The colon, therefore, accumulates excessive amounts of gas. The gas then increases the pressure on thebowel wall, which causes the colon to dilate.''Patients with toxic megacolon usually are very ill, with abdominal pain, bloating (distention), and ''fever''. Thedilated colon can allow bacteria to leak through the bowel wall into the bloodstream (septicemia). With continuing dilation, the inflamed colonic wall becomesat high risk for bursting (perforating) and causing inflammation of the abdominal ''cavity'' (peritonitis). Both septicemia and peritonitis are serious infections, which, in some cases, can even lead to death.'""Toxic megacolon typically occurs when inflammation of the colon is severe. This complication, however, does not occur exclusively in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Thus, a toxic megacolon can develop in other types of colitis, such as amebiasis or bacillary dysentery (""'shigella''). Narcotics, ''codeine'', or anti-diarrheal medications such asdiphenoxylate (Lomotil) or ''loperamide'' (Imodium) can decrease the contractions ofthe colon and allow excessive gas to accumulate. These medications, therefore, predispose to the development of toxic megacolon and should be avoided during severe episodes (flares) of colitis.' "
What kind of malabsorption occurs in IBD?,"""Malabsorption means abnormal intestinal absorption. Crohn's disease usually affects the small intestine, which is the part of the gut that absorbs most nutrients.Remember that Crohn's disease involves the small bowel and/or the colon, while ulcerative colitis involves only the colon. Crohn's disease of the upper part (duodenum) and middle part (jejunum) of the small intestine may interfere with the absorption of proteins, sugars, iron,""'vitamins'', and ''fats'"". This widespread malabsorption in Crohn's disease, which does not occur in ulcerative colitis, may lead to ""'weight loss'"" and malnutrition. In addition, some unabsorbed nutrients can cause the small or large intestine to secrete increased amounts of liquid, which worsens the diarrhea in Crohn's disease. (As previously mentioned, diarrhea is the most common symptom in patients with IBD, with or without the intestinal complications.) The lower end (ileum) of the small intestine is the part of the bowel most commonly involved in Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, however, the function of the ileum is normal. When the ileum is involved in patients with Crohn's disease (or surgically removed),a decreased absorption of vitamin B12 may occur. If a deficiency of B12 develops, a particular type of ""'anemia'' called ''pernicious anemia'' can result.''The ileum is also the major area for intestinal absorption of bile acids. The bile acids are compounds that are secreted in the bile by the liver into the duodenum. The major function of bile acids is to help transport and absorb fats,mostly in the jejunum. Bile acids that are not absorbed by a diseased or removed ileum pass into the colon. The bile acids then induce the colon to secrete liquid, which aggravates the diarrhea. If the bile acids are not sufficiently absorbed in the colon and consequently become deficient, fat malabsorption and more diarrhea can result.'""Extensive Crohn's disease, usually involving the surgical removal of several intestinal segments over the years, can lead to a debilitating condition known as short bowel syndrome. In this condition, the patients hav emany of the intestinal complications of Crohn's disease, including severe malabsorption. They can also suffer from the previously mentioned complications not directly affecting the intestinal tract (extraintestinal). Additionally, these patients frequently have certain other extraintestinal complications, such asosteoporosis (thin or porous bones), osteomalacia (soft bones), ""'gallstones'', and ''kidney stones''.''The treatment of malabsorption in patients with IBD includes medications to treat the underlying intestinal inflammation. Decreasing the inflammation can improve the intestinal absorption of the nutrients that were malabsorbed. The malabsorption or deficiency of B12 may need to be treated by administering the vitamin in the vein or into the muscle. Diarrhea that is induced by bile acid scan be treated with ''cholestyramine'', a compound that works by binding the bile acids.''Supplemental calories and nutrients may be administered as special liquid diets. These so-called elemental diets are composed of proteins, carbohydrates,''vitamins'', and fats that are broken down into smaller particles that are easier for the intestine to absorb. Unfortunately, however, these diets often do not smell or taste very good. Nevertheless, they can be administered through a small tube inserted through the nose (enteral feeding). For patients who are unable to tolerate any food or liquid by mouth or by enteral feeding, ''nutrition'"" may need to be given solely through the veins (total parenteral nutrition). Finally, a small bowel transplant can now be done for patients with severe Crohn's disease or otherwise unmanageable short bowel syndrome."" "
What Is Ulcerative Colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' is a chronic (long-term) inflammatory disease. It affects the lining of the ''large intestine'', or colon, and rectum. The rectum is the last section of the colon and is located just above the anus. People with ''ulcerative colitis'' have tiny ulcers and abscesses in their colon and rectum. These flare up periodically and cause bloody stools and ''diarrhea''. ''Ulcerative colitis'' may also cause severe ''abdominal pain'' and ''anemia''. ''Anemia'' is marked by low levels of healthy ''red blood cells''.''Ulcerative ''colitis'' has alternating periods of flare-ups and remission. During remission the disease seems to have disappeared. The periods of remission can last from weeks to years.''The inflammation usually begins in the rectum. It then spreads to other segments of the colon. How much of the colon is affected varies from person to person. If the inflammation is limited to the rectum, the disease is called ulcerative proctitis.' "
"How Is Ulcerative Colitis Diagnosed?
","'Ulcerative colitis'' closely resembles '""Crohn's disease"""". Crohn's is another ""'inflammatory bowel disease''. Often the only thing that distinguishes ''ulcerative colitis'"" is that it affects only the colon. Crohn's may affect any part of the ""'digestive system'', including the mouth. '""Crohn's disease""' also is particularly destructive to the small intestine, known as the ileum.''A doctor may order several different types of tests when considering ''ulcerative colitis'' as a diagnosis. These include:' Blood tests Stool sample tests Imaging tests, such as a CT scan Colonoscopy Sigmoidoscopy 
	Pill camera"
"How Common Is Surgery for Ulcerative Colitis?
","'About 25% to 40% of people with ulcerative ''colitis'' will have to have surgery to remove their colons. The reasons that surgery becomes necessary include:''In some cases, surgery to remove the colon is recommended if other treatments do not work or if the side effects of medications are harming the patient.' Medical treatment -- for instance, drug therapy -- fails to provide results. There may be a risk of cancer without surgery. The colon has ruptured. The patient experiences a severe, sudden onset of the disease. There is extensive bleeding. Treatment causes side effects severe enough to compromise the patient's health. Toxic megacolon has set in. In this dangerous condition, the muscles of the large intestine are dilated, and the colon can rupture."
What Types of Surgery Can Treat Ulcerative Colitis?,"'Surgery to remove the entire colon is called a colectomy. Surgery to remove both the colon and rectum is a proctocolectomy. Both can be used to treat ulcerative colitis. These surgeries are also performed to eliminate the threat of ''colon cancer''. Colon ''cancer'' is common in people with ulcerative colitis. Proctocolectomy is considered the standard treatment when surgery for ulcerative colitis is needed.''If the entire colon is removed, the surgeon may create an opening, or ''stoma'', in the abdominal wall. The tip of the lower small intestine is brought through the stoma. An external bag, or pouch, is attached to the stoma. This is called a permanent ileostomy. Stools pass through this opening and collect in the pouch. The pouch must be worn at all times.''Another procedure is the pelvic pouch or ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). This is a procedure that does not require a permanent stoma. This surgery is also called a restorative proctocolectomy. The patient is still able to eliminate ''stool'' through the anus. In this procedure, the colon and rectum are removed. Then the small intestine is used to form an internal pouch or reservoir -- called a J-pouch -- that will serve as a new rectum. This pouch is connected to the anus. This procedure is frequently done in two operations. In between the operations the patient needs a temporary ileostomy.''The ''continent ileostomy'"", or Kock pouch, is an option for people who would like their ileostomy converted to an internal pouch. It's also an option for people who do not qualify for the IPAA procedure. In this procedure, there is a stoma but no bag. The colon and rectum are removed, and an internal reservoir is created from the small intestine. An opening is made in the abdominal wall, and the reservoir is then joined to the skin with a ""'nipple'"" valve. To drain the pouch, the patient inserts a catheter through the valve into the internal reservoir. This procedure, however, is not the preferred surgical treatment for ulcerative patients. That's because of its uncertain results and the potential need for additional surgery."" "
What Are the Benefits of Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries?,"'If the entire colon is removed, ulcerative colitis is cured. This should put an end to the ''diarrhea'', ''abdominal pains'', ''anemia'', and other symptoms.''In addition, the surgical procedures prevent colon ''cancer''. Overall, an estimated 5% of ulcerative colitis patients will develop ''cancer''. The elimination of the ''colon cancer'' threat is especially significant for people who have ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon. In these cases, as opposed to cases of ulcerative colitis that affects only the lower colon and the rectum, the ''cancer'' risk without surgery could be up to 32 times the normal rate.' "
"What Are the Complications of Ulcerative Colitis Surgeries?
","'Complications from ileoanal anastomosis may include:''WebMD Medical Reference' More frequent and more watery bowel movements Inflammation of the pouch (pouchitis) Blockage of the intestine (bowel obstruction) from internal scar tissue, called 
	adhesions, caused by surgery Pouch failure, which happens in about 8% to 10% of patients with IPAA If the pouch fails, the patient will need to have a permanent ileostomy."
Electron Beam (Ultrafast) CT (EBCT) Introduction,"'EBCT, also called calcium-score screening ''heart'' scan, is a test used to detect calcium deposits found in ''atherosclerotic'' plaque in the coronary arteries of ''heart disease'' patients. State-of-the-art ''computerized tomography'' (CT) methods, such as this one, are the most effective way to detect coronary calcification from ''atherosclerosis'', before symptoms develop. More coronary calcium means more ''coronary atherosclerosis'', suggesting a greater likelihood of significant narrowing somewhere in the coronary system and a higher risk of future cardiovascular problems.''Your doctor uses the calcium-score screening heart scan to evaluate risk for future ''coronary artery disease''.''Because there are certain forms of coronary disease, such as ""soft plaque"" atherosclerosis, that escape detection during this ''CT scan'', it is important to remember that this test is not absolute in predicting your risk for a life-threatening event, such as a ''heart attack''.''Your doctor may also order a coronary CT ''angiogram'' (CTA) to look directly at the arteries of the heart. With the CTA, pictures of your coronary arteries are made.  This is regularly performed in addition to a heart CT scan now.' "
How Should I Prepare for a Heart CT Scan?,"'You may continue to take any medications but should avoid ''caffeine'' and ''smoking'' for four hours before the test. CT scanners use ''X-rays''. For your safety, the amount of ''radiation'' exposure is kept to a minimum. But, because X-rays can harm a developing fetus, this procedure is not recommended if you are ''pregnant''. Tell your technologist and your doctor if you are:' Pregnant. Undergoing radiation therapy."
What Can I Expect During a Heart CT Scan?,"'During the CT scan of your heart:' You will change into a hospital gown. The nurse will record your height, weight, and blood pressure. He or she may draw your blood for a lipid analysis. You will lie on a special scanning table. The technologist will clean three small areas of your chest and place small, sticky electrode patches on these areas. Men may expect to have their chest partially shaved to help the electrodes stick. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph (ECG) monitor, which charts your heart's electrical activity during the test. You may also be given an injection of a contrast material to help the CT scanner directly visualize your coronary arteries. During the scan, you will feel the table move inside a donut-shaped scanner. The high-speed CT scan captures multiple images, synchronized with your heartbeat. A sophisticated computer program, guided by the cardiovascular radiologist, analyzes the images for presence of calcification within the coronary arteries. Absence of calcium is considered a ""negative"" exam. But, it does not exclude the presence of ""soft"" noncalcified plaque. If calcium is present, the computer will create a calcium ""score"" that estimates the extent of coronary artery disease. The calcium-score screening heart scan takes only a few minutes."
What Happens After a Heart CT Scan?,"'You may continue all normal activities and eat as usual after the heart CT scan.''The results of the scan will be reviewed. The following information will be obtained:''Your heart CT scan results will be examined and reviewed by a team of cardiovascular specialists, including a cardiovascular radiologist and a preventive cardiologist. The team will evaluate the calcium score and/or your CT angiogram, along with other risk factor measurements (risk factor evaluation, blood pressure, lipid analysis), to determine your risk for future coronary artery disease and will make recommendations regarding your lifestyle, medications, or additional cardiac testing.''You and your primary care doctor will receive the full report outlining your risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the calcium-score screening heart scan.' The number and density of calcified coronary plaques in the coronary arteries. Calcium score."
Is the Heart CT Scan Covered by Insurance?,"'Because this CT scan is a screening examination, it is not currently covered under most insurance companies and Medicare. Therefore, you will likely be responsible for all involved costs at the time of the exam. The examination cost is about $350.00 and includes all lab, technical, medical and professional interpretation charges.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is an ultrasound?,"""While the patient's history and physical examination are the initial steps of making a medical diagnosis, the ability to peer inside the body can be a powerful tool. Ultrasound is an imaging technique that provides that ability to medical practitioners.""'Ultrasound produces sound waves that are beamed into the body causing return echoes that are recorded to ""visualize"" structures beneath the skin. The ability to measure different echoes reflected from a variety of tissues allows a shadow picture to be constructed. The technology is especially accurate at seeing the interface between solid and fluid filled spaces. These are actually the same principles that allow SONAR on boats to see the bottom of the ocean.'  "
What is ultrasonography?,"'Ultrasonography is a form of body imaging using sound waves to facilitate makeing a medical diagnosis. A skilled ultrasound technician is able to see inside the body using ultrasonography to answer questions that may be asked by the medical practitioner caring for the patient. Usually, a radiologist will oversee the ultrasound test and report on the results, but other types of physicians may also use ultrasound as a diagnostic tool. For example, obstetricians use ultrasound to assess the fetus during ''pregnancy''. Surgeons and emergency physicians use ultrasound at the bedside to assess ''abdominal pain'' or other concerns.''A transducer, or probe, is used to project and receive the sound waves and their echoes. A gel is wiped onto the patient\'s skin so that the sound waves are not distorted as they cross through the skin. Using their understanding of human anatomy and the machine, the technician can evaluate specific structures and try to answer the question asked by the patient\'s physician. This may take a fair amount of time and require the probe to be repositioned and pointed in different directions. As well, the technician may need to vary the amount of pressure used to push the probe into the skin. The goal will be to ""paint"" a shadow picture of the inner organ that the health care practitioner has asked to be visualized.''The physics of sound can place limits on the test. The quality of the picture depends on many factors.''Ultrasound can be enhanced by using Doppler technology which can measure whether an object is moving towards or away from the probe. This can allow the technician to measure blood flow in organs such as the ''heart'' or ''liver'', or within specific blood vessels.' Sound waves cannot penetrate deeply, and an obese patient may be imaged poorly. Ultrasound does poorly when gas is present between the probe and the target organ. Should the intestine be distended with bowel gas, organs behind it may not be easily seen. Similarly, ultrasound works poorly in the chest, where the lungs are filled with air. Ultrasound does not penetrate bone easily. The accuracy of the test is very much operator dependent. This means that the key to a good test is the ultrasound technician."
For what purposes are ultrasounds used?,"'Ultrasound is not limited to diagnosis, but can also be used in screening for disease and to aid in treatment of diseases or conditions. ' "
Diagnostic uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound is routinely used for assessing the progression of a pregnancy. Pelvic ultrasounds can be obtained trans-abdominally where the probe is placed on the abdominal wall, or trans-vaginally, where the probe is placed in the vagina. For example ultrasound in obstetrics/gynecology is used to diagnose growths or tumors of the ovary, uterus, or, Fallopian tubes.''Echocardiography'"" (echo=sound + cardio=heart + graphy=study) evaluates the heart, the heart valve's motion, and blood flow through them. It also evaluates the heart wall motion and the amount of blood the heart pumps with each ""'stroke''.''Echocardiography can be performed in two ways:''Anatomically, the esophagus sits near the heart and allows clearer images. However, this approach is a little more invasive.''Different groups of illnesses can be assessed by echocardiography:''Ultrasound can detect blood clots in veins (superficial or deep venous thrombosis) or artery blockage (stenosis) and dilatation (aneurysms). Some examples of ultrasound testing include:''Aside from its use in obstetrics, ultrasound can evaluate most of the solid structures in the abdominal ''cavity''. This includes the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, bladder, prostate, testicles, uterus, and ovaries.''The thyroid gland can be imaged using ultrasound looking for nodules, growths, or tumors.''Ultrasound can be used to detect bulging of fluid from a swollen ''knee joint'' into the back of the knee, called a '""Baker's cyst""'.'   trans-thoracic: the probe is place on the chest wall to obtain images, and trans-esophageal: where the probe is placed through the mouth into the esophagus. Valves in the heart keep blood flowing in one direction when the heart pumps. For example, when the heart beats, blood is pumped from the left ventricle through the aortic valve into the aorta and the rest of the body. The aortic valve prevents blood from back-flowing into the heart as it fills for the next beat. Echocardiography can determine if the valve is narrow or leaking (regurgitating, insufficient). By following how the patient fares clinically, repeated echocardiograms can help determine whether valve replacement or repair is warranted. The same principles apply to the mitral valve which keeps blood flowing from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The heart muscle pumps blood to the body. If the heart weakens, the amount of blood it pumps with each beat can decrease, leading to congestive heart failure. The echocardiogram can measure the efficiency of the heart beat and how much blood it pumps; which assists in determining whether medications are needed. It also is used to monitor how well medications are working. Echocardiography can visualize the heart chambers to detect blood clots in conditions such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm). In other situations, the test can help diagnose endocarditis (an infection of the heart valves) by visualizing ""vegetations"" (an infected mass) on the valves themselves. Echocardiography also can detect abnormal fluid collections (pericardial effusions) in the pericardium. Echocardiograms are used to diagnose and monitor pulmonary artery hypertension. Carotid ultrasound is performed in patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes to determine whether the major arteries in the neck are blocked causing the decreased blood supply to the brain. The aorta is the large blood vessel leaving the heart that supplies blood to the rest of the body. The walls of the aorta are under significant pressure from the force of the heartbeat and over time, may weaken and widen. This is called an aneurysm, and it can be detected in the abdomen by ultrasound (abdominal aortic aneurysm). For those patients with small aneurysm, observation may be recommended and the aneurysms size followed over time by repeated tests. Veins can also be evaluated by ultrasound and it is a common test to assess whether swelling in a leg is due to a blood clot, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or another cause. Ultrasound is the preferred technique to test for gallstones or an infected gallbladder. The ultrasound can reveal the stones as well as signs of infection, including thickening of the gallbladder wall and fluid surrounding the gallbladder. The ultrasound may find blockage in the bile ducts. For those patients where the radiation of a CT scan (computerized tomography) is a potential risk (pregnant patients or children), ultrasound may be used to look for diseases like appendicitis or kidney stones. Ultrasound is the test of choice to diagnose testicular torsion. Pelvic ultrasound is used in gynecology to help assess non-pregnancy related issues like lower abdominal pain, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, uterine growths, and endometriosis."
Screening uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound may be used to screen for blood vessel diseases. By measuring blood flow and blockage in the carotid arteries, the test can predict potential risk for future ''stroke''. Similarly, by measuring the diameter of the aorta in the abdomen, ultrasound can screen for aneurysm (abnormal dilatation) and the risk of rupture. These tests may be indicated for an individual patient or they may be offered as a community wide health screening assessment.' "
Therapeutic uses for ultrasound,"'Ultrasound may be used to help physicians guide needles into the body.''In situations where an intravenous line is required but it is difficult to find a vein, ultrasound guidance may be used to identify larger veins in the neck, chest wall, or groin.''Ultrasound may be used to guide a needle into a ''cavity'' that needs to be drained (for example, an ''abscess'') or a mass that needs to be biopsied, where a small bit of tissue is removed for analysis.' "
What are the risks of ultrasound?,"""There are no known risks to ultrasound, and as technology has improved, the machines have become smaller, portable and available for use at the patient's bedside. "" "
How do patients prepare for an ultrasound?,"'Preparation for ultrasound is minimal. Generally, if internal organs such as the gallbladder are to be examined, patients are requested to avoid eating and drinking with the exception of water for six to eight hours prior to the examination. This is because food causes gallbladder contraction, minimizing the size, which would be visible during the ultrasound.''In preparation for examination of the baby and womb during pregnancy, sometimes it is recommended that mothers drink at least four to six glasses of water approximately one to two hours prior to the examination for the purpose of filling the bladder. This helps improve the images captured during the exam.' "
How are the results of ultrasound interpreted and communicated to the physician?,"'The ultrasound is generally performed by a technician. The technician will notice preliminary structures and may point out several of these structures during the examination. The official reading of the ultrasound is done by a radiologist, a physician who is an expert at interpreting ultrasound images. The radiologist records the interpretation and transmits it to the practitioner requesting the test.

What is prenatal ultrasound?,"'Like other ''ultrasound'' examinations, ''prenatal'' or fetal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to obtain images of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac in a ''pregnant'' woman. The test does not involve ''radiation'' and is completely safe for both mother and baby. An ultrasound examination is also known as a ''sonogram''. The entire procedure can be performed in 30 minutes or less.\xa0Two types of ultrasound exams are used in ''pregnancy''.''Two types of ultrasound exams are used in pregnancy. The most common is a transabdominal ultrasound, in which the measuring instrument (transducer) is moved over the surface of the abdomen after a gel has been applied. Sometimes a full bladder is required to obtain better images, so you may be asked to drink several glasses of water before the test. There is no ''pain'"" or discomfort associated with the test, and it can be performed in the doctor's office.""""Transvaginal ultrasound uses a probe that is inserted directly into the vagina. It is performed in the doctor's office similar to a pelvic examination.

In early pregnancy this examination can provide more accurate information then a transabdominal examination.""  Transabdominal ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound"
Why is prenatal ultrasound performed?,"'As mentioned above, transvaginal ultrasound is most often used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out problems or to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. Most pregnant women receive a transabdominal ultrasound around the 20th week of pregnancy. This exam confirms that the baby is growing normally and that the placenta is attached normally. The heartbeat of the fetus is visible, and the movement of the fetus can be observed. Major ''birth defects'' can be visualized by this method, as well. In most cases, it is possible to determine the sex of the baby through an ultrasound exam at 20 weeks, but this method is not 100% accurate. You can tell the examiner whether or not you wish to know the gender of your baby at the time of the examination.''Ultrasound may also be performed earlier or later in the pregnancy for specific reasons that include:' Determination of multiple gestation Ensuring the health of the baby and 
monitoring its growth Determining the location of the 
placenta Estimation of gestational age and due 
date Assessing the expected size and weight 
of the baby Determining the amount of amniotic 
fluid Determining the position of the baby"
What are 3D and 4D ultrasound?,"'A 3D ultrasound provides a particularly clear image that resembles a photograph. A so-called 4D ultrasound provides this image in real time. Sometimes these ultrasound images are offered by non-medical providers in stores or other locations. Medical authorities, including The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Food and Drug Administration do not recommend using these services because the examiners may not have received proper training and could provide inaccurate information.' "
Are there risks associated with prenatal ultrasound?,"'As mentioned before, there is no radiation exposure during a prenatal ultrasound. Ultrasound exams have been used for many years, and studies have never shown any harms associated with the procedure, either on a short- or long-term basis.' "
What is an echocardiogram? What is the definition of echocardiogram?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump that circulates blood throughout the body. The anatomy includes four chambers and four valves. For the heart to function normally these structures need to be intact and the heart muscle needs to beat in a coordinated fashion, so that blood flows in and out of each chamber in the proper direction.''An echocardiogram (echo=sound + card=heart + gram=drawing) is an ''ultrasound'' test that can evaluate the structures of the heart, as well as the direction of blood flow within it. Technicians specially trained in ''echocardiography'' produce the images and videos, often using a special probe or transducer that is placed in various places on the chest wall, to view the heart from different directions. Cardiologists, or heart specialists, are trained to evaluate these images to assess ''heart function'' and provide a report of the results.The echocardiogram is just one of the many tests that can be done to evaluate heart anatomy and function.''An ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'', ''ECG'') is the most common heart tracing done. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall and collect information about the electrical activity of the heart. Aside from the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat, the EKG can provide indirect evidence of blood flow within arteries to heart muscle and the thickness of heart muscle.''Cardiac catheterization'' is an invasive test performed by a cardiologist, where a catheter is threaded into the coronary arteries (those arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood) through the femoral artery in the groin, the radial artery in the wrist, or the brachial artery in the elbow. Dye is injected into the coronary arteries looking for blockage. In some instances, the blockage can be corrected by ''balloon angioplasty'' where a balloon is inflated at the level of blockage, re-establishing blood flow. A ''stent'' can be used to keep the artery open. This test can also assess the size and function of the heart chambers and valves, and the major arteries and veins that enter and leave the heart.' "
What are the different types of echocardiograms?,"   Transthoracic echocardiogram: In the transthoracic echocardiogram procedure, the echocardiographer places the transducer, or probe, on the chest wall and bounces sound waves off the structures of the heart. The return signals are received by the same transducer and converted by a computer into the images seen on the screen. Transesophageal echocardiogram: In some situations, a clearer view of the heart is required and instead of placing the transducer on the chest wall, a cardiologist will direct the probe through the mouth into the esophagus. The esophagus is located right next to the heart in the middle of the chest and the sound waves can travel to the heart without the interference of the ribs and muscles of the chest wall.This test usually requires intravenous medications to sedate the patient. Because of the sedation, monitors will also be used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the blood. This test usually requires intravenous medications to sedate the patient. Because of the sedation, monitors will also be used to measure blood pressure and oxygen levels in the blood. Doppler echocardiogram: In addition to sound waves bouncing off the solid structures of the heart, they also bounce off the red blood cells as they circulate through the heart chambers. Using Doppler technology, the echocardiogram can assess the speed and direction of blood flow, helping increase the amount and quality of information available from the test. The computer can add color to help the doctor appreciate that information. Color flow Doppler is routinely added to all echocardiogram studies and is the same technology used in weather reports. Stress echocardiogram: A stress echocardiogram helps uncover abnormalities in the function of the heart wall muscle. The patient may be asked to exercise by either walking on a treadmill or riding an exercise bicycle. The echocardiogram is performed before exercise as a baseline, and then immediately after the test. When coronary arteries narrow due to atherosclerotic heart disease, the heart muscle may not receive enough blood supply during exercise. During a stress echocardiogram, the areas of heart muscle not receiving enough blood flow may not squeeze as well as other parts of the heart, and will appear to have motion abnormality. This can indirectly indicate narrowing, or stenosis, of the coronary arteries. This can cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or you may have no symptoms. For a stress echocardiogram to be effectively interpreted, the exercise done needs to achieve certain minimum intensity. If the patient is unable to exercise adequately, medications can be injected intravenously to chemically make the heart respond as if exercise is occurring. Contrast may be injected into the patient's vein to help enhance the images and increase the information that is obtained. The contrast material (Optison, Density) are microscopic protein shells filled with gas bubbles. The decision to use contrast depends upon the patient's specific situation."
What is an echocardiogram used to diagnose?,"'The purpose of an echocardiogram is to assess the structure and function of the heart. It is recommended as a noninvasive procedure as part of assessing potential and established heart problems.''Regarding structure, the test can assess the general size of the heart, the size of the four heart chambers, and the appearance and function of the four heart valves. It can look at the two septa of the heart; the atrial septum separates the right and ''left atrium'' and the ventricular septum separates the right and left ventricles. It can also assess the pericardium (the sac that lines the heart) and the ''aorta''.''Regarding function, the echocardiogram can determine how the heart valves open and close. It can evaluate whether the heart muscle squeezes appropriately and how efficiently. Cardiac output measures how much blood the heart pumps. Ejection fraction measures what percent of blood within the heart is pumped out to the body with each heartbeat. It can also measure how well the heart relaxes in between beats, when the heart fills for the next pump.''Some heart issues that the echocardiogram can help evaluate include the following:'  Heart valve disorders: Stenosis (narrowed), insufficiency or regurgitation (leaking), and endocarditis (infection of the valves) Abnormalities of the septum: Atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent foramen ovale Wall motion abnormalities: Cardiomyopathy, atherosclerotic heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease), and trauma Diseases of the pericardium (the sac that lines the heart): This includes pericardial effusion (assessment of fluid in the pericardial sac)"
How should you prepare for an echocardiogram?,"'There is no preparation for a transthoracic echocardiogram.''When a transesophageal echocardiogram is performed, the patient usually requires some sedation to tolerate the procedure. The stomach should be empty to prevent ''vomiting'' and aspiration into the ''lungs''. For that reason, the patient should have nothing to eat or drink for many hours before the procedure. Due to the sedation, the patient will need a family member or friend to escort the patient home.''For a stress echocardiogram, the patient may need to walk on a treadmill or ride a bicycle. Comfortable shoes are recommended.'  "
What happens during an echocardiogram test?,"'An echocardiogram is an office or outpatient procedure. Electrodes are placed on the chest wall to monitor heart rate and rhythm. The lights in the room may be dimmed to help see the images on the computer monitor. If contrast is used, an intravenous line will need to be started.''In transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient\'s chest will need to be exposed. The technician will press the transducer or probe firmly on the chest wall to get the heart images. The patient may be asked to roll on their left side take deep breaths to help the probe better ""see"" the heart. The patient will be monitored because of the need for intravenous sedation. A heart monitor and oxygen monitor will be placed; supplemental oxygen is usually provided by prongs placed in the nose and an intravenous line will be started. Once sedated, the cardiologist will pass a tube, with the transducer on its tip, through the mouth and position it in the esophagus at a level near the heart. The patient may or may or remember the procedure because many of the sedative medicines have an amnestic effect; but once the patient is fully awake, they may be discharged home with an escort.' "
What are the potential risks of having an echocardiogram?,"'There are no risks associated with a transthoracic echocardiogram.''The risks of a transesophageal echocardiogram are due to the sedation required to perform the procedure or, very rarely, damage to the esophagus.' "
What will the results of an echocardiogram indicate?,"'The purpose of the echocardiogram is to assess the structure and function of the heart. The results will provide information that can help the health care professional make a diagnosis that involves the heart.''Echocardiograms may be repeated over time, monitoring heart function and the results may help decide whether previous treatment has been effective and whether any changes in that treatment program are required.'

What is hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism (overactive thyroid) is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces an abnormally low amount of thyroid hormone. Many disorders result in hypothyroidism, which may directly or indirectly involve the thyroid gland. Because thyroid hormone affects growth, development, and many cellular processes, inadequate thyroid hormone has widespread consequences for the body.'  "
What should I do if I have signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'If you have signs or symptoms the same or similar to hypothyroidism, discuss them (for example, weight gain, ''constipation'', or ''fatigue'') with your doctor or other healthcare professional. A simple blood test is the first step in the diagnosis. If you need treatment for hypothyroidism, let your doctor know of any concerns or questions you have about the available treatment, including home or natural remedies.' "
What is subclinical hypothyroidism?,"'Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to a state in which people do not have symptoms of hypothyroidism and have a normal amount of thyroid hormone in their blood. The only abnormality is an increased TSH on the person’s blood work. This implies that the pituitary gland is working extra hard to maintain a normal circulating thyroid hormone level and that the thyroid gland requires extra stimulation by the pituitary to produce adequate hormones. Most people with subclinical hypothyroidism can expect the disease to progress to obvious hypothyroidism, in which symptoms and signs occur.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'The symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. They are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to ''aging''. People with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. The symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. Common symptoms and signs include:'

What  are the symptoms of severe hypothyroidism? What is myxedema coma?,"'As hypothyroidism becomes more severe, signs and symptoms may include puffiness around the eyes, the ''heart'' rate slows, body temperature drops, and ''heart failure''.' Severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). In a person with severe hypothyroidism, a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness, surgery, stress, or traumatic injury. Myxedema coma requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection."
Where is the thyroid located? What are thyroid hormones?,"""Thyroid hormones are produced by the thyroid gland. This gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below Adam's apple. The gland wraps around the windpipe (trachea) and has a shape that is similar to a butterfly - formed by two wings (lobes) and attached by a middle part (isthmus).""'The thyroid gland uses iodine (mostly from foods in the ''diet'' like seafood, bread, and salt) to produce thyroid hormones. The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine or T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which account for 99% and 1% of thyroid hormones present in the blood respectively. However, the hormone with the most biological activity is T3. Once released from the thyroid gland into the blood, a large amount of T4 is converted as needed into T3 - the active hormone that affects the metabolism of cells.' "
What causes hypothyroidism?,"""Hypothyroidism is a very common condition. Approximately 3% to 4% of the U.S. population has some form of hypothyroidism. This type of thyroid disorder is more common in women than in men, and its incidence increases with age. Examples of common causes of hypothyroidism in adults include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune form of overactive thyroid, lymphocytic thyroiditis, which may occur after ""'hyperthyroidism'' (underactive thyroid), thyroid destruction from radioactive iodine or surgery, pituitary or hypothalamic disease, medications, and severe iodine deficiency.''The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an ''inherited'"" condition called Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This condition is named after Dr. Hakaru Hashimoto who first described it in 1912. In this condition, the thyroid gland is usually enlarged (goiter) and has a decreased ability to make thyroid hormones. Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system inappropriately attacks the thyroid tissue. In part, this condition is believed to have a genetic basis. This means that the tendency toward developing Hashimoto's thyroiditis can run in families. Hashimoto's is 5 to 10 times more common in women than in men.""'In areas of the world where there is an iodine deficiency in the diet, severe hypothyroidism occurs in about 5% to 15% of the population. Examples of these areas include Zaire, Ecuador, India, and Chile. Severe iodine deficiency occurs in remote mountain areas such as the Andes and the Himalayas. Since the addition of iodine to table salt and to bread, iodine deficiency is rare in the United States.''Thyroiditis refers to inflammation of the thyroid gland. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is a condition in which the inflammation is caused by a particular type of white blood cell known as a lymphocyte. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is particularly common after ''pregnancy'', and can affect up to 8% of women after they deliver their baby. In this type of thyroid disorder there usually is a hyperthyroid phase (in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormone leak out of the inflamed gland), which is followed by a hypothyroid phase that can last for up to six months. In the majority women with lymphocytic thyroiditis, the thyroid eventually returns to its normal function, but there is a possibility that the thyroid will remain underactive.''People who have been treated for hyperthyroidism (underactive thyroid) like '""Graves' disease""', and received radioactive iodine may be left with little or no functioning thyroid tissue after treatment. The likelihood of this depends on a number of factors including the dose of iodine given, along with the size and the activity of the thyroid gland. If there is no significant activity of the thyroid gland six months after the radioactive iodine treatment it usually means that the thyroid gland no longer functioning adequately. The result is hypothyroidism. Similarly, removal of the thyroid gland during surgery cause hypothyroidism.''If for some reason the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus are unable to signal the thyroid and instruct it to produce thyroid hormones, it may cause decreased T4 and T3 blood levels, even if the thyroid gland itself is normal. If pituitary disease causes this defect, the condition is called ""secondary hypothyroidism."" If the defect is due to hypothalamic disease, it is called ""tertiary hypothyroidism.""''A pituitary injury may result after brain surgery or the blood supply to the brain has decreased. When the pituitary gland is injured, hypothyroidism results in low TSH blood levels because the thyroid gland is no longer stimulated by the pituitary TSH. Usually, hypothyroidism from pituitary gland injury occurs in together with other hormone deficiencies, since the pituitary regulates other processes such as growth, reproduction, and adrenal function.''Medications that are used to treat an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) may cause hypothyroidism. These ''drugs'' include ''methimazole'' (''Tapazole'') and ''propylthiouracil'' (PTU). The psychiatric medication, ''lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid''), is also known to alter thyroid function and cause hypothyroidism. Interestingly, drugs containing a large amount of iodine such as ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), ''potassium iodide'"" (SSKI, Pima), and Lugol's solution can cause changes in thyroid function, which may result in low blood levels of thyroid hormone.""  "
Are there special foods or diets for hypothyroidism?,"'There is no special diet required for people with hypothyroidism. In the US, routine supplementation of salt, flour, and other foods with iodine has decreased the rates of hypothyroidism caused by an iodine deficiency.' "
What tests diagnose hypothyroidism?,"   People with symptoms of fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry, flaky skin may have hypothyroidism. A blood test can confirm the diagnosis. ""Secondary"" or ""tertiary"" hypothyroidism occurs when the decrease in thyroid hormone is due to a defect of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. A special test, known as the TRH test, can help distinguish if the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. This test requires an injection of the TRH hormone and is performed by a doctor that treats thyroid conditions (endocrinologist or hormone specialist). Blood work confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, but does not identify the cause. A combination of the patient's clinical history, antibody screening, and a thyroid scan can help diagnose the underlying thyroid problem more clearly. An MRI of the brain and other tests may be ordered if the cause is thought to be from pituitary gland or hypothalamic problems."
What is the treatment for hypothyroidism?,"'Hypothyroidism can be easily treated with thyroid hormone replacement. The preferred treatment for most people with an underactive thyroid is ''levothyroxine sodium'' (''Levoxyl'', ''Synthroid''). This is a more stable form of thyroid hormone and requires once a day dosing.''Liothyronine sodium'' (''Cytomel'') also may be prescribed to treat hypothyroidism under certain conditions.''With the exception of certain conditions, the treatment of hypothyroidism requires life-long therapy. However, over treating hypothyroidism with excessive thyroid medication is potentially harmful and can cause problems with heart ''palpitations'' and ''blood pressure'' control, and contribute to ''osteoporosis''.'  "
What happens if hypothyroidism goes untreated? What are the complications?,"'Untreated hypothyroidism can cause complications, for example, ''enlarged heart'' (''cardiomyopathy''), worsening ''congestive heart failure'', an accumulation of fluid around the ''lungs'' (''pleural effusion'').' "
What is excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)?,"'The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis, excessive sweat or excessive sweating, produces a lot of embarrassment and unhappiness. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no apparent cause. Secondary hyperhidrosis is much less common and can be due to certain ''drugs'', a variety of serious systemic diseases, neurological disorders, facial surgery, and ''anxiety''. Of the approximately 3% of Americans who suffer from excessive sweating, 50% involve the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis). Underarm problems tend to start around ''puberty'', while palm and sole sweating may begin earlier, often during childhood. Untreated, these problems may continue throughout life.''Sweating is embarrassing, stains clothes, and may complicate business and social interactions. Excessive sweat can have serious practical consequences, like making it difficult to hold tools, grip a steering wheel, or shake hands.'  "
What is the cause of excessive sweating?,"'Otherwise healthy people with excessive sweating have primary hyperhidrosis. Heat and emotions may trigger hyperhidrosis in some, but many who suffer from hyperhidrosis perspire nearly all the time, regardless of their mood or the weather.''Secondary hyperhidrosis can be caused by medications such as ''dopamine'' agonists, ''antidepressants'', antipsychotics, ''alcohol'', and ''insulin''. Systemic disorders such as ''diabetes mellitus'', ''hyperthyroidism'', '""Parkinson's""' disease, and tumors such as ''pheochromocytoma'' and ''lymphoma'' have been associated with secondary hyperhidrosis.'  "
What signs and symptoms accompany hyperhidrosis?,"'Generally, the only sign of excessive sweating is the presence of abundant moisture in the anatomical area affected. The presence of this moisture can predispose to skin infections.''As stated above, there are a number of conditions and diseases that produce secondary hyperhidrosis. Treating the underlying condition can help relieve at least some of the excessive sweating.''The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweat.''Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating ''skin conditions''. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hyperhidrosis?,"""The diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination. If the sweating is excessive and constant, then the diagnosis is obvious. It is not unusual that one must rely on the patient's history to determine the diagnosis. Research centers measure sweat production by comparing the weight of filter paper left on the skin for a specified interval before and after sweating.""'Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating skin conditions. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
What are medical treatment options for hyperhidrosis?,"'Through a systematic evaluation of causes and triggers of excessive sweating, followed by a judicious, stepwise approach to medical treatment, many people with this annoying disorder can achieve improved quality of life. The decision on initial treatment depends upon the severity of the condition and the anatomical areas that are affected.''The approach to treating hyperhidrosis generally proceeds as follows:''When regular antiperspirants fail, as they often do, to remedy hyperhidrosis, most doctors start by recommending aluminum chloride hexahydrate (''Drysol'', various generics), a prescription-strength version of aluminum chloride. It is applied just before bedtime seven to 10 nights in a row, then roughly once a week as a maintenance medication. The aluminum salts in this preparation collect in the sweat ducts of the patient and block them. Over time, the excessive ''perspiration'"" may diminish to such an extent that no further treatment is needed. This method works reasonably well for many patients whose problem is excessive underarm sweating, but it's not satisfactory for most of those with clammy palms and sweating of the soles of the ""'feet''.''The main side effect with aluminum chloride is irritation, which can sometimes, but not always, be overcome by reducing the frequency of use or applying anti-inflammatory medications such as lotions containing hydrocortisone.'""Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago to treat excessive sweating. Its exact mechanism of action is still unclear. The procedure uses water to conduct an electric current to the skin, which combats the production of sweat. The current is applied typically for 10-20 minutes per session, initially with two to three sessions per week followed by a maintenance program of treatments at one- to three-week intervals, depending upon the patient's response. Iontophoresis treatments sound painful but in fact are not.""""Patients purchase devices for this treatment through a doctor's prescription. There are three iontophoresis devices that are registered with and cleared by the U.S. FDA; the R.A. Fischer and the Hidrex USA devices require a prescription, whereas the Drionic device is available without a prescription. They work best on palms and soles but can be adapted for use in the underarms. Medical insurers sometimes cover the cost.""'Oral anticholinergic drugs such as ''glycopyrrolate'' (''Robinul''), ''oxybutynin'', and ''propantheline'' bromide can be quite effective for this condition, but they can produce side effects like ''dry mouth'', ''insomnia'', and ''blurred vision''. The dosage should be titrated carefully.''Topical anticholinergic pads''Recently, a new topical treatment using glycopyrronium tosylate impregnated gauze pads (Qbrexza) has received approval for the treatment of axillary (armpit) hyperhidrosis.''Botulinum toxin (Botox), a muscle poison much in the news as a cosmetic treatment for ''wrinkles'', has actually been used in many areas of medicine for some time, such as in the treatment of ''muscle spasms'' and certain types of ''headaches''. Its latest medical use is for treating excessive underarm sweating.''Botox is injected into tissues of the armpit or hand. The drug works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, which is the chemical that activates sweat glands. This may produce approximately six months of relief from sweating. The injections are uncomfortable, but use of a very small needle minimizes discomfort.''Now that this treatment option has received FDA approval, many health insurers are providing coverage for the injections and the Botox itself, which is quite costly.''Currently, the FDA has not approved Botox for treating sweating of the palms and soles of the feet, though some physicians are administering it as an off-label use, with some success. Drawbacks of using this treatment for the palms and soles are ''pain'', requiring ''nerve blocks'' to numb the hands in order to make the injections tolerable, and the potential for temporary muscle ''weakness''.'""These new techniques produce energy that presumably destroys sweat glands while preserving other tissues. Currently, only the armpits seem to be appropriate treatment sites. Treatments occur in a doctor's office and in recent studies have been accompanied by local swelling and irritation as well as a variety of other relatively minor side effects. Sweating seems to be significantly decreased for a time with these treatments. How these would be used in other anatomical areas aside from the armpits is not clear.""   Over-the-counter antiperspirants: Patients usually try home remedies like these first because they are readily available. Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride (for example, Certain-Dri) may be more effective when other antiperspirants have failed. So-called ""natural"" antiperspirants are often not very helpful for patients. Prescription-strength antiperspirants: those containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate Iontophoresis: a device that uses a direct current to drive ions into the sweat gland using tap water occasionally mixed with aluminum ions or other substances Oral medications: from the group of medications known as anticholinergics, which reduce sweating Topical medicated pads: pads impregnated with anticholinergic medications for use in the armpits Botox (botulinum toxin): approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating excessive axillary sweating Microwave destruction: a device destroys the sweat glands, purportedly causing minimal damage to other tissues Surgery: paraspinal sympathectomy, or interruption of certain nerve pathways, as a last resort"
Are there home remedies for hyperhidrosis?,"'Over-the-counter antiperspirants may be effective, but usually the patient has already tried these.' "
Can surgery treat hyperhidrosis? What are potential side effects of surgery for hyperhidrosis?,"'Localized axillary hyperhidrosis has been treated by surgical removal of a substantial portion of axillary skin. Another approach is the use of ''liposuction'' curettage, although how this effectively damages the dermal sweat glands is hard to visualize.''Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) refers to surgical interruption of the sympathetic nerves responsible for sweating. Sympathectomy is an operation intended to destroy part of the nerve supply to the sweat glands in the skin. The surgeon inserts a special endoscopic instrument into the chest between two ribs just below the armpit. The lung is briefly deflated to better visualize and destroy the nerves. Sympathectomy is both effective and risky. Even with newer endoscopic techniques, complications of the procedure can include compensatory, excessive sweating in other parts of the body as well as lung and nerve problems. As many of these complications are serious and not reversible, this option is rarely used, and then only as a last resort.'  "
Is it possible to prevent hyperhidrosis?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent hyperhidrosis.''Most hyperhidrosis patients can be effective and safely treated.' "

"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "
Where can you find men's urinary incontinence products?,"'Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet.'""If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help."" "
How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems.""'Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by.

What is ventilator management?,"'Intubation'' is a procedure performed when patients are unable to breathe themselves. It may be performed as a life-saving procedure in the emergency room (ER) or during the surgery when patients are under general anesthesia.\xa0''The doctor inserts a tube through the nose or mouth into the throat and trachea (windpipe). The tube facilitates air entry into and out of the ''lungs''. The tube is connected to a machine called a ventilator that pumps air containing an increased amount of oxygen.\xa0''The machine then helps in exhaling air containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The ventilator maintains normal oxygen and CO2 levels in the body. This is called mechanical ventilation. During mechanical ventilation, the cardiac function, ''blood pressure'', and oxygen saturation/levels in the body are monitored continuously.' "
What are the types of ventilator management?,"'Most ventilators can be set to apply the delivered tidal volume (the total volume of air that is inspired [breathed in] and expired in one cycle of ''breathing''/''respiration'') in a control or support mode.' Control mode: In the control mode, the ventilator delivers a preset tidal volume once it is triggered irrespective of the patient’s effort.  Support mode: In the support mode, the ventilator assists during inspiration with the help of an assist pressure. The ventilator detects inspiratory effort (breathing effort) by the patient and supplies an assist pressure during inspiration. The assist pressure is terminated when it detects expiration. The support mode requires the patient to have an adequate respiratory drive. "
When is mechanical ventilation done?,"'The main purpose of mechanical ventilation is to protect the ''airway'' and manage respiratory failure. Patients presenting with respiratory failure in the emergency room (ER) is usually a clinical diagnosis.''The decision to intubate and mechanically ventilate or use noninvasive ventilation support is typically made based on clinical assessment by the physician without delay for laboratory results.''It is also indicated for treating critical, life-threatening conditions, such as salicylate intoxication, major ''head injury'' with elevated intracranial pressure, or ''antidepressant'' toxicity.' "
What are ventilator graphics?,"'Ventilator graphics are an important part of treating patients who are on mechanical ventilation. Ventilator graphics help in understanding the pathophysiology in mechanically ventilated patients.\xa0''Patient-ventilator asynchrony is a common problem occurring in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation within the first 24 hours. The ventilator displays waveforms that help the physician to identify and manage any patient-ventilator asynchrony.\xa0''Graphical displays are common in the intensive care setting (ICU). These waveforms are studied and interpreted by the physician who monitors the patient, identifies abnormalities and treats them appropriately. The following are examples:''A mechanical breath is divided into four phases that help identify and correct asynchronies:''Mechanical breaths are typically initiated by the patient (patient trigger) or as a function of time (time trigger).\xa0''The presence of inappropriate flow and patterns during the inspiratory phase can be identified in the ventilator graphics. Flow may be inadequate or excessive, which can lead to patient-ventilator asynchrony (incoordination).''Cycling'' between breathing in and out is brought about by a drop in the flow rate and breath cycles. Other secondary cycling characteristics also are present as a safety precaution if the breath in time is unduly prolonged.''Shortened expiratory time may lead to auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which is caused by a progressively increasing accumulation of air (air trapping).' Ventilator waveforms Arterial waveforms Venous waveforms (central venous pressure [CVP]) Intracranial pressure waveforms Intra-aortic balloon pressure waveforms Trigger phase Inspiratory phase Cycle phase Expiratory phase Trigger phase"
What are the complications of mechanical ventilation?,'The common complications of mechanical ventilation include the following.''The ''heart'' and major blood vessels are present within the chest ''cavity''. They are subjected to increased pressure in the chest due to mechanical ventilation. This reduces cardiac function leading to ischemia (decreased oxygenation in the body).' Pulmonary (lung) complications Barotrauma (damage to the lungs due to pressure differences) may result in the following: Pneumomediastinum (air in the space between the two lungs) Pneumoperitoneum (presence of air in the abdomen) Pneumothorax (air in the space between the lungs and chest wall) Infection of the lungs Atelectasis (collapse of the lungs)
What is upper endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to examine the ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope with a camera on the tip through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.'  "
How do I prepare for endoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's ""'allergies''. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.'  "
Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.' "

Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.' "
What is an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series?,"'An upper gastrointestinal (GI) series (barium swallow), is a radiological test that is used to visualize the structures of the upper ''digestive system'' - the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. (If visualization of the remaining parts of the small intestine is necessary, a small bowel follow through\xa0 can be added to the test.) These structures are observed during the examination, and the images are also\xa0 saved for further review on X-ray film or as digital images. An upper GI series can reveal conditions such as ulcers, tumors, hiatal hernias, scarring, blockages, and abnormalities of the muscular wall of the gastrointestinal tissues.' "
What are the risks of an upper GI series?,"' Any x-ray test procedure involves some risk from ''radiation'' exposure. The radiation exposure is minimized by standard techniques that have been assigned and approved by national and international radiology committees and councils.  Radiology technicians are certified by national certifying boards.''Patients who are or may be pregnant should notify the requesting practitioner and radiology staff, as there is potential risk of harm to the fetus with any  radiation exposure.' "
"How does a patient prepare for an upper GI series, and how is it performed?","'A radiology technologist guides the patient through the upper GI series along with a radiologist (a physician trained in performing and interpreting ''x-rays''). Because an upper GI series involves interpreting images of the gastrointestinal system, it is important that any materials or objects internally or externally that could potentially interfere with interpretation of the X-ray film be avoided. Therefore, patients are requested not to eat or drink anything from four to eight hours before the procedure. Patients also are asked to remove their clothing and all metallic objects such as jewelry.''As barium passes through the digestive system, ''constipation'' can result, especially in patients prone to ''constipation''. Therefore, it generally is advisable that patients who undergo an upper GI series drink extra fluids after the test and consider a ''laxative'' to relieve the bowels of the barium if the barium is not eliminated completely within the next day or two. As it is passing in the ''stool'', barium has a whitish appearance that maybe apparent for several days after the test.'   A patient will be positioned behind X-ray equipment called a fluoroscope for X-ray exposure. The patient then is asked to swallow a liquid that contains barium. The barium fills and then coats the lining of the intestinal tract making the adjacent esophagus, stomach and duodenum visible. (X-rays of the stomach and intestine done without barium provide very little detail and information.) X-ray images are obtained at different angles through the chest and abdomen. The X-ray machine (fluoroscope) produces these images by sending X-ray radiation through the tissues of the body to a film on the opposite side of the patient's body. As the radiation penetrates the body, it is absorbed in varying amounts by different body tissues. Due to differences in their composition, the different organs and certain abnormalities and conditions all become visible on the X-ray film, by blocking the penetration of the X-ray beam to varying degrees. After development of the film, an image of the organs is revealed. The radiologist then examines the X-rays and can identify various normal and abnormal structures of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, further enhancement of the different structures can be obtained by having air as well as barium in the stomach. This is accomplished by swallowing baking soda crystals."
How does the patient obtain the results of the upper GI series?,"'After the radiology technician develops the X-ray film or digital image, it is transferred to the radiologist. This physician interprets the films. The radiologist then generates a report that is transmitted to the physician who requested the test. The radiologist and the practitioner often review the findings together. The practitioner can review the results of the upper GI series with the patient and can proceed with therapy or discuss whether other tests may be necessary.' "
What is an upper respiratory infection?,"'The upper respiratory tract includes the sinuses, nasal passages, pharynx, and larynx. These structures direct the air we breathe from the outside to the trachea and eventually to the ''lungs'' for ''respiration'' to take place.''An ''upper respiratory tract infection'', or upper ''respiratory infection'', is an infectious process of any of the components of the upper ''airway''.''Infection of the specific areas of the upper respiratory tract can be named specifically. Examples of these may include ''rhinitis'' (inflammation of the nasal ''cavity''), ''sinus infection'' (''sinusitis'' or rhinosinusitis) -- inflammation of the sinuses located around the nose, ''common cold'' (nasopharyngitis) -- inflammation of the nares, pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and ''tonsils'', ''pharyngitis'' (inflammation of the pharynx, uvula, and ''tonsils''), epiglottitis (inflammation of the upper portion of the larynx or the ''epiglottis''), ''laryngitis'' (inflammation of the larynx), laryngotracheitis (inflammation of the larynx and the trachea), and tracheitis (inflammation of the trachea).''Upper respiratory infections are one of the most frequent causes for a doctor visit with varying symptoms ranging from ''runny nose'', ''sore throat'', ''cough'', to ''breathing'' difficulty, and lethargy. In the United States, upper respiratory infections are the most common illness leading to missing school or work.''Although upper respiratory infections can happen at any time, they are most common in the fall and winter months, from September until March. This may be explained because these are the usual school months when children and adolescents spend a lot of time in groups and inside closed doors. Furthermore, many ''viruses'' of upper respiratory infection thrive in the low humidity of the winter.' "
Is an upper respiratory infection contagious?,"'A majority of upper respiratory infections are due to self-limited viral infections. Occasionally, ''bacterial infections'' may cause upper respiratory infections. Most often, upper respiratory infection is ''contagious'' and can spread from person to person by inhaling respiratory droplets from ''coughing'' or sneezing. The transmission of respiratory infections can also occur by touching the nose or mouth by hand or other object exposed to the virus.'  "
What are the causes of upper respiratory infection?,"'An URTI is generally caused by the direct invasion of the inner lining (mucosa or ''mucus'' membrane) of the upper ''airway'' by the culprit virus or bacteria. In order for the pathogens (viruses and bacteria) to invade the mucus membrane of the upper airways, they have to fight through several physical and immunologic barriers.''The hair in the lining of the nose acts as physical barrier and can potentially trap the invading organisms. Additionally, the wet mucus inside the nasal ''cavity'' can engulf the viruses and bacteria that enter the upper airways. There are also small hair-like structures (cilia) that line the trachea which constantly move any foreign invaders up towards the pharynx to be eventually swallowed into the digestive tract and into the stomach.''In addition to these intense physical barriers in the upper respiratory tract, the immune system also does its part to fight the invasion of the pathogens or microbes entering the upper airway. ''Adenoids'' and ''tonsils'' located in the upper respiratory tract are a part of the immune system that help fight infections. Through the actions of the specialized cells, antibodies, and chemicals within these ''lymph nodes'', invading microbes are engulfed within them and are eventually destroyed.'""Despite these defense processes, invading viruses and bacteria adapt various mechanisms to resist destruction. They can sometimes produce toxins to impair the body's defense system or change their shape or outer structural proteins to disguise from being recognized by the immune systems (change of antigenicity). Some bacteria may produce adhesion factors that allow them to stick to the mucus membrane and hinder their destruction.""""It is also important to note that different pathogens have varying ability to overcome the body's defense system and cause infections.""'Furthermore, different organisms require varying time of onset from when they enter the body to when symptoms occur (incubation time). Some of the common pathogens for upper respiratory infection and their respective incubation times are the following:' Thinoviruses, 1-5 days; Group A streptococci, 1-5 days; Influenza and parainfluenza viruses, 1-4 days; Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 7 days; Whooping cough (pertussis), 7-21 days; Diphtheria, 1-10 days; and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 4-6 weeks."
What are the symptoms of upper respiratory infection?,"'Generally, the symptoms of upper respiratory infection result from the toxins released by the pathogens as well as the inflammatory response mounted by the immune system to fight the infection.''Common symptoms of upper respiratory infection generally include:''Other less common symptoms may include''The symptoms of upper respiratory infection usually last between 3-14 days; if symptoms last longer than 14 days, an alternative diagnosis can be considered such as, ''sinusitis'', ''allergy'', ''pneumonia'', or ''bronchitis''.''Bacterial ''pharyngitis'' (''strep throat'' due to group A ''Streptococcus'') may be considered if symptoms continue to worsen after the first week in the absence of runny nose, ''cough'', or ''conjunctivitis''. Prompt testing and initiation of appropriate antibiotics is important due to the risk of developing ''rheumatic fever'', especially in children.''Epiglottitis is an upper respiratory infection in children that may have a more sudden onset of ''sore throat'', feeling of a lump in the throat, muffled voice, dry cough, very painful swallowing, and ''drooling''.''Respiratory infections in the lower part of the upper respiratory tract, such as, laryngotracheitis, are more commonly featured with dry cough and ''hoarseness'' or ''loss of voice''. Barking or ''whooping cough'', gagging, rib ''pain'' (from severe cough) are other symptoms and signs.'   nasal congestion, runny nose (rhinorrhea), nasal discharge (may change from clear to white to green) nasal breathing, sneezing, sore or scratchy throat, painful swallowing (odynophagia), cough (from laryngeal swelling and post nasal drip), malaise, and low-grade fever (more common in children). foul breath, reduced ability to smell (hyposmia), headache, shortness of breath, sinus pain, itchy and watery eye (conjunctivitis), nausea, vomiting diarrhea, and body aches."
What are the risk factors for upper respiratory infection?,"'Some common risk factors for upper respiratory infection are:' physical or close contact with someone with a upper respiratory infection; poor hand washing after contact with an individual with upper respiratory infection; close contact with children in a group setting, schools or daycare centers; contact with groups of individuals in a closed setting, such as, traveling, tours, cruises; smoking or second-hand smoking (may impair mucosal resistance and destroy the cilia); health care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes; immunocompromised state (compromised immune system) such as, HIV, organ transplant, congenital immune defects, long term steroid use; and anatomical abnormalities as in facial trauma, upper airway trauma, nasal polyps."
When should you seek medical care for a respiratory tract infection?,"'Most people tend to diagnose and treat their symptoms at home without seeking professional medical care. A great majority of cases of upper respiratory infection are caused by viruses and are self-limited, meaning they resolve on their own spontaneously.''Visiting a doctor may be advisable if:''Sometimes hospitalization may be necessary if upper respiratory infection is severe and causes significant ''dehydration'', respiratory difficulty with poor oxygenation (''hypoxia''), significant ''confusion'', lethargy, and worsening of ''shortness of breath'' in chronic lung and ''heart disease'' (''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' or ''COPD'', ''congestive heart failure''). Hospitalizations are much more common in children less than 2 years of age, elderly people (especially those with ''dementia''), and immunocompromised individuals (weak immune system).' symptoms last more than a couple of weeks, symptoms are severe and worsening, there is difficulty breathing, swallowing is impaired, and upper respiratory infection is recurring."
How is an upper respiratory infection diagnosed?,"'In evaluating people with suspected upper respiratory infection, other alternative diagnoses need to be considered. Some of the common and important diagnoses that can resemble upper respiratory infection are:''The diagnosis of upper respiratory infection is typically made based on review of symptoms, physical examination, and occasionally, laboratory tests.''In physical examination of an individual with upper respiratory infection, a doctor may look for swollen and redness inside wall of the nasal cavity (sign of inflammation), redness of the throat, enlargement of the ''tonsils'', white secretions on the tonsils (exudates), ''enlarged lymph nodes'' around the head and neck, ''redness of the eyes'', and facial tenderness (''sinusitis''). Other signs may include ''bad breath'' (''halitosis''), cough, voice ''hoarseness'', and ''fever''.''Laboratory testing is generally not recommended in the evaluation of upper respiratory infections. Because most upper respiratory infections are caused by viruses, specific testing is not required as there is typically no specific treatment for different types of viral upper respiratory infections.''Some important situations where specific testing may be important include:''Blood work and imaging tests are rarely necessary in the valuation of upper respiratory infection. ''X-rays'' of the neck may be done if suspected case of epiglottitis. Although the finding of swollen ''epiglottis'' may not be diagnostic, its absence can rule out the condition. ''CT scans'' can sometimes be useful if symptoms suggestive of sinusitis last longer than 4 weeks or are associated with visual changes, copious nasal discharge, or protrusion of the eye. ''CT scan'' can determine the extent of sinus inflammation, formation of ''abscess'', or the spread of infection into adjacent structures (cavity of the eye or the brain).' asthma, pneumonia, H1N1 (swine) flu, influenza, allergic reactions, seasonal allergies, chronic (long standing) sinusitis, acute HIV infection, and bronchitis. Suspected strep throat (fever, lymph nodes in the neck, whitish tonsils, absence of cough), necessitating rapid antigen testing (rapid strep test) to rule in or rule out the condition given possible severe sequelae if untreated. Possible bacterial infection by taking bacterial cultures with nasal swab, throat swab, or sputum. Prolonged symptoms, as finding a specific virus can prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics (for example, rapid testing for the influenza virus from nasal or pharyngeal swabs). Evaluation of allergies and asthma which can cause long lasting or unusual symptoms. Enlarged lymph node and sore throat as the primary symptoms that may be caused by Ebstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis) with expected longer time course (by using the monospot test). Testing for the H1N1 (swine) flu if suspected."
What is the treatment for upper respiratory infection?,"""As described above, most cases of upper respiratory infection are caused by viruses and therefore, require no specific treatment and are self-limited. People with upper respiratory infections typically diagnose themselves and treat their symptoms at home without requiring doctor's visit or prescription medications.""'Rest is an important step in treating upper respiratory infections. Usual activities, such as, working and light exercising may be continued as much as tolerated.''Increased intake of oral fluids is also generally advised to keep up with the fluid loss from runny nose, ''fevers'', and poor appetite associated with upper respiratory infections.''Treatment of the symptoms of upper respiratory infection is usually continued until the infection has resolved.''Some of the most common upper respiratory infection or ''cold'' medications used to treat these symptoms are the following:''Some cough and ''cold'' medicines can cause excessive drowsiness need to be used with caution in children younger than 4 years of age and the elderly.''Broad-spectrum antibiotics are sometimes used to treat upper respiratory infections if a bacterial infection is suspected or diagnosed. These conditions may include ''strep throat'', bacterial sinusitis, or epiglottitis. Antivirals may occasionally be recommended by doctors in patients who are immunocompromised (poor immune system). The treating doctor can determine which antibiotic would be the best option for a particular infection.''Because antibiotic use is associated with many side effects and can promote bacterial resistance and secondary infections, they need to be used very cautiously and only under the direction of a treating physician.''Inhaled epinephrine is sometimes used in children with severe spasm of the airways (bronchospasm) and in ''croup'' to reduce spasm.''Rarely, surgical procedures may be necessary in cases of complicated ''sinus infections'', compromised airway with difficulty breathing, formation of abscesses behind the throat, or ''abscess'' formation of the tonsils (peritonsillar abscess).'   Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used to reduce fever and body aches. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) can be used for body aches and fever. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are helpful in decreasing nasal secretions and congestions. Nasal ipratropium (topical) can be used to diminish nasal secretions. Cough medications (antitussives) can be used to reduce cough. Many cough medications are commercially available such as dextromethorphan, guaifenesin (Robitussin), and codeine all have shown benefits in reducing cough in upper respiratory infections. Honey can be used in reducing cough. Steroids such as dexamethasone (Decadron) and prednisone orally (and nasally) are sometimes used reduce inflammation of the airway passage and decrease swelling and congestion. Decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) Actifed oral, phenylephrine (Neo-synephrine nasal) can be used to reduce nasal congestion (generally not recommended in children less than 2 years of age and not recommended for individuals with high blood pressure). Oxymetazoline (Afrin) nasal solution is a decongestant, but should only be used for short-term. Combination medications containing many of these components are also widely available over the counter."
What are home remedies for upper respiratory infection?,"'There are several self-care methods that can simply be applied at home for relief of symptoms of upper respiratory infection.''Moist warm air can help soothe the oral and nasal passages that become more irritated with dry air. This can make breathing easier and nasal secretions looser and easier to discharge. Some simple ways to do this are:''Nasal saline (salt water) can help with symptoms of nasal congestion. There are over the counter saline spray solutions available that can be used for this purpose. Simpler and more cost effective home-made salt water solution may also be considered. A forth of a teaspoon of salt can be added to 8 oz cup of room temperature water and stirred to dissolve. Using a bulb syringe or a small spray bottle, the solution may be applied in one nostril at time with slow ''inhalation'' and expelled with ''exhalation'' several times a day as needed.''Applying a warm pack (a warm well towel or wash cloth) to the face may also be used to treat symptoms of nasal congestion. This can be repeated every few hours as needed to relieve to the symptoms.''Salt water gurgles and lozenges may reduce throat irritation and dryness and can alleviate the symptoms of throat symptoms.''Cough can be suppressed by limiting exposure to irritants, such as, cold whether, ''cigarette'' smoke, dust, and pollution. Sleeping in a semi-upright position may be helpful at time to reduce cough. A study has suggested that honey may be superior to dextromethorphan in reducing ''cough in children'' with upper respiratory infection.''Adequate hydration with water, juices, and non-''caffeinated'' ''drinks'' can thin nasal secretions and replace the fluid losses.'   making steam in the shower by turning on the hot water (without going under it) and breathing the steamed air; drinking warm beverages (hot tea, hot chocolate, warm milk); using a vaporizer to create humidity in the room; and avoid cold, dry air if possible."
What are some data on alternative therapies in treating upper respiratory infections?,"'Many alternative and cultural remedies are used in treating upper respiratory infections.''Herbal teas including elm bark and ''licorice'' root are thought to relieve ''sore throat'' and some studies have suggested benefits compared to placebo. Long-term use of these remedies has not been evaluated; however, prolonged use of ''licorice'' may cause elevation of ''blood pressure''.''As noted above, honey has been shown to be beneficial in suppressing ''cough in children'' with upper respiratory infection and its use in hot water or tea with lemon juice is not uncommon. Ingestion of honey in infants, however, is not recommended as they are not able to properly digest the spores in honey which can result in infections.''Echinacea'' is another herbal remedy commonly used in treating upper respiratory infection. Research data failed to prove any significant benefit in altering the duration and severity of upper respiratory infection symptoms when ''Echinacea'' was used in children between 2-11 years of age as compared to placebo.''Oral zinc supplementation has been used in recent years to shorten the duration and reduce the severity of symptoms of upper respiratory infection and ''common cold''. This therapy has been studied in children with upper respiratory infection and the results are mixed. The FDA has not approved the use of oral zinc to treat the ''common cold'' or upper respiratory infections. There are reports of ''nausea'' and unpleasant taste caused by oral zinc.''Topical nasal zinc products (Zicam nasal gel) has been also used to attenuate the symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Some studies suggest loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) associated with the use of this over the counter product. Therefore, the FDA recommended discontinuation of the use of intranasal zinc products in 2009.''The use of oral ''vitamin C'' is thought to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infection symptoms, but research data are inconclusive regarding the benefits of ''vitamin C''.' "
What are the complications of an upper respiratory infection?,"'Some of the common complications of upper respiratory infections are the following:' respiratory compromise from epiglottitis; secondary infection by bacteria (viral infection can cause impairment of the physical barrier in the respiratory airways making it easier for bacteria to invade) resulting in bacterial sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia; formation of abscesses in the tonsils; rheumatic fever from strep throat; spread of infection from sinuses to the brain (meningitis); involvement of the ears resulting in middle ear infections (otitis media); worsening of underlying chronic lung disease (asthma, COPD); spread of infection to the heart (pericarditis, myocarditis); spread of the infection to the brain or the fluid around the brain causing encephalitis or meningitis; and muscular pain and rib fractures from forceful coughing."
Can an upper respiratory infection be prevented?,"'There are several measures that can reduce the risk of infections in general. ''Smoking cessation'', reducing ''stress'', adequate and balanced ''diet'', and regular ''exercise'' are all measures that can improve the immune system and reduce the overall risk of infections. ''Breastfeeding'"" also helps strengthen the immune system of infants by transferring the protective antibodies from the mother's milk to the baby.""'Other preventive measures to diminish the risk of spread of upper respiratory infections are:' hand washing is especially encouraged during the cold seasons (fall and winter) or handling others with the infection; reducing contact with people who may have the infection (people may carry and spread the virus a few days before they have symptoms and a few days after their symptoms have resolved); proper cleaning of common objects that are touched by individuals who may be infectious such as, telephones, refrigerator door, computers, stair railings, door handles, etc.; covering mouth and noise when coughing or sneezing; and vaccination with flu vaccine as recommended for certain people (elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, health care workers, etc.)."
What is the outlook for a patient suffering from an upper respiratory infection?,"'In general, the outcome of upper respiratory infection is good. The majority of these cases are due to viral infections that are self-limiting. ''Bacterial infections'', people with weak immune systems, and those with complications of upper respiratory infections (listed above) may have less favorable prognosis.' "
What is the urea breath test?,"'The urea breath test (UBT) is a test for diagnosing the presence of a bacterium, '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'') infection in the stomach. ''H. pylori'' causes inflammation, ulcers, and atrophy of the stomach. The test also may be used to demonstrate that ''H. pylori'' has been eliminated by treatment with antibiotics.'  "
What is the preparation for the urea breath test? How is it performed?,"'Your\xa0doctor or other health care professional will provide you with instructions to prepare for the urea breath test.''During the test you will swallow a capsule containing urea, which is made from an isotope of carbon. (Isotopes of carbon occur in minuscule amounts in nature, and can be measured with special testing machines.) If ''H. pylori'' is present in the stomach, the urea is broken up and turned into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is absorbed across the lining of the stomach and into the blood. It then travels in the blood to the ''lungs'' where it is excreted in the breath. Samples of exhaled breath are collected, and the isotopic carbon in the exhaled carbon dioxide is measured.' "
How does the urea breath test diagnose H. pylori infection?,"'The urea breath test is based on the ability of ''H. pylori'' to break down urea, a chemical made up of nitrogen and carbon into carbon dioxide. which then is absorbed from the stomach and eliminated in the breath. (Urea normally is produced by the body from excess or ""waste"" nitrogen-containing chemicals and then eliminated in the urine.)' "
How are the results of the urea breath test interpreted?,"'If the urea breath test is positive and the isotope is detected in the breath, it means that ''H. pylori'' is present in the stomach. If the isotope is not found in the breath, the test results are negative for the infection.''When the ''H. pylori'' is effectively treated (eradicated) by antibiotics, the test changes from positive (isotope present) to negative (isotope absent).' "
"Are there any side effects, risks, or complications of the urea breath test?","'There are no side effects, risks, or complications of the urea breath test. You do not need to stop taking medications, including ''proton pump inhibitors'' (''PPIs''), prior to having the procedure performed by a doctor.'  "
Urethral cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the urethra.,"'The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. In women, the urethra is about 1½ inches long and is just above the vagina. In men, the urethra is about 8 inches long, and goes through the ''prostate gland'' and the penis to the outside of the body. In men, the urethra also carries semen.''Urethral cancer is a rare cancer that occurs more often in women than in men.' "
There are different types of urethral cancer that begin in cells that line the urethra.,"'These ''cancers'' are named for the types of cells that become malignant (cancer):''Urethral cancer can ''metastasize'' (spread) quickly to tissues around the urethra and is often found in nearby ''lymph nodes'' by the time it is diagnosed.' Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of urethral cancer. It forms in cells in the part of the urethra near the bladder in women, and in the lining of the urethra in the penis in men. Transitional cell carcinoma forms in the area near the urethral opening in women, and in the part of the urethra that goes through the prostate gland in men. Adenocarcinoma forms in glands that are around the urethra in both men and women."
A history of bladder cancer can affect the risk of urethral cancer.,"'Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn’t mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for urethral cancer include the following:' Having a history of bladder cancer. Having conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra, including:Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16.Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16. Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)."
Signs of urethral cancer include bleeding or trouble with urination.,"'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by urethral cancer or by other conditions. There may be no signs or symptoms in the early stages. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'   Trouble starting the flow of urine. Weak or interrupted (""stop-and-go"") flow of urine. Frequent urination, especially at night. Incontinence. Discharge from the urethra. Bleeding from the urethra or blood in the urine. A lump or thickness in the perineum or penis. A painless lump or swelling in the groin."
Tests that examine the urethra and bladder are used to detect (find) and diagnose urethral cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:'   Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. Digital rectal exam: An exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. Urine cytology: A laboratory test in which a sample of urine is checked under a microscope for abnormal cells. Urinalysis: A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and white blood cells. If white blood cells (a sign of infection) are found, a urine culture is usually done to find out what type of infection it is. Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells. The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the pelvis and abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Ureteroscopy: A procedure to look inside the ureter and renal pelvis to check for abnormal areas. A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. The ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis. A tool may be inserted through the ureteroscope to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease. Biopsy: The removal of cell or tissue samples from the urethra, bladder, and, sometimes, the prostate gland. The samples are viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) 
and treatment options.","'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:' Where the cancer formed in the urethra. Whether the cancer has spread through the mucosa lining the urethra to nearby tissue, to lymph nodes, or to other parts of the body. Whether the patient is a male or female. The patient's general health. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back)."
"After urethral cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the urethra or to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the urethra or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following procedures may be used in the staging process:''There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.''Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:''Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.''When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if urethral cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually urethral cancer cells. The disease is metastatic urethral cancer, not ''lung cancer''.''Urethral cancer is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected.''Urethral cancer is staged and treated based on the part of the urethra that is affected and how deeply the tumor has spread into tissue around the urethra. Urethral cancer can be described as distal or proximal.''Distal urethral cancer''In distal urethral cancer, the cancer usually has not spread deeply into the tissue. In women, the part of the urethra that is closest to the outside of the body (about ½ inch) is affected. In men, the part of the urethra that is in the penis is affected.''Proximal urethral cancer''Proximal urethral cancer affects the part of the urethra that is not the distal urethra. In women and men, proximal urethral cancer usually has spread deeply into tissue.''Bladder and/or prostate cancer may occur at the same time as urethral cancer.''In men, cancer that forms in the proximal urethra (the part of the urethra that passes through the prostate to the bladder) may occur at the same time as ''cancer of the bladder'' and/or prostate. Sometimes this occurs at diagnosis and sometimes it occurs later.' Chest X-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan) of the pelvis and abdomen: A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the pelvis and abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the urethra, nearby lymph nodes, and other soft tissue and bones in the pelvis. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Urethrography: A series of x-rays of the urethra. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. A dye is injected through the urethra into the bladder. The dye coats the bladder and urethra and x-rays are taken to see if the urethra is blocked and if cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Tissue.

The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
Recurrent urethral cancer,'Recurrent urethral cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the urethra or in other parts of the body.' 
There are different types of treatment for patients with urethral cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with urethral cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Four types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for cancer of the urethra. One of the following types of surgery may be done:''If the urethra is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for the urine to pass from the body. This is called urinary diversion. If the bladder is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for urine to be stored and passed from the body. The surgeon may use part of the small intestine to make a tube that passes urine through an opening (stoma). This is called an ostomy or urostomy. If a patient has an ostomy, a disposable bag to collect urine is worn under clothing. The surgeon may also use part of the small intestine to make a new storage pouch (continent reservoir) inside the body where the urine can collect. A tube (catheter) is then used to drain the urine through a stoma.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat urethral cancer.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra.'""Active surveillance is following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including biopsies, on a regular schedule.""'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.''Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.'   Open excision: Removal of the cancer by surgery. Transurethral resection (TUR): Surgery to remove the cancer using a special tool inserted into the urethra. Electroresection with fulguration: Surgery to remove the cancer by electric current. A lighted tool with a small wire loop on the end is used to remove the cancer or to burn the tumor away with high-energy electricity. Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove or destroy tissue. Lymph node dissection: Lymph nodes in the pelvis and groin may be removed. Cystourethrectomy: Surgery to remove the bladder and the urethra. Cystoprostatectomy: Surgery to remove the bladder and the prostate. Anterior exenteration: Surgery to remove the urethra, the bladder, and the vagina. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the vagina. Partial penectomy: Surgery to remove the part of the penis surrounding the urethra where cancer has spread. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the penis. Radical penectomy: Surgery to remove the entire penis. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the penis. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
Distal urethral cancer,"'Treatment of abnormal cells in the mucosa (inside lining of the urethra that have not become cancer, may include surgery to remove the tumor (open excision or transurethral resection), electroresection with fulguration, or laser surgery.''Treatment of distal urethral cancer is different for men and women.''For women, treatment may include the following:''For men, treatment may include the following:' Surgery to remove the tumor (transurethral resection), electroresection and fulguration, or laser surgery for tumors that have not spread deeply into tissue. Brachytherapy and/or external radiation therapy for tumors that have not spread deeply into tissue. Surgery to remove the tumor (anterior exenteration) for tumors that have spread deeply into tissue. Sometimes nearby lymph nodes are also removed (lymph node dissection). Radiation therapy may be given before surgery. Surgery to remove the tumor (transurethral resection), electroresection and fulguration, or laser surgery for tumors that have not spread deeply into tissue. Surgery to remove part of the penis (partial penectomy) for tumors that are near the tip of the penis. Sometimes nearby lymph nodes are also removed (lymph node dissection). Surgery to remove part of the urethra for tumors that are in the distal urethra but not at the tip of the penis and have not spread deeply into tissue. Sometimes nearby lymph nodes are also removed (lymph node dissection). Surgery to remove the penis (radical penectomy) for tumors that have spread deeply into tissue. Sometimes nearby lymph nodes are also removed (lymph node dissection). Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given together with radiation therapy."
Proximal urethral cancer,"'Treatment of proximal urethral cancer or urethral cancer that affects the entire urethra is different for men and women.''For women, treatment may include the following:''For men, treatment may include the following:''Treatment of urethral cancer that forms at the same time as invasive bladder cancer may include the following:''If the urethra is not removed during surgery to remove the bladder, treatment may include the following:' Radiation therapy and/or surgery (open excision, transurethral resection) for tumors that are ¾ of an inch or smaller. Radiation therapy followed by surgery (anterior exenteration with lymph node dissection and urinary diversion). Radiation therapy or radiation therapy and chemotherapy, followed by surgery (cystoprostatectomy, penectomy, lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion).

Samples of cells are taken from inside the urethra and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer."
Metastatic or recurrent urethral cancer,'Treatment of urethral cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body) is usually chemotherapy.''Treatment of recurrent urethral cancer may include one or more of the following:' Surgery to remove the tumor. Sometimes nearby lymph nodes are also removed (lymph node dissection). Radiation therapy.
What is the urethra?,"'The urethra is a hollow tube that allows urine to leave the bladder. In men, the urethra starts from the lower opening of the bladder, the bladder neck, and traverses the entire length of the penis. In women, it is a shorter opening coming off the lower opening of bladder and is between 2.5 to 4 centimeters (cm) in length. In both males and females, muscle (urethral sphincter) surrounds the urethra. The urethral sphincter closes the urethra to keep urine in the bladder, and just prior to urination, the sphincter muscle relaxes to allow urine to leave the bladder and pass through the urethra.''The posterior urethra and the anterior urethra are the two principal segments of the urethra in males. The posterior urethra is composed of the prostatic and membranous urethra and extends from the bladder neck to the end of the verumontanum (the region where the ejaculate [sperm and fluids] enters the urethra). The anterior urethra is composed of the bulbar urethra, penile urethra, and the fossa navicularis. The corpus spongiosum completely surrounds the anterior urethra. Subdivisions of these segments include the following:' The urethral meatus, which is the opening at the tip of the penis The fossa navicularis, which is the urethra located proximal to the urethral meatus and within the glans, head of the penis The penile urethra, which is the urethra that goes from the urethral meatus to the distal edge of the muscle, the bulbocavernosus muscle The bulbar urethra goes from the beginning of the proximal urethra back to the end of the membranous urethra. The bulbocavernosus muscle surrounds the bulbar urethra. The membranous urethra is a short area of the urethra that extends from the proximal bulbar urethra to the distal verumontanum (the verumontanum is a small mound in the urethra where the ejaculatory ducts open into and sperm enters the urethra). The prostatic urethra is the urethra that goes from the end of the bladder neck (outlet of the bladder) to the verumontanum. The bladder neck, the outlet of the bladder"
What is a urethral stricture?,"'Urethral stricture refers to chronic fibrosis and/or narrowing of the lumen of the urethra. Depending on the severity of the stricture, the flow of urine (urinary stream) may or may not be affected. Urethral stricture disease is associated with varying degrees of fibrosis of the spongiosum. ''Urethral stricture'' is the term applied to abnormal narrowing of the anterior urethra, whereas the American Urologic Association prefers the term ''stenosis'' for narrowing of the posterior urethra, which lacks spongiosum.''Urethral stricture is significantly more common in men and boys compared to women and girls. This condition is rare in females. The bulbar urethra is most commonly affected.' "
What are the risk factors and causes of urethral strictures?,"'Any inflammation of urethra can result in scarring, which then can lead to a stricture or a narrowing of the urethra. ''Trauma'', infection, tumors, iatrogenic urologic interventions such as urethral instrumentation (catheter placement, ''cystoscopy''), transurethral surgeries, treatment of ''prostate cancer'', or any other cause of scarring may lead to urethral narrowing or stricture. Mechanical narrowing of the urethra without ''scar'' formation (developmental causes or ''prostate enlargement'') can also narrow the urethra, but is not a stricture.''In developed countries, the most common cause of urethral stricture is idiopathic (41%, no cause identified) followed by iatrogenic (35%). Iatrogenic causes include strictures related to hypospadias (a congenital abnormality where the urethral meatus is located on the underside of the penis, anywhere from the perineum to just short of the head of the penis) and strictures from endoscopic procedures (for example, ''cystoscopy'' or transurethral ''prostatectomy''). In developing countries, trauma (36%) is the most common cause of stricture.''The following are common causes of scarring or narrowing of the urethra:' Trauma from injury or accidents with damage to the urethra or bladder (for example, falling on a frame of a bicycle between the legs, or a car accident), straddle injuries Pelvic injury (fracture of the pelvic bones) or trauma Previous procedures involving the urethra (urinary catheters, surgeries, cystoscopy) Previous prostate surgery (TURP or transurethral resection of the prostate for prostate enlargement, radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer) Prostate enlargement Cancer of the urethra (rare) Infections of the urethra (sexually transmitted infections or STDs, urethritis, gonorrhea, chlamydia) Prostate infection or inflammation (prostatitis) Previous hypospadias surgery (a congenital birth defect in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of the tip) Congenital malformations of the urethra, which rarely can cause urethral stricture in children Brachytherapy (placement of radiation seeds into the prostate) for prostate cancer Diaper-related irritation to the urethral meatus (opening at the tip of the penis) Inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (previously referred to as balanitis xerotica obliterans in males), Reiter's syndrome"
What are the symptoms and signs of a urethral stricture?,"'Symptoms of urethral stricture can range from no symptoms at all (asymptomatic), to mild discomfort, to complete ''urinary retention'' (''inability to urinate'').''Some of the possible symptoms and complications of urethral stricture include the following:'   Difficulty starting urine flow (hesitancy) Painful urination (dysuria) Urinary tract infection (UTI) Urinary retention Incomplete emptying of bladder Decreased urinary stream Dribbling of urine Spraying or double streaming urine Blood in the urine (bloody or dark-appearing urine) known as hematuria Blood in the semen (hematospermia) Urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) Pelvic pain Discharge from the urethra Reduced ejaculation force Stones in bladder Straining to urinate Safe sex"
What type of doctor treats urethral obstruction?,"'Most commonly, urologists manage urethral strictures. Urologists are doctors with training and specialization in the urinary system.' "
How do physicians diagnose urethral strictures?,"'Doctors make a diagnosis based on history, physical examination, and one or more studies to determine the location and extent of the stricture.''When the medical history, physical examination, and symptoms are suggestive of urethral stricture, additional diagnostic tests may be helpful in further evaluation. ''Urinalysis'' (UA), urine culture, and urethral culture for sexually transmitted infections diseases (''gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'') are some of the tests that physicians may order. A doctor may examine the prostate and screen for ''prostate cancer'' (manual exam and measurement of ''prostate specific antigen'' or PSA) depending on the history, symptoms, and age of the male. A uroflow study may be obtained, whereby one urinates into a special collection container that can measure the rate of the flow of urine and the pattern of the urine stream. In addition, an ''ultrasound'' like machine, a bladder scanner assesses the amount of urine left in the bladder (postvoid residual).''Oftentimes, imaging and endoscopic studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the location, length, and extent of the narrowing from the stricture.'  "
Are there any special tests for diagnosing urethral strictures?,"'The following are some common imaging and endoscopic tests in evaluating urethral stricture:''Ultrasound of the urethra (ultrasound urethrography) is one of the radiologic methods in evaluating urethral stricture. An ultrasound probe can be placed along the length of the penis (phallus) and determine the size of the stricture, degree of narrowing, and length of the stricture. This is a noninvasive method and usually does not require any special preparation. However, the location of the stricture limit an ultrasound of the urethra. Ultrasound of the urethra is more helpful in identifying strictures in the part of the urethra that passes through the penis. Currently, doctors may use ultrasound of the urethra in addition to other studies, such as retrograde urethrogram (RUG) to define the stricture before surgery.''Retrograde urethrography is another X-ray test to evaluate urethral strictures. This test entails placing a small urinary catheter in the last part of the urethra, the urethral meatus (the opening at the tip of the penis). A health care professional gently inflates the balloon of the catheter to hold the catheter in place during the study. Then a physician injects a small amount (10-20 cc) of an ''iodine'' contrast material into the urethra via the catheter and takes radiographic pictures under fluoroscopy to assess any obstruction or impairment to the flow of the contrast material that can suggest urethral stricture. This test provides useful information about the location, length of the stricture, and presence of other abnormalities.''Cystography, filling and voiding (VCUG) is helpful to look at the first part of the urethra, proximal urethra. In this study, an individual ''drinks'' water to fill his/her bladder and then voids under fluoroscopy.''Antegrade cystourethrogram is a similar test that a health care professional performs if there is a suprapubic catheter in place (a urinary catheter placed in the bladder through the skin in the lower abdomen). A health care provider injects ''iodine'' contrast into the bladder via the catheter and its flow out of the urethra is radiographed under fluoroscopy.''Cystourethroscopy is an endoscopic evaluation in which a small instrument that is a thin tube (cystoscope) with a light within it and a camera at the tip is inserted into the urethra to look directly at the inside (lumen) of the urethra. A health care professional cleans the tip of the urethral opening to prevent infection and applies a local lubricant and anesthetic gel for comfort. Then a physician passes an endoscope through the urethra into the bladder to detect any anatomical or structural abnormalities and obtain a biopsy if he or she suspects ''urethral cancer''. Cystoscopy is limited as the length of the stricture and the exact location may not be able to be fully identified due to the size of the scope and the degree of narrowing of the urethra. In individuals with a suprapubic tube in place, a health care provider can perform the cystoscopy with a flexible tube through the suprapubic tract, termed antegrade cystoscopy.''MRI'' and CT: Physicians use these studies less frequently to evaluate urethral strictures but in certain cases may be helpful, such as in individuals with a history of a ''fracture'' of the pelvic bone(s).' Ultrasound of the urethra Retrograde urethrogram Cystography, filling and voiding (VCUG) Antegrade cystourethrogram Cystourethroscopy MRI and CT scan"
What is the treatment for urethral strictures?,"'Once a stricture has developed, it will not go away. The role of medications in the management of primary urethral strictures is limited.''Surgery is the recommended treatment for individuals with symptomatic urethral strictures.''A doctor may recommend surgery in the following circumstances:'   Severe problems with urination, such as straining to urinate, weak stream, and urinary retention (inability to urinate) Stones in the bladder Recurrent urinary tract infections Increasing post-void residual (amount of urine left in bladder after urination) Failure of conservative measures to control symptoms (pain)"
What surgical options are available for urethral strictures?,"'There are several surgical treatments available for treating urethral strictures, some are more invasive than others. The treatment recommended may vary with the location, length, and severity of the stricture as well as an assessment of the risks and benefits of the procedure.''The common procedures include'""When deciding the most appropriate form of treatment, it's important to take into account the stricture etiology, location, and severity, prior treatments, comorbidities, and patient preference. Physicians typically place a urethral catheter after urethral stricture treatment as it may serve as a ""'stent'' around which the site of urethral intervention can heal.''Urethral dilation is a commonly attempted technique for treating urethral strictures. The goal of urethral dilation is to stretch the ''scar tissue'' without injuring the lining of the urethra. A physician performs the procedure in the office under local anesthesia or in the operating room under general anesthesia. A health care professional gently inserts thin rods of increasing diameters into the urethra from the tip of the penis (meatus) in order stretch the narrowing without causing any further injury to the urethra. A health care provider typically places a catheter after the dilation and removes it approximately 72 hours after the procedure, if it was uncomplicated. It may be necessary to repeat this procedure from time to time, as strictures may recur. However, the AUA guidelines recommend urethroplasty instead of repeated endoscopic management for recurrent anterior urethral strictures following failed urethral dilation of direct vision internal urethrotomy. The shorter the stricture, the less likely it is to recur after a dilation procedure. Occasionally, physicians give patients instructions and dilation instruments (rods, lubricating gel, and anesthetic gel) to perform the urethral dilation at home as needed, particularly those patients who are not candidates for urethroplasty. A risk of urethral dilation is the risk of making the stricture worse over the long term.''Direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) is an endoscopic procedure performed under general anesthesia. A physician inserts a thin tube with a camera (endoscope) into the urethra to visualize the stricture (as describe in earlier section). Then a physician passes a tiny knife through the endoscope to cut the stricture lengthwise to open up the stricture and widen the urethra. A physician then inserts a Foley catheter (urinary catheter), which is kept in place for a few days to a week while the urethral incision is healing. For individuals with a soft stricture that is short, <1 cm long, located in a segment of the urethra called the bulbar urethra, DVIU has a stricture-free rate of 50%-70%. The success of DVIU in other locations and more dense strictures is often less. Complications after DVIU include bleeding, ''pain'', ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), troubles with erections, and recurrent stricture. Use of the laser to open up the ''scar tissue'' does not appear to be any better than using the knife. DVIU may be repeated if the stricture recurs, however, as with urethral dilation, urethroplasty should be offered for recurrent anterior urethral strictures after failed DVIU.''Bladder neck contracture (vesicourethral stenosis) may occur after surgical management of prostate disease, including transurethral prostatectomy for ''benign prostatic hypertrophy'' (''BPH'') and radical prostatectomy for prostate ''cancer''. Dilation or incision initially treats bladder neck contracture. Recurrent bladder neck contracture may require surgical reconstruction.''Urethral stent placement is another endoscopic procedure aimed at treating urethral strictures. Depending on the location of the stricture in the urethra, a health care provider may pass a closed tube (stent) through an endoscope to the area of the stricture. Once it reaches the proper location, a physician will open the stent to form a patent tube or conduit for urine to flow. This may be helpful in individuals who are too sick to undergo surgery that is more extensive. Information on long-term success rates of urethral ''stents'' is lacking. Complications of urethral stent placement include ''pain'', dribbling after urinating, change in position of the stent (stent migration), stent malposition, and blockage of the stent.''Open surgery, urethroplasty, is the gold standard. It has better long-term success rates than other therapies. Doctors may recommend different types of urethroplasty depending on the location and extent of the stricture. There are two types of urethroplasty techniques: tissue transfer procedures and non-tissue transfer procedures. Performance of tissue transfer procedures may require one stage or multiple stages (multi-stage) depending on the availability of tissue, extent, and location of the stricture.''Excision and primary anastomosis urethroplasty is a non-tissue transfer procedure: This procedure involves open surgical removal of the ''scar'' and reconnection of the urethra. This procedure works well for short strictures (< 2 cm) located in a special area of the urethra, the bulbar urethra. A catheter left in place after the procedure allows the area to heal. The duration of the catheter will vary with surgeon preference. The success rate of this procedure is up to 90%. Risks of this procedure include risks of infection, bleeding, ''pain'', recurrent stricture, and fistula (a communication between the urethra and the skin), and dribbling after urination.''Augmented urethroplasty involves tissue transfer. For example, if the stricture is long and/or located in the penis, the stricture may be opened and a flap or graft of tissue is sewn on top of the opened urethra to increase the caliber of the urethra (single stage) or less commonly replaced with a tube, made from surrounding tissues, such as nearby skin or from tissue removed from other areas in the body such as from the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa) (multi-stage). In a multi-stage procedure, the scarred urethra is typically removed and a piece of tissue (graft of flap) is sewn into the area. Several months later the tissue is then made into a tube. To allow the tissue to heal and minimize urine leakage during healing, a catheter is left in place. The duration of the catheter may vary with the extent and location of the stricture and whether the procedure is being performed in a single stage or in two stages. Individuals with lichen sclerosis related stricture disease should not use penile or genital skin for the urethroplasty due to possible involvement of this tissue with the lichen sclerosis. ''Erectile dysfunction'' may occur transiently after urethroplasty with resolution in nearly all affected individuals by six months postoperative. Ejaculatory dysfunction (pooling of semen, decreased ejaculatory force, discomfort with ejaculation, and decreased semen volume) is reported in up to 21% of men follow urethroplasty for bulbar urethral strictures.''Pelvic ''fractures'' may results in urethral injury and subsequent stricture. The risk of developing a stricture is related to the initial treatment of the injury. If a suprapubic tube is placed at the time of the pelvic injury, there is a high likelihood that a stricture will form. The stricture is repaired when the patient has healed from the other injuries and is treated with excision of the stricture and reapproximation of the ends of the urethra. In some cases, a catheter is able to be passed through the urethral injury into the bladder (primary realignment) at the time of injury, and the urethra is allowed to heal over the catheter. This realignment of the urethra decreases the risk of urethral stricture formation by about 30% and makes surgery for repair of the stricture, if it occurs, easier. Success rates with repairs of urethral strictures from pelvic ''fractures'' is about 90%-98% with excision of the stricture and bringing the ends of the urethra together (reapproximation). Complications of pelvic fractures include bleeding, infection, and ''erectile dysfunction''. Complications of the urethral stricture repair include bleeding, infection, and urinary ''incontinence''.''In select circumstances, a perineal urethrostomy may be preferred as a long-term treatment alternative to urethroplasty. A perineal urethrostomy involves making an incision into the urethra, urethrothrotomy, and opening the urethra and sewing it to the perineum (anterior to the rectum and behind the scrotum). With a perineal urethrostomy, the individual would sit on the toilet to urinate.''The treating ''urologist'' would recommend the procedure that would be the best option for each individual. As with any medical procedures, there are some degrees of risks and complications associated with any of these operations.' urethral dilation, direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU), urethral stent placement, and open urethral reconstruction."
What is the recovery period after surgery to repair a urethral stricture?,"'The recovery period after surgery will vary with the procedure performed, duration of catheterization, surgeon preference, and overall health status. A catheter (Foley catheter) is left in the penis after almost all surgeries for treatment of a urethral stricture. How long the catheter remains in place will depend on the procedure performed and surgeon preference. Typically, the catheter is left in place for at least 72 hours. In some cases, a suprapubic tube (tube that goes through the lower abdomen into the bladder) may be left in place to drain the urine in addition to the catheter. With less invasive procedures, the duration may be shorter. The discomfort related to the procedure will also vary with much less discomfort with the less invasive procedures, urethral dilation, and internal urethrotomy. With the more extensive surgery, urethroplasty, a more prolonged course can be expected, varying with the extent of the surgery. Procedures such as dilation and internal urethrotomy are outpatient procedures, whereas more complex repairs may be associated with an overnight stay in the hospital. Follow-up is required after urethroplasty to ensure that the repair is healing well and complications such as a fistula (communication between the urethra and the skin), recurrent stricture, and ''diverticulum'' (outpouching of the urethra) are identified and treated if they occur.' "
How are urethral strictures followed after repair?,"'There is a risk of recurrence of the urethral stricture, and thus follow-up is essential. The physician will ask questions about the force of urine stream, frequency of urination, feeling of complete or incomplete bladder emptying, direction of the urine stream, and other symptoms of urethral strictures. During such follow-up visits, you may be asked to void into a special collection device, uroflow, to measure the speed of urination and the flow of urination. A small ultrasound probe may be placed on the lower part of the abdomen after urination to measure the amount of urine remaining in the bladder (post-void residual). In some cases, a cystoscopy may be performed to look directly at the area of urethra that was repaired.''Urethral strictures in children may result from ''diaper'' irritation (meatal stenosis), trauma, prior surgery or instrumentation, or may be congenital. They will often appear with similar symptoms as those in adults.''Meatal stenosis is a narrowing of the opening at the tip of the penis and is felt to occur from diaper irritation in circumcised boys. It may also occur after hypospadias repair. Symptoms include decreased or deflected urine stream. Performing a meatotomy/meatoplasty, crushing the scarred ''bridge'' of tissue and cutting it after, is successful in 98%-100% of boys.''For urethral strictures in the penile urethra to the bulbar urethra, dilation is not recommended. DVIU will be successful in approximately 50% of patients. Excision of the stricture if feasible and primary reattachment of the urethral ends is most effective. When this cannot be accomplished, then a patch graft of buccal mucosa is successful.' "
Is it possible to prevent a urethral stricture?,"'In general terms, urethral stricture is not preventable as most common causes are related to injury, trauma, instrumentation, or unpreventable medical conditions. Sexually transmitted infections such as ''gonorrhea'' or ''chlamydia'' are less common causes of urethral stricture, and they can be potentially prevented by practicing ''safe sex. Judicious use of catheters and instrumentation may decrease the risk of urethral strictures.' "
What is the prognosis for urethral stricture?,"'In general, the outlook on urethral stricture is favorable with success rates up to 90%-98%. A thorough initial evaluation may help identify the most appropriate initial treatment strategy and thus decrease recurrence rates. Repeated dilation and DVIU is discouraged as they result in further urethral injury and longer and more extensive strictures.' "
What is the urethra?,"'The urethra is a hollow tube that allows urine to leave the bladder. In men, the urethra starts from the lower opening of the bladder, the bladder neck, and traverses the entire length of the penis. In women, it is a shorter opening coming off the lower opening of bladder and is between 2.5 to 4 centimeters (cm) in length. In both males and females, muscle (urethral sphincter) surrounds the urethra. The urethral sphincter closes the urethra to keep urine in the bladder, and just prior to urination, the sphincter muscle relaxes to allow urine to leave the bladder and pass through the urethra.''The posterior urethra and the anterior urethra are the two principal segments of the urethra in males. The posterior urethra is composed of the prostatic and membranous urethra and extends from the bladder neck to the end of the verumontanum (the region where the ejaculate [sperm and fluids] enters the urethra). The anterior urethra is composed of the bulbar urethra, penile urethra, and the fossa navicularis. The corpus spongiosum completely surrounds the anterior urethra. Subdivisions of these segments include the following:' The urethral meatus, which is the opening at the tip of the penis The fossa navicularis, which is the urethra located proximal to the urethral meatus and within the glans, head of the penis The penile urethra, which is the urethra that goes from the urethral meatus to the distal edge of the muscle, the bulbocavernosus muscle The bulbar urethra goes from the beginning of the proximal urethra back to the end of the membranous urethra. The bulbocavernosus muscle surrounds the bulbar urethra. The membranous urethra is a short area of the urethra that extends from the proximal bulbar urethra to the distal verumontanum (the verumontanum is a small mound in the urethra where the ejaculatory ducts open into and sperm enters the urethra). The prostatic urethra is the urethra that goes from the end of the bladder neck (outlet of the bladder) to the verumontanum. The bladder neck, the outlet of the bladder"
What is a urethral stricture?,"'Urethral stricture refers to chronic fibrosis and/or narrowing of the lumen of the urethra. Depending on the severity of the stricture, the flow of urine (urinary stream) may or may not be affected. Urethral stricture disease is associated with varying degrees of fibrosis of the spongiosum. ''Urethral stricture'' is the term applied to abnormal narrowing of the anterior urethra, whereas the American Urologic Association prefers the term ''stenosis'' for narrowing of the posterior urethra, which lacks spongiosum.''Urethral stricture is significantly more common in men and boys compared to women and girls. This condition is rare in females. The bulbar urethra is most commonly affected.' "
What are the risk factors and causes of urethral strictures?,"'Any inflammation of urethra can result in scarring, which then can lead to a stricture or a narrowing of the urethra. ''Trauma'', infection, tumors, iatrogenic urologic interventions such as urethral instrumentation (catheter placement, ''cystoscopy''), transurethral surgeries, treatment of ''prostate cancer'', or any other cause of scarring may lead to urethral narrowing or stricture. Mechanical narrowing of the urethra without ''scar'' formation (developmental causes or ''prostate enlargement'') can also narrow the urethra, but is not a stricture.''In developed countries, the most common cause of urethral stricture is idiopathic (41%, no cause identified) followed by iatrogenic (35%). Iatrogenic causes include strictures related to hypospadias (a congenital abnormality where the urethral meatus is located on the underside of the penis, anywhere from the perineum to just short of the head of the penis) and strictures from endoscopic procedures (for example, ''cystoscopy'' or transurethral ''prostatectomy''). In developing countries, trauma (36%) is the most common cause of stricture.''The following are common causes of scarring or narrowing of the urethra:' Trauma from injury or accidents with damage to the urethra or bladder (for example, falling on a frame of a bicycle between the legs, or a car accident), straddle injuries Pelvic injury (fracture of the pelvic bones) or trauma Previous procedures involving the urethra (urinary catheters, surgeries, cystoscopy) Previous prostate surgery (TURP or transurethral resection of the prostate for prostate enlargement, radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer) Prostate enlargement Cancer of the urethra (rare) Infections of the urethra (sexually transmitted infections or STDs, urethritis, gonorrhea, chlamydia) Prostate infection or inflammation (prostatitis) Previous hypospadias surgery (a congenital birth defect in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of the tip) Congenital malformations of the urethra, which rarely can cause urethral stricture in children Brachytherapy (placement of radiation seeds into the prostate) for prostate cancer Diaper-related irritation to the urethral meatus (opening at the tip of the penis) Inflammatory conditions such as lichen sclerosus (previously referred to as balanitis xerotica obliterans in males), Reiter's syndrome"
What are the symptoms and signs of a urethral stricture?,"'Symptoms of urethral stricture can range from no symptoms at all (asymptomatic), to mild discomfort, to complete ''urinary retention'' (''inability to urinate'').''Some of the possible symptoms and complications of urethral stricture include the following:'   Difficulty starting urine flow (hesitancy) Painful urination (dysuria) Urinary tract infection (UTI) Urinary retention Incomplete emptying of bladder Decreased urinary stream Dribbling of urine Spraying or double streaming urine Blood in the urine (bloody or dark-appearing urine) known as hematuria Blood in the semen (hematospermia) Urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) Pelvic pain Discharge from the urethra Reduced ejaculation force Stones in bladder Straining to urinate Safe sex"
What type of doctor treats urethral obstruction?,"'Most commonly, urologists manage urethral strictures. Urologists are doctors with training and specialization in the urinary system.' "
How do physicians diagnose urethral strictures?,"'Doctors make a diagnosis based on history, physical examination, and one or more studies to determine the location and extent of the stricture.''When the medical history, physical examination, and symptoms are suggestive of urethral stricture, additional diagnostic tests may be helpful in further evaluation. ''Urinalysis'' (UA), urine culture, and urethral culture for sexually transmitted infections diseases (''gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'') are some of the tests that physicians may order. A doctor may examine the prostate and screen for ''prostate cancer'' (manual exam and measurement of ''prostate specific antigen'' or PSA) depending on the history, symptoms, and age of the male. A uroflow study may be obtained, whereby one urinates into a special collection container that can measure the rate of the flow of urine and the pattern of the urine stream. In addition, an ''ultrasound'' like machine, a bladder scanner assesses the amount of urine left in the bladder (postvoid residual).''Oftentimes, imaging and endoscopic studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the location, length, and extent of the narrowing from the stricture.'  "
Are there any special tests for diagnosing urethral strictures?,"'The following are some common imaging and endoscopic tests in evaluating urethral stricture:''Ultrasound of the urethra (ultrasound urethrography) is one of the radiologic methods in evaluating urethral stricture. An ultrasound probe can be placed along the length of the penis (phallus) and determine the size of the stricture, degree of narrowing, and length of the stricture. This is a noninvasive method and usually does not require any special preparation. However, the location of the stricture limit an ultrasound of the urethra. Ultrasound of the urethra is more helpful in identifying strictures in the part of the urethra that passes through the penis. Currently, doctors may use ultrasound of the urethra in addition to other studies, such as retrograde urethrogram (RUG) to define the stricture before surgery.''Retrograde urethrography is another X-ray test to evaluate urethral strictures. This test entails placing a small urinary catheter in the last part of the urethra, the urethral meatus (the opening at the tip of the penis). A health care professional gently inflates the balloon of the catheter to hold the catheter in place during the study. Then a physician injects a small amount (10-20 cc) of an ''iodine'' contrast material into the urethra via the catheter and takes radiographic pictures under fluoroscopy to assess any obstruction or impairment to the flow of the contrast material that can suggest urethral stricture. This test provides useful information about the location, length of the stricture, and presence of other abnormalities.''Cystography, filling and voiding (VCUG) is helpful to look at the first part of the urethra, proximal urethra. In this study, an individual ''drinks'' water to fill his/her bladder and then voids under fluoroscopy.''Antegrade cystourethrogram is a similar test that a health care professional performs if there is a suprapubic catheter in place (a urinary catheter placed in the bladder through the skin in the lower abdomen). A health care provider injects ''iodine'' contrast into the bladder via the catheter and its flow out of the urethra is radiographed under fluoroscopy.''Cystourethroscopy is an endoscopic evaluation in which a small instrument that is a thin tube (cystoscope) with a light within it and a camera at the tip is inserted into the urethra to look directly at the inside (lumen) of the urethra. A health care professional cleans the tip of the urethral opening to prevent infection and applies a local lubricant and anesthetic gel for comfort. Then a physician passes an endoscope through the urethra into the bladder to detect any anatomical or structural abnormalities and obtain a biopsy if he or she suspects ''urethral cancer''. Cystoscopy is limited as the length of the stricture and the exact location may not be able to be fully identified due to the size of the scope and the degree of narrowing of the urethra. In individuals with a suprapubic tube in place, a health care provider can perform the cystoscopy with a flexible tube through the suprapubic tract, termed antegrade cystoscopy.''MRI'' and CT: Physicians use these studies less frequently to evaluate urethral strictures but in certain cases may be helpful, such as in individuals with a history of a ''fracture'' of the pelvic bone(s).'

What is the treatment for urethral strictures?,"'Once a stricture has developed, it will not go away. The role of medications in the management of primary urethral strictures is limited.''Surgery is the recommended treatment for individuals with symptomatic urethral strictures.''A doctor may recommend surgery in the following circumstances:'   Severe problems with urination, such as straining to urinate, weak stream, and urinary retention (inability to urinate) Stones in the bladder Recurrent urinary tract infections Increasing post-void residual (amount of urine left in bladder after urination) Failure of conservative measures to control symptoms (pain)"
What surgical options are available for urethral strictures?,"'There are several surgical treatments available for treating urethral strictures, some are more invasive than others. The treatment recommended may vary with the location, length, and severity of the stricture as well as an assessment of the risks and benefits of the procedure.''The common procedures include'""When deciding the most appropriate form of treatment, it's important to take into account the stricture etiology, location, and severity, prior treatments, comorbidities, and patient preference. Physicians typically place a urethral catheter after urethral stricture treatment as it may serve as a ""'stent'' around which the site of urethral intervention can heal.''Urethral dilation is a commonly attempted technique for treating urethral strictures. The goal of urethral dilation is to stretch the ''scar tissue'' without injuring the lining of the urethra. A physician performs the procedure in the office under local anesthesia or in the operating room under general anesthesia. A health care professional gently inserts thin rods of increasing diameters into the urethra from the tip of the penis (meatus) in order stretch the narrowing without causing any further injury to the urethra. A health care provider typically places a catheter after the dilation and removes it approximately 72 hours after the procedure, if it was uncomplicated. It may be necessary to repeat this procedure from time to time, as strictures may recur. However, the AUA guidelines recommend urethroplasty instead of repeated endoscopic management for recurrent anterior urethral strictures following failed urethral dilation of direct vision internal urethrotomy. The shorter the stricture, the less likely it is to recur after a dilation procedure. Occasionally, physicians give patients instructions and dilation instruments (rods, lubricating gel, and anesthetic gel) to perform the urethral dilation at home as needed, particularly those patients who are not candidates for urethroplasty. A risk of urethral dilation is the risk of making the stricture worse over the long term.''Direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) is an endoscopic procedure performed under general anesthesia. A physician inserts a thin tube with a camera (endoscope) into the urethra to visualize the stricture (as describe in earlier section). Then a physician passes a tiny knife through the endoscope to cut the stricture lengthwise to open up the stricture and widen the urethra. A physician then inserts a Foley catheter (urinary catheter), which is kept in place for a few days to a week while the urethral incision is healing. For individuals with a soft stricture that is short, <1 cm long, located in a segment of the urethra called the bulbar urethra, DVIU has a stricture-free rate of 50%-70%. The success of DVIU in other locations and more dense strictures is often less. Complications after DVIU include bleeding, ''pain'', ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), troubles with erections, and recurrent stricture. Use of the laser to open up the ''scar tissue'' does not appear to be any better than using the knife. DVIU may be repeated if the stricture recurs, however, as with urethral dilation, urethroplasty should be offered for recurrent anterior urethral strictures after failed DVIU.''Bladder neck contracture (vesicourethral stenosis) may occur after surgical management of prostate disease, including transurethral prostatectomy for ''benign prostatic hypertrophy'' (''BPH'') and radical prostatectomy for prostate ''cancer''. Dilation or incision initially treats bladder neck contracture. Recurrent bladder neck contracture may require surgical reconstruction.''Urethral stent placement is another endoscopic procedure aimed at treating urethral strictures. Depending on the location of the stricture in the urethra, a health care provider may pass a closed tube (stent) through an endoscope to the area of the stricture. Once it reaches the proper location, a physician will open the stent to form a patent tube or conduit for urine to flow. This may be helpful in individuals who are too sick to undergo surgery that is more extensive. Information on long-term success rates of urethral ''stents'' is lacking. Complications of urethral stent placement include ''pain'', dribbling after urinating, change in position of the stent (stent migration), stent malposition, and blockage of the stent.''Open surgery, urethroplasty, is the gold standard. It has better long-term success rates than other therapies. Doctors may recommend different types of urethroplasty depending on the location and extent of the stricture. There are two types of urethroplasty techniques: tissue transfer procedures and non-tissue transfer procedures. Performance of tissue transfer procedures may require one stage or multiple stages (multi-stage) depending on the availability of tissue, extent, and location of the stricture.''Excision and primary anastomosis urethroplasty is a non-tissue transfer procedure: This procedure involves open surgical removal of the ''scar'' and reconnection of the urethra. This procedure works well for short strictures (< 2 cm) located in a special area of the urethra, the bulbar urethra. A catheter left in place after the procedure allows the area to heal. The duration of the catheter will vary with surgeon preference. The success rate of this procedure is up to 90%. Risks of this procedure include risks of infection, bleeding, ''pain'', recurrent stricture, and fistula (a communication between the urethra and the skin), and dribbling after urination.''Augmented urethroplasty involves tissue transfer. For example, if the stricture is long and/or located in the penis, the stricture may be opened and a flap or graft of tissue is sewn on top of the opened urethra to increase the caliber of the urethra (single stage) or less commonly replaced with a tube, made from surrounding tissues, such as nearby skin or from tissue removed from other areas in the body such as from the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa) (multi-stage). In a multi-stage procedure, the scarred urethra is typically removed and a piece of tissue (graft of flap) is sewn into the area. Several months later the tissue is then made into a tube. To allow the tissue to heal and minimize urine leakage during healing, a catheter is left in place. The duration of the catheter may vary with the extent and location of the stricture and whether the procedure is being performed in a single stage or in two stages. Individuals with lichen sclerosis related stricture disease should not use penile or genital skin for the urethroplasty due to possible involvement of this tissue with the lichen sclerosis. ''Erectile dysfunction'' may occur transiently after urethroplasty with resolution in nearly all affected individuals by six months postoperative. Ejaculatory dysfunction (pooling of semen, decreased ejaculatory force, discomfort with ejaculation, and decreased semen volume) is reported in up to 21% of men follow urethroplasty for bulbar urethral strictures.''Pelvic ''fractures'' may results in urethral injury and subsequent stricture. The risk of developing a stricture is related to the initial treatment of the injury. If a suprapubic tube is placed at the time of the pelvic injury, there is a high likelihood that a stricture will form. The stricture is repaired when the patient has healed from the other injuries and is treated with excision of the stricture and reapproximation of the ends of the urethra. In some cases, a catheter is able to be passed through the urethral injury into the bladder (primary realignment) at the time of injury, and the urethra is allowed to heal over the catheter. This realignment of the urethra decreases the risk of urethral stricture formation by about 30% and makes surgery for repair of the stricture, if it occurs, easier. Success rates with repairs of urethral strictures from pelvic ''fractures'' is about 90%-98% with excision of the stricture and bringing the ends of the urethra together (reapproximation). Complications of pelvic fractures include bleeding, infection, and ''erectile dysfunction''. Complications of the urethral stricture repair include bleeding, infection, and urinary ''incontinence''.''In select circumstances, a perineal urethrostomy may be preferred as a long-term treatment alternative to urethroplasty. A perineal urethrostomy involves making an incision into the urethra, urethrothrotomy, and opening the urethra and sewing it to the perineum (anterior to the rectum and behind the scrotum). With a perineal urethrostomy, the individual would sit on the toilet to urinate.''The treating ''urologist'' would recommend the procedure that would be the best option for each individual. As with any medical procedures, there are some degrees of risks and complications associated with any of these operations.' urethral dilation, direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU), urethral stent placement, and open urethral reconstruction."
What is the recovery period after surgery to repair a urethral stricture?,"'The recovery period after surgery will vary with the procedure performed, duration of catheterization, surgeon preference, and overall health status. A catheter (Foley catheter) is left in the penis after almost all surgeries for treatment of a urethral stricture. How long the catheter remains in place will depend on the procedure performed and surgeon preference. Typically, the catheter is left in place for at least 72 hours. In some cases, a suprapubic tube (tube that goes through the lower abdomen into the bladder) may be left in place to drain the urine in addition to the catheter. With less invasive procedures, the duration may be shorter. The discomfort related to the procedure will also vary with much less discomfort with the less invasive procedures, urethral dilation, and internal urethrotomy. With the more extensive surgery, urethroplasty, a more prolonged course can be expected, varying with the extent of the surgery. Procedures such as dilation and internal urethrotomy are outpatient procedures, whereas more complex repairs may be associated with an overnight stay in the hospital. Follow-up is required after urethroplasty to ensure that the repair is healing well and complications such as a fistula (communication between the urethra and the skin), recurrent stricture, and ''diverticulum'' (outpouching of the urethra) are identified and treated if they occur.' "
How are urethral strictures followed after repair?,"'There is a risk of recurrence of the urethral stricture, and thus follow-up is essential. The physician will ask questions about the force of urine stream, frequency of urination, feeling of complete or incomplete bladder emptying, direction of the urine stream, and other symptoms of urethral strictures. During such follow-up visits, you may be asked to void into a special collection device, uroflow, to measure the speed of urination and the flow of urination. A small ultrasound probe may be placed on the lower part of the abdomen after urination to measure the amount of urine remaining in the bladder (post-void residual). In some cases, a cystoscopy may be performed to look directly at the area of urethra that was repaired.''Urethral strictures in children may result from ''diaper'' irritation (meatal stenosis), trauma, prior surgery or instrumentation, or may be congenital. They will often appear with similar symptoms as those in adults.''Meatal stenosis is a narrowing of the opening at the tip of the penis and is felt to occur from diaper irritation in circumcised boys.

What is a urinalysis?,"""A urinalysis is simply an analysis of the urine. It is a very common test that can be performed in many health care settings, including doctors' offices, urgent care facilities, laboratories, hospitals, and even at home.""'A urinalysis test is performed by collecting a urine sample from the patient in a specimen cup. Usually only small amounts (30-60 mL) may be required for urinalysis testing. The sample can be either analyzed in the medical clinic or sent to a laboratory to perform the tests. Urinalysis is abbreviated UA.''UA is in general easily available and relatively inexpensive. It is also a simple test and can provide many useful information about various diseases and conditions. Some physicians refer to urinalysis as ""a poor man\'s kidney biopsy"" because of the plethora of information that can be obtained about the health of the kidney or other internal diseases by this simple test.''Urine can be evaluated by its physical appearance (color, cloudiness, odor, clarity), also referred to as a macroscopic analysis. It can be also analyzed based on its chemical and molecular properties, including microscopic assessment.''Urinalysis is ordered by doctors for a number of reasons, including the following:'   Routine medical evaluation: general yearly screening, assessment before surgery (preoperative assessment), admission to hospital, screening for kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (high blood pressure), liver disease, etc. Assessing particular symptoms: abdominal pain, painful urination, flank pain, fever, blood in the urine (hematuria), or other urinary symptoms. Diagnosing medical conditions: urinary tract infections, kidney stones, uncontrolled diabetes (high blood sugars), kidney impairment, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), protein in urine (proteinuria), drug screening, and kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis). Monitoring disease progression and response to therapy: diabetes related kidney disease, kidney impairment, lupus related kidney disease, blood pressure related kidney disease, kidney infection, proteinuria, and hematuria Pregnancy testing"
What can urinalysis results show?,"'Urinalysis can disclose evidence of diseases, even some that have not caused significant signs or symptoms. Therefore, a urinalysis is commonly a part of routine health screening.''Urinalysis is commonly used to diagnose a urinary tract or kidney infection, to evaluate causes of ''kidney failure'', to screen for progression of some chronic conditions such as ''diabetes'' mellitus and ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''It also may be used in combination with other tests to diagnose some diseases. Additional tests and clinical assessment are often required to further investigate findings of urinalysis and ultimately diagnose the causes or specific features of underlying problems. For example, urine infection is generally diagnosed based on results of urinalysis. However, urine culture is often ordered as a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the bacteria that may be causing the infection. Other examples include kidney stones, inflammation or the kidneys (glomerulonephritis), or muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).'  "
Who is involved in the interpretation of urinalysis?,'Interpretation of urinalysis is generally based on reviewing all the components of the test and correlating it with the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient and the physical examination. The results are reviewed and interpreted by the doctor who ordered the test.' 
What types of doctors perform urinalysis?,"'Many types of doctors may order a urinalysis in their practice. Because of easy availability, relatively nominal cost, simplicity of performing the test, and quick turnaround time, UA is done in many settings by variety of doctors. Most frequently, UA is ordered by internists, family practitioners, emergency-room physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, nephrologists (kidney specialists), urologists, ''rheumatologists'', and possibly less often by many other specialists.' "
What does urinalysis involve?,"'Urinalysis is done by collecting a urine sample from a patient. The optimal sample tends to be an early morning urine sample because it is frequently the most concentrated urine produced in the day. Typically, no fasting is required before the collection of urine sample and routine medications can be taken before the test, unless otherwise instructed by the ordering physician.''Methods of collection are slightly different for female and male patient.''The collected urine sample should be taken to the laboratory for analysis, typically within one hour of collection. If transportation to the lab could take more than one hour, then the sample may be refrigerated.''In some patients who are unable to void spontaneously or those who are not able to follow instructions other methods may be used, such as placing a catheter (a small rubber tube) through the outside opening to the bladder (urethra) to collect the sample directly from the bladder.' For females, the patient is asked to clean the area around the urethra with a special cleansing wipe, by spreading the labia of the external genitals and cleaning from front to back (toward the anus). The cleaning hand is then used to maintain the spread while the cup is held by the other hand to collect the sample. For men, the tip of the penis may be wiped with a cleansing pad prior to collection. The urine is then collected in a clean urine specimen cup while the patient is urinating. It is best to avoid collecting the initial stream of urine. After the initial part of urine is disposed of in the toilet, then the urine is collected in the urine container provided. Once about 30 mL to 60 mL (roughly 3 to 5 tablespoons) are collected in the container for testing, the remainder of the urine may be voided in the toilet again. This is called the midstream clean catch urine collection."
What is macroscopic urinalysis?,"'Macroscopic urinalysis is the direct visual observation of the urine, noting its quantity, color, clarity or cloudiness, etc.''Normal urine is typically light yellow and clear without any cloudiness. Obvious abnormalities in the color, clarity, and cloudiness may suggest possibility of''Certain medications may also change the color of urine (for example, ''phenazopyridine'', a urinary antiseptic and ''pain reliever''). Very foamy urine may represent large amounts of ''protein in the urine'' (proteinuria).' an infection (cloudy urine), dehydration (dark urine color), liver disease (""bilirubin,"" a digestive substance secreted by the liver, stains urine a tea or cola color), blood in the urine (hematuria -- visible to the eye may indicate urinary tract infection, stones, tumors, or injuries), or breakdown of muscle (orange- or tea-colored urine)."
What is urine test strip chemical analysis?,"'Urine test strip\xa0is a narrow ''plastic'' strip which has several squares of different colors attached to it. Each small square represents a component of the test used to interpret urinalysis. The entire test strip is dipped in the urine sample and color changes in each square are noted. The color change takes place after several seconds to a few minutes from dipping the strip. If read too early or too long after the urinalysis strip is dipped, the results may not be accurate.''Each color change on a particular square may indicate specific abnormalities in the urine sample caused by a certain chemical reaction. The reference for color changes is posted on the plastic bottle container of the urine test strips. This makes for easy and quick interpretation of the urinalysis results by placing the strip next to the container and comparing its color changes to the reference provided.''The squares on the dipstick represent the following components in the urine:''Presence or absence of each of these color changes on the strip provides important information for clinical decisions.''After the dipstick test strip is dipped in urine briefly and completely, the reading is done within a few minutes. Each one of the squares on the box has next to it the time which is recommended for its interpretation (for example, whether these is a change in color on the square). The squares are placed in similar order on the box, from the ones requiring the shortest time to read of 30 seconds to the ones with the longest time to read of two minutes. This arrangement is based on result time and makes it easier to quickly read and interpret any color changes by simply scanning the strip from the shortest (glucose) to the longest (leukocytes).' Specific gravity (concentration of urine) Acidity of the urine (pH levels) Protein in the urine (proteinuria), mainly albumin Glucose (sugar) in the urine (glycosuria) Ketones in the urine (ketonuria), products of fat metabolism Hemoglobin/blood in the urine (hematuria) Leukocyte esterase (suggestive of white blood cells in urine) Nitrite (suggestive of bacteria in urine) Bilirubin (possible liver disease or red blood cell breakdown) Urobilinogen (possible liver disease or etodolac [Lodine] medication)"
What are the pros and cons of urine test strip?,"""The main advantage of a urine test strip is that they are convenient, easy to interpret, and cost-effective. They can be analyzed within minutes of urine collection in the doctor's office or in the emergency room to provide valuable information.""'However, what can be learned from a dipstick is limited by the design of the dipstick. The main disadvantage is that the information may not be very accurate, as the test is time-sensitive. It also provides limited information about the urine, as it is qualitative test and not a quantitative test (for example, it does not give a precise measure of the quantity of abnormality). Therefore, normal and abnormal values are not reported as part of urinalysis results.' "
What is microscopic urinalysis?,"'The microscopic urinalysis is the study of the urine sample under a microscope. It requires only a relatively inexpensive light microscope. Cells and cellular debris, bacteria, and crystals in the urine (crystalluria) can be detected by microscopic examination to provide confirmation of the dipstick color change (see above) and further clinical clues.' "
How is microscopic urinalysis done?,"'Microscopic urinalysis is done simply pouring the urine sample into a test tube and centrifuging it (spinning it down in a machine) for a few minutes. The top liquid part (the supernatant) is discarded. The solid part left in the bottom of the test tube (the urine sediment) is mixed with the remaining drop of urine in the test tube and one drop is analyzed under a microscope.''The sediment is examined through the microscope under low-power to identify what are called casts, crystals, squamous (flat) cells, and other large objects.''Examination is then performed through the microscope at higher power to further identify any cells, bacteria and clumps of cells or debris called casts.' "
What kind of cells can be detected?,"'Epithelial cells (flat cells), red and white blood cells may be seen in the urine.''Sometimes cells, cellular debris, and casts are seen in the microscopic exam. Epithelial cells (cells in the lining of the bladder or urethra) may suggest inflammation within the bladder, but they also may originate from the skin and could be contamination.''Casts and cellular debris originate from higher up in the urinary tract, such as in the kidneys. These are material shed from kidney cell lining due to injury or inflammation and travel down through the urinary tubes. These usually suggest an injury to the kidney from an inflammation or lack of blood flow to the kidneys. Rarely, ''tumor'' cells can be in the urine suggesting a urinary tract ''cancer''.' "
What can the presence of red blood cells in the urine mean?,"'Red blood cells'' can enter the urine from the vagina in ''menstruation'' or from the ''trauma'' of bladder catheterization.''A high count of red blood cells in the urine can indicate infection, trauma, tumors, or kidney stones. If red blood cells seen under microscopy look distorted, they suggest kidney as the possible source and may arise due to kidney inflammation (glomerulonephritis). Small amounts of red blood cells in the urine are sometimes seen young healthy people and usually are not indicative of any disease.' "
What can the presence of white blood cells in the urine mean?,"'Urine is a generally thought of as a sterile body fluid, therefore, evidence of white blood cells or bacteria in the urine is considered abnormal and may suggest a ''urinary tract infection'' such as, ''bladder infection'' (''cystitis''), infection of kidney (''pyelonephritis''). White blood cells (WBC) may be detected in the urine through a microscopic examination (pyuria or leukocytes in the blood). They can be seen under high power field and the number of cells are recorded (quantitative) as ""rare, few, moderate, or many.""''White cells from the vagina or the opening of the urethra (in males, too) can contaminate a urine sample. Such contamination aside, the presence of abnormal numbers of white blood cells in the urine is significant.' "
"Other than urinalysis, what are other common urine tests available?","'Other commonly performed urine tests are drug tests, ''pregnancy tests'', specific chemicals and proteins in the body, which are not a part of routine urinalysis.''Urine drug screen is done routinely to check for ''drugs'' or their byproducts in the urine. There are many purposes for these tests including athletic screening, emergency rooms settings, drug detoxification programs, school and employment screening. This test detects the presence of commonly used drugs such as''Urine ''pregnancy test'' is very common and it measures a hormone in the urine associated with pregnancy (beta-HCG or beta- human chorionic gonadotropin). This test can be done in medical settings, but numerous kits are available for home use.''Other urine tests can also be used in evaluation of many medical conditions. Examples include' cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, marijuana, phencyclidine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and opiates. urine culture (in determining the bacterial cause of urine infection), urine creatinine (in assessing kidney disease), urine total protein and albumin (in assessing kidney disease and protein loss from kidney), urine cytology (in evaluating for possible bladder or other urinary tumors), urine calcium (in evaluating elevated blood calcium levels), 24-hour urine collection for proteins (in diagnosing causes of kidney impairment, diabetic related kidney disease, lupus related kidney disease), 24-hour urine collection for protein electrophoresis (for measuring different components of proteins in urine in evaluating multiple myeloma, kidney inflammation with increased protein loss), or 24-hour urine collection of catecholamine metabolites (in evaluating adrenal gland disease, difficult to treat high blood pressure)."
Urinary incontinence (UI) introduction,"'Urinary ''incontinence'' (UI) is the accidental leakage of urine. At different ages, males and females have different risks for developing UI. In childhood, girls usually develop bladder control at an earlier age than boys, and ''bedwetting'' -- or ''nocturnal enuresis'' -- is less common in girls than in boys. However, adult women are far more likely than adult men to experience UI because of anatomical differences in the pelvic region and the changes induced by ''pregnancy'' and ''childbirth''. Nevertheless, many men do suffer from incontinence. Its prevalence increases with age, but UI is not an inevitable part of ''aging''.''UI is a treatable problem. To find a treatment that addresses the root of the problem, you need to talk with your health care provider. The three forms of UI are' stress incontinence, which is the involuntary loss of urine during actions -- such as coughing, sneezing, and lifting -- that put abdominal pressure on the bladder urge incontinence, which is the involuntary loss of urine following an overwhelming urge to urinate that cannot be halted overflow incontinence, which is the constant dribbling of urine usually associated with urinating frequently and in small amounts"
What causes urinary incontinence (UI) in men?,"'For the urinary system to do its job, muscles and nerves must work together to hold urine in the bladder and then release it at the right time.''Any disease, condition, or injury that damages nerves can lead to urination problems. Nerve problems can occur at any age.''The prostate is a male gland about the size and shape of a walnut. It surrounds the urethra just below the bladder, where it adds fluid to semen before ejaculation.''If your prostate could be involved in your incontinence, your health care provider may ask you a series of standardized questions, either the International Prostate Symptom Score or the American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Scale. Some of the questions you will be asked for the AUA Symptom Scale will be the following:''Your answers to these questions may help identify the problem or determine which tests are needed. Your symptom score evaluation can be used as a baseline to see how effective later treatments are at relieving those symptoms.'   Men who have had diabetes for many years may develop nerve damage that affects their bladder control. Stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis all affect the brain and nervous system, so they can also cause bladder emptying problems. Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder squeezes at the wrong time. The condition may be caused by nerve problems, or it may occur without any clear cause. A person with overactive bladder may have any two or all three of the following symptoms:urinary frequency -- urination eight or more times a day or two or more times at nighturinary urgency -- the sudden, strong need to urinate immediatelyurge incontinence -- urine leakage that follows a sudden, strong urge to urinate urinary frequency -- urination eight or more times a day or two or more times at night urinary urgency -- the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately urge incontinence -- urine leakage that follows a sudden, strong urge to urinate Spinal cord injury may affect bladder emptying by interrupting the nerve signals required for bladder control. BPH: The prostate gland commonly becomes enlarged as a man ages. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or benign prostatic hypertrophy. As the prostate enlarges, it may squeeze the urethra and affect the flow of the urinary stream. The lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with the development of BPH rarely occur before age 40, but more than half of men in their sixties and up to 90 percent in their seventies and eighties have some LUTS. The symptoms vary, but the most common ones involve changes or problems with urination, such as a hesitant, interrupted, weak stream; urgency and leaking or dribbling; more frequent urination, especially at night; and urge incontinence. Problems with urination do not necessarily signal blockage caused by an enlarged prostate. Women don't usually have urinary hesitancy and a weak stream or dribbling. Radical prostatectomy: The surgical removal of the entire prostate gland -- called radical prostatectomy -- is one treatment for prostate cancer. In some cases, the surgery may lead to erection problems and UI. External beam radiation: This procedure is another treatment method for prostate cancer. The treatment may result in either temporary or permanent bladder problems. Over the past month or so, how often have you had to urinate again in less than 2 hours? Over the past month or so, from the time you went to bed at night until the time you got up in the morning, how many times did you typically get up to urinate? Over the past month or so, how often have you had a sensation of not emptying your bladder completely after you finished urinating? Over the past month or so, how often have you had a weak urinary stream? Over the past month or so, how often have you had to push or strain to begin urinating?"
How is urinary incontinence (UI) in men diagnosed?,"'The first step in solving a urinary problem is talking with your health care provider. Your general medical history, including any major illnesses or surgeries, and details about your continence problem and when it started will help your doctor determine the cause. You should talk about how much fluid you drink a day and whether you use ''alcohol'' or ''caffeine''. You should also talk about the medicines you take, both prescription and nonprescription, because they might be part of the problem.''You may be asked to keep a voiding diary, which is a record of fluid intake and trips to the bathroom, plus any episodes of leakage. Studying the diary will give your health care provider a better idea of your problem and help direct additional tests.''A physical exam will check for ''prostate enlargement'' or nerve damage. In a digital rectal exam, the doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum and feels the part of the prostate next to it. This exam gives the doctor a general idea of the size and condition of the gland. To check for nerve damage, the doctor may ask about tingling sensations or feelings of numbness and may check for changes in sensation, muscle tone, and reflexes.''Your doctor might recommend other tests, including an ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG''), a test where wires are taped to the forehead to sense dysfunction in the brain. In an ''electromyogram'' (''EMG''), the wires are taped to the lower abdomen to measure nerve activity in muscles and muscular activity that may be related to loss of bladder control.''For an ultrasound, or sonography, a technician holds a device, called a transducer, that sends harmless sound waves into the body and catches them as they bounce back off the organs inside to create a picture on a monitor. In abdominal ultrasound, the technician slides the transducer over the surface of your abdomen for images of the bladder and kidneys. In transrectal ultrasound, the technician uses a wand inserted in the rectum for images of the prostate.'""Urodynamic testing focuses on the bladder's ability to store urine and empty steadily and completely, and on your sphincter control mechanism. It can also show whether the bladder is having abnormal contractions that cause leakage. The testing involves measuring pressure in the bladder as it is filled with fluid through a small catheter. This test can help identify limited bladder capacity, bladder overactivity or underactivity, weak sphincter muscles, or urinary obstruction. If the test is performed with EMG surface pads, it can also detect abnormal nerve signals and uncontrolled bladder contractions."" "
How is urinary incontinence (UI) in men treated?,"'No single treatment works for everyone. Your treatment will depend on the type and severity of your problem, your lifestyle, and your preferences, starting with the simpler treatment options. Many men regain urinary control by changing a few habits and doing exercises to strengthen the muscles that hold urine in the bladder. If these behavioral treatments do not work, you may choose to try medicines or a continence device -- either an artificial sphincter or a catheter. For some men, surgery is the best choice.''For some men, avoiding incontinence is as simple as limiting fluids at certain times of the day or planning regular trips to the bathroom -- a therapy called timed voiding or bladder training. As you gain control, you can extend the time between trips. Bladder training also includes Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles, which help hold urine in the bladder. Extensive studies have not yet conclusively shown that Kegel exercises are effective in reducing incontinence in men, but many clinicians find them to be an important element in therapy for men.'  "
What medications relieve pain and treat urinary incontinence in men?,"'If changing medicines is not an option, your doctor may choose from the following types of ''drugs'' for incontinence:' Alpha-blockers: Terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax), and alfzosin (Uroxatral) are used to treat problems caused by prostate enlargement and bladder outlet obstruction. They act by relaxing the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, allowing normal urine flow and preventing abnormal bladder contractions that can lead to urge incontinence. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: Finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart) work by inhibiting the production of the male hormone DHT, which is thought to be responsible for prostate enlargement. These 5-alpha reductase inhibitors may help to relieve voiding problems by shrinking an enlarged prostate. Imipramine: Marketed as Tofranil, this drug belongs to a class of drugs called tricyclic antidepressants. It relaxes muscles and blocks nerve signals that might cause bladder spasms. Antispasmodics: propantheline (Pro-Banthine), tolterodine (Detrol LA), oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), darifenacin (Enablex), trospium chloride (Sanctura), and solifenacin succinate (VESIcare) belong to a class of drugs that work by relaxing the bladder muscle and relieving spasms. Their most common side effect Is is dry mouth Large doses of antispasmodics may cause:Blurred visionConstipation.A fast heartbeatHeadacheFlushing Blurred vision Constipation. A fast heartbeat Headache Flushing"
How do you do Kegel exercises?,"  The first step is to find the right muscles. Imagine that you are trying to stop yourself from passing gas. Squeeze the muscles you would use. If you sense a ""pulling"" feeling, those are the right muscles for pelvic exercises. Do not squeeze other muscles at the same time or hold your breath. Also, be careful not to tighten your stomach, leg, or buttock muscles. Squeezing the wrong muscles can put more pressure on your bladder control muscles. Squeeze just the pelvic muscles. Pull in the pelvic muscles and hold for a count of 3. Then relax for a count of 3. Repeat, but do not overdo it. Work up to 3 sets of 10 repeats. Start doing your pelvic muscle exercises lying down. This position is the easiest for doing Kegel exercises because the muscles then do not need to work against gravity. When your muscles get stronger, do your exercises sitting or standing. Working against gravity is like adding more weight. Be patient. Do not give up. It takes just 5 minutes, three times a day. Your bladder control may not improve for 3 to 6 weeks, although most people notice an improvement after a few weeks."

What is urinary incontinence?,"'Very simply stated, urinary incontinence is defined as the loss of complete control of the act of urination or the involuntary emptying of the bladder. It is also referred to as enuresis. It can be caused by any number of factors, and in young infants and toddlers, it is usually completely normal. In order to understand the different causes better, one must have some basic understanding of the processes involved in urination' "
How does the urinary system work?,"'The urinary system is made up of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Urine is produced by the kidneys and drains via the ureters to the bladder. The bladder serves as the storage tank, stowing the urine until emptied through micturition (urinating). The act of emptying the bladder requires significant coordination between the brain, nerves, and muscles. There are two major muscles involved in urination, the detrusor and the sphincter. The detrusor is a large muscle which contracts to squeeze urine out of the bladder, and the sphincter is a group of muscles which remains contracted to keep urine in the bladder. These two muscles must work in concert, one contracting while the other relaxes, to control the flow of urine. Dysfunction in either may result in some degree of loss of urinary control. The urethra serves as the canal which carries the urine from the bladder during voiding. Achieving bladder control must be learned, and some children learn earlier than others, and therefore urinary incontinence is normal in most young infants and children, but in older children and adolescents, it is not considered normal.' "
What are the different types of urinary incontinence in children?,"'It is easiest to divide childhood enuresis into two groups. ''Nocturnal enuresis'' occurs during ''sleep'' and diurnal (daytime) enuresis occurs during waking hours. ''Nocturnal'' enuresis is often referred to as ''bedwetting'' and is the most common type of urinary incontinence in children over 5 years of age. Diurnal enuresis is more often seen in younger children and more often a result of certain behaviors, though rarely it can be a sign of more serious problems. Another way to categorize incontinence is by the timing of the symptoms. If a child has good daytime bladder control but has never had a dry night, it is referred to as primary enuresis. Secondary enuresis is incontinence in an individual who has been dry for at least six months and then develops symptoms after that period.' "
How common is urinary incontinence in children?,"'Studies indicate that 20% of all 5-year-old children and 10% of 7-year-olds wet the bed, and of these, up to 20% also have some degree of daytime incontinence. In addition, nocturnal enuresis is more common in boys, and diurnal incontinence is more common in girls. Secondary enuresis accounts for about one-quarter of all cases and is most often associated with some psychological stressor or ''anxiety''.' "
What causes nighttime incontinence in children?,"'Any number of normal and abnormal things can cause nocturnal enuresis in children. Boys are more commonly affected than girls. Most young children who suffer from bedwetting are physically and emotionally normal. Although the exact cause is unknown, the bedwetting is believed to be the result of a number of nonorganic factors, including developmental issues, overproduction of urine, and an inability to respond to the normal physiological signals associated with bladder distension while asleep. Since bedwetting does run in families, experts believe there is a genetic disposition as well and if a parent experienced nocturnal enuresis as a child, there is a 45% risk that their child will also suffer from bedwetting. In addition to nonorganic causes, there are also some less common organic causes including infection, anatomic abnormalities, neurologic abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities such as ''diabetes mellitus''.'  "
What causes daytime incontinence in children?,"'Common causes of daytime wetting include voluntary holding of urine, ''urinary tract infection'', ''constipation'', and wetting with giggling. Girls are more commonly affected than boys. Less common causes include more serious issues such as neurological causes (neurogenic bladder), urinary tract anatomic abnormalities, and ''diabetes'"". Voluntary holding of urine is the most common cause of daytime wetting in young children. This is often observed in 3- to 5-year-olds who don't want to take the time to use the toilet. They are just too busy to take a break and will often fidget, squirm, and hold on to their perineal areas. Most children grow out of this on their own as they get older.""  "
How do you differentiate between organic and nonorganic causes of urinary incontinence?,"'It is important to recognize that most cases of urinary incontinence are caused by nonorganic problems, but since there are organic causes, physicians may evaluate affected children with some basic studies. Evaluation always begins with a complete history and physical exam. This differentiates between the otherwise healthy child and the child with underlying disease. The clinician will probably ask about psychological stressors, such as starting a new school, the birth of a sibling, or parental strife. In addition, in order to evaluate the severity of the symptoms, parents will be encouraged to keep a voiding diary. These are diaries which document the number of daytime voids, volumes, timing, and relationship with eating and drinking. In addition, these diaries should document the frequency of daytime wetting or nighttime wetting. Besides the history, physical, and diary, a ''urinalysis'' can be helpful to screen for organic causes, such as ''diabetes'' and ''urinary tract infections''. For children with significant daytime symptoms, ''ultrasound'' imaging of the urinary tract including bladder and kidneys may be needed to evaluate for anatomic abnormalities. Lastly and rarely, if a neurological cause is suspected, an ''MRI'' of the spine may be indicated to evaluate for spinal cord abnormalities.' "
What is the treatment for urinary incontinence in children?,"'The treatment of urinary incontinence depends upon the underlying cause of the problem. The primary treatment for nocturnal enuresis most commonly involves behavioral modification. This involves positive reinforcement, encouraging frequent daytime voiding, and periodically waking the child at night, restricting fluid intake prior to bed, and alarm therapy with devices that wake the child when the underwear or bedclothes have become wet. In all cases, most children are already embarrassed by bedwetting and it is important try to reduce the social and psychological impact of the condition. Moisture alarm therapy has a high success rate and works best for motivated older children and parents. The basic process involves placing a probe in the undergarments or bed which alarms when it senses wetness. Most children will ''sleep'"" through the alarm; however, most stop voiding when the alarm goes off. The child's parent must get up and help the child to the bathroom to encourage voiding, change the wet sheets and pajamas, and reset the alarm. Moisture alarms generally work within two weeks to three months and should be discontinued if the child's symptoms persist after three months.""'In addition to behavioral modification, there are some children who will ultimate require medication. Most commonly used medications include ''desmopressin acetate'' (''DDAVP''), ''oxybutynin'' chloride (Ditropan), ''hyoscyamine'' sulphate (''Levsin''), and ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil''). All of these medications have significant potential for side effects, should be reserved for a very select population, and should be used to treat the symptoms not as a cure, while awaiting natural resolution. Medications can be used intermittently for children who attend overnight camp or for sleepovers since these are 70% effective in preventing the symptoms, and bedwetting in these environments can be humiliating and ''stress''-producing for children.' "
What is the prognosis of urinary incontinence in children?,"'The prognosis of urinary incontinence is dependent upon the underlying cause, however, most children who suffer from nonorganic causes of enuresis will simply outgrow the symptoms, and less than 1% of all affected children have persistent enuresis into their adult years.' "

What is urinary incontinence?,"'Millions of women experience involuntary loss of urine called urinary incontinence (UI). Some women may lose a few drops of urine while ''running'' or ''coughing''. Others may feel a strong, sudden urge to urinate just before losing a large amount of urine. Many women experience both symptoms. UI can be slightly bothersome or totally debilitating. For some women, the risk of public embarrassment keeps them from enjoying many activities with their family and friends. Urine loss can also occur during sexual activity and cause tremendous emotional distress.''Women experience UI twice as often as men. Pregnancy and ''childbirth'', ''menopause'', and the structure of the female urinary tract account for this difference. But both women and men can become ''incontinent'' from neurologic injury, ''birth defects'', ''stroke'', ''multiple sclerosis'', and physical problems associated with ''aging''.''Older women experience UI more often than younger women. But incontinence is not inevitable with age. UI is a medical problem. Your doctor or nurse can help you find a solution. No single treatment works for everyone, but many women can find improvement without surgery.''Incontinence occurs because of problems with muscles and nerves that help to hold or release urine. The body stores urine -- water and wastes removed by the kidneys -- in the bladder, a balloon-like organ. The bladder connects to the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body.''During urination, muscles in the wall of the bladder contract, forcing urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time, sphincter muscles surrounding the urethra relax, letting urine pass out of the body. Incontinence will occur if your bladder muscles suddenly contract or the sphincter muscles are not strong enough to hold back urine. Urine may escape with less pressure than usual if the muscles are damaged, causing a change in the position of the bladder. ''Obesity'', which is associated with increased abdominal pressure, can worsen incontinence. Fortunately, ''weight loss'' can reduce its severity.'  "
What are the types of incontinence?,"'If coughing, laughing, ''sneezing'', or other movements that put pressure on the bladder cause you to leak urine, you may have stress incontinence. Physical changes resulting from pregnancy, ''childbirth'', and ''menopause'' often cause stress incontinence. This type of incontinence is common in women and, in many cases, can be treated.''Childbirth and other events can injure the scaffolding that helps support the bladder in women. Pelvic floor muscles, the vagina, and ligaments support your bladder (see figure 2). If these structures weaken, your bladder can move downward, pushing slightly out of the bottom of the pelvis toward the vagina. This prevents muscles that ordinarily force the urethra shut from squeezing as tightly as they should. As a result, urine can leak into the urethra during moments of physical stress. Stress incontinence also occurs if the squeezing muscles weaken.''Stress incontinence can worsen during the week before your ''menstrual period''. At that time, lowered estrogen levels might lead to lower muscular pressure around the urethra, increasing chances of leakage. The incidence of stress incontinence increases following menopause.''If you lose urine for no apparent reason after suddenly feeling the need or urge to urinate, you may have urge incontinence. A common cause of urge incontinence is inappropriate bladder contractions. Abnormal nerve signals might be the cause of these ''bladder spasms''.''Urge incontinence can mean that your bladder empties during ''sleep'', after drinking a small amount of water, or when you touch water or hear it running (as when washing dishes or ''hearing'' someone else taking a shower). Certain fluids and medications such as diuretics or emotional states such as ''anxiety'' can worsen this condition. Some medical conditions, such as ''hyperthyroidism'' and uncontrolled ''diabetes'', can also lead to or worsen urge incontinence.''Involuntary actions of bladder muscles can occur because of damage to the nerves of the bladder, to the nervous system (spinal cord and brain), or to the muscles themselves. ''Multiple sclerosis'', '""Parkinson's""' disease, '""Alzheimer's""' disease, ''stroke'', and injury -- including injury that occurs during surgery -- all can harm bladder nerves or muscles.''Overactive bladder occurs when abnormal nerves send signals to the bladder at the wrong time, causing its muscles to squeeze without warning. Voiding up to seven times a day is normal for many women, but women with overactive bladder may find that they must urinate even more frequently.''Specifically, the ''symptoms of overactive bladder'' include''People with medical problems that interfere with thinking, moving, or communicating may have trouble reaching a toilet. A person with '""Alzheimer's""' disease, for example, may not think well enough to plan a timely trip to a restroom. A person in a wheelchair may have a hard time getting to a toilet in time. Functional incontinence is the result of these physical and medical conditions. Conditions such as ''arthritis'' often develop with age and account for some of the incontinence of elderly women in ''nursing'' homes.'""Overflow incontinence happens when the bladder doesn't empty properly, causing it to spill over. Your doctor can check for this problem. Weak bladder muscles or a blocked urethra can cause this type of incontinence. Nerve damage from ""'diabetes'' or other diseases can lead to weak bladder muscles; tumors and urinary stones can block the urethra. Overflow incontinence is rare in women.'""Stress and urge incontinence often occur together in women. Combinations of incontinence -- and this combination in particular -- are sometimes referred to as mixed incontinence. Most women don't have pure stress or urge incontinence, and many studies show that mixed incontinence is the most common type of urine loss in women.""'Transient incontinence is a temporary version of incontinence. Medications, ''urinary tract infections'', mental impairment, and restricted mobility can all trigger transient incontinence. Severe ''constipation'' can cause transient incontinence when the impacted ''stool'' pushes against the urinary tract and obstructs outflow. A ''cold'' can trigger incontinence, which resolves once the coughing spells cease.'   urinary  frequency -- bothersome urination eight or more times a day or two or more times at night urinary  urgency -- the sudden, strong need to urinate immediately urge  incontinence -- leakage or gushing of urine that follows a sudden, strong urge nocturia -- awaking at night to urinate"
How is incontinence evaluated?,"'The first step toward relief is to see a doctor who has experience treating incontinence to learn what type you have. A ''urologist'' specializes in the urinary tract, and some urologists further specialize in the female urinary tract. Gynecologists and obstetricians specialize in the female reproductive tract and childbirth. A urogynecologist focuses on urinary and associated pelvic problems in women. Family practitioners and internists see patients for all kinds of health conditions. Any of these doctors may be able to help you. In addition, some nurses and other health care providers often provide rehabilitation services and teach behavioral therapies such as fluid management and pelvic floor strengthening.''To diagnose the problem, your doctor will first ask about symptoms and medical history. Your pattern of voiding and urine leakage may suggest the type of incontinence you have. Thus, many specialists begin with having you fill out a bladder diary over several days. These diaries can reveal obvious factors that can help define the problem -- including straining and discomfort, fluid intake, use of ''drugs'', recent surgery, and illness. Often you can begin treatment at the first medical visit.''Your doctor may instruct you to keep a diary for a day or more -- sometimes up to a week -- to record when you void. This diary should note the times you urinate and the amounts of urine you produce. To measure your urine, you can use a special pan that fits over the toilet rim. You can also use the bladder diary to record your fluid intake, episodes of urine leakage, and estimated amounts of leakage.''If your diary and medical history do not define the problem, they will at least suggest which tests you need.''Your doctor will physically examine you for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence, including treatable blockages from bowel or pelvic growths. In addition, ''weakness'' of the pelvic floor leading to incontinence may cause a condition called prolapse, where the vagina or bladder begins to protrude out of your body. This condition is also important to diagnose at the time of an evaluation.''Your doctor may measure your bladder capacity. The doctor may also measure the residual urine for evidence of poorly functioning bladder muscles. To do this, you will urinate into a measuring pan, after which the nurse or doctor will measure any urine remaining in the bladder. Your doctor may also recommend other tests:'  Bladder stress  test -- You cough vigorously as the doctor watches for loss of urine from the urinary opening. Urinalysis and urine culture -- Laboratory technicians test your urine for evidence of infection, urinary stones, or other contributing causes. Ultrasound -- This test uses sound waves to create an image of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Cystoscopy -- The doctor inserts a thin tube with a tiny camera in the urethra to see inside the urethra and bladder. Urodynamics -- Various techniques measure pressure in the bladder and the flow of urine."
How is incontinence treated?,"'By looking at your bladder diary, the doctor may see a pattern and suggest making it a point to use the bathroom at regular timed intervals, a habit called timed voiding. As you gain control, you can extend the time between scheduled trips to the bathroom. Behavioral treatment also includes Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles that help hold in urine.''The first step is to find the right muscles. One way to find them is to imagine that you are sitting on a marble and want to pick up the marble with your vagina. Imagine sucking or drawing the marble into your vagina.'""Try not to squeeze other muscles at the same time. Be careful not to tighten your stomach, legs, or buttocks. Squeezing the wrong muscles can put more pressure on your bladder control muscles. Just squeeze the pelvic muscles. Don't hold your breath. Do not practice while urinating.""""Repeat, but don't overdo it. At first, find a quiet spot to practice -- your bathroom or bedroom -- so you can concentrate. Pull in the pelvic muscles and hold for a count of three. Then relax for a count of three. Work up to three sets of 10 repeats. Start doing your pelvic muscle exercises lying down. This is the easiest position to do them in because the muscles do not need to work against gravity. When your muscles get stronger, do your exercises sitting or standing. Working against gravity is like adding more weight.""""Be patient. Don't give up. It takes just 5 minutes a day. You may not feel your bladder control improve for 3 to 6 weeks. Still, most people do notice an improvement after a few weeks.""'Some people with nerve damage cannot tell whether they are doing Kegel exercises correctly. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or nurse to examine you while you try to do them. If it turns out that you are not squeezing the right muscles, you may still be able to learn proper Kegel exercises by doing special training with biofeedback, electrical stimulation, or both.''If you have an overactive bladder, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to block the nerve signals that cause ''frequent urination'' and urgency.''Several medicines from a class of drugs called anticholinergics can help relax bladder muscles and prevent bladder spasms. Their most common side effect is ''dry mouth'', although larger doses may cause ''blurred vision'', ''constipation'', a faster heartbeat, and flushing. Other side effects include drowsiness, ''confusion'', or ''memory loss''. If you have ''glaucoma'', ask your ophthalmologist if these drugs are safe for you.''Some medicines can affect the nerves and muscles of the urinary tract in different ways. Pills to treat swelling (''edema'') or ''high blood pressure'' may increase your urine output and contribute to bladder control problems. Talk with your doctor; you may find that taking an alternative to a medicine you already take may solve the problem without adding another prescription.''Scientists are studying other drugs and injections that have not yet received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for incontinence to see if they are effective treatments for people who were unsuccessful with behavioral therapy or pills.'""Biofeedback uses measuring devices to help you become aware of your body's functioning. By using electronic devices or diaries to track when your bladder and urethral muscles contract, you can gain control over these muscles. Biofeedback can supplement pelvic muscle exercises and electrical stimulation to relieve stress and urge incontinence.""'For urge incontinence not responding to behavioral treatments or drugs, stimulation of nerves to the bladder leaving the spine can be effective in some patients. Neuromodulation is the name of this therapy. The FDA has approved a device called InterStim for this purpose. Your doctor will need to test to determine if this device would be helpful to you. The doctor applies an external stimulator to determine if neuromodulation works in you. If you have a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, a surgeon will implant the device. Although neuromodulation can be effective, it is not for everyone. The therapy is expensive, involving surgery with possible surgical revisions and replacement.''One of the reasons for stress incontinence may be weak pelvic muscles, the muscles that hold the bladder in place and hold urine inside. A pessary is a stiff ring that a doctor or nurse inserts into the vagina, where it presses against the wall of the vagina and the nearby urethra. The pressure helps reposition the urethra, leading to less stress leakage. If you use a pessary, you should watch for possible vaginal and ''urinary tract infections'' and see your doctor regularly.''A variety of bulking agents, such as collagen and carbon spheres, are available for injection near the urinary sphincter. The doctor injects the bulking agent into tissues around the bladder neck and urethra to make the tissues thicker and close the bladder opening to reduce stress incontinence. After using local anesthesia or sedation, a doctor can inject the material in about half an hour. Over time, the body may slowly eliminate certain bulking agents, so you will need repeat injections. Before you receive an injection, a doctor may perform a skin test to determine whether you could have an ''allergic reaction'' to the material. Scientists are testing newer agents, including your own muscle cells, to see if they are effective in treating stress incontinence. Your doctor will discuss which bulking agent may be best for you.''In some women, the bladder can move out of its normal position, especially following childbirth. Surgeons have developed different techniques for supporting the bladder back to its normal position. The three main types of surgery are retropubic suspension and two types of sling procedures.''Retropubic suspension uses surgical threads called ''sutures'' to support the bladder neck. The most common retropubic suspension procedure is called the Burch procedure. In this operation, the surgeon makes an incision in the abdomen a few inches below the navel and then secures the threads to strong ligaments within the pelvis to support the urethral sphincter. This common procedure is often done at the time of an abdominal procedure such as a ''hysterectomy''.''Sling procedures are performed through a vaginal incision. The traditional sling procedure uses a strip of your own tissue called fascia to cradle the bladder neck. Some slings may consist of natural tissue or man-made material. The surgeon attaches both ends of the sling to the pubic bone or ties them in front of the abdomen just above the pubic bone.''Midurethral slings are newer procedures that you can have on an outpatient basis. These procedures use synthetic mesh materials that the surgeon places midway along the urethra. The two general types of midurethral slings are retropubic slings, such as the transvaginal tapes (TVT), and transobturator slings (TOT). The surgeon makes small incisions behind the pubic bone or just by the sides of the vaginal opening as well as a small incision in the vagina. The surgeon uses specially designed needles to position a synthetic tape under the urethra. The surgeon pulls the ends of the tape through the incisions and adjusts them to provide the right amount of support to the urethra.''If you have pelvic prolapse, your surgeon may recommend an anti-incontinence procedure with a prolapse repair and possibly a hysterectomy.'""Recent women's health studies performed with the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN) compared the suspension and sling procedures and found that, 2 years after surgery, about two-thirds of women with a sling and about half of women with a suspension were cured of stress incontinence. Women with a sling, however, had more urinary tract infections, voiding problems, and urge incontinence than women with a suspension. Overall, 86 percent of women with a sling and 78 percent of women with a suspension said they were satisfied with their results. For more information, please visit www.uitn.net. Women who are interested in joining a study for urinary incontinence can go to ""'www.ClinicalTrials.gov'' for a list of current studies recruiting patients.'""Talk with your doctor about whether surgery will help your condition and what type of surgery is best for you. The procedure you choose may depend on your own preferences or on your surgeon's experience. Ask what you should expect after the procedure. You may also wish to talk with someone who has recently had the procedure. Surgeons have described more than 200 procedures for stress incontinence, so no single surgery stands out as best.""'If you are incontinent because your bladder never empties completely -- overflow incontinence -- or your bladder cannot empty because of poor muscle tone, past surgery, or ''spinal cord injury'', you might use a catheter to empty your bladder. A catheter is a tube that you can learn to insert through the urethra into the bladder to drain urine. You may use a catheter once in a while or on a constant basis, in which case the tube connects to a bag that you can attach to your leg. If you use an indwelling -- long-term -- catheter, you should watch for possible urinary tract infections.''Many women manage urinary incontinence with menstrual pads that catch slight leakage during activities such as exercising. Also, many people find they can reduce incontinence by restricting certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and ''alcohol''.''Finally, many women are afraid to mention their problem. They may have urinary incontinence that can improve with treatment but remain silent sufferers and resort to wearing absorbent undergarments, or diapers. This practice is unfortunate, because diapering can lead to diminished self-esteem, as well as skin irritation and sores. If you are relying on diapers to manage your incontinence, you and your family should discuss with your doctor the possible effectiveness of treatments such as timed voiding and pelvic muscle exercises.'  "
Hope through research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has many research programs aimed at finding treatments for urinary disorders, including urinary incontinence. The NIDDK is sponsoring the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN), a consortium of urologists and urogynecologists who are evaluating and comparing treatment methods for stress and mixed incontinence in women. The goal of the first study, completed in 2007, was to learn which treatment methods have the best short- and long-term outcomes for treating stress urinary incontinence in women. Ongoing studies focus on treatments for urge incontinence and minimally invasive treatments for stress incontinence.''The National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development also supports research in the area of pelvic health. The Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) was formed in 2001 to do research to improve the care and daily lives of women with pelvic organ prolapse and bladder and bowel control problems.

"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "
Where can you find men's urinary incontinence products?,"'Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet.'""If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help."" "
How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems.""'Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by. They may not be a long-term solution, but they can vastly improve your quality of life right now.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is urinary retention?,"'Urinary retention is the inability to empty the bladder completely. Urinary retention can be acute or chronic. Acute urinary retention happens suddenly and lasts only a short time. People with acute urinary retention cannot urinate at all, even though they have a full bladder. Acute urinary retention, a potentially life-threatening medical condition, requires immediate emergency treatment. Acute urinary retention can cause great discomfort or ''pain''.''Chronic urinary retention can be a long-lasting medical condition. People with chronic urinary retention can urinate. However, they do not completely empty all of the urine from their bladders. Often people are not even aware they have this condition until they develop another problem, such as ''urinary incontinence'' -- loss of bladder control, resulting in the accidental loss of urine -- or a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''), an illness caused by harmful bacteria growing in the urinary tract.' "
What is the urinary tract and how does it work?,"""The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for removing urine, which is composed of wastes and extra fluid. In order for normal urination to occur, all body parts in the urinary tract need to work together in the correct order.""'Kidneys''. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. The kidneys work around the clock; a person does not control what they do.''Ureters''. Ureters are the thin tubes of muscle -- one on each side of the bladder -- that carry urine from each of the kidneys to the bladder.''Bladder''. The bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. Although a person does not control kidney function, a person does control when the bladder empties. Bladder emptying is known as urination. The bladder stores urine until the person finds an appropriate time and place to urinate. A normal bladder acts like a reservoir and can hold 1.5 to 2 cups of urine. How often a person needs to urinate depends on how quickly the kidneys produce the urine that fills the bladder. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. During urination, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder.''Three sets of muscles work together like a dam, keeping urine in the bladder.''The first set is the muscles of the urethra itself. The area where the urethra joins the bladder is the bladder neck. The bladder neck, composed of the second set of muscles known as the internal sphincter, helps urine stay in the bladder. The third set of muscles is the pelvic floor muscles, also referred to as the external sphincter, which surround and support the urethra.''To urinate, the brain signals the muscular bladder wall to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra.' "
What are the symptoms of urinary retention?,"'The symptoms of acute urinary retention may include the following and require immediate medical attention:''The symptoms of ''chronic'' urinary retention may include''Some people with chronic urinary retention may not have symptoms that lead them to seek medical care. People who are unaware they have chronic urinary retention may have a higher chance of developing complications.'   inability to urinate painful, urgent need to urinate pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen bloating of the lower abdomen urinary frequency -- urination eight or more times a day trouble beginning a urine stream a weak or an interrupted urine stream an urgent need to urinate with little success when trying to urinate feeling the need to urinate after finishing urination mild and constant discomfort in the lower abdomen and urinary tract"
How common is urinary retention?,"'Urinary retention in men becomes more common with age.'""Urinary retention in women is less common, though not rare. The incidence of urinary retention in women has not been well studied because researchers have primarily thought of urinary retention as a man's problem related to the prostate."" In men 40 to 83 years old, the overall incidence of urinary retention is 4.5 to 6.8 per 1,000 men. For men in their 70s, the overall incidence increases to 100 per 1,000 men. For men in their 80s, the incidence of acute urinary retention is 300 per 1,000 men."
What causes urinary retention?,"'Urinary retention can result from''Obstruction of the urethra causes urinary retention by blocking the normal urine flow out of the body. Conditions such as ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' -- also called ''BPH'' -- ''urethral stricture'', urinary tract stones, ''cystocele'', rectocele, ''constipation'', and certain tumors and ''cancers'' can cause an obstruction.''Benign prostatic hyperplasia''. For men in their 50s and 60s, urinary retention is often caused by prostate enlargement due to ''benign prostatic hyperplasia''. ''Benign prostatic hyperplasia'' is a medical condition in which the ''prostate gland'' is enlarged and not cancerous. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that is part of the male reproductive system. The gland surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder. The bladder neck is the area where the urethra joins the bladder. The prostate goes through two main periods of growth. The first occurs early in ''puberty'"", when the prostate doubles in size. The second phase of growth begins around age 25 and continues during most of a man's life. ""'Benign prostatic hyperplasia'' often occurs with the second phase of growth.''As the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against and pinches the urethra. The bladder wall becomes thicker. Eventually, the bladder may weaken and lose the ability to empty completely, leaving some urine in the bladder.''Urethral stricture''. A urethral stricture is a narrowing or closure of the urethra. Causes of urethral stricture include inflammation and ''scar tissue'' from surgery, disease, recurring ''UTIs'', or injury. In men, a urethral stricture may result from ''prostatitis'', scarring after an injury to the penis or perineum, or surgery for ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' and ''prostate cancer''. ''Prostatitis'' is a frequently painful condition that involves inflammation of the prostate and sometimes the areas around the prostate. The perineum is the area between the anus and the sex organs. Since men have a longer urethra than women, urethral stricture is more common in men than women.1''Surgery to correct pelvic organ prolapse, such as cystocele and rectocele, and urinary ''incontinence'' can also cause urethral stricture. The urethral stricture often gets better a few weeks after surgery.''Urethral stricture and acute or chronic urinary retention may occur when the muscles surrounding the urethra do not relax. This condition happens mostly in women.''Urinary tract stones''. Urinary tract stones develop from crystals that form in the urine and build up on the inner surfaces of the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. The stones formed or lodged in the bladder may block the opening to the urethra.''Cystocele'"". A cystocele is a bulging of the bladder into the vagina. A cystocele occurs when the muscles and supportive tissues between a woman's bladder and vagina weaken and stretch, letting the bladder sag from its normal position and bulge into the vagina. The abnormal position of the bladder may cause it to press against and pinch the urethra.""'Rectocele'"". A rectocele is a bulging of the rectum into the vagina. A rectocele occurs when the muscles and supportive tissues between a woman's rectum and vagina weaken and stretch, letting the rectum sag from its normal position and bulge into the vagina. The abnormal position of the rectum may cause it to press against and pinch the urethra.""'Constipation''. ''Constipation'' is a condition in which a person has fewer than three bowel movements a week or has bowel movements with stools that are hard, dry, and small, making them painful or difficult to pass. A person with ''constipation'' may feel bloated or have ''pain'' in the abdomen -- the area between the chest and hips. Some people with ''constipation'' often have to strain to have a bowel movement. ''Hard stools'' in the rectum may push against the bladder and urethra, causing the urethra to be pinched, especially if a rectocele is present.''Tumors and cancers''. Tumors and cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra can gradually expand and obstruct urine flow by pressing against and pinching the urethra or by blocking the bladder outlet. Tumors may be cancerous or noncancerous.''Urinary retention can result from problems with the nerves that control the bladder and sphincters. Many events or conditions can interfere with nerve signals between the brain and the bladder and sphincters. If the nerves are damaged, the brain may not get the signal that the bladder is full. Even when a person has a full bladder, the bladder muscles that squeeze urine out may not get the signal to push, or the sphincters may not get the signal to relax. People of all ages can have nerve problems that interfere with bladder function. Some of the most common causes of nerve problems include''In addition, some children are born with defects that affect the coordination of nerve signals among the bladder, spinal cord, and brain. ''Spina bifida'' and other ''birth defects'' that affect the spinal cord can lead to urinary retention in newborns.''Many patients have urinary retention right after surgery. During surgery, anesthesia is often used to block pain signals in the nerves, and fluid is given intravenously to compensate for possible blood loss. The combination of anesthesia and intravenous (IV) fluid may result in a full bladder with impaired nerve function, causing urinary retention. Normal bladder nerve function usually returns once anesthesia wears off. The patient will then be able to empty the bladder completely.''Various classes of medications can cause urinary retention by interfering with nerve signals to the bladder and prostate. These medications include''Other medications associated with urinary retention include''Over-the-counter'' ''cold'' and ''allergy'' medications that contain decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, and ''antihistamines'', such as ''diphenhydramine'', can increase symptoms of urinary retention in men with prostate enlargement.''Aging'' is a common cause of weakened bladder muscles.

When to seek medical care,'A person who has any of the following symptoms should see a health care provider right away:' complete inability to urinate great discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen and urinary tract
How is urinary retention diagnosed?,"'A health care provider diagnoses acute or chronic urinary retention with''A health care provider may use the following medical tests to help determine the cause of urinary retention:'""A health care provider may suspect urinary retention because of a patient's symptoms and, therefore, perform a physical exam of the lower abdomen. The health care provider may be able to feel a distended bladder by lightly tapping on the lower belly.""'This test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. The remaining urine is called the postvoid residual. A specially trained technician performs an ''ultrasound'', which uses harmless sound waves to create a picture of the bladder, to measure the postvoid residual. The technician performs the bladder ''ultrasound'"" in a health care provider's office, a radiology center, or a hospital, and a radiologist -- a doctor who specializes in medical imaging -- interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia.""'A health care provider may use a catheter -- a thin, flexible tube -- to measure postvoid residual. The health care provider inserts the catheter through the urethra into the bladder, a procedure called catheterization, to drain and measure the amount of remaining urine. A postvoid residual of 100 mL or more indicates the bladder does not empty completely. A health care provider performs this test during an office visit. The patient often receives local anesthesia.''Cystoscopy''. Cystoscopy is a procedure that requires a tubelike instrument, called a cystoscope, to look inside the urethra and bladder. A health care provider performs cystoscopy during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. However, in some cases, the patient may receive sedation and regional or general anesthesia. A health care provider may use cystoscopy to diagnose urethral stricture or look for a bladder stone blocking the opening of the urethra.''CT scans''. CT scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create images. For a ''CT scan'', a health care provider may give the patient a solution to drink and an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the patient to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where a technician takes the x rays. An x-ray technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist interprets the images. The patient does not need anesthesia. A health care provider may give infants and children a sedative to help them fall asleep for the test. CT scans can show''Urodynamic tests''. Urodynamic tests include a variety of procedures that look at how well the bladder and urethra store and release urine. A health care provider may use one or more urodynamic tests to diagnose urinary retention. The health care provider will perform these tests during an office visit. For tests that use a catheter, the patient often receives local anesthesia.''Electromyography'"". Electromyography uses special sensors to measure the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in and around the bladder and sphincters. A specially trained technician places sensors on the skin near the urethra and rectum or on a urethral or rectal catheter. The sensors record, on a machine, muscle and nerve activity. The patterns of the nerve impulses show whether the messages sent to the bladder and sphincters coordinate correctly. A technician performs electromyography in a health care provider's office, an outpatient center, or a hospital. The patient does not need anesthesia if the technician uses sensors placed on the skin. The patient will receive local anesthesia if the technician uses sensors placed on a urethral or rectal catheter.""   a physical exam postvoid residual measurement cystoscopy computerized tomography (CT) scans urodynamic tests electromyography urinary tract stones UTIs tumors traumatic injuries abnormal, fluid-containing sacs called cysts Uroflowmetry. Uroflowmetry measures urine speed and volume. Special equipment automatically measures the amount of urine and the flow rate -- how fast urine comes out. Uroflowmetry equipment includes a device for catching and measuring urine and a computer to record the data. The equipment creates a graph that shows changes in flow rate from second to second so the health care provider can see the highest flow rate and how many seconds it takes to get there. A weak bladder muscle or blocked urine flow will yield an abnormal test result. Pressure flow study. A pressure flow study measures the bladder pressure required to urinate and the flow rate a given pressure generates. A health care provider places a catheter with a manometer into the bladder. The manometer measures bladder pressure and flow rate as the bladder empties. A pressure flow study helps diagnose bladder outlet obstruction. Video urodynamics. This test uses x rays or ultrasound to create real-time images of the bladder and urethra during the filling or emptying of the bladder. For x rays, a health care provider passes a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. He or she fills the bladder with contrast medium, which is visible on the video images. Video urodynamic images can show the size and shape of the urinary tract, the flow of urine, and causes of urinary retention, such as bladder neck obstruction."
How is urinary retention treated?,"'A health care provider treats urinary retention with''The type and length of treatment depend on the type and cause of urinary retention.''Bladder drainage involves catheterization to drain urine. Treatment of acute urinary retention begins with catheterization to relieve the immediate distress of a full bladder and prevent bladder damage. A health care provider performs catheterization during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient often receives local anesthesia. The health care provider can pass a catheter through the urethra into the bladder. In cases of a blocked urethra, he or she can pass a catheter directly through the lower abdomen, just above the pubic bone, directly into the bladder. In these cases, the health care provider will use anesthesia.''For chronic urinary retention, the patient may require intermittent -- occasional, or not continuous -- or long-term catheterization if other treatments do not work. Patients who need to continue intermittent catheterization will receive instruction regarding how to self-catheterize to drain urine as necessary.''Urethral dilation treats urethral stricture by inserting increasingly wider tubes into the urethra to widen the stricture. An alternative dilation method involves inflating a small balloon at the end of a catheter inside the urethra. A health care provider performs a urethral dilation during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. In some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.''Another treatment for urethral stricture involves inserting an artificial tube, called a ''stent'', into the urethra to the area of the stricture. Once in place, the ''stent'' expands like a spring and pushes back the surrounding tissue, widening the urethra. ''Stents'' may be temporary or permanent. A health care provider performs stent placement during an office visit or in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive local anesthesia. In some cases, the patient will receive sedation and regional anesthesia.''Medications that stop the growth of or shrink the prostate or relieve urinary retention symptoms associated with ''benign prostatic hyperplasia'' include''The following medications relax the muscles of the bladder outlet and prostate to help relieve blockage:''Prostate surgery''. To treat urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia, a ''urologist'' -- a doctor who specializes in the urinary tract -- may surgically destroy or remove ''enlarged prostate'' tissue by using the transurethral method. For transurethral surgery, the urologist inserts a catheter or surgical instruments through the urethra to reach the prostate. Removal of the enlarged tissue usually relieves the blockage and urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia. A urologist performs some procedures on an outpatient basis. Some men may require a hospital stay. In some cases, the urologist will remove the entire prostate using open surgery. Men will receive general anesthesia and have a longer hospital stay than for other surgical procedures. Men will also have a longer rehabilitation period for open surgery.''Internal urethrotomy''. A urologist can repair a urethral stricture by performing an internal urethrotomy. For this procedure, the urologist inserts a special catheter into the urethra until it reaches the stricture. The urologist then uses a knife or laser to make an incision that opens the stricture. The urologist performs an internal urethrotomy in an outpatient center or a hospital. The patient will receive general anesthesia.''Cystocele or rectocele repair''. Women may need surgery to lift a fallen bladder or rectum into its normal position. The most common procedure for cystocele and rectocele repair involves a urologist, who also specializes in the ''female reproductive system'', making an incision in the wall of the vagina. Through the incision, the urologist looks for a defect or hole in the tissue that normally separates the vagina from the other pelvic organs. The urologist places ''stitches'' in the tissue to close up the defect and then closes the incision in the vaginal wall with more ''stitches'', removing any extra tissue. These stitches tighten the layers of tissue that separate the organs, creating more support for the pelvic organs. A urologist or gynecologist -- a doctor who specializes in the ''female reproductive system'' -- performs the surgery to repair a cystocele or rectocele in a hospital. Women will receive anesthesia.''Tumor'' and ''cancer'' surgery''. Removal of tumors and cancerous tissues in the bladder or urethra may reduce urethral obstruction and urinary retention.'   bladder drainage urethral dilation urethral stents prostate medications surgery dutasteride (Avodart) finasteride (Proscar) alfuzosin (Uroxatral) doxazosin (Cardura) silodosin (Rapaflo) tadalafil (Cialis) tamsulosin (Flomax) terazosin (Hytrin)"
What are the complications of urinary retention and its treatments?,"'Complications of urinary retention and its treatments may include''UTIs''. Urine is normally sterile, and the normal flow of urine usually prevents bacteria from infecting the urinary tract. With urinary retention, the abnormal urine flow gives bacteria at the opening of the urethra a chance to infect the urinary tract.''Bladder damage''. If the bladder becomes stretched too far or for long periods, the muscles may be permanently damaged and lose their ability to contract.''Kidney damage''. In some people, urinary retention causes urine to flow backward into the kidneys. This backward flow, called reflux, may damage or ''scar'' the kidneys.''Urinary incontinence after prostate, tumor, or ''cancer'' surgery''. Transurethral surgery to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia may result in urinary incontinence in some men. This problem is often temporary. Most men recover their bladder control in a few weeks or months after surgery. Surgery to remove tumors or cancerous tissue in the bladder, prostate, or urethra may also result in urinary incontinence.'   UTIs bladder damage kidney damage urinary incontinence after prostate, tumor, or cancer surgery"
How can urinary retention be prevented?,"'People can prevent urinary retention before it occurs by treating some of the potential causes. For example, men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should take prostate medications as prescribed by their health care provider. Men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should avoid medications associated with urinary retention, such as over-the-counter ''cold'' and ''allergy'' medications that contain decongestants. Women with mild cystocele or rectocele may prevent urinary retention by doing exercises to strengthen the pelvic muscles. In most cases, dietary and lifestyle changes will help prevent urinary retention caused by constipation. People whose constipation continues should see a health care provider.' "
"Eating, diet, and nutrition","'Researchers have not found that eating, ''diet'', and ''nutrition'' play a role in causing or preventing urinary retention.' "

Hope through research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) conducts and supports research into many kinds of urinary tract disorders, including urinary retention. The knowledge gained from these studies is advancing scientific understanding of why urinary tract disorders develop, leading to improved methods of diagnosing, treating, and preventing them.''Clinical trials'' are research studies involving people. ''Clinical trials'' look at safe and effective new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses.' "

What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'A ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') is an infection involving the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. These are the structures that urine passes through before being eliminated from the body.''Any part of this system can become infected. As a rule, the farther up in the urinary tract the infection is located, the more serious it is.''In the United States, ''urinary tract infections'' account for more than 10 million visits to medical offices and hospitals each year.'   The kidneys are a pair of small organs that lie on either side of the spine at about waist level. They have several important functions in the body, including removing waste and excess water from the blood and eliminating them as urine. These functions make them important in the regulation of blood pressure. Kidneys are also very sensitive to changes in blood sugar levels and blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Both diabetes and hypertension can cause damage to these organs. Two ureters, narrow tubes about 10 inches long, drain urine from each kidney into the bladder. The bladder is a small saclike organ that collects and stores urine. When the urine reaches a certain level in the bladder, we experience the sensation that we have to void, then the muscle lining the bladder can be voluntarily contracted to expel the urine. The urethra is a small tube connecting the bladder with the outside of the body. A muscle called the urinary sphincter, located at the junction of the bladder and the urethra, must relax at the same time the bladder contracts to expel urine. The upper urinary tract is composed of the kidneys and ureters. Infection in the upper urinary tract generally affects the kidneys (pyelonephritis), which can cause fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and other severe symptoms. The lower urinary tract consists of the bladder and the urethra. Infection in the lower urinary tract can affect the urethra (urethritis) or the bladder (cystitis). Urinary tract infections are much more common in adults than in children, but about 1%-2% of children do get urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections in children are more likely to be serious than those in adults (especially in younger children). Urinary tract infection is the most common urinary tract problem in children besides bedwetting. Urinary tract infection is second only to respiratory infection as the most common type of infection. These infections are much more common in girls and women than in boys and men younger than 50 years of age. The reason for this is not well understood, but anatomic differences between the genders (a shorter urethra in women) might be partially responsible. About 40% of women and 12% of men have a urinary tract infection at some time in their life."
What are causes and risk factors for a urinary tract infection?,"'The urine is normally sterile. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the urine and begin to grow. The bacterial infection usually starts at the opening of the urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the urinary tract.''The following people are at increased risk of urinary tract infection:''The following special groups may be at increased risk of urinary tract infection:' The culprit in at least 90% of uncomplicated infections is a type of bacteria called Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. These bacteria normally live in the bowel (colon) and around the anus. These bacteria can move from the area around the anus to the opening of the urethra. The two most common causes of this are improper wiping and sexual intercourse. Usually, the act of emptying the bladder (urinating) flushes the bacteria out of the urethra. If there are too many bacteria, urinating may not stop their spread. The bacteria can travel up the urethra to the bladder, where they can grow and cause an infection. The infection can spread further as the bacteria move up from the bladder via the ureters. If they reach the kidney, they can cause a kidney infection (pyelonephritis), which can become a very serious condition if not treated promptly. People with conditions that block (obstruct) the urinary tract, such as kidney stones People with medical conditions that cause incomplete bladder emptying (for example, spinal cord injury) Postmenopausal women: Decreased circulating estrogen makes the urinary tract more vulnerable to a UTI. People with suppressed immune systems: Examples of situations in which the immune system is suppressed are HIV/AIDS and diabetes. People who take immunosuppressant medications such as chemotherapy for cancer also are at increased risk. Women who are sexually active: Sexual intercourse can introduce larger numbers of bacteria into the bladder. Urinating after intercourse seems to decrease the likelihood of developing a urinary tract infection. Women who use a diaphragm for birth control Men with an enlarged prostate: Prostatitis or obstruction of the urethra by an enlarged prostate can lead to incomplete bladder emptying, thus increasing the risk of infection. This is most common in older men. Breastfeeding has been found to decrease the risk for urinary tract infections in children. Very young infants: Bacteria gain entry to the urinary tract via the bloodstream from other sites in the body. Young children: Young children have trouble wiping themselves and washing their hands well after a bowel movement. Poor hygiene has been linked to an increased frequency of urinary tract infections. Children of all ages: Urinary tract infection in children can be (but is not always) a sign of an abnormality in the urinary tract, usually a partial blockage. An example is a condition in which urine moves backward from the bladder up the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Hospitalized patients or nursing-home residents: Many of these individuals are catheterized for long periods and are thus vulnerable to infection of the urinary tract. Catheterization means that a thin tube (catheter) is placed in the urethra to drain urine from the bladder. This is done for people who have problems urinating or cannot reach a toilet to urinate on their own. Patients using catheters: If a patient is required to empty their bladder using a catheter, they are at increased risk for infection."
Are urinary tract infections contagious?,'No. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not ''contagious''.' 
What are urinary tract infection symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms develop rapidly and may or may not include the symptoms for a lower urinary tract infection.''In newborns, infants, children, and elderly people, the classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection may not be present. Other symptoms may indicate a urinary tract infection.''Pregnant'' women are at increased risk for an UTI. Typically, pregnant women do not have unusual or unique symptoms. If a woman is pregnant, her urine should be checked during ''prenatal'' visits because an unrecognized infection can cause ''pregnancy'' health complications.''Although most people have symptoms with a urinary tract infection, some do not.''The ''symptoms of urinary tract infection'' can resemble those of ''sexually transmitted diseases''.'

   Bladder (cystitis, or bladder infection): The lining of the urethra and bladder becomes inflamed and irritated. Dysuria: pain or burning during urination Frequency: more frequent urination (or waking up at night to urinate, sometimes referred to as nocturia); often with only a small amount of urine Urinary urgency: the sensation of having to urinate urgently Cloudy, bad-smelling, or bloody urine Lower abdominal pain or pelvic pressure or pain Mild fever (less than 101 F), chills, and ""just not feeling well"" (malaise) Urethra (urethritis): Burning with urination Fairly high fever (higher than 101 F) Shaking chills Nausea Vomiting Flank pain: pain in the back or side, usually on only one side at about waist level Newborns: fever or hypothermia (low temperature), poor feeding, jaundice Infants: vomiting, diarrhea, fever, poor feeding, not thriving Children: irritability, eating poorly, unexplained fever that doesn't go away, loss of bowel control, loose bowels, change in urination pattern Elderly people: fever or hypothermia, poor appetite, lethargy, change in mental status"
When should people seek medical care for a UTI?,"'Any adult or child who develops any of the symptoms of a urinary tract infection needs to be evaluated by a medical professional, preferably within 24 hours. Most medical offices can test urine for infection by using a quick urine ""dipstick"" test.''If someone has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection and any of the following applies, he or she may be at risk for complications of the urinary tract infection.''Infants, children, and elderly people with any of the signs and ''symptoms of UTI'' should see their health care professional as soon as possible or go to an emergency department for evaluation.' Someone who has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection should call a health care professional for an appointment, preferably on the same day that symptoms are recognized. Someone who has symptoms of an upper urinary tract infection involving the kidneys should call a health care professional immediately. Depending on the situation, he or she will recommend either a visit to the office or to a hospital emergency department. Vomiting and inability to keep down clear fluids or medication Not better after taking antibiotics for two days Pregnant Having diabetes or another disease that affects the immune system Taking medication that suppresses the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy Fever, lethargy, and poor appetite may indicate a urinary tract infection in these groups, but they may also be signs of something more serious. Urinary tract infections have the potential to make these vulnerable people very ill when the bacteria spread into the bloodstream."
How do health care professionals diagnose a urinary tract infection?,"'Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection is based on information someone gives about his or her symptoms, medical and surgical history, medications, habits, and lifestyle. A physical examination and lab tests complete the evaluation.''A health care professional may simply perform a urine dipstick test in the office. Only a few minutes are needed to obtain results. Your health care provider may also send a urine sample to the lab for culture testing (see below). These results take a few days to come back. This tells the doctor the exact bacteria causing the infection and to which antibiotics these bacteria have resistance or sensitivity. The culture is usually sent for special populations, including men, because they are less likely to get UTIs. It is not necessary to send a culture for everyone because the majority of UTIs are caused by the same bacteria.''For a culture specimen, the patient will be asked to give a clean-catch, midstream urine specimen. This avoids contamination of the urine with bacteria from the skin. Patients will be instructed in how to do this.''If someone cannot produce a urine specimen or is unable to follow instructions for a clean-catch specimen, a health care professional may obtain a urine specimen by catheterization.''Depending on their symptoms, sexually active women could require a pelvic examination because pelvic infections can have similar symptoms as a urinary tract infection. Males will require a genital examination, and depending on the symptoms, most likely a prostate examination. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.''Men will most likely require a rectal examination so that the prostate can be checked. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.''Rarely, an imaging test may be indicated to detect any underlying problem in the urinary tract that could cause an infection. This is usually only necessary in repeat infections or special circumstances (unusual bacteria, suspected anatomic abnormalities).''Imaging tests are most often needed for the following groups:' The single most important lab test is urinalysis. A urine culture will be tested for signs of infection, such as the presence of white blood cells and bacteria. In certain circumstances, urine also may be ""cultured."" This means that a small amount of the urine is brushed on a sterile nutrient substance in a plastic plate. The plate is allowed to sit for a few days and then examined to see what kind of bacteria are growing on it. These bacteria are treated with different antibiotics to see which works best against them. This helps determine the best treatment for the specific infection. Blood tests usually are not required unless a complicated condition, such as pyelonephritis or kidney failure, is suspected. Midstream means urinating a little into the toilet before collecting a specimen. The idea is to avoid collecting the urine that comes out first, as this urine is often contaminated. Clean-catch refers to a midstream sample that was collected after cleaning the area of the urethral opening. Adult women and older girls: Cleanse the area around the urethral opening gently (but completely) using a sterile wipe or soap and water. Catch the urine midstream. For some women, catheterization (inserting a tube into the bladder) may be the only way to obtain a sterile, uncontaminated specimen. Men and boys: A sterile specimen can usually be obtained with a midstream catch. Uncircumcised males should retract the foreskin and cleanse the area before urinating. Newborns: Urine may be obtained with a catheter or a procedure in which a needle is introduced through the lower abdominal wall to draw (aspirate) urine from the bladder. Infants and children: Either catheterization or the needle aspiration method is used. This means placing a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra to drain urine from the bladder. The catheter usually is removed after the bladder is emptied. The catheter may remain in place if someone is very ill or if it is necessary to collect all urine or measure urine output. An ultrasound examination can evaluate kidney and bladder problems. A fluoroscopic study can show any physical problems that predispose children to urinary tract infections. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a special series of X-rays that uses a contrast dye to highlight abnormalities in the urinary tract. Cystoscopy involves insertion of a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end through the urethra into the bladder. This allows detection of abnormalities inside the bladder that might contribute to infections. A CT scan gives a very detailed three-dimensional picture of the urinary tract. Children with repeat urinary tract infections, especially boys Up to 50% of infants and 30% of older children with a urinary tract infection have an anatomic abnormality. The child's pediatrician should investigate this possibility. Adults with frequent or recurrent urinary tract infections People who have blood in the urine"
What is the treatment for a urinary tract infection?,"'The usual treatment for both simple and complicated urinary tract infections is antibiotics. The type of antibiotic and duration of treatment depend on the circumstances. Examples of common antibiotics used in treatment include, but are not limited to, ''amoxicillin'', ''sulfamethoxazole''/''trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim''), ''ciprofloxacin'', ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Macrobid''), and many others. Your health care provider will chose the appropriate medication for your condition and the specific causative organisms.''A person may be hospitalized if he or she has symptoms of pyelonephritis and any of the following:''Urethritis in men and women can be caused by the same bacteria as sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''). Therefore, people with symptoms of ''STDs'' (vaginal or ''penile discharge'', for example) should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Your doctor will have to evaluate you for urinalysis as well as UTIs if you experience any pain in the genital area.' 

Read Doctor's View
   In an otherwise healthy person, a three-day course of antibiotics is usually enough. Some providers prefer a seven-day course of antibiotics. Occasionally, a single dose of an antibiotic is used. A health care professional will determine which of these options is best. In adult males, if the prostate is also infected (prostatitis), four weeks or more of antibiotic treatment may be required. Adult females with potential for or early involvement of the kidneys, urinary tract abnormalities, or diabetes are usually given a five- to seven-day course of antibiotics. Children with uncomplicated cystitis are usually given a 10-day course of antibiotics. To alleviate burning pain during urination, phenazopyridine (Pyridium) or a similar drug, can be used in addition to antibiotics for one to two days. Young, otherwise healthy patients with symptoms of pyelonephritis can be treated as outpatients. They may receive IV fluids and antibiotics or an injection of antibiotics in the emergency department, followed by 10-14 days of oral antibiotics. They should follow up with their health care professional in one to two days to monitor improvement. If someone is very ill, dehydrated, or unable to keep anything in his or her stomach because of vomiting, an IV will be inserted into the arm. He or she will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids and antibiotics through the IV until he/she is well enough to switch to an oral antibiotic. A complicated, acute infection may require treatment for several weeks. Appear very ill Are pregnant Have not gotten better with outpatient antibiotic treatment Have underlying diseases that compromise the immune system (diabetes is one example) or are taking immunosuppressive medication Are unable to keep anything in the stomach because of nausea or vomiting Had previous kidney disease, especially pyelonephritis, within the last 30 days Have a device such as a urinary catheter in place Have kidney stones"
Are there home remedies for a urinary tract infection?,"'There are a variety of self-care measures (home remedies) and other treatments available for urinary tract infections.''Because the symptoms of a urinary tract infection mimic those of other conditions, someone should see a health care professional if a urinary tract infection is suspected. A urine test is needed to confirm an infection. Self-care is not recommended.'   Use a hot-water bottle to ease pain. Drink plenty of water. Avoid coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods, all of which irritate the bladder. There are some indications that cranberry juice can help fight a urinary tract infection."
What kinds of doctors treat urinary tract infections?,"""Most urinary tract infections can be treated by your primary care doctor (including family medicine and internal-medicine specialists, as well as gynecologists) or your child's pediatrician. They are usually the best provider to treat you as they are most familiar with your medical history, medications you are taking, and other factors that might affect your treatment. If you seek treatment in an urgent care facility, a specialist in ""'emergency medicine'' may be involved in your care.''If there are frequent reoccurrences of UTIs or if complicating circumstances are present, your primary care doctor might refer you to a ''urologist'', a physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the urinary system.' "
How long does a UTI last after treatment with antibiotics?,"   Symptoms of lower urinary tract infections usually resolve within 24 hours of starting the medication. The full amount of prescribed antibiotics should be taken even if the symptoms are fully gone. Upper urinary tract symptoms (pyelonephritis) will usually take longer to respond to treatment. The patient will usually improve within 24 hours, but it will often take longer until all symptoms resolve."
What follow-up is needed for a urinary tract infection?,"""Follow a health care professional's treatment recommendations. Finish all medications even if feeling better before the medication is gone. A health care professional will want the patient to have a follow-up appointment to repeat the urinalysis and make sure he or she is getting better.""'Occasionally, the infection does not go away with the first treatment. If someone is being treated for an infection and has any of the following, call a health care professional promptly:' Children and adults with kidney involvement should be seen again in one to two days. People recovering from uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections might be told that they only have to return if symptoms don't go away or if they return. Fever or pain with urination is not gone after two days of antibiotic treatment. Someone cannot keep the medication down or it has severe side effects. Someone is unable to keep foods, fluids, or medication down because of nausea or vomiting. Someone develops signs of kidney involvement (such as flank pain, shaking chills, high fever). Someone's symptoms are worse rather than better after two days of antibiotics."
Is it possible to prevent a urinary tract infection?," Women and girls should wipe from front to back (not back to front) after bowel movements. This helps prevent bacteria from the anus entering the urethra. Empty the bladder regularly and completely, especially after sexual intercourse. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water. Cranberry juice, especially, has been shown to help prevent urinary tract infections. Women should empty the bladder soon after sexual intercourse."
What is the prognosis of a urinary tract infection?," For people with uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis, antibiotic treatment usually brings complete resolution of the infection. If not treated promptly, urinary tract infections can cause permanent scarring of the urinary tract. Recurrent urinary tract infections can become a problem and will require close monitoring by your health care provider. Pyelonephritis, if not treated promptly, can spread to the bloodstream and cause a very severe infection.Short-term and long-term kidney damage can be a result of pyelonephritis.Death from pyelonephritis is rare in otherwise healthy people.Factors associated with poor outcome are old age or general debility, kidney stones, recent hospitalization, diabetes, sickle cell disease, cancer, or chronic kidney disease. Short-term and long-term kidney damage can be a result of pyelonephritis. Death from pyelonephritis is rare in otherwise healthy people. Factors associated with poor outcome are old age or general debility, kidney stones, recent hospitalization, diabetes, sickle cell disease, cancer, or chronic kidney disease."
Are urinary tract infections (UTIs) contagious?,"'The answer depends upon what microbe is infecting the urinary tract. The urinary tract consists of the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys, each of which can become infected with different microbes. ''Urinary tract infections'"" usually arise from organisms that are normally present in (colonizing) the person's gut and/or urethral opening. These organisms (for example, bacteria such as ""'E. coli'' or ''Pseudomonas'' infect the urinary tract by relocating against the flow of urine (retrograde) toward the kidneys.''Lower ''urinary tract infections'' do not involve the kidneys while upper ''urinary tract infections'' involve the kidneys and are typically more severe. These types of infections of the urinary tract are almost never ''contagious'' to other individuals. This article will not consider ''STDs'' and the organisms that cause ''STDs'' as ''urinary tract infections'' as they are discussed in other articles. However, ''STDs'' are often ''contagious'' and are transferred to others during intercourse, while ''UTIs'' are not usually transmitted by intercourse, so ''UTIs'' are rarely contagious to a partner. In addition, women who are sexually active and those individuals (males and females) who have anal intercourse have an increased chance to develop a ''UTI''.''It is unlikely for anyone to get a ''UTI'' or ''STD'"" from a toilet seat, as the urethra in males and females typically wouldn't touch the toilet seat. It is theoretically possible to transfer infectious organisms from a toilet seat to a buttock or thigh cut or sore and then have the organisms spread to the urethra or genitals. Nevertheless, such transmission of UTIs and/or ""'STDs'' are highly unlikely.'  "
How long before I know I have an infection of the urinary tract?,"'The incubation period (time of exposure to time symptoms begin) varies with the microbe. In general, common urinary tract infections with colonizing bacteria, like ''E. coli'', varies from about three to eight days.' "
How are urinary tract infections spread?,"'Bacterial infections'' of the urinary tract are almost never spread to others if the infecting organisms originate from the bacteria normally colonizing the individual (for example, ''E. coli'').' "
When should I seek medical care for a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'For symptoms of ''itching'' and/or ''burning on urination'' or discomfort with urination, people should seek help within 24 hours. Individuals who may develop an upper ''urinary tract infection'' (kidney involvement with flank ''pain'', for example) should seek medical help immediately.'  "
When are urinary tract infections no longer contagious?,'Simple lower and upper urinary tract infections caused by bacteria residing in the patient are not considered to be contagious. Clinicians suggest people are cleared of lower urinary tract infections after about three to seven days of antibiotic treatment and upper urinary tract (kidneys) infections by about 10-14 days after treatment. Some individuals with ''kidney infection'' may benefit from an initial IV dose of antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics.' 
What is a urinary tract infection?,"'The urinary system of your body includes two kidneys, two tubes (ureters), a urine sac (bladder) and an opening to expel the urine from the body (urethra).''An infection of this system due to germs is called a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'').''Most urinary infections affect the lower urinary tract and spare the kidneys. These ''UTIs'' are easily treatable. In a few cases, the kidneys may be affected, and this is a serious condition. Women are more likely than men to experience UTIs, especially recurrently.\xa0' "
What are the causes of urinary tract infection or urinary infection?,"'An infection occurs when there is contamination of the urinary area due to bacteria from the gut. The most common germ is ''E. coli'' (80%). Other causative bacteria include ''Staphylococcus'' saprophyticus'' (10% to 15%), ''Enterococcus'', ''Klebsiella'', ''Enterobacter ''and ''Proteus''.''Some habits or conditions may also increase your risk of ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI''). These include\xa0' Not drinking enough water Holding urine for long periods Spinal cord injuries or nerve damage that may cause difficulties in emptying bladder regularly and completely Tumors, kidney stones and an enlarged prostate (in men) that may block the flow of urine Conditions such as diabetes that may reduce the ability of the body’s immune system to fight off an infection, especially in an older person A catheter (a tube placed in the urethra and bladder to drain urine) in a bed-ridden person Women get infected more commonly because a woman’s urethra is shorter than a man’s, which allows easy access to the bladder Unhygienic patterns of wiping the genital area, especially in women Sexual activity that may move the infection to the urethra Birth control methods such as spermicides, diaphragms and unlubricated condoms that may allow bacterial growth Hormonal changes in pregnant women and women who are in menopause"
What are the symptoms of urinary tract infection?,"'You may have a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') if you are experiencing the following''It can be serious if you have' Pain and pressure in the lower part of your tummy or groin Burning pain while urinating An urge to urinate often, but not much comes out when you are urinating Cloudy and smelly urine Increased frequency of urination Dribbling of urine Inability to control urine Inability to void the urine Feeling tired Blood in urine Fever Back pain Vaginal discharge"
How  is UTI diagnosed?,"'Your doctor may ask for' Urine examination and analysis for the presence of bacteria, sugar and abnormal blood cells A urine culture test A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test (to check prostate enlargement in men) Blood sugar levels to check whether you have diabetes. Ultrasonography to check for thickening of the urinary bladder, renal stones or prostate problems."
What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,'A ''urinary tract infection'' is an infection of the bladder (''cystitis'') or kidney(s) (''pyelonephritis''). ''Cystitis'' is considerably more common than the more severe and more serious pyelonephritis.'  
What causes urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children?,"'Bacteria cause the large majority of ''urinary tract infections'' in children. Viral infection of the bladder is less common, while ''fungal infections'' of the urinary tract are rare and occur most commonly in immunocompromised individuals (for example, those with ''HIV/AIDS'', ''chemotherapy'' recipients).' "
What are risk factors for UTIs in children?,"'Risk factors predisposing for childhood UTIs include the following:' Male gender, especially uncircumcised infants Poor toilet habits: Children should be encouraged to urinate every two to three hours. Poor toilet hygiene: Females should always wipe front to back to avoid introduction of stool bacteria to the urethral opening. Individuals with a compromised immune system or compromised bladder function (for example, spinal cord injury victims who require self-catheterization) Sexual activity"
What are symptoms and signs of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children?,"'Characteristic symptoms of a ''urinary tract infection'' include''Nonspecific but common symptoms include ''fever'' (especially >102.2 F or 39 C) and ''abdominal pain''. For some children less than 2 years of age, these more subtle problems may be the only indicator of a ''UTI''. Associated symptoms of concern include flank ''pain'', ''fever'', and ''vomiting''. Obvious ''blood in the urine'' (gross ''hematuria'') as well as a positive family history for childhood ''urinary tract infections'' (especially in siblings) are also red flags and should raise the level of concern. Interestingly, the odor and color (with the exception of obvious blood) of the urine are not predictors of a ''UTI''.'   pain with urination (dysuria), urinary frequency (needing to urinate frequently), urinary urgency (feeling a compelling urge to urinate), and loss of previously established urinary control (for example, bedwetting)."
What type of doctors treat UTIs in children?,"'Most children with a ''UTI'' can be appropriately managed by their pediatrician. If kidney function is compromised, a pediatric nephrologist should be consulted. Similarly, if anatomical problems are discovered, a pediatric urologic surgeon (''urologist'"") should help guide the child's evaluation and management."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose UTIs in children?,"""Establishing an accurate diagnosis (vs. a presumptive diagnosis) includes determining the causative bacteria of the infection, its antibiotic sensitivity profile, and determining whether any anatomical or functional risk factors are present that might predispose the child to the current infection. Such information is crucial to establish the individual's risk for recurrent urinary tract infections, which can predispose to scarring of the kidney and possibly ""'renal failure'' (end-stage ''kidney disease'', requiring either ''dialysis'' or ''renal transplant'').''The physical examination of a child with suspected ''urinary tract infection'' should start with the vital signs (temperature, pulse, ''breathing'' rate, and ''blood pressure'', which is often measured with the vital signs). The presence of ''fever'' (especially over 102.2 F or 39 C) is highly correlated with the presence of a UTI. ''Blood pressure'' and assessment of height and weight provide helpful reassurance if normal or stable long-term renal function. Visual examination of the abdomen for enlargement related to potentially oversized kidney(s) or bladder is important. Tenderness during palpation of the abdomen (especially the suprapubic region containing the bladder) or the flank area (where the kidneys are situated) is very helpful in establishing the diagnosis.''Examination of the genitalia is also very important to see if there is evidence of vaginal irritation (redness, discharge, evidence of ''trauma'' or foreign body). An uncircumcised male infant (especially with a foreskin that is difficult to retract) is more likely to experience a UTI when compared to a population of similar infant boys who have been circumcised. Lastly, consideration of other conditions that might be responsible for fever and ''abdominal pain'' is important.''An abnormal ''urinalysis'' (including microscopic examination) may be indicative of a ''urinary tract infection''. However, the urine culture is mandatory in confirming the diagnosis of a UTI. The culture provides both the exact bacterial cause as well as the antibiotic sensitivity profile to successfully treat the infection. In addition, studies have demonstrated a relatively short list of bacteria that commonly cause UTIs. A UTI caused by abnormal bacteria should be a source of concern.''In a toilet-trained child, a clean-catch urine specimen should provide a reliable specimen for culture. A non-toilet-trained child or an uncircumcised boy whose tight foreskin may lead to potential urine specimen contamination should have the specimen obtained by a sterile catheterization. An alternative approach to catheterization is called ""suprapubic bladder aspiration."" This safe procedure involves passing a small needle through the skin into the urine-filled bladder ''cavity'' and aspiration of urine into the attached syringe. Collection of urine in a ""urine bag"" is not recommended. Some studies have indicated an 85% false-positive rate of UTI diagnosis with this method, prompting unnecessary laboratory and diagnostic studies as well as inappropriately prescribed antibiotic therapy.'""Regardless of the mechanism chosen to obtain a child's urine specimen, it is very important to examine the urine as soon as possible since a delay can increase the risk of both false-negative and false-positive results.""'Other laboratory studies (for example, ''complete blood count'') are generally not helpful, and their nonspecific values do not provide differentiation between the more significant ''kidney infection'' (pyelonephritis) and a less concerning ''bladder infection'' (cystitis).'  "
Are there any home remedies for UTIs in children?,"'Home remedy suggestions for UTIs in adults are legion, and unfortunately many have no scientific basis in fact. Fewer still have been shown to be safe and possibly effective in children. Those that do fulfill such criteria include the following:''Perhaps the best therapy is ''prevention''.' Unsweetened cranberry or blueberry juice: These juices reportedly lessen the adherence of infective bacteria to the bladder wall and thus allow them to be expelled in urine. Pineapple: This fruit contains a chemical (bromelain) that reportedly possesses anti-inflammatory properties and thus reduces UTI symptoms. Yogurt: Some studies have indicated a benefit in consumption of this product. The exact mechanism of benefit is unclear at this time. Increase in overall fluid intake (for example, water): This would dilute bacteria concentration and allow more effective ""flushing out"" of harmful bacteria."
How long do UTIs in children last?,"'Once an effective antibiotic has been selected and administered, most patients experience a rapid and permanent resolution of their symptoms. Recurrent UTIs raise a concern regarding anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract (for example, kidney malformation). Similarly, malfunction of the urinary tract (for example, reflux of urine from the bladder to the kidney) is another condition commonly associated with recurrent UTIs.' "
Are UTIs in children contagious?,"'Urinary tract infections are not ''contagious''. They are not acquired by sharing a bath with another child who has a UTI. Likewise, they cannot be acquired from sitting on a contaminated toilet seat.' "
What is the treatment for UTIs in children?,"'Antibiotic therapy for UTIs is based upon the sensitivity profile obtained from the urine-culture results. Cystitis (infection limited to the bladder) should respond quickly to routine oral antibiotics. Pyelonephritis may need hospitalization for intravenous administration of antibiotics along with fluid therapy if the patient is experiencing associated ''vomiting'' and ''dehydration''. Oral antibiotic therapy, however, may be appropriate if these complications are not present.''The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' has issued a position statement recommending follow-up studies for children who have experienced a ''urinary tract infection''. Children who should be further evaluated include''The purpose of the studies detailed below is to accurately define the anatomy and functional physiology of these children who may be at risk for renal scarring and possible complete ''kidney failure''.'   children 2 months of age to 2 years of age who sustain their first UTI, any male child who experiences a UTI, any child 3 years and older who has had more than one UTI, and any child who has had pyelonephritis. Renal ultrasound: This procedure helps to define the renal anatomy (kidney location, size, shape). VCUG (voiding cysto-urethrogram): This test involves passage of a catheter into the bladder to fill it with dye. After removal of the catheter, the bladder will empty. A radiologist performs imaging studies to monitor for complete bladder emptying without obstruction and/or backward flow (reflux) of the dye from the bladder into to ureters and up to the kidneys. Renal scan: This test uses a small amount of radioactive material (radioisotope) to measure the function of the kidneys. It is designed to evaluate the functional capability of the kidneys and evaluate for possible renal scarring. IVP (intravenous pyelogram): This is a rarely used test involving injecting dye into the bloodstream via an IV (The dye is excreted via the kidneys.) and then obtaining X-ray images. The renal ultrasound and renal scan have replaced the usefulness of this test."
Is it possible to prevent UTIs in children?,"'There are several suggestions that have been made by pediatric urologists to lessen the likelihood of children developing urinary tract infections. These include the following:' Hygiene: Wipe females from front to back during diaper changes or after using the toilet in older girls. With uncircumcised males, mild and gentle traction of the foreskin helps to expose the urethral opening. Most boys are able to fully retract the foreskin by 4 years of age. Complete bladder emptying: Some toilet-trained children are in hurry to leave the bathroom. Encourage ""double voiding"" (urinating immediately after finishing the first void). Children should be encouraged to urinate approximately every two to three hours. Some children ignore the sensation of a full bladder in the desire to continue to play. Avoid the ""4 Cs"": carbonated drinks, high amounts of citrus, caffeine (sodas), and chocolate. Some kidney specialists are not as adamant about this option. Avoid bubble baths: Some renal specialists also view this recommendation with skepticism. Encourage cranberry juice: Similar to the above ""4 Cs,"" some specialists view this suggestion as folklore. Prophylactic antibiotics: Daily low-dose antibiotics under a doctor's supervision may be used in children with recurrent UTIs or in those with anatomic or physiologic factors that predispose to UTIs."
What is the prognosis for UTIs in children?,"""Children who experience a UTI generally have an excellent prognosis. If a child's UTI is associated with a red flag or high-risk characteristic (for example, male gender, usual type of bacteria, pyelonephritis, etc.), appropriate follow-up studies (renal ultrasound, renal scan, and VCUG) will help to alert the doctor about unrecognized problems. These additional studies can help avoid progressive loss of kidney function or other health issues that might not be detected."" "
Types of Defects in the Urinary Tract,"'Hydronephrosis can result from many types of defects in the urinary tract. Doctors use specific terms to describe the type and location of the blockage. ' Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The openings where the ureters empty urine into 
the bladder should work like valves to keep urine from backing up into the 
ureters. Sometimes the valve doesn't work properly and urine flows back into the 
kidneys. The urine may flow only a short way back into the ureters, or it may go 
all the way back to the kidneys, causing the ureters and kidneys to swell. VUR 
may occur in only one ureter or in both. Kidneys with severe reflux may not 
develop normally, and after birth kidneys with reflux may be at risk for damage 
from infections. Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction. The point where the ureter joins 
the kidney is called the ureteropelvic junction. If urine is blocked here, only 
the kidney swells. The ureter remains at a normal size. UPJ obstruction usually 
only occurs in one kidney. Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). BOO describes any blockage in the urethra 
or at the opening of the bladder. The obstruction may occur in boys or girls. 
The most common form of BOO seen in newborns and during prenatal ultrasound 
examinations is posterior urethral valves (PUV). BOO caused by PUV occurs only 
in boys. Posterior urethral valves (PUV). In boys, sometimes an abnormal fold of 
tissue in the urethra keeps urine from flowing freely out of the bladder. This 
defect may cause swelling in the entire urinary tract, including the urethra, 
bladder, ureters, and kidneys. Ureterocele. If the end of the ureter does not develop normally, it can 
bulge, creating what is called a ureterocele. The ureterocele may obstruct part 
of the kidney or the bladder. Nerve disease. Urination requires coordinated nerve signals between the 
bladder, spinal cord, and brain. Spina bifida and other birth defects that 
affect the spinal cord may interrupt nerve signals and lead to urine retention 
in newborns. "
Syndromes That May Affect the Urinary Tract,"'In addition to defects that occur in a single spot in the urinary tract, some babies are born with genetic conditions that affect several different systems in the body. A condition that includes multiple, seemingly unrelated problems, is called a syndrome. '  Prune belly syndrome (PBS). Occurring only in boys, PBS causes a baby to 
have an enlarged abdomen because the normal abdominal wall muscles are missing 
or very weak. The entire urinary tract is enlarged, and both testicles remain 
inside the body instead of descending into the scrotum. The skin over the 
abdomen is wrinkled, giving the appearance of a prune. Most children with PBS 
have hydronephrosis and VUR.  Esophageal atresia (EA). EA is a birth defect in which the esophagus is 
incomplete. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the 
stomach. About 30 percent of babies born with EA will have problems in other 
body systems, such as the heart or urinary tract. Congenital heart defects. Heart defects range from mild to life threatening. 
Children born with heart defects also have a higher rate of problems in the 
urinary tract than children in the general population, suggesting that some 
types of heart and urinary defects may have a common genetic cause. "
Diagnosis,"'Birth defects and other problems of the urinary tract may be discovered before the baby is born, at the time of birth, or later, when the child is brought to the doctor for a ''urinary tract infection'' or urination problem. ''Prenatal Screening''Tests during pregnancy can help determine if the baby is developing normally in the womb. ''Examination of Newborn''Sometimes a ''newborn'' does not urinate as expected, even though ''prenatal'' testing showed no sign of urine blockage. The baby may urinate only small amounts or not at all. An enlarged kidney may be felt during the newborn examination as well. Different imaging techniques are available to determine the cause of the problem.''Later Diagnosis''Sometimes urine blockage is not apparent until the child develops the symptoms of a ''urinary tract infection''. These symptoms include ''If these symptoms persist, the child should be seen by a doctor. For any ''fever'' in the first 2 months of life, the child should be seen by a doctor immediately. The doctor will ask for a urine sample to test for bacteria. The doctor may also recommend imaging tests including ultrasound, VCUG, or nuclear scan. '   Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce a picture on a television 
screen. A wand gliding on the mother's abdomen directs harmless sound waves into 
the womb. The sound waves bounce off the baby and back into the wand to create a 
black-and-white image on the screen. Ultrasound images can even display internal 
organs within the baby, so enlarged kidneys, ureters, or bladder may be visible. Amniocentesis. In amniocentesis, the doctor inserts a needle through the 
mother's skin into the amniotic sac to collect about an ounce of amniotic fluid. 
The fluid contains genetic material from the baby that can be analyzed for signs 
of defects. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In CVS, the doctor collects a small piece 
of tissue from the placenta using a needle passed through the mother's vagina 
and cervix. The placenta has the same genetic makeup as the baby.

Most healthy women do not need all the tests. Ultrasound examinations during 
pregnancy are routine, although they are not always required and rarely 
influence treatment decisions. Amniocentesis and CVS are recommended only when a 
risk of genetic problems exists because of family history or something detected 
during an ultrasound. Amniocentesis and CVS carry a slight risk of harming the 
baby and mother, or ending the pregnancy in miscarriage, so those risks should 
be weighed carefully against the potential benefits of learning about the baby's 
condition. Ultrasound. Once the baby is born, ultrasound can be used to view the baby's 
urinary tract directly for a clearer image than could be achieved while the baby 
was in the womb.  Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). If the doctor suspects that urine is 
backing up into the ureters or that the bladder outlet is obstructed, a VCUG may 
be needed. In this test, a catheter is used to fill the child's bladder with 
warm liquid containing iodine to make it visible on an x ray. A video records 
the x-ray images of the bladder as it is filled and as the child urinates. The 
video will reveal reflux if the liquid enters the ureters and blockage of the 
bladder in the case of an obstruction, such as PUV. Nuclear scan. A nuclear scan involves injecting a very small amount of 
radioactive material, just enough to show up using a camera that captures gamma 
rays. The amount of radioactive substance used is determined by the child's 
weight. The liquid is injected into the child's bloodstream and eventually 
passes through the kidneys, where it is filtered from the blood and directed 
down the ureters to the bladder. The camera may be mounted above or below a 
table where the patient lies. The camera passes over or under the urinary tract 
as the child lies on the table. fever irritability poor appetite vomiting unusual smelling urine dark urine"
Treatment,"'Treatment for urine blockage depends on the cause and severity of the blockage. Hydronephrosis discovered before the baby is born will rarely require immediate action, especially if it is only on one side. Often the condition goes away without any treatment before birth or sometimes after. The doctor will keep track of the condition with frequent ultrasounds. With few exceptions, treatment can wait until the baby is born. ''Prenatal Shunt'""If the urine blockage threatens the life of the unborn baby, the doctor may recommend a procedure to insert a small tube, called a shunt, into the baby's bladder to release urine into the amniotic sac. The placement of the shunt is similar to an amniocentesis, in that a needle is inserted through the mother's abdomen. Ultrasound guides the placing of the shunt. This fetal surgery carries many risks, so it is performed only in special circumstances, such as when the amniotic fluid is absent and the baby's ""'lungs'"" aren't developing or when the kidneys are very severely damaged. ""'Antibiotics''Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. A newborn with possible urine blockage or VUR may be given antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections from developing until the urinary defect corrects itself or is surgically corrected. ''Surgery'""If the urinary defect doesn't correct itself and the child continues to have urine blockage, surgery may be needed. The decision to operate depends upon the degree of blockage. The surgeon will remove the obstruction to restore urine flow. A small tube, called a ""'stent'', may be placed in the ureter or urethra to keep it open temporarily while healing occurs. ''Intermittent Catheterization''If the child has urine retention because of nerve disease, the condition may be treated with intermittent catheterization. The parent, and later the child, will be taught to drain the bladder by inserting a thin tube, called a catheter, through the urethra to the bladder. Emptying the bladder in this way helps prevent kidney damage, overflow ''incontinence'', and ''urinary tract infections''. ' "
Hope Through Research,"'Researchers from universities and government agencies are working to understand the causes of urinary birth defects and to find more effective treatments. Through its Pediatric Urology Program, the National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases funds research into bladder and urinary tract development, prenatal interventions for urinary tract disorders, and bladder abnormalities associated with spina bifida. Additionally, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development has established the Birth Defects Initiative to study the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying developmental processes of the fetus.

Facts you should know about urine tests for diabetes," Urine tests may be done in people with diabetes to evaluate severe hyperglycemia (severe high blood sugar) by looking for ketones in the urine. Ketones are a metabolic product produced when fat is metabolized. Ketones increase when there is insufficient insulin to use glucose for energy. Urine tests are also done to look for the presence of protein in the urine, which is a sign of kidney damage. Urine glucose measurements are less reliable than blood glucose measurements and are not used to diagnose diabetes or evaluate treatment for diabetes. They may be used for screening purposes. Testing for ketones is most common in people with type 1 diabetes. Both people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes typically have microalbumin testing."
What are urine tests for diabetes?,"""Urine tests are tests performed in a clinical laboratory or at home using self-test kits and a sample of the patient's urine. Urine tests can be performed for a variety of reasons, but in people with ""'diabetes'', they are most commonly used to look for ketones or microalbumin (see below). Urine glucose (''sugar'') can also be measured, but this is less valuable than blood glucose levels for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes, so this is not commonly done as a way to monitor blood glucose status.'  "
Ketone test,"'This test detects the presence of ketones, which are byproducts of metabolism that form in the presence of severe hyperglycemia (elevated blood ''sugar''). Ketones are formed from fat that is burned by the body when there is insufficient insulin to allow glucose to be used for fuel. When ketones build up to high levels, ''ketoacidosis'' (a serious and life-threatening condition) may occur.''Ketone testing can be performed both at home and in the clinical laboratory. Ketones can be detected by dipping a test strip into a sample of urine. A color change on the test strip signals the presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones occur most commonly in people with ''type 1 diabetes'', but uncommonly, people with ''type 2 diabetes'' may test positive for ketones.' "
Microalbumin test,"'The microalbumin test detects microalbumin, a type of protein, in the urine. Protein is present in the urine when there is damage to the kidneys. Since the damage to blood vessels that occurs as a complication of diabetes can lead to kidney problems, the microalbumin test is done to check for damage to the kidneys over time.' "
Can urine tests diagnose diabetes?,"'While urine tests can show signs that may signal diabetes, such as elevated sugar or ketones, the diagnosis of diabetes is made on the basis of blood tests.

When are urine tests used in people with diabetes?,"'The ketone test is generally recommended for people with type 1 diabetes. Those with type 1 diabetes should test their urine for ketones when they are ill, especially if they have ''vomiting'' and ''nausea''.

What is the urinary tract?,"""The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Blood flows through the kidneys, and the kidneys filter out wastes and extra water, making urine. The urine travels down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a muscular, balloonlike organ called the bladder. The bladder swells into a round shape when it is full and gets smaller as it empties. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through the urethra."" "
What is the lower urinary tract and how does it work?,"'The lower urinary tract includes the bladder and urethra. The bladder sits in the pelvis and is attached to other organs, muscles, and the pelvic bones, which hold it in place. The urethra is a tube at the bottom of the bladder that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.''The lower urinary tract works by coordinating the muscles of the bladder wall with the sphincters, which are circular muscles that surround the area of the bladder that opens into the urethra. The muscles of the bladder wall relax as the bladder fills with urine. If the urinary tract is healthy, the bladder can hold up to 2 cups, or 16 ounces, of urine comfortably for 2 to 5 hours. The sphincters close tightly like rubber bands around the bladder to help keep urine from leaking. As the bladder fills, the need to urinate becomes stronger and stronger, until the bladder reaches its limit. Urination is the process of emptying the bladder. To urinate, the brain signals the bladder muscles to tighten, squeezing urine out of the bladder. At the same time, the brain signals the sphincters to relax. As the sphincters relax, urine exits the bladder through the urethra. When all the signals occur in the correct order, normal urination occurs.' "
What is urodynamic testing?,"""Urodynamic testing is any procedure that looks at how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladder's ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely. Urodynamic tests can also show whether the bladder is having involuntary contractions that cause urine leakage. A health care provider may recommend urodynamic tests if symptoms suggest problems with the lower urinary tract. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include""""Urodynamic tests range from simple observation to precise measurements using sophisticated instruments. For simple observation, a health care provider may record the length of time it takes a person to produce a urinary stream, note the volume of urine produced, and record the ability or inability to stop the urine flow in midstream. For precise measurements, imaging equipment takes pictures of the bladder filling and emptying, pressure monitors record the pressures inside the bladder, and sensors record muscle and nerve activity. The health care provider will decide the type of urodynamic test based on the person's health information, physical exam, and LUTS. The urodynamic test results help diagnose the cause and nature of a lower urinary tract problem.""'Most urodynamic tests do not involve special preparations, though some tests may require a person to make a change in fluid intake or to stop taking certain medications. Depending on the test, a person may be instructed to arrive for testing with a full bladder.' urine leakage frequent urination  painful urination sudden, strong urges to urinate problems starting a urine stream problems emptying the bladder completely recurrent urinary tract infections"
What are the urodynamic tests?,"'Urodynamic tests include'""Uroflowmetry is the measurement of urine speed and volume. Special equipment automatically measures the amount of urine and the flow rate -- how fast the urine comes out. Uroflowmetry equipment includes a device for catching and measuring urine and a computer to record the data. During a uroflowmetry test, the person urinates privately into a special toilet or funnel that has a container for collecting the urine and a scale. The equipment creates a graph that shows changes in flow rate from second to second so the health care provider can see when the flow rate is the highest and how many seconds it takes to get there. Results of this test will be abnormal if the bladder muscles are weak or urine flow is blocked. Another approach to measuring flow rate is to record the time it takes to urinate into a special container that accurately measures the volume of urine. Uroflowmetry measurements are performed in a health care provider's office; no anesthesia is needed.""'This urodynamic test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. The remaining urine is called the postvoid residual. Postvoid residual can be measured with ''ultrasound'"" equipment that uses harmless sound waves to create a picture of the bladder. Bladder ultrasounds are performed in a health care provider's office, radiology center, or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a doctor, usually a radiologist. Anesthesia is not needed. Postvoid residual can also be measured using a catheter -- a thin flexible tube. A health care provider inserts the catheter through the urethra up into the bladder to remove and measure the amount of remaining urine. A postvoid residual of 100 milliliters or more is a sign that the bladder is not emptying completely. Catheter measurements are performed in a health care provider's office, clinic, or hospital with local anesthesia.""'A cystometric test measures how much urine the bladder can hold, how much pressure builds up inside the bladder as it stores urine, and how full it is when the urge to urinate begins. A catheter is used to empty the bladder completely. Then a special, smaller catheter is placed in the bladder. This catheter has a pressure-measuring device called a manometer. Another catheter may be placed in the rectum to record pressure there.''Once the bladder is emptied completely, the bladder is filled slowly with warm water. During this time, the person is asked to describe how the bladder feels and indicate when the need to urinate arises. When the urge to urinate occurs, the volume of water and the bladder pressure are recorded. The person may be asked to ''cough'"" or strain during this procedure to see if the bladder pressure changes. A cystometric test can also identify involuntary bladder contractions. Cystometric tests are performed in a health care provider's office, clinic, or hospital with local anesthesia.""'This urodynamic test measures pressure at the point of leakage during a cystometric test. While the bladder is being filled for the cystometric test, it may suddenly contract and squeeze some water out without warning. The manometer measures the pressure inside the bladder when this leakage occurs. This reading may provide information about the kind of bladder problem that exists. The person may be asked to apply abdominal pressure to the bladder by ''coughing'', shifting position, or trying to exhale while holding the nose and mouth. These actions help the health care provider evaluate the sphincters.''A pressure flow study measures the bladder pressure required to urinate and the flow rate a given pressure generates. After the cystometric test, the person empties the bladder, during which time a manometer is used to measure bladder pressure and flow rate. This pressure flow study helps identify bladder outlet blockage that men may experience with ''prostate enlargement''. Bladder outlet blockage is less common in women but can occur with a ''cystocele'' or, rarely, after a surgical procedure for ''urinary incontinence'"". Pressure flow studies are performed in a health care provider's office, clinic, or hospital with local anesthesia.""""Electromyography uses special sensors to measure the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves in and around the bladder and the sphincters. If the health care provider thinks the urinary problem is related to nerve or muscle damage, the person may be given an electromyography. The sensors are placed on the skin near the urethra and rectum or on a urethral or rectal catheter. Muscle and nerve activity is recorded on a machine. The patterns of the nerve impulses show whether the messages sent to the bladder and sphincters are coordinated correctly. Electromyography is performed by a specially trained technician in a health care provider's office, outpatient clinic, or hospital. Anesthesia is not needed if sensors are placed on the skin. Local anesthesia is needed if sensors are placed on a urethral or rectal catheter.""'Video urodynamic tests take pictures and videos of the bladder during filling and emptying. The imaging equipment may use ''x-rays'' or ''ultrasound'"". If x-ray equipment is used, the bladder will be filled with a special fluid, called contrast medium, that shows up on x rays. X rays are performed by an x-ray technician in a health care provider's office, outpatient facility, or hospital; anesthesia is not needed. If ultrasound equipment is used, the bladder is filled with warm water and harmless sound waves are used to create a picture of the bladder. The pictures and videos show the size and shape of the bladder and help the health care provider understand the problem. Bladder ultrasounds are performed in a health care provider's office, radiology center, or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a doctor, usually a radiologist. Although anesthesia is not needed for the ultrasound, local anesthesia is needed to insert the catheter to fill the bladder.""   uroflowmetry postvoid residual measurement cystometric test leak point pressure measurement pressure flow study electromyography video urodynamic tests"
What happens after urodynamic tests?,"'After having urodynamic tests, a person may feel mild discomfort for a few hours when urinating. Drinking an 8-ounce glass of water every half-hour for 2 hours may help to reduce the discomfort. The health care provider may recommend taking a warm bath or holding a warm, damp washcloth over the urethral opening to relieve the discomfort.''An antibiotic may be prescribed for 1 or 2 days to prevent infection, but not always. People with signs of infection -- including ''pain'', ''chills'', or ''fever'' -- should call their health care provider immediately.' "
How soon will test results be available?,'Results for simple tests such as cystometry and uroflowmetry are often available immediately after the test. Results of other tests such as electromyography and video urodynamic tests may take a few days to come back. A health care provider will talk with the patient about the results and possible treatments.' 
Points to Remember," The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The lower urinary tract includes the bladder and urethra. Urodynamic testing is any procedure that looks at how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra are storing and releasing urine. Most urodynamic tests focus on the bladder's ability to hold urine and empty steadily and completely. Urodynamic tests include uroflowmetry, postvoid residual measurement, cystometric test, leak point pressure measurement, pressure flow study, electromyography, and video urodynamic tests. Most urodynamic tests do not involve special preparations. Depending on the test, a person may be instructed to arrive for testing with a full bladder. After having urodynamic tests, a person may feel mild discomfort for a few hours when urinating. Results for simple tests are often available immediately after the test, while other test results may take a few days to come back."
Hope through Research,"'In recent years, researchers have learned much about the causes and treatment of lower urinary tract problems. Researchers are looking into ways to more accurately assess LUTS and diagnose lower urinary tract problems. Research focuses on designing and developing more accurate and reliable diagnostic tests and tools.''The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) sponsors studies of diagnostic urodynamic methods and devices. The NIDDK also sponsors programs aimed at understanding, diagnosing, and treating lower urinary tract problems. NIDDK-funded studies have shown associations between LUTS and nonurologic diseases and conditions. These findings have important diagnostic and management implications. Continued improvement in urodynamic testing will help support advancements in understanding these associations.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

What are hives (urticaria) and angioedema? What do hives look like?,"'Hives (medically known as urticaria) appear on the skin as wheals that are red, very ''itchy'', smoothly elevated areas of skin often with a blanched center. They appear in varying shapes and sizes, from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter anywhere on the body.''It is estimated that 20% of all people will develop urticaria at some point in their lives. Hives are more common in women than in men. One hallmark of hives are their tendency to change size rapidly and to move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours. An individual ''hive'' usually lasts no longer than 24 hours. An outbreak that looks impressive, even alarming, first thing in the morning can be completely gone by noon, only to be back in full force later in the day. Very few skin diseases occur and then resolve so rapidly. Therefore, even if you have no evidence of hives to show the doctor when you get to the office for examination, the diagnosis can be established based upon the accurate recounting of your symptoms and signs. Because hives fluctuate so much and so fast, it is helpful to bring along a photograph of what the outbreak looked like at its most severe point.''Swelling deeper in the skin that may accompany hives is called ''angioedema''. This swelling of the hands and ''feet'', as well as the face (lips or eyelids), can be as dramatic as it is brief.'  "
What causes hives and angioedema? Are hives contagious? Does stress cause hives?,"'Hives appear when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells, which are normally found in the skin. Histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels, leading to swelling in the skin.''Hives are very common and are not considered ''contagious''. Although annoying, hives usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious. Some hives may be caused by an\xa0''allergic reaction''\xa0to such things as foods, infections by different organisms, medications, food coloring, preservatives and ''insect stings'' or bites, and chemicals; but in the majority of cases, no specific cause is ever found. Although people may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives, maneuvers like changing ''diet'', soap, detergent, and ''makeup'' are rarely helpful in preventing hives unless there is an excellent temporal relationship. Since hives most often are produced by an immune mechanism, the condition is not contagious. If an infectious disease were the cause of hives in a particular person then it is possible, but not likely, that an infected contact could develop hives.''Having hives may cause ''stress'', but ''stress'' by itself does not cause hives.' "
What are the different kinds of hives?,"""Hives fall into two categories on the basis of the time they have been present: acute urticaria (ordinary hives, which resolve after six to eight weeks) and chronic idiopathic urticaria (that continues longer than six to eight weeks). Since hives are so common and acute urticaria, by definition, resolves spontaneously, physicians do not generally expend much time or expense to evaluate the cause of hives of less than eight weeks' duration."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of ordinary hives?,"'Symptoms of ordinary hives flare up suddenly and usually for no specific reason. Welts appear, often in several places. The welts may be skin-colored, pink, or red, and they flare, ''itch'', cause swelling, and go away in a matter of a few minutes to hours, only to appear elsewhere. This sequence may go on from days to weeks. Most episodes of hives last less than six weeks. Although that cutoff point is arbitrary, cases of hives that last more than six weeks are often called chronic hives.'  "
What are the risk factors and causes of ordinary hives?,"'As noted above, many cases of ordinary hives are ""idiopathic,"" meaning no cause is known. Others may be triggered by ''allergic'' reactions or viral infections. A few may be caused by medications, usually when they have been taken for the first time a few weeks before. (It is less likely for ''drugs'' taken continuously for long periods to cause hives but certainly not impossible.) When a medication is implicated as a cause of hives, the drug must be stopped, since testing is rarely available to confirm the cause. In most cases, drug-induced hives will go away in a few days. If a drug is stopped and the hives do not go away, this is a strong indication that the medication was not the cause of the hives.''Some medications, like morphine, ''codeine'', ''aspirin'', and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'', such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'']), cause the body to release histamine and produce urticaria through nonallergic mechanisms. People with urticaria should avoid these medications.''Despite the reputation of hives being an ""allergic"" condition, there is often no obvious connection to any provoking substance. In this situation, random ''allergy'' testing is not usually helpful. If you know what is causing your hives, then avoiding the cause, if possible.' "
What are the causes of chronic hives?,"'Chronic hives (defined as lasting six weeks or more) can last from months to years. The evaluation of this condition is difficult, and ''allergy'' testing and other laboratory tests are only occasionally useful in such cases. The accurate evaluation of this condition requires the patient to give his or her physician precise information regarding their complete medical history, personal habits, and oral intake. Occasionally, it may be necessary to limit specific foods or drugs (potential allergens) for a time to observe any affect upon the skin condition. Certain systemic diseases and infections, including parasitic infestations, may occasionally present in the skin as hives. If an inciting cause can be determined, then specific treatments for that condition ought to be effective, or in the case of ''food allergies'' or ''drug allergy'', strict avoidance would be necessary. There are additionally rare forms of chronic urticaria that are produced when the patient makes antibodies against molecules on the surface of their own mast cells. There are tests available to identify this type of hives.''Physical urticaria (for example, heat hives) is a type of chronic urticaria produced by physical stimuli. Common environmental provocations such as sunlight (solar urticaria), water, cold, heat, ''exercise'', and pressure occasionally induce hives. Dermatographism, which literally means ""skin writing,"" is a common cause of physical urticaria. This is an exaggerated form of what happens to anyone when their skin is scratched or rubbed; a red welt appears at the site of the scratch. In dermatographism, raised, itchy red welts with adjacent flares appear wherever the skin is scratched or where belts and other articles of clothing rub against the skin, causing mast cells to leak histamine.''Another common form of physically induced hives is called cholinergic urticaria. This produces hundreds of small, itchy ''bumps''. These occur within 15 minutes of ''exercise'' or physical exertion and are usually gone before a doctor can examine them. This form of hives happens more often in young people.' "
Are there conditions or other causes that mimic hives?,"'There are other ''rashes'' that may look like hives, but the fact that they remain stable and do not resolve within 24 hours is helpful in distinguishing them from hives. Such ''rashes'' may need to have a small specimen of skin removed and examined under the microscope (biopsy) to accurately determine the nature of the skin disease.''If hives are making it difficult to ''sleep'', then it may be necessary to see a physician. This would be especially important if you are taking nonprescription antihistamines. If your hives last longer than two months, it is also likely you will benefit from visiting a physician.' "
What specialists treat hives?,'Some family physicians or internists may feel comfortable caring for patients with chronic urticaria. Most dermatologists and allergists are able to care for patients with urticaria.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose and evaluate chronic urticaria?,"'Blood tests, including a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR, a marker of inflammation), are all that is typically recommended for evaluation.' "
What are hives treatment options and home remedies?,"'The goal of treating most cases of ordinary acute urticaria is to relieve symptoms while the condition goes away by itself. The most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines, which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. The main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness.''Many antihistamines are available without prescription, such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), taken in doses of 25 milligrams, and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton), taken in a dose of 4 milligrams. These can be taken up to three times a day, but because these medications can cause drowsiness, they are often taken at bedtime. Those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration.''Loratadine'' (''Claritin'', 10 milligrams) and ''fexofenadine'' (''Allegra'') are antihistamines available over the counter that are less likely to cause drowsiness (non-sedating). Also approved for ''over-the-counter'' use is ''hydroxyzine'' (Atarax, ''Vistaril''), which causes drowsiness, and its breakdown product, ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec'', 10 milligrams), which is less sedating.''Antihistamines that require a prescription include ''cyproheptadine'' (''Periactin''), which tends to cause drowsiness. A prescription ''antihistamine'' that causes little sedation is levocetirizine (Xyzal). Sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called H2 blockers, such as ''ranitidine'' (''Zantac'') and ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet''). This antihistamine list is not exhaustive. Physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response.''Oral steroids (''prednisone'', [''Medrol'']) can help severe cases of hives in the short term, but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. Other treatments have been used for urticaria as well, including ''montelukast'' (''Singulair''), ultraviolet ''radiation'', antifungal antibiotics, agents that suppress the immune system, and ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (''amitriptyline'' [''Elavil'', ''Endep''], ''nortriptyline'' [''Pamelor'', Aventyl], ''doxepin'' [Sinequan, Adapin]). Evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. In ordinary cases, they are rarely needed. A new treatment now indicated for chronic urticaria is the monthly subcutaneous injection of a monoclonal antibody, ''omalizumab'' (''Xolair''), directed against the IgE receptor on human mast cells.''Topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. They include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce ''itching''. Some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor, menthol, diphenhydramine, and ''pramoxine''. Many of these topical preparations require no prescription. Cortisone-containing creams (steroids), even strong ones requiring a prescription, are not very helpful in controlling the ''itch'' of hives.''Applying cool compresses may help soothe the itch of an urticarial\xa0''rash''.'  "
What is the prognosis of hives?,"'To know exactly what kind of hives one has, or to learn more about research into the immune basis of hives or about rarer forms of this condition, consult a physician. It is important, however, to keep in mind that most cases of urticaria are annoying, not serious, and almost always temporary.' "
What is Usher syndrome?,"'Usher syndrome is the most common condition that affects both ''hearing'' and vision. A syndrome is a disease or disorder that has more than one feature or symptom. The major symptoms of Usher syndrome are ''hearing loss'' and an eye disorder called ''retinitis pigmentosa'', or RP. RP causes night-''blindness'' and a loss of peripheral vision (side vision) through the progressive degeneration of the retina. The retina is a light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye and is crucial for vision. As RP progresses, the field of vision narrows - a condition known as ""''tunnel vision''"" - until only ''central vision'' (the ability to see straight ahead) remains. Many people with Usher syndrome also have severe balance problems.''There are three clinical types of Usher syndrome: ''In the United States, types 1 and 2 are the most common types. Together, they account for approximately 90 to 95 percent of all cases of children who have Usher syndrome.''Photograph of the retina of a patient with Usher syndrome (left) compared to a normal retina (right). The ''optic nerve'' (arrow) looks very pale, the vessels (stars) are very thin and there is characteristic pigment, called bone spicules (double arrows).' type 1, type 2, and type 3."
Who is affected by Usher syndrome?,"'Approximately 3 to 6 percent of all children who are deaf and another 3 to 6 percent of children who are hard-of-hearing have Usher syndrome. In developed countries such as the United States, about four ''babies'' in every 100,000 births have Usher syndrome.' "
What causes Usher syndrome?,"'Usher syndrome is ''inherited'', which means that it is passed from parents to their children through genes. Genes are located in almost every cell of the body. Genes contain instructions that tell cells what to do. Every person inherits two copies of each gene, one from each parent. Sometimes genes are altered, or mutated. Mutated genes may cause cells to act differently than expected.''Usher syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The term autosomal means that the mutated gene is not located on either of the chromosomes that determine a person\'s sex; in other words, both males and females can have the disorder and can pass it along to a child. The word recessive means that, to have Usher syndrome, a person must receive a mutated form of the Usher syndrome gene from each parent. If a child has a mutation in one Usher syndrome gene but the other gene is normal, he or she is predicted to have normal vision and hearing. People with a mutation in a gene that can cause an autosomal recessive disorder are called carriers, because they ""carry"" the gene with a mutation, but show no symptoms of the disorder. If both parents are carriers of a mutated gene for Usher syndrome, they will have a one-in-four chance of having a child with Usher syndrome with each birth.''Usually, parents who have normal hearing and vision do not know if they are carriers of an Usher syndrome gene mutation. Currently, it is not possible to determine whether a person who does not have a family history of Usher syndrome is a carrier. Scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders are hoping to change this, however, as they learn more about the genes responsible for Usher syndrome. ''Genetic disorders can be caused by a change(s) in a gene. Every individual has two copies of the same gene. Genetic disorders are inherited in different ways. Usher syndrome is a recessive disorder. ''Recessive'' means: ''An individual with Usher syndrome usually: ''An individual who has one changed Usher syndrome gene is called a ''carrier''. When two carriers of the same Usher syndrome gene have a child together, with each birth there is a: ' a person must inherit a change in the same gene from each parent in order to have the disorder  a person with one changed gene does not have the disorder, but can pass either the changed or the unchanged gene on to his or her child has inherited a change in the same gene from each parent 1-in-4 chance of having a child with Usher syndrome  2-in-4 chance of having a child who is a carrier  1-in-4 chance of having a child who neither has Usher syndrome nor is a carrier"
What are the characteristics of the three types of Usher syndrome?,"""Children with type 1 Usher syndrome are profoundly deaf at birth and have severe balance problems. Many of these children obtain little or no benefit from hearing aids. Parents should consult their doctor and other hearing health professionals as early as possible to determine the best communication method for their child. Intervention should be introduced early, during the first few years of life, so that the child can take advantage of the unique window of time during which the brain is most receptive to learning language, whether spoken or signed. If a child is diagnosed with type 1 Usher syndrome early on, before he or she loses the ability to see, that child is more likely to benefit from the full spectrum of intervention strategies that can help him or her participate more fully in life's activities.""""Because of the balance problems associated with type 1 Usher syndrome, children with this disorder are slow to sit without support and typically don't walk independently before they are 18 months old. These children usually begin to develop vision problems in early childhood, almost always by the time they reach age 10. Vision problems most often begin with difficulty seeing at night, but tend to progress rapidly until the person is completely blind.""'Children with type 2 Usher syndrome are born with moderate to severe ''hearing loss'' and normal balance. Although the severity of hearing loss varies, most of these children can benefit from hearing aids and can communicate orally. The vision problems in type 2 Usher syndrome tend to progress more slowly than those in type 1, with the onset of RP often not apparent until the ''teens''. ''Children with type 3 Usher syndrome have normal hearing at birth. Although most children with the disorder have normal to near-normal balance, some may develop balance problems later on. Hearing and sight worsen over time, but the rate at which they decline can vary from person to person, even within the same family. A person with type 3 Usher syndrome may develop hearing loss by the teens, and he or she will usually require hearing aids by mid- to late adulthood. Night blindness usually begins sometime during ''puberty''. Blind spots appear by the late teens to early adulthood, and, by mid-adulthood, the person is usually legally blind.' "
How is Usher syndrome diagnosed?,"'Because Usher syndrome affects hearing, balance, and vision, diagnosis of the disorder usually includes the evaluation of all three senses. Evaluation of the eyes may include a ''visual field test'"" to measure a person's peripheral vision, an electroretinogram (ERG) to measure the electrical response of the eye's light-sensitive cells, and a retinal examination to observe the retina and other structures in the back of the eye. A hearing (audiologic) evaluation measures how loud sounds at a range of frequencies need to be before a person can hear them. An electronystagmogram (ENG) measures involuntary eye movements that could signify a balance problem.""'Early diagnosis of Usher syndrome is very important. The earlier that parents know if their child has Usher syndrome, the sooner that child can begin special educational training programs to manage the loss of hearing and vision. '  "
Is genetic testing for Usher syndrome available?,"'So far, 11 genetic loci (a segment of chromosome on which a certain gene is located) have been found to cause Usher syndrome, and nine genes have been pinpointed that cause the disorder. They are: ''With so many possible genes involved in Usher syndrome, genetic tests for the disorder are not conducted on a widespread basis. Diagnosis of Usher syndrome is usually performed through hearing, balance, and vision tests. Genetic testing for a few of the identified genes is clinically available. To learn about laboratories that conduct clinical testing, visit the Web site www.GeneTests.org and search the laboratory directory by typing in the term ""Usher syndrome."" Genetic testing for additional Usher syndrome genes may be available through clinical research studies. To learn about ''clinical trials'' that include genetic testing for Usher syndrome, visit the Web site www.clinicaltrials.gov and type in the search term ""Usher syndrome"" or ""Usher genetic testing.""' Type 1 Usher syndrome: MY07A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15, SANS  Type 2 Usher syndrome: USH2A, VLGR1, WHRN  Type 3 Usher syndrome: USH3A"
How is Usher syndrome treated?,"'Currently, there is no cure for Usher syndrome. The best treatment involves early identification so that educational programs can begin as soon as possible. The exact nature of these programs will depend on the severity of the hearing and ''vision loss'' as well as the age and abilities of the person. Typically, treatment will include hearing aids, assistive listening devices, cochlear implants, or other communication methods such as American ''Sign Language''; orientation and mobility training; and communication services and independent-living training that may include Braille instruction, low-vision services, or auditory training.''Some ophthalmologists believe that a high dose of ''vitamin A'' palmitate may slow, but not halt, the progression of retinitis pigmentosa. This belief stems from the results of a long-term clinical trial supported by the National Eye Institute and the Foundation for Fighting Blindness. Based on these findings, the researchers recommend that most adult patients with the common forms of RP take a daily supplement of 15,000 IU (international units) of vitamin A in the palmitate form under the supervision of their ''eye care'' professional. (Because people with type 1 Usher syndrome did not take part in the study, high-dose vitamin A is not recommended for these patients.) People who are considering taking vitamin A should discuss this treatment option with their health care provider before proceeding. Other guidelines regarding this treatment option include:''In addition, according to the same study, people with RP should avoid using ''supplements'' of more than 400 IU of ''vitamin E'' per day. '   Do not substitute vitamin A palmitate with a beta-carotene supplement. Do not take vitamin A supplements greater than the recommended dose of 15,000 IU or modify your diet to select foods with high levels of vitamin A. Women who are considering pregnancy should stop taking the high-dose supplement of vitamin A three months before trying to conceive due to the increased risk of birth defects. Women who are pregnant should stop taking the high-dose supplement of vitamin A due to the increased risk of birth defects. "
What research is being conducted on Usher syndrome?,"'Researchers are currently trying to identify all of the genes that cause Usher syndrome and determine the function of those genes. This research will lead to improved ''genetic counseling'' and early diagnosis, and may eventually expand treatment options.''Scientists also are developing mouse models that have the same characteristics as the human types of Usher syndrome. Mouse models will make it easier to determine the function of the genes involved in Usher syndrome. Other areas of study include the early identification of children with Usher syndrome, treatment strategies such as the use of cochlear implants for hearing loss, and intervention strategies to help slow or stop the progression of RP.' "
What are some of the latest research findings?,"'NIDCD researchers, along with collaborators from universities in New York and Israel, pinpointed a mutation, named R245X, of the PCDH15 gene that accounts for a large percentage of type 1 Usher syndrome in today\'s Ashkenazi Jewish population. (The term ""Ashkenazi"" describes Jewish people who originate from Eastern Europe.) Based on this finding, the researchers conclude that Ashkenazi Jewish infants with bilateral, profound hearing loss who lack another known mutation that causes hearing loss should be screened for the R245X mutation.' "
What is testicular cancer?,"'Testicular cancer'' arises from the testes. The testicles are responsible for the production of male sex hormones and sperm for reproduction. They are located within the scrotum, a loose bag of skin below the penis. Testicular ''cancer'' is the most common type of ''cancer'' occurring in American males between the ages of 15 and 35.' "
What causes testicular cancer?,"'The exact cause of testicular ''cancer'' is not known. Some factors increase the risk of testicular cancer, such as:\xa0' Age: Testicular cancer usually occurs between the age of 20 to 35. Race: It is more common in white men than other races. Undescended testes (cryptorchidism): Surgical correction of undescended testes before puberty reduces the risk of testicular cancer.  Genetic conditions like Klinefelter syndrome causing abnormal development of the testes   Family history  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection"
What are the first symptoms of testicular cancer?,"'The initial signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include:''The other signs and symptoms that may develop later include:' A painless lump in the testicular area The affected testicle feels firmer and harder than the other  Dull aching in the scrotum or the groin Formation of blood clots in the blood vessels which can travel to the lungs causing chest pain and breathlessness. Varicocele (swollen blood vessels) appearing as enlarged, dark blue veins Hydrocele (Fluid around the testicle) causing swelling Infection of the testicle, causing pain Injury of the testes Twisting of the testicle  (torsion)"
What are the types of testicular cancer?,"'Most testicular ''cancers'' are germ cell (cells that produce sperm) tumors. There are two main types of testicular cancer:''Seminomas\xa0grow and spread slowly. There are two subtypes:\xa0''Nonseminomas\xa0grow and spread more quickly. They usually consist of multiple types of cancer cells, including:\xa0' Classical seminoma: This is the most common and usually happens in men ages 25 to 45. Spermatocytic seminoma: Commonly occurs in older men and usually does not spread. Embryonal carcinoma: Contains cells look like cells from embryos under microscopic examination. Yolk sac carcinoma: These cells look like the sac that surrounds the embryos and usually occurs in children. Choriocarcinoma: Usually rare and spreads to the rest of the body quickly. Teratoma: A rare tumor that contains other tissue and organs, including teeth and hair."
How is testicular cancer diagnosed?,"'Self-examination can help in early diagnosis and treatment. Affected testes are enlarged, firm and usually painless.\xa0''The physician performs a complete physical assessment if their patient complains of these testicular symptoms. Complete blood and radiological assessment is performed.\xa0' Blood TestsAlpha Fetoprotein levels (Alpha FP)Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin levels (hCG)Lactate Dehydrate Hydrogenase levels (LDH) Alpha Fetoprotein levels (Alpha FP) Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin levels (hCG) Lactate Dehydrate Hydrogenase levels (LDH) Testicular USG Testicular CT Scan Lymphangiography to study tumor spread in lymph node A biopsy is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves obtaining a small sample of the testicle and examining the cells for cancer."
How is testicular cancer treated?,"'Testicular cancer is highly treatable, even when cancer has spread beyond the testicle.

What is endometrial ablation?,"'Endometrial ablation is the surgical destruction of the lining tissues of the uterus, known as the ''endometrium''. Endometrial ablation is one type of treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding.'  "
Why is endometrial ablation done?,"'Endometrial ablation is a treatment for abnormal bleeding of the uterus that is due to a benign (non-cancerous) condition. Endometrial ablation is not sufficient treatment when the cause of bleeding is ''cancer of the uterus'', since ''cancer'' cells may have grown into the deeper tissues of the uterus and cannot often be removed by the procedure.''Endometrial ablation is only performed on females who are not ''pregnant'' and do not plan to become pregnant in the future. It should not be performed if the woman has an active infection of the genital tract. This treatment is not a first-line therapy for heavy bleeding. It should only be considered when medical and hormonal therapies have not been sufficient to control the bleeding.' "
How is endometrial ablation performed?,"'Prior to the procedure, a woman needs to have an endometrial sampling (biopsy) performed to exclude the presence of ''cancer''. Imaging studies and/or direct visualization with a hysteroscope (a lighted viewing instrument that is inserted to visualize the inside of the uterus) are necessary to exclude the presence of uterine polyps or benign tumors (fibroids) beneath the lining tissues of the uterus. Polyps and fibroids are possible causes of heavy bleeding that can be simply removed without ablation of the entire ''endometrium''. Obviously, the possibility of pregnancy must be excluded, and intrauterine ''contraceptive'' devices (IUDs) must be removed prior to endometrial ablation.''Hormonal therapy may be given in the weeks prior to the procedure (particularly in younger women), in order to shrink the endometrium to an extent where ablation therapy has the greatest likelihood for success. The belief is the thinner the endometrium, the greater the chances for successful ablation.''To begin the procedure, the cervical opening is dilated to allow passage of the instruments into the uterine ''cavity''. Different procedures have been used and are all similarly effective for destroying the uterine lining tissue. These include laser beam, electricity, freezing, and heating.''The choice of procedure depends upon a number of factors, including''The type of anesthesia required depends upon the method used, and some endometrial ablation procedures can be performed with minimal anesthesia during an office visit. Others may be performed in an outpatient surgery center.' the surgeon's preference and experience, the presence of fibroids, the size and shape of the uterus, whether or not pretreatment medication is given, and type of anesthesia desired by the patient."
What are the risks and complications of endometrial ablation?,"'Complications of the procedure are not common but may include:''In very rare cases, fluid used to expand the uterus during the procedure can be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to ''fluid in the lungs'' (''pulmonary edema'').''Some women may experience regrowth of the endometrium and need further surgery (see below).''Minor side effects from the procedure can occur for a few days, include cramping (like ''menstrual cramps''), ''nausea'', and ''frequent urination'' that may last for 24 hours. A watery discharge mixed with blood may be present for a few weeks after the procedure and can be heavy for the first few days.'   accidental perforation of the uterus, tears or damage to the cervical opening (the opening to the uterus), and infection, bleeding, and burn injuries to the uterus or intestines."
What is the outlook after endometrial ablation?,"'The majority of women who undergo endometrial ablation report a successful reduction in abnormal bleeding. Up to half of women will stop having periods after the procedure. Yet, studies indicate the rate of failure (defined as bleeding or ''pain'' after endometrial ablation that required ''hysterectomy'' or reablation) was 16% to 30% at five 5 or years. Failure was most likely to occur in women younger than 45 years and in women with 5 or more children, prior ''tubal ligation'', and a history of painful ''menstrual cramps''. After endometrial ablation, 11% to 36% of women had a repeat ablation or other uterine-sparing procedure.''Although the procedure removes the uterine lining and typically results in ''infertility'', it should not be considered as a ''birth control'' measure, because pregnancy can still occur in a small portion of the endometrium that remains or has regrown. In this case there may be severe problems with the pregnancy, and the procedure should never be performed if the woman may desire pregnancy in the future.' "
Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.,"'The ''endometrium'"" is the lining of the uterus, a hollow, muscular organ in a woman's pelvis. The uterus is where a fetus grows. In most nonpregnant women, the uterus is about 3 inches long. The lower, narrow end of the uterus is the cervix, which leads to the vagina.""'Cancer of the ''endometrium'' is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called sarcoma of the uterus.'  "
Obesity and having metabolic syndrome may increase the risk of endometrial cancer.,"""Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk for endometrial cancer.""'Risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:''Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.''Endometrial cancer may develop in ''breast cancer'' patients who have been treated with tamoxifen. A patient who takes this drug and has abnormal ''vaginal bleeding'"" should have a follow-up exam and a biopsy of the endometrial lining if needed. Women taking estrogen (a hormone that can affect the growth of some cancers) alone also have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Taking estrogen combined with progesterone (another hormone) does not increase a woman's risk of endometrial cancer.""   Taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause. Taking tamoxifen to prevent or treat breast cancer. Obesity. Having metabolic syndrome. Having type 2 diabetes. Exposure of endometrial tissue to estrogen made by the body. This may be caused by:Never giving birth.Menstruating at an early age.Starting menopause at a later age. Never giving birth. Menstruating at an early age. Starting menopause at a later age. Having polycystic ovarian syndrome. Having a family history of endometrial cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter). Having certain genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome. Having endometrial hyperplasia."
Signs and symptoms of endometrial cancer include unusual vaginal bleeding or pain in the pelvis.,'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by endometrial cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'   Vaginal bleeding or discharge not related to menstruation (periods). Vaginal bleeding after menopause. Difficult or painful urination. Pain during sexual intercourse. Pain in the pelvic area.
Tests that examine the endometrium are used to detect (find) and diagnose endometrial cancer.,"'Because endometrial cancer begins inside the uterus, it does not usually show up in the results of a Pap test. For this reason, a sample of endometrial tissue must be removed and checked under a microscope to look for cancer cells. One of the following procedures may be used:''Other tests and procedures used to diagnose endometrial cancer include the following:'   Endometrial biopsy: The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus. The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Dilatation and curettage: A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The cervix is dilated and a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This procedure is also called a D&C. Hysteroscopy: A procedure to look inside the uterus for abnormal areas. A hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina and cervix into the uterus. A hysteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:''Endometrial cancer can usually be cured because it is usually diagnosed early.' The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body). How the cancer cells look under a microscope. Whether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone."
"After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A ''hysterectomy'' (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.''The following procedures may be used in the staging process:' Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.,"'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not ''lung cancer''. Many cancer deaths are caused when cancer moves from the original tumor and spreads to other tissues and organs. This is called metastatic cancer.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:,"'In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.''In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.''In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.''In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.''Low-risk endometrial cancer''Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.''High-risk endometrial cancer''Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.'   Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus). Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium. Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus. Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus). Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart). Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin."
Recurrent endometrial cancer,"'Recurrent endometrial cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the uterus, the pelvis, in lymph nodes in the abdomen, or in other parts of the body.' "
There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.,"'Different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:''After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.'   Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. Radical hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Bevacizumab is used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer. mTOR inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer. Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Metformin is being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer."
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "
Treatment options by stage,"'Low-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2)''Treatment of low-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:''If cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be done.''High-risk endometrial cancer (grade 3)''Treatment of high-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage III endometrial cancer, stage IV endometrial cancer, and recurrent endometrial cancer may include the following:' Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy).

Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall. Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin."
Recurrent endometrial cancer,"'Recurrent endometrial cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the uterus, the pelvis, in lymph nodes in the abdomen, or in other parts of the body.' "
There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.,"'Different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:''After the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.''Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.''Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.'   Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes. Radical hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed. Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Bevacizumab is used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer. mTOR inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer. Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Metformin is being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer."
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "
Treatment options by stage,"'Low-risk endometrial cancer (grade 1 or grade 2)''Treatment of low-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:''If cancer has spread to the cervix, a radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy may be done.''High-risk endometrial cancer (grade 3)''Treatment of high-risk stage I endometrial cancer and stage II endometrial cancer may include the following:''Treatment of stage III endometrial cancer, stage IV endometrial cancer, and recurrent endometrial cancer may include the following:' Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Surgery (total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen) followed by internal radiation therapy. In certain cases, external radiation therapy to the pelvis may be used in place of internal radiation therapy. Radiation therapy alone for patients who cannot have surgery. A clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen. Surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen may also be removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Surgery (radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) followed by chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy. A clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen. Surgery (radical hysterectomy and removal of lymph nodes in the pelvis so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and internal and external radiation therapy for patients who cannot have surgery. Hormone therapy for patients who cannot have surgery or radiation therapy. Targeted therapy with mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or ridaforolimus) or a monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab). A clinical trial of a new treatment regimen that may include combination chemotherapy, targeted therapy, such as an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) or signal transduction inhibitor (metformin), and/or hormone therapy, for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer."
What are uterine fibroids? What do they look like?,"'Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that originate in the uterus (womb). Although they are composed of the same smooth muscle fibers as the uterine wall (myometrium), they are much denser than normal myometrium. Uterine fibroids are usually round. In most cases, fibroids do not cause ''pain'' or other symptoms. However, exceptionally large fibroids may cause pressure on the bladder or other organs, leading to specific symptoms (see: What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids?)''Uterine fibroids are often described based upon their location within the uterus.'   Subserosal fibroids are located beneath the serosa (the lining membrane on the outside of the uterus). These often appear localized on the outside surface of the uterus or may be attached to the outside surface by a pedicle. Submucosal (submucous) fibroids are located inside the uterine cavity beneath the inner lining of the uterus. Intramural fibroids are located within the muscular wall of the uterus. Pedunculated fibroids grow on a stalk of tissue known as a pedicle (like a mushroom), extending either inside the cavity of the uterus or outside the uterus from its outer surface."
What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids? Do they cause pain?,"'Most of the time, uterine fibroids do not cause symptoms or problems, and a woman with a ''fibroid'' is usually unaware of its presence.''However, abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common symptom of a ''fibroid''. If the tumors are near the uterine lining, or interfere with the blood flow to the lining, they can cause heavy periods, painful periods, prolonged periods, or ''spotting'' between menses. Women with excessive bleeding due to fibroids may develop ''iron deficiency anemia''. Uterine fibroids that are degenerating can sometimes cause severe, localized pain.''Fibroids can also cause a number of symptoms depending on their size, location within the uterus, and how close they are to adjacent pelvic organs. Large fibroids can cause:''While fibroids do not interfere with ''ovulation'', some studies suggest that they may impair ''fertility'' and lead to poorer ''pregnancy'' outcomes. In particular, submucosal fibroids that deform the inner uterine cavity are most strongly associated with decreases in fertility. Occasionally, fibroids are the cause of recurrent miscarriages. If they are not removed in these cases, the woman may not be able to sustain a pregnancy.'   pressure, pelvic pain, including pain during sex, pressure on the bladder with frequent or even obstructed urination, and pressure on the rectum with painful or difficult defecation."
What causes uterine fibroids to grow? How big can they get?,"'We do not know exactly why women develop these tumors. Genetic abnormalities, alterations in growth factor (proteins formed in the body that direct the rate and extent of cell proliferation) expression, abnormalities in the vascular (blood vessel) system, and tissue response to injury have all been suggested to play a role in the development of fibroids.''Family history is a key factor, since there is often a history of fibroids developing in women of the same family. Race also appears to play a role. Women of African descent are two to three times more likely to develop fibroids than women of other races. Women of African ancestry also develop fibroids at a younger age and may have symptoms from fibroids in their 20s, in contrast to Caucasian women with fibroids, in whom symptoms typically occur during the 30s and 40s. Early pregnancy decreases the likelihood that fibroids will develop. Fibroids have not been observed in girls who have not reached ''puberty'', but adolescent girls may rarely develop fibroids. Other factors that researchers have associated with an increased risk of developing fibroids include having the first ''menstrual period'' (menarche) prior to age 10, consumption of ''alcohol'' (particularly beer), uterine infections, and elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''Estrogen tends to stimulate the growth of fibroids in many cases. During the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy, about a third of fibroids will enlarge and then shrink after the birth. In general, fibroids tend to shrink after ''menopause'', but ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'' may cause symptoms to persist.''Overall, these tumors are fairly common and occur in about 70% to 80% of all women by the time they reach age 50.''Uterine fibroids can be as small as a few millimeters (less than an inch) in diameter. They can also be very large (grapefruit-sized or larger).' "
Can uterine fibroids cause cancer?,"'For the most part, uterine fibroids that do not cause a problem for the woman can be left untreated. In some cases, even fibroids that are not causing symptoms require removal or at least close observation. Rapid growth is a reason to watch more carefully, since a rare cancerous form of fibroid (referred to as a leiomyosarcoma) can be a fast-growing ''tumor'', and it cannot be differentiated from a benign fibroid by ultrasound, MRI , or other imaging studies. However, this type of tumor occurs in less than 1% of uterine fibroids. It is also important to note that these rare cancerous tumors are not thought to begin in a benign fibroid.''Another risk of leaving these tumors alone is that they sometimes grow to a size that eventually causes significant symptoms, thus requiring removal. If fibroids grow large enough, the surgery to remove them can become more difficult and risky.' "
What tests diagnose uterine fibroids?,"'Uterine fibroids are diagnosed by pelvic exam and even more commonly by ultrasound. Often, a pelvic mass cannot be determined to be a fibroid on pelvic exam alone, and ultrasound is very helpful in differentiating it from other conditions such as ovarian tumors. MRI and ''CT scans'' can also play a role in diagnosing fibroids, but ultrasound is the simplest, cheapest, and best technique for imaging the pelvis. Occasionally, when trying to determine if a fibroid is present in the uterine cavity (endometrial cavity), a hysterosonogram (HSG) is done. In this procedure, an ultrasound exam is done while contrast fluid is injected into the uterus through the cervix. The fluid within the endometrial cavity can help outline any masses that are inside, such as submucosal fibroids.'  "
Are there home remedies for uterine fibroids?,"'There are no known home remedies that can shrink fibroids. If uterine fibroids are not causing symptoms or problems, they can be left alone without specific treatment. If they are large enough to cause symptoms like bleeding, pain, or pressure, medical or surgical treatment is required.' "
What is the treatment for uterine fibroids?,"'There are several uterine fibroids treatment options, including:''Medical treatments include medications such as:'   surgery (hysterectomy, myomectomy, cryosurgery), MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), and uterine artery embolization (UAE). mifepristone (RU-486), danazol (Danocrine), raloxifene (Evista), GnRH analogs (Lupron and others), and low-dose formulations of oral contraceptives."
Surgery for fibroids,"'There are many ways of managing uterine fibroids. Surgical methods are the mainstay of treatment when treatment is necessary. Possible surgical interventions include hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus (and the fibroids with it). ''Myomectomy'' is the selective removal of just the fibroids within the uterus. Myomectomy can be done through a hysteroscope, laparoscope, or with the standard open incision on the abdominal wall. Some treatments have involved boring holes into the fibroid with laser fibers, freezing probes (cryosurgery), and other destructive techniques that do not actually remove the tissue but try to destroy it in place. Surgery is necessary if there is suspicion of ''malignancy'' in any case of a leiomyoma or uterine mass.''Another technique for treating fibroids is known as uterine artery embolization (UAE). This technique uses small beads of a compound called polyvinyl alcohol, which are injected through a catheter into the arteries that feed the fibroid. These beads obstruct the blood supply to the fibroid and starve it of blood and oxygen. While this technique has not been in use long enough to evaluate long-term effects of UAE versus surgery, women undergoing UAE for fibroids have a shorter hospital stay than those having surgery but a greater risk of complications and readmissions to the hospital. Studies are underway to evaluate the long-term outcomes of UAE as opposed to surgical treatment. Uterine artery occlusion (UAO), which involves clamping the involved uterine arteries as opposed to injecting the polyvinyl alcohol beads, is currently under investigation as a potential alternative to UAE.''High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a relatively new treatment for fibroids and other abnormalities. It is also known as MRgFUS (MRI-guided focused ultrasound) and FUS (focused ultrasound surgery). HIFU uses an ultrasound transducer with higher energy than those used for diagnostic examinations. The device focuses the sound waves, generating heat to destroy the fibroid. MRI imaging may be used for planning and monitoring of treatment.'  "
Medical treatment for fibroids,"'Nonsurgical techniques are usually hormonal in nature and include the use of ''drugs'' that turn off the production of estrogen from the ovaries (GnRH analogs). These medications are given for three to six months and induce a hypoestrogenic (low estrogen) state. When successful, they can shrink the fibroids by as much as 50%. Side effects of these drugs are similar to the ''symptoms of menopause'' and can include ''hot flashes'', ''sleep'' disturbance, ''vaginal dryness'', and ''mood changes''. Bone loss leading to ''osteoporosis'' after long-term (6 to 12+ months) use is one complication. This is generally reversed after the treatment ends. These drugs may also be used as preoperative treatment for large leiomyomas to shrink them in order to make the operation less difficult and reduce surgical risk.''Mifepristone (RU-486) is an antiprogestin drug that can shrink fibroids to an extent comparable to treatment with the GnRH analogs. This drug is also used to terminate early pregnancy. Treatment with mifepristone also reduces the bleeding associated with fibroids, but this treatment can be associated with adverse side effects such as overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the ''endometrium'' (uterine lining). Mifepristone is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas, and the required dosages (different from those used for termination of early pregnancy) have not been determined.''Danazol (Danocrine) is an androgenic steroid hormone that has been used to reduce bleeding in women with fibroids, since this drug causes ''menstruation'' to cease. However, danazol does not appear to shrink the size of fibroids. Danazol is also associated with significant side effects, including ''weight gain'', ''muscle cramps'', decreased breast size, ''acne'', hirsutism (inappropriate hair growth), oily skin, mood changes, ''depression'', decreased high density lipoprotein (''HDL'' or ""good"" ''cholesterol'') levels, and increased ''liver'' enzyme levels.''The administration of raloxifene (Evista), a drug used to prevent and treat ''osteoporosis'' in postmenopausal women, has been shown to decrease the size of fibroids in postmenopausal women, but results with this therapy in premenopausal women have been conflicting.''Low dose formulations of oral contraceptives are also sometimes given to treat the abnormal bleeding associated with fibroids, but these do not shrink the fibroids themselves.' "
What are the risks of uterine fibroids during pregnancy?,"'Some studies have shown an increased risk of pregnancy complications in the presence of fibroids, such as first trimester bleeding, breech presentation, ''placental abruption'', and problems during ''labor''. Fibroids have also been associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. The size of the fibroid and its precise location within the uterus are important factors in determining whether a fibroid causes obstetric complications.' "
What causes uterine fibroids?,"'The exact cause of ''uterine fibroids'' is unknown. It’s believed that ''uterine fibroids'' may develop from ''stem cells'' in the muscular layer of the uterus (myometrium). The cells multiply due to various causative factors creating a firm, rubbery mass.''Based on research and clinical experience, the causative factors include:''Risk factors of ''uterine fibroids'':' Genetics: Certain genetic changes are seen in the fibroid tissue. Hormones: Estrogen and progesterone are female reproductive hormones. These hormones are responsible for the thickening and shedding of the uterine lining during each menstrual cycle. Imbalance of these hormones may cause fibroids. Fibroids have more progesterone and estrogen compared to normal uterine muscle cells. Fibroids tend to shrink after menopause. They may also shrink during pregnancy or after childbirth. Growth factors: Some substances that help the body to build and maintain tissues, such as insulin-like growth factors, can lead to the development of fibroids. Extracellular matrix (ECM): ECM is what makes the cells stick together, like cement between bricks. ECM is higher in fibroids; these store growth factors and cause biological changes in the cells. Race: Any woman of reproductive age can develop fibroids, but black women are at a higher risk to develop fibroids compared to other racial groups. Women of reproductive age Family history: If a relative has had fibroids, the risk increases. Early-onset of menstruation Obesity Vitamin D deficiency A diet that is higher in red meat and lowers in green vegetables, fruit, and dairy Drinking alcohol"
How are uterine fibroids treated?,"'The treatment options include:''Observation and follow-up'': Many women with uterine fibroids may not have signs or have mild symptoms that can be managed conservatively to provide symptomatic relief.''Medications'': Medications that target hormones, which regulate the menstrual cycle, treat symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding or ''pain''. Medications do not eliminate fibroids but may help shrink them.''Noninvasive procedures:''Minimally invasive procedures:''Traditional surgical procedures:' Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists: They block the production of estrogen and progesterone. This causes menstruation to stop, putting the patient in a temporary menopausal state. As a result, fibroids shrink and anemia often improves. Progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD): A progestin-releasing IUD can relieve symptoms like heavy bleeding caused by fibroids. It provides an additional benefit of contraception but doesn't shrink fibroids or make them disappear. Lysteda, Cyklokapron (Tranexamic acid): This nonhormonal medication is taken to reduce bleeding during periods. Oral contraceptives: These can help control menstrual bleeding but don't shrink fibroid size. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These can be effective in relieving pain related to fibroids, but they don't reduce menstrual bleeding or shrink fibroids. Nutritional supplements: Vitamins and iron supplements may be advised to correct anemia and improve overall health. A non-invasive treatment option for uterine fibroids that preserves your uterus requires no incision and is done on an outpatient basis. Performed while you are inside an MRI scanner equipped with a high-energy ultrasound transducer for treatment. The images give your doctor the precise location of the uterine fibroids. When the location of the fibroid is targeted, the ultrasound transducer focuses the sound waves (sonication) into the fibroid to heat and destroy small areas of the fibroid tissue. With newer technology researchers are learning more about the long-term safety and effectiveness. However, so far, the data collected show that focused ultrasound surgery for uterine fibroids is safe and effective. Uterine artery embolization: Small particles (embolic agents) are injected into the arteries supplying to the uterus that cuts off blood flow to fibroids, causing them to regress. Radiofrequency ablation: Radiofrequency energy is used to destroy uterine fibroids and shrinks the blood vessels that feed them. Laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy: During myomectomy surgery, the fibroids are removed, leaving the uterus intact. Hysteroscopic myomectomy: The surgeon inserts instruments through the vagina and cervix into the uterus to remove the fibroid. Endometrial ablation: A specialized instrument inserted into the uterus. Heat, microwave energy, hot water, or electric current is used to destroy the lining of the uterus resulting in the ending of menstruation or reducing menstrual flow. Abdominal myomectomy: In the case of multiple fibroids or very large or deep fibroids, the surgeon may use an open abdominal surgical technique to remove the fibroids. Hysterectomy: This involves the removal of the uterus. It is a permanent solution for uterine fibroids."
What are uterine growths?,"'Uterine growths are tissue enlargements of the female womb (uterus). Uterine growths can be caused by either harmless or dangerous conditions. Growths are sometimes referred to medically as masses or tumors. An example of a harmless (benign or non-cancerous) growth, which does not pose a threat, is a polyp of the cervix. Some growths, such as ''uterine fibroids'', are benign, but they can still cause some annoying problems, such as bleeding. Dangerous growths of the uterus include cancerous (''malignant'') tumors.''While the majority of uterine growths are benign, ''cancers'' of the uterus do occur. This article will discuss the benign conditions that cause uterine growths or masses. Benign growths, or non-cancerous, growths include ''uterine fibroids'', adenomyosis, and uterine polyps.'""The uterus (or womb) is a hollow, pear-shaped organ that is located in a woman's pelvis between the bladder and the rectum. The narrow, lower portion of the uterus is the cervix; the broader, upper part is known as the corpus. The cervix forms the transition between the uterus and the vagina. The vagina, or birth canal, connects the uterus to the outside of the body.""  "
What are uterine fibroids?,"'Uterine fibroids'' are benign masses that grow in the uterus for unclear reasons. Uterine fibroids are commonly called by the shorter name, ""fibroids."" The medical term for a ''fibroid'' is leiomyoma, which refers to a proliferation or abnormal growth of smooth muscle tissue. Uterine fibroids arise from the tissue in the muscle layer of the wall of the uterus, called the myometrium. They are not usually cancerous.''The reason why some women develop fibroids is not yet understood. Family history may play a role, since there is often a history of fibroids developing in women of the same family. For poorly understood reasons, fibroids are more common in African American women (who have a two- to threefold increased risk) than in white Americans or Asian women. Fibroids are most common between the ages of 35 to 49. In addition, women who are ''overweight'' have an increased risk of fibroids. Most women with fibroids probably go through life not even knowing they have them, because fibroids are often found incidentally during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids and what do they look like?,"'Most women with uterine fibroids have no symptoms. However, fibroids can cause a number of symptoms depending on their size, location within the uterus, and how close they are to adjacent pelvic organs. Large fibroids can cause:''Abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common symptom of a ''fibroid''. If the tumors are near the uterine lining, or interfere with the blood flow to the lining, they can cause heavy periods, painful periods, prolonged periods or ''spotting'' between menses. Uterine fibroids that are deteriorating can sometimes cause severe, localized pain.''The main answer is that uterine fibroids can cause bleeding. This bleeding can sometimes be significant and lead to ''anemia''. Fibroids can also lead to complications as discussed in the next section. Fortunately, there are also many nonsurgical means available to treat fibroids.'   Bleeding Pressure Pelvic pain Pressure on the bladder with frequent or even obstructed urination Pain during intercourse Reproductive difficulties such as infertility, miscarriage, or premature labor Pressure on the rectum with pain during defecation"
How are uterine fibroids diagnosed?,"'Fibroids are diagnosed by performing a manual pelvic examination (bimanual examination) and confirmed by ''ultrasound''. Ultrasound is harmless and does not involve ''radiation'' exposure. This test is similar to the one performed in ''pregnant'' women to view the developing fetus inside the uterus. Rarely, more complex imaging is used, but only in cases wherein the doctor cannot determine the exact nature of the mass found on the physical exam or ultrasound.' "
What is the treatment for uterine fibroids?,"'Some of the reasons for surgical removal of uterine fibroids include:'   If there is still concern that the uterine growth could be cancer: In these cases, the doctor is not certain that the growth is actually a benign fibroid. Unusually rapid growth is a sign that a uterine growth may be cancerous. The growth must be removed and examined by a pathologist for signs of more dangerous conditions. If other pelvic surgery is already being done: There are other reasons for pelvic surgery, such as ovarian disease. If all medical treatments have failed to stop bleeding or other complications."
Surgery for uterine fibroids,"'There are three major categories of surgery for fibroids.''It might seem very appealing to a woman to just have the uterus removed, however, as with any surgery, complications can include a risk (though extremely low) of dying or having complications from the general anesthesia. There are also risks of bleeding and infection, although these risks are fairly low. However, a hysterectomy is actually a more significant procedure than many women realize in that it does require substantial recovery time.' Hysterectomy: Removal of the uterus is called a hysterectomy. Fibroids are the most common reason that hysterectomies are performed in the United States. Advantages are that: (1) the fibroids never return (the only ""cure"" for fibroids); (2) the woman will never have another menstrual period (which some, but not all women, find to be an advantage); and (3) contraception is no longer a concern. It is easy to understand, therefore, that the best candidates for hysterectomy have already finished their childbearing. Myomectomy (Local Resection): This surgery involves the removal of the fibroids themselves without removal of the whole uterus. Myomectomy is not permanent in the sense that fibroids can grow back after the procedure. The fibroids grow back in about 25% to 50% of women, and about 10% of women will need a second surgery. Although myomectomy is a sure temporary measure, it is less guaranteed to be a permanent solution. Thus, this procedure is often used to ""buy time"" if the woman is planning to become pregnant in the next few years. The advantages of this surgery are that it preserves the uterus for childbearing and involves less extensive surgery, which implies less extensive recovery periods. Certainly, in the short term, bleeding tends to be much improved after myomectomy (in about 80% of women). Embolization: Another technique for treating fibroids is known as uterine artery embolization (UAE). This technique uses small beads of a compound called polyvinyl alcohol, which are injected through a catheter into the arteries that supply the fibroid. These beads obstruct the blood supply to the fibroid and starve it of blood and oxygen. Uterine artery occlusion (UAO), which involves clamping the involved uterine arteries as opposed to injecting the polyvinyl alcohol beads, has also been used as a way to interrupt blood supply to the fibroid. Other Procedures: Some treatments have involved boring holes into the fibroid with laser fibers, freezing probes (cryosurgery), and other destructive techniques that do not actually remove the tissue but try to destroy it in place."
What other medical treatments are available for uterine fibroids?,"'It is important to remember that fibroids only require treatment if they cause bleeding or pain. There are several medical treatments available for fibroids. ''Birth control pills'' (''oral contraceptives'') can provide many benefits for women with fibroids. They decrease the amount of uterine bleeding by about 50% and decrease cramping pain during ''menstruation''. They also may also decrease the risk of fibroids.''Other medical treatments include the use of ''drugs'' that turn off the production of estrogen from the ovaries (GnRH analogs). These medications are given for three to six months. When successful, they can shrink the fibroids by as much as 50%.''Mifepristone'' (''RU-486'') is an antiprogestin drug that can shrink fibroids to an extent comparable to treatment with the GnRH analogs. This drug, sometimes known as the ""''morning-after pill'',"" is also used to terminate early ''pregnancy''. Treatment with mifepristone also reduces the bleeding associated with fibroids, but this treatment can be associated with adverse side effects such as overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the ''endometrium'' (uterine lining).''Danazol'' (''Danocrine'') is an androgenic steroid hormone that has been used to reduce bleeding in women with fibroids, since this drug causes ''menstruation'' to cease. However, danazol does not appear to shrink the size of fibroids.''Letrozole'' (''Femara''), an aromatase inhibitor blocks the conversion of testosterone to estrogen and is used to treat some women with ''breast cancer''. Preliminary studies have shown a potential role for aromatase inhibitors in the management of fibroids, but more research is needed.''The administration of ''raloxifene'' (''Evista'') (a drug used to prevent and treat ''osteoporosis'' in ''postmenopausal'' women) has been shown to decrease the size of fibroids in postmenopausal women, but results with this therapy in premenopausal women have been conflicting.''Fibroids themselves do not require treatment, but women with fibroids can develop complications as a result of fibroids, including bleeding and ''pelvic pain'' (as discussed previously). It is because of symptoms that doctors may suggest treatment for a fibroid. Only 20% to 50% of women with fibroids have symptoms due to the condition, primarily bleeding or pelvic pressure.''In addition to bleeding and pelvic pressure, fibroids can cause recurrent miscarriage, ''infertility'', premature ''labor'', and ''labor'' complications. However, a substantial majority of women with fibroids are able to have successful ''pregnancies'' unless the uterine ''cavity'' is unusually distorted.' "
What is adenomyosis?,"'Adenomyosis is the growth of uterine tissue from one particular layer of the uterus (the endometrial glands from the lining tissue of the uterus) into the ""wrong"" layer (the muscle layer, called the myometrium). It is a benign condition, but it can enlarge the uterus, clinically appearing as a growth. Adenomyosis is similar to ''endometriosis'', which is the growth of cells similar to those that form the inside of the uterus (endometrial cells), in a location outside of the uterus. In adenomyosis, the abnormal growth of endometrial cells occurs within the muscular layer of the uterus itself rather than outside the uterus.''The cause of adenomyosis is not well understood. Some researchers believe that previous surgeries on the uterus (including Cesarean births) can cause the endometrial (uterine lining) cells to spread and grow in an abnormal location (the muscular layer of the uterine wall). Another possibility is that adenomyosis arises from tissues in the uterine wall itself that may have been deposited there during development of the uterus.''Adenomyosis is more common after ''childbirth''.'  "
What are the symptoms of adenomyosis and what does it look like?,"'Adenomyosis may not produce any symptoms, although some women may experience:' Excessive bleeding Painful menstrual periods Bleeding between periods Painful intercourse"
How is adenomyosis diagnosed?,'The true diagnosis of adenomyosis is only possible with actual microscopic examination of uterine tissue. This means that it is ultimately diagnosed after hysterectomy. Sometimes the results of a physical examination and/or ultrasound examination may suggest the presence of adenomyosis.' 
How is adenomyosis treated?,"'Pain medications are used to relieve the cramping pain of adenomyosis. Currently, the only effective treatment for adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, meaning removal of the uterus. This requires a recovery period and carries the risk of surgery and anesthesia, as described previously. The decision as to whether or not to have a hysterectomy depends on the severity of the symptoms and the overall health of the patient. Controlling the ''menstrual cycle'' through hormonal contraception (''the pill'') or use of other hormones may provide some symptom relief.' "
What are uterine polyps?,"'Polyps of the uterus are benign overgrowths, or bulges, of the normal tissue lining the uterus into the uterine ''cavity''. Polyps may also be found in the uterine cervix. Polyps are usually attached to the underlying tissue by a base or stalk, and they vary in size. Polyps only rarely contain cancerous cells. They are most common in women in their 40s and are rare in women under 20 years of age.' "
What are the symptoms of uterine polyps and what do they look like?,"'Uterine polyps may not produce any symptoms. However, some women may experience:'   Irregular vaginal bleeding Bleeding after intercourse Heavy menstrual bleeding"
How are uterine polyps diagnosed and treated?,"'Sometimes, the polyps stick out through the opening of the cervix so that they are visible during a speculum exam, such as during a ''Pap smear''. Diagnosis is by ultrasound or examination under a microscope of the tissue removed during uterine sampling. A diagnosis can also be made by ''hysteroscopy'', the insertion of a scope that allows visualization of the uterine cavity from the inside. It is often possible to remove polyps during this procedure. Curettage, a procedure in which the lining of the uterus is removed, can be used to cure endometrial polyps in most cases.' "
What is endometrial biopsy procedure?,"'The uterus (womb) is lined by a special type of tissue known as the ''endometrium''. Endometrial biopsy, or endometrial sampling, is a technique of removing a piece of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The sample of tissue is analyzed under a microscope in the laboratory by a pathologist, a doctor with special training in diagnosis of diseases based upon tissue examination.'  "
Is endometrial biopsy painful?,"'Usually, endometrial biopsy procedures painful, and women who are having the procedure should be notified. There are ''drugs'' to stop the ''pain'' caused by the biopsy. ''Endometriosis'' can have an impact psychologicaly on women with the condition due to severe ''pain''. Moreover, the severe pain caused by ''endometriosis'' is compounded negatively by the inability to conceive.\xa0\xa0' "
Why is endometrial biopsy done?,"'An endometrial biopsy is most often performed to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help evaluate the cause of ''infertility'', test for uterine infections, and even monitor the response to certain medications.''Endometrial biopsy has many advantages over the more complicated procedure known as ''dilation and curettage'"" (D&C), which is a more extensive removal of the uterine lining that requires dilation (stretching) of the cervical opening with special instruments. Unlike D&C, endometrial biopsy may be performed in the doctor's office and typically does not require anesthesia or hospitalization.""'Endometrial biopsy cannot be performed during ''pregnancy'', and sometimes may not be recommended when certain other conditions are present, including ''cancer of the cervix'' or abnormal narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening.' "
How is endometrial biopsy done?,"""Endometrial biopsy is most often done in the physician's office, but it can be performed on women in the hospital. The patient lies on the examining table in a position similar to that used for obtaining Pap smears. The doctor uses a speculum to open the vaginal canal and visualize the cervix, the opening to the uterus. During endometrial biopsy the doctor inserts a thin ""'plastic'' or metal tubular device through the cervix into the uterus to remove a tiny piece of the inner lining tissue.''Usually no anesthesia is required, but taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (''NSAID'') 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure can help reduce cramping and pain. In some cases, a small amount of ''lidocaine'' anesthetic is inserted into the uterine ''cavity'' to minimize discomfort.' "
What are the risks of endometrial biopsy?,"'There are very few risks with endometrial biopsy. The leading risk is pain or cramping, but this typically subsides rapidly following the procedure. Other less common risks are:' Feeling faint or light-headed Infection Bleeding Rarely, perforation of the uterus"
What is a urinary tract infection (UTI)?,"'A ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') is an infection involving the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. These are the structures that urine passes through before being eliminated from the body.''Any part of this system can become infected. As a rule, the farther up in the urinary tract the infection is located, the more serious it is.''In the United States, ''urinary tract infections'' account for more than 10 million visits to medical offices and hospitals each year.'   The kidneys are a pair of small organs that lie on either side of the spine at about waist level. They have several important functions in the body, including removing waste and excess water from the blood and eliminating them as urine. These functions make them important in the regulation of blood pressure. Kidneys are also very sensitive to changes in blood sugar levels and blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Both diabetes and hypertension can cause damage to these organs. Two ureters, narrow tubes about 10 inches long, drain urine from each kidney into the bladder. The bladder is a small saclike organ that collects and stores urine. When the urine reaches a certain level in the bladder, we experience the sensation that we have to void, then the muscle lining the bladder can be voluntarily contracted to expel the urine. The urethra is a small tube connecting the bladder with the outside of the body. A muscle called the urinary sphincter, located at the junction of the bladder and the urethra, must relax at the same time the bladder contracts to expel urine. The upper urinary tract is composed of the kidneys and ureters. Infection in the upper urinary tract generally affects the kidneys (pyelonephritis), which can cause fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and other severe symptoms. The lower urinary tract consists of the bladder and the urethra. Infection in the lower urinary tract can affect the urethra (urethritis) or the bladder (cystitis). Urinary tract infections are much more common in adults than in children, but about 1%-2% of children do get urinary tract infections. Urinary tract infections in children are more likely to be serious than those in adults (especially in younger children). Urinary tract infection is the most common urinary tract problem in children besides bedwetting. Urinary tract infection is second only to respiratory infection as the most common type of infection. These infections are much more common in girls and women than in boys and men younger than 50 years of age. The reason for this is not well understood, but anatomic differences between the genders (a shorter urethra in women) might be partially responsible. About 40% of women and 12% of men have a urinary tract infection at some time in their life."
What are causes and risk factors for a urinary tract infection?,"'The urine is normally sterile. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the urine and begin to grow. The bacterial infection usually starts at the opening of the urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the urinary tract.''The following people are at increased risk of urinary tract infection:''The following special groups may be at increased risk of urinary tract infection:' The culprit in at least 90% of uncomplicated infections is a type of bacteria called Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli. These bacteria normally live in the bowel (colon) and around the anus. These bacteria can move from the area around the anus to the opening of the urethra. The two most common causes of this are improper wiping and sexual intercourse. Usually, the act of emptying the bladder (urinating) flushes the bacteria out of the urethra. If there are too many bacteria, urinating may not stop their spread. The bacteria can travel up the urethra to the bladder, where they can grow and cause an infection. The infection can spread further as the bacteria move up from the bladder via the ureters. If they reach the kidney, they can cause a kidney infection (pyelonephritis), which can become a very serious condition if not treated promptly. People with conditions that block (obstruct) the urinary tract, such as kidney stones People with medical conditions that cause incomplete bladder emptying (for example, spinal cord injury) Postmenopausal women: Decreased circulating estrogen makes the urinary tract more vulnerable to a UTI. People with suppressed immune systems: Examples of situations in which the immune system is suppressed are HIV/AIDS and diabetes. People who take immunosuppressant medications such as chemotherapy for cancer also are at increased risk. Women who are sexually active: Sexual intercourse can introduce larger numbers of bacteria into the bladder. Urinating after intercourse seems to decrease the likelihood of developing a urinary tract infection. Women who use a diaphragm for birth control Men with an enlarged prostate: Prostatitis or obstruction of the urethra by an enlarged prostate can lead to incomplete bladder emptying, thus increasing the risk of infection. This is most common in older men. Breastfeeding has been found to decrease the risk for urinary tract infections in children. Very young infants: Bacteria gain entry to the urinary tract via the bloodstream from other sites in the body. Young children: Young children have trouble wiping themselves and washing their hands well after a bowel movement. Poor hygiene has been linked to an increased frequency of urinary tract infections. Children of all ages: Urinary tract infection in children can be (but is not always) a sign of an abnormality in the urinary tract, usually a partial blockage. An example is a condition in which urine moves backward from the bladder up the ureters (vesicoureteral reflux). Hospitalized patients or nursing-home residents: Many of these individuals are catheterized for long periods and are thus vulnerable to infection of the urinary tract. Catheterization means that a thin tube (catheter) is placed in the urethra to drain urine from the bladder. This is done for people who have problems urinating or cannot reach a toilet to urinate on their own. Patients using catheters: If a patient is required to empty their bladder using a catheter, they are at increased risk for infection."
Are urinary tract infections contagious?,'No. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are not ''contagious''.' 
What are urinary tract infection symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms develop rapidly and may or may not include the symptoms for a lower urinary tract infection.''In newborns, infants, children, and elderly people, the classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection may not be present. Other symptoms may indicate a urinary tract infection.''Pregnant'' women are at increased risk for an UTI. Typically, pregnant women do not have unusual or unique symptoms. If a woman is pregnant, her urine should be checked during ''prenatal'' visits because an unrecognized infection can cause ''pregnancy'' health complications.''Although most people have symptoms with a urinary tract infection, some do not.''The ''symptoms of urinary tract infection'' can resemble those of ''sexually transmitted diseases''.'

   Bladder (cystitis, or bladder infection): The lining of the urethra and bladder becomes inflamed and irritated. Dysuria: pain or burning during urination Frequency: more frequent urination (or waking up at night to urinate, sometimes referred to as nocturia); often with only a small amount of urine Urinary urgency: the sensation of having to urinate urgently Cloudy, bad-smelling, or bloody urine Lower abdominal pain or pelvic pressure or pain Mild fever (less than 101 F), chills, and ""just not feeling well"" (malaise) Urethra (urethritis): Burning with urination Fairly high fever (higher than 101 F) Shaking chills Nausea Vomiting Flank pain: pain in the back or side, usually on only one side at about waist level Newborns: fever or hypothermia (low temperature), poor feeding, jaundice Infants: vomiting, diarrhea, fever, poor feeding, not thriving Children: irritability, eating poorly, unexplained fever that doesn't go away, loss of bowel control, loose bowels, change in urination pattern Elderly people: fever or hypothermia, poor appetite, lethargy, change in mental status"
When should people seek medical care for a UTI?,"'Any adult or child who develops any of the symptoms of a urinary tract infection needs to be evaluated by a medical professional, preferably within 24 hours. Most medical offices can test urine for infection by using a quick urine ""dipstick"" test.''If someone has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection and any of the following applies, he or she may be at risk for complications of the urinary tract infection.''Infants, children, and elderly people with any of the signs and ''symptoms of UTI'' should see their health care professional as soon as possible or go to an emergency department for evaluation.' Someone who has symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection should call a health care professional for an appointment, preferably on the same day that symptoms are recognized. Someone who has symptoms of an upper urinary tract infection involving the kidneys should call a health care professional immediately. Depending on the situation, he or she will recommend either a visit to the office or to a hospital emergency department. Vomiting and inability to keep down clear fluids or medication Not better after taking antibiotics for two days Pregnant Having diabetes or another disease that affects the immune system Taking medication that suppresses the immune system such as cancer chemotherapy Fever, lethargy, and poor appetite may indicate a urinary tract infection in these groups, but they may also be signs of something more serious. Urinary tract infections have the potential to make these vulnerable people very ill when the bacteria spread into the bloodstream."
How do health care professionals diagnose a urinary tract infection?,"'Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection is based on information someone gives about his or her symptoms, medical and surgical history, medications, habits, and lifestyle. A physical examination and lab tests complete the evaluation.''A health care professional may simply perform a urine dipstick test in the office. Only a few minutes are needed to obtain results. Your health care provider may also send a urine sample to the lab for culture testing (see below). These results take a few days to come back. This tells the doctor the exact bacteria causing the infection and to which antibiotics these bacteria have resistance or sensitivity. The culture is usually sent for special populations, including men, because they are less likely to get UTIs. It is not necessary to send a culture for everyone because the majority of UTIs are caused by the same bacteria.''For a culture specimen, the patient will be asked to give a clean-catch, midstream urine specimen. This avoids contamination of the urine with bacteria from the skin. Patients will be instructed in how to do this.''If someone cannot produce a urine specimen or is unable to follow instructions for a clean-catch specimen, a health care professional may obtain a urine specimen by catheterization.''Depending on their symptoms, sexually active women could require a pelvic examination because pelvic infections can have similar symptoms as a urinary tract infection. Males will require a genital examination, and depending on the symptoms, most likely a prostate examination. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.''Men will most likely require a rectal examination so that the prostate can be checked. A prostate infection (prostatitis) requires a longer course of antibiotics than a urinary tract infection.''Rarely, an imaging test may be indicated to detect any underlying problem in the urinary tract that could cause an infection. This is usually only necessary in repeat infections or special circumstances (unusual bacteria, suspected anatomic abnormalities).''Imaging tests are most often needed for the following groups:' The single most important lab test is urinalysis. A urine culture will be tested for signs of infection, such as the presence of white blood cells and bacteria. In certain circumstances, urine also may be ""cultured."" This means that a small amount of the urine is brushed on a sterile nutrient substance in a plastic plate. The plate is allowed to sit for a few days and then examined to see what kind of bacteria are growing on it. These bacteria are treated with different antibiotics to see which works best against them. This helps determine the best treatment for the specific infection. Blood tests usually are not required unless a complicated condition, such as pyelonephritis or kidney failure, is suspected. Midstream means urinating a little into the toilet before collecting a specimen. The idea is to avoid collecting the urine that comes out first, as this urine is often contaminated. Clean-catch refers to a midstream sample that was collected after cleaning the area of the urethral opening. Adult women and older girls: Cleanse the area around the urethral opening gently (but completely) using a sterile wipe or soap and water. Catch the urine midstream. For some women, catheterization (inserting a tube into the bladder) may be the only way to obtain a sterile, uncontaminated specimen. Men and boys: A sterile specimen can usually be obtained with a midstream catch. Uncircumcised males should retract the foreskin and cleanse the area before urinating. Newborns: Urine may be obtained with a catheter or a procedure in which a needle is introduced through the lower abdominal wall to draw (aspirate) urine from the bladder. Infants and children: Either catheterization or the needle aspiration method is used. This means placing a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra to drain urine from the bladder. The catheter usually is removed after the bladder is emptied. The catheter may remain in place if someone is very ill or if it is necessary to collect all urine or measure urine output. An ultrasound examination can evaluate kidney and bladder problems. A fluoroscopic study can show any physical problems that predispose children to urinary tract infections. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a special series of X-rays that uses a contrast dye to highlight abnormalities in the urinary tract. Cystoscopy involves insertion of a thin, flexible tube with a tiny camera on the end through the urethra into the bladder. This allows detection of abnormalities inside the bladder that might contribute to infections. A CT scan gives a very detailed three-dimensional picture of the urinary tract. Children with repeat urinary tract infections, especially boys Up to 50% of infants and 30% of older children with a urinary tract infection have an anatomic abnormality. The child's pediatrician should investigate this possibility. Adults with frequent or recurrent urinary tract infections People who have blood in the urine"
What is the treatment for a urinary tract infection?,"'The usual treatment for both simple and complicated urinary tract infections is antibiotics. The type of antibiotic and duration of treatment depend on the circumstances. Examples of common antibiotics used in treatment include, but are not limited to, ''amoxicillin'', ''sulfamethoxazole''/''trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim''), ''ciprofloxacin'', ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Macrobid''), and many others. Your health care provider will chose the appropriate medication for your condition and the specific causative organisms.''A person may be hospitalized if he or she has symptoms of pyelonephritis and any of the following:''Urethritis in men and women can be caused by the same bacteria as sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs''). Therefore, people with symptoms of ''STDs'' (vaginal or ''penile discharge'', for example) should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Your doctor will have to evaluate you for urinalysis as well as UTIs if you experience any pain in the genital area.'

   In an otherwise healthy person, a three-day course of antibiotics is usually enough. Some providers prefer a seven-day course of antibiotics. Occasionally, a single dose of an antibiotic is used. A health care professional will determine which of these options is best. In adult males, if the prostate is also infected (prostatitis), four weeks or more of antibiotic treatment may be required. Adult females with potential for or early involvement of the kidneys, urinary tract abnormalities, or diabetes are usually given a five- to seven-day course of antibiotics. Children with uncomplicated cystitis are usually given a 10-day course of antibiotics. To alleviate burning pain during urination, phenazopyridine (Pyridium) or a similar drug, can be used in addition to antibiotics for one to two days. Young, otherwise healthy patients with symptoms of pyelonephritis can be treated as outpatients. They may receive IV fluids and antibiotics or an injection of antibiotics in the emergency department, followed by 10-14 days of oral antibiotics. They should follow up with their health care professional in one to two days to monitor improvement. If someone is very ill, dehydrated, or unable to keep anything in his or her stomach because of vomiting, an IV will be inserted into the arm. He or she will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids and antibiotics through the IV until he/she is well enough to switch to an oral antibiotic. A complicated, acute infection may require treatment for several weeks. Appear very ill Are pregnant Have not gotten better with outpatient antibiotic treatment Have underlying diseases that compromise the immune system (diabetes is one example) or are taking immunosuppressive medication Are unable to keep anything in the stomach because of nausea or vomiting Had previous kidney disease, especially pyelonephritis, within the last 30 days Have a device such as a urinary catheter in place Have kidney stones"
Are there home remedies for a urinary tract infection?,"'There are a variety of self-care measures (home remedies) and other treatments available for urinary tract infections.''Because the symptoms of a urinary tract infection mimic those of other conditions, someone should see a health care professional if a urinary tract infection is suspected. A urine test is needed to confirm an infection. Self-care is not recommended.'   Use a hot-water bottle to ease pain. Drink plenty of water. Avoid coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods, all of which irritate the bladder. There are some indications that cranberry juice can help fight a urinary tract infection."
What kinds of doctors treat urinary tract infections?,"""Most urinary tract infections can be treated by your primary care doctor (including family medicine and internal-medicine specialists, as well as gynecologists) or your child's pediatrician. They are usually the best provider to treat you as they are most familiar with your medical history, medications you are taking, and other factors that might affect your treatment. If you seek treatment in an urgent care facility, a specialist in ""'emergency medicine'' may be involved in your care.''If there are frequent reoccurrences of UTIs or if complicating circumstances are present, your primary care doctor might refer you to a ''urologist'', a physician who specializes in diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to the urinary system.' "
How long does a UTI last after treatment with antibiotics?,"   Symptoms of lower urinary tract infections usually resolve within 24 hours of starting the medication. The full amount of prescribed antibiotics should be taken even if the symptoms are fully gone. Upper urinary tract symptoms (pyelonephritis) will usually take longer to respond to treatment. The patient will usually improve within 24 hours, but it will often take longer until all symptoms resolve."
What follow-up is needed for a urinary tract infection?,"""Follow a health care professional's treatment recommendations. Finish all medications even if feeling better before the medication is gone. A health care professional will want the patient to have a follow-up appointment to repeat the urinalysis and make sure he or she is getting better.""'Occasionally, the infection does not go away with the first treatment. If someone is being treated for an infection and has any of the following, call a health care professional promptly:' Children and adults with kidney involvement should be seen again in one to two days. People recovering from uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections might be told that they only have to return if symptoms don't go away or if they return. Fever or pain with urination is not gone after two days of antibiotic treatment. Someone cannot keep the medication down or it has severe side effects. Someone is unable to keep foods, fluids, or medication down because of nausea or vomiting. Someone develops signs of kidney involvement (such as flank pain, shaking chills, high fever). Someone's symptoms are worse rather than better after two days of antibiotics."
Is it possible to prevent a urinary tract infection?," Women and girls should wipe from front to back (not back to front) after bowel movements. This helps prevent bacteria from the anus entering the urethra. Empty the bladder regularly and completely, especially after sexual intercourse. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water. Cranberry juice, especially, has been shown to help prevent urinary tract infections. Women should empty the bladder soon after sexual intercourse."
What is the prognosis of a urinary tract infection?," For people with uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis, antibiotic treatment usually brings complete resolution of the infection. If not treated promptly, urinary tract infections can cause permanent scarring of the urinary tract. Recurrent urinary tract infections can become a problem and will require close monitoring by your health care provider. Pyelonephritis, if not treated promptly, can spread to the bloodstream and cause a very severe infection.Short-term and long-term kidney damage can be a result of pyelonephritis.Death from pyelonephritis is rare in otherwise healthy people.Factors associated with poor outcome are old age or general debility, kidney stones, recent hospitalization, diabetes, sickle cell disease, cancer, or chronic kidney disease.

"Intraocular melanoma is a 
disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the eye.","'Intraocular melanoma begins in the middle of three layers of the wall of the eye. The outer layer includes the white sclera (the ""white of the eye"") and the clear ''cornea'' at the front of the eye. The inner layer has a lining of nerve tissue, called the retina, which senses light and sends images along the ''optic nerve'' to the brain.''The middle layer, where intraocular melanoma forms, is called the uvea or uveal tract, and has three main parts:''The iris is the colored area at the front of the eye (the ""eye color""). It can be seen through the clear cornea. The pupil is in the center of the iris and it changes size to let more or less light into the eye. Intraocular melanoma of the iris is usually a small tumor that grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.''The ciliary body is a ring of tissue with muscle fibers that change the size of the pupil and the shape of the ''lens''. It is found behind the iris. Changes in the shape of the lens help the eye focus. The ciliary body also makes the clear fluid that fills the space between the cornea and the iris. Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.''The choroid is a layer of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. Most intraocular melanomas begin in the choroid. Intraocular melanoma of the choroid is often larger and more likely to spread to other parts of the body than intraocular melanoma of the iris.''Intraocular melanoma is a rare ''cancer'' that forms from cells that make melanin in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.

Signs of intraocular melanoma include blurred vision or a dark spot on the iris.,'Intraocular melanoma may not cause early signs or symptoms. It is sometimes found during a regular eye exam when the doctor dilates the pupil and looks into the eye. Signs and symptoms may be caused by intraocular melanoma or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:'  Blurred vision or other change in vision. Floaters (spots that drift in your field of vision) or flashes of light. A dark spot on the iris. A change in the size or shape of the pupil. A change in the position of the eyeball in the eye socket.
"Tests that examine the eye are used to help detect (find) and diagnose 
intraocular melanoma.","'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (enlarged) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is checked. Pictures may be taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor. There are several types of eye exams:Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.Slit-lamp biomicroscopy: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.Gonioscopy: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. Ophthalmoscopy: An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy: An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope. Gonioscopy: An exam of the front part of the eye between the cornea and iris. A special instrument is used to see if the area where fluid drains out of the eye is blocked. Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. High-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a more detailed picture of the inside of the eye than a regular ultrasound. The tumor is checked for its size, shape, and thickness, and for signs that the tumor has spread to nearby tissue. Transillumination of the globe and iris: An exam of the iris, cornea, lens, and ciliary body with a light placed on either the upper or lower lid. Fluorescein angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. An orange fluorescent dye (fluorescein) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. Indocyanine green angiography: A procedure to look at blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. A green dye (indocyanine green) is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any areas that are blocked or leaking. Ocular coherence tomography: An imaging test that uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina, and sometimes the choroid, to see if there is swelling or fluid beneath the retina."
A biopsy of the tumor is rarely needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma.,"'A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Rarely, a biopsy of the tumor is needed to diagnose intraocular melanoma. Tissue that is removed during a biopsy or surgery to remove the tumor may be tested to get more information about prognosis and which treatment options are best.''The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue:''A biopsy may result in ''retinal detachment'' (the retina separates from other tissues in the eye). This can be repaired by surgery.' Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Gene expression profiling: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are checked for certain types of RNA."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:' How the melanoma cells look under a microscope. The size and thickness of the tumor. The part of the eye the tumor is in (the iris, ciliary body, or choroid). Whether the tumor has spread within the eye or to other places in the body. Whether there are certain changes in the genes linked to intraocular melanoma. The patient's age and general health. Whether the tumor has recurred (come back) after treatment."

These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.' Blood chemistry studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. Liver function tests: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found. more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter."
There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.,"'Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:' Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body."
"Cancer may 
spread from where it began to other parts of the body.","'When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not ''liver cancer''.' Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
"There are 
two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.","'Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems.

Recurrent intraocular (uveal) melanoma,'Recurrent intraocular melanoma is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The melanoma may come back in the eye or in other parts of the body.' 
There are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with intraocular melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in ''clinical trials''. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Five types of standard treatment are used:''Surgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used:'""Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Pictures are taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor and how fast it is growing.""'Watchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision.''Radiation'' therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy ''x-rays'' or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma.''Photocoagulation is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation.''Thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.'  Resection: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it. Enucleation: Surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye. Exenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy. A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called protons or helium ions, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy.Gamma Knife therapy is a type of stereotactic radiosurgery used for some melanomas. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused gamma rays directly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation. Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy.

Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:Localized plaque radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. The side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.

Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.' "
"Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their 
cancer treatment.",'Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' 
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.' "
Treatment options for intraocular (uveal) melanoma,"'Treatment of iris melanoma may include the following:''Treatment of tumors in the ciliary body and choroid may include the following:''Treatment of small choroid melanoma may include the following:''Treatment of medium choroid melanoma may include the following:''Treatment of large choroid melanoma may include the following:' Watchful waiting.

What is uveitis?,"'Uveitis'' is inflammation of the uvea of the eye. Three parts make up the uvea. The first part is the ''iris'', which is the colored ring of tissue you can see in the mirror. The dark hole in the middle of the iris is the pupil. The second and third parts, which you cannot see directly when looking in a mirror, are the ciliary body and the choroid. They are located behind the iris. An ophthalmologist can visualize them using special examination equipment. Because all three parts of the uvea are connected, physician often refer to them as the uveal tract.''Because there are three parts to the uveal tract, ''uveitis'' can be divided into different types, depending which parts are involved. Inflammation of the iris is ''iritis'', or anterior uveitis. Inflammation of the ciliary body is intermediate uveitis or cyclitis. Inflammation of the choroid is choroiditis or posterior uveitis (or chorioretinitis if the retina is also involved). Anterior uveitis is the most common form. Inflammation of all three is called panuveitis.' "
What causes uveitis?,"'There are many causes of uveitis, including autoimmune disorders (such as ''sarcoidosis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', '""Behcet's disease""', Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, ''psoriatic arthritis'', and ''ankylosing spondylitis''), infections (such as ''syphilis'' and ''toxoplasmosis''), and ''trauma''. Additionally, some are idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown.'  "
What are uveitis symptoms?,"'Symptoms of uveitis include some or all of the following:'   Aching, painful eye(s) Red, bloodshot eye(s) Sensitivity to light (eye pain when looking at light, called photophobia) Blurred, cloudy vision Floaters (spots seen in the visual field)"
What are the signs of uveitis?,"'The eyes are often red and typically a deeper red than that seen in ''pinkeye'' (''conjunctivitis''). The redness is usually present in anterior uveitis.''Aside from the redness of the eye(s), only an ophthalmologist or optometrist can see the other visible microscopic signs of uveitis using a slit lamp microscope. He or she can visualize inflammatory white blood cells in and around the uvea.' "
What other medical conditions are associated with uveitis?,"'Several diseases can be associated with uveitis: HLA-B27 arthropathies, ''sarcoidosis'', ''lupus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''ulcerative colitis'', and ''multiple sclerosis'', to name a few. Several infections in the body can also be associated: ''tuberculosis'', ''Lyme disease'', ''syphilis'', ''herpes zoster'' (''shingles''), and others. Eye diseases that can cause iritis include Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis and UGH (uveitis-''glaucoma''-hyphema) syndrome.'  "
What are the different types of uveitis?,"'The classification of the different types of uveitis depend on which parts of the uvea are affected: iritis or anterior uveitis (iris), cyclitis or intermediate uveitis (ciliary body), choroiditis or posterior uveitis (choroid), or panuveitis (all three parts of the uvea).'""Different types are then further classified by cause: autoimmune diseases (when one's immune system is misdirected against one's own uveal tract tissue), infectious (when caused by a bacteria, virus, fungus, or parasite), traumatic (after trauma to either eye), or idiopathic (no identifiable cause)."" "
What specialties treat uveitis?,"'If your eye doctor suspects an associated medical disease, he or she (ophthalmologist) may ask you to see other doctors, as well. A primary care doctor or pediatrician will likely be involved in the work-up, and additional specialists such as a ''rheumatologist'' or infectious disease doctor may consult.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose uveitis?,"'An ophthalmologist will ask several questions about the symptoms, both in the eyes and the rest of the body. For example, the presence of ''painful joints'', weight changes, skin ''rashes'', ''fatigue'', and other symptoms may help the doctor diagnose an underlying illness that may be associated with uveitis. The doctor will also need a detailed history of any eye health issues and medical conditions, as well as a family history of medical disorders.'""An ophthalmologist or optometrist will measure a patient's vision and eye pressures and carefully examine the eyes with the slit lamp. The dilated red blood vessels on the eyes' surface can have a characteristic appearance called a ciliary ""'flush'' of deep red that is typical of uveitis (as opposed to the lighter reddish eyes of ''conjunctivitis''). Though there are several types of uveitis, they all have one thing in common; white blood cells (immune cells of inflammation found in the bloodstream) leak from inside the blood vessels of the uvea to outside the blood vessels. These white cells permeate the uveal tissue and leak out of the uvea into the aqueous (liquid in the front part of the eye) and/or the vitreous (clear jelly-like material in the back part of the eye). This presence of white blood cells is what an ophthalmologist looks for when making the diagnosis of uveitis. Iritis (anterior uveitis) can appear initially as subclinical with no white blood cells visible. Other times, uveitis is not so subtle, with large numbers of cells visible in the aqueous and/or vitreous. In some cases, clusters of white blood cells accumulate on the back side of the ''cornea'' (the clear dome-shaped front cover of the eye). These clusters of cells are mutton fat deposits. In extreme cases, the cells can also form a large pool in the space between the iris and the cornea. This is a hypopyon.'""Cyclitis (intermediate uveitis affecting the ciliary body, or middle layer of the uveal tract) appears as white blood cells floating in the vitreous and collections of cells on the surface of uveal tissues behind the iris. Choroiditis appears as cells in the vitreous and uveal tissue but further posterior (toward the back of the eye). An ophthalmologist will need to dilate the patient's eyes and use special examination techniques to visualize this. Pictures of the back part of the eye using OCT, fluorescein ""'angiography'', or other technologies can also be helpful in assessing the extent of a posterior uveitis.''Additional tests might include laboratory evaluation of a small sample of aqueous or vitreous liquid from the eye, blood tests, and/or ''X-rays''. These tests take time. Therefore, a medical professional usually initiates a treatment plan based on a clinical judgment before the cause can be definitively identified.' "
What is the treatment for uveitis?,"'In noninfectious uveitis, treatment centers on control of the eye inflammation with anti-inflammatory medications. Often this can be achieved with steroids given as eyedrops, injection in or around the eye, orally (by mouth), or intravenously, depending on the extent and severity of the inflammation.''The duration of the treatment may be as short as a week or several months or even years, depending on the cause. Usually, once the uveitis resolves, patients slowly taper the use of steroid eyedrops to prevent a rebound of inflammation. Steroid drops can also have side effects that your eye doctor must monitor closely.''In chronic, relapsing or advanced non-infectious uveitis, medical professionals may prescribe steroid alternatives. In certain cases, health care providers may use immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) ''drugs'' such as ''methotrexate'', ''azathioprine'', and mycophenolate. Sometimes medical professionals prescribe biologic response modifier (BRM) drugs, including anti-TNF ''infliximab'', ''adalimumab'', and others. Close monitoring by a specialist (such as an internist or rheumatologist) is important to detect side effects of these medications If the cause is infectious, an anti-infective medication will also be used (for example antibiotic, antiviral, antiparasitic, or antifungal) to combat the underlying infectious agent.''Eye care'' professionals may prescribe dilation eyedrops (called cycloplegics) in conjunction to uveitis treatment to help relieve some of the ache. They may also help prevent and/or treat scarring (synechial adhesions) of the iris.' "
Are there home remedies for uveitis?,"'There are no known home remedies for uveitis. While waiting for the prescribed medications to take effect, wearing dark ''sunglasses'' can help with the light sensitivity. Some types of uveitis are more severe among ''smokers'', so stopping (or at least cutting back as much as possible) is advisable.' "
What is the prognosis for uveitis?,"'The prognosis varies tremendously; some types are mild and occur only once, never to recur. Others recur repeatedly over the years, coming and going at seemingly random and unpredictable intervals. Still other types never completely subside and linger for years, requiring chronic treatment to prevent flare-ups.' "
What are the complications of uveitis?,"'Uveitis has many potentially serious complications that can lead to permanent, irreversible ''vision loss''. For this reason, it is imperative that medical professionals treat uveitis promptly and to the best extent possible.''If the inflammation continues unchecked, complications may include sudden or chronic rises in eye pressure that can lead to permanent damage of the optic nerves, resulting in irreversible vision loss (''glaucoma''). The inflammation can also damage delicate cells on the cornea and retina, causing fluid buildup that blurs and damages the vision, sometimes irreversibly. Inflammation of the choroid can lead to fluid leaking under the retina, causing a serous ''retinal detachment''.''Your doctor will check for the presence of synechiae, which are ''scar tissue'' (adhesions) that form between the inflamed iris and other parts of the eye (the front surface of the ''lens'' and/or the peripheral cornea). Synechiae can lead to glaucoma if they interfere with the normal flow of ''intraocular'' fluid.'""For these reasons, health care providers should treat uveitis as aggressively as possible. The medications used to treat uveitis have side effects of their own, some of them serious. The ophthalmologist, often together with the patient's other doctor(s), balances the risks and benefits of the drug(s) against the potential damage that can result from undertreated uveitis.""  "
Is it possible to prevent uveitis?,"'It is not always possible to prevent uveitis, particularly since many cases do not have a known cause. However, one can reduce the chances of acquiring traumatic or infectious uveitis with common-sense precautions against risk factors. Examples include the use of eye protection when engaging in activities such as lawn edging and drilling, using extra caution around opening champagne bottles or firecrackers, keeping ''vaccinations'' up to date, practicing good hygiene and hand washing, guarding against ''sexually transmitted diseases'', and getting regular general health checkups with a primary care doctor.'""Autoimmune diseases (in which the immune system attacks one's own body tissues) are often run in families (genetic), and perhaps gene therapies in the future will be available. ""'Prevention'' of flare-ups of uveitis requires close monitoring with repeat examinations by an ophthalmologist. Health care professionals must often adjust or modify the treatment according to both microscopic and clinical changes for optimal control.' "
